On the 5th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening (as near as I can guess.) I saw the prisoner Jones, and another with him, near the house; when I first saw them I was at the corner of the house: I cannot say who the other was - he was very much like Sullivan, but I cannot be certain of him; I saw them standing at Julian's shop window, with a knife or something, trying to get the putty away from the glass; when they saw me they went away: they returned in five or ten minutes - I was then in my little shop, at the corner of the house; I heard them break the glass: I looked as close as I could to the window, and saw Jones take the snuff-boxes out of the window, and tuck them into his bosom, with his left-hand; the other one was standing by his side: Jones put down a piece of glass, which they had broken, and then they ran away; I followed Jones, and never lost sight of him - he ran into Baker's-row; I followed, and saw him in Baker's-row - the other ran straight up Great Warner-street - (the house is at the corner of Little Warner-street;) Sullivan joined Jones in Baker's-row, and another one.</p>
               <p>Q. If Sullivan was the same person, how did he get from Great Warner-street to Baker's-row? A. There was time for him to come round; I followed all three into Coppice-row, till I saw Bowden, the constable; I told him to come with me, for they had broken a window and taken the boxes out; we followed, and took the prisoners - the other had gone away; we did not see which way he went. I told them what we took them for - Jones denied it, and said the boxes were his own; Bowden found them all upon him; he took nine from his bosom when we took him: Sullivan said he had got nothing about him, and knew nothing about it; I had not lost sight of Jones from the time he took the boxes till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JONES. Q. Could you keep sight of me all the way? A. Yes, I did; it was about half-past six o'clock - it was dark; there were lights in the street, and a lamp lighted in the shop - I could see his features.</p>

On the 5th of February I met the witness in Coppice-row, and took the prisoners in Crawford-passage; the prisoner Jones was just before the witness when I first met him; I never lost sight of him - we secured them; I found nine snuff-boxes in the prisoner Jones' bosom, and seven in his pocket; he said he had got nothing till I found them on him; I did not find the seven in his pocket till I got to the office; he said nothing after I found them- I have them here, and produce them: I found nothing on Sullivan: it was about half-past six o'clock.

I knew him before, but was not particularly acquainted with him; I knew him six months ago. I walked about half a mile with him on this night - it was neither light nor dark; there was no moon: when I said I had no money he gave me a blow on the temple, with his fist; I fell from the blow, and he rifled my pockets; another person, who I could not identify, was with him; he came from the hedge, or the ditch, after I was struck - I had not seen him before that; I hallooed Murder! several times, and told him to save my life - they told me to hush; they both filled my month with gravel and dirt; they ran away and left me, after the prisoner had rifled my pocket of my purse - I cannot tell whether he searched more than one pocket, for I was struggling at the time. I only had a halfpenny left; it was a silk purse, and contained a crown-piece, two half-crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence; I had not looked at my purse after I left Osnaburgh-street, which is half a mile off; they both kicked me about the ribs, five or six times, after they got my purse, and then left me; I was perfectly sober. I knew the prisoner before, and have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it by his clothes that you know him? A. No, by his speech. I told the watchman and turnpike-man what his clothes were, and told the officer I knew him by his clothes as well as his dress. I had drank part of four glasses of gin and water with three people, at a house in Osnaburgh-street - Mr. Elliott's foreman was one of them; I do not know the others, or the sign of the house; I was never there before - I went there to engage with the foreman to work; I had nothing else that day except half a pint of porter at Holloway. I went to the house in Osnaburgh-street about half-past six o'clock, and left at half-past eight; I paid the reckoning, which was 2s.; I treated the foreman and the other men; I was attacked two or three hundred yards from the toll-bar; the bell of the toll-bar rang while I was being robbed; I was quite close under the bell at the time when I gave the alarm; it rang for six or seven minutes; I could see the prisoner's face as he walked by the lamps, when he first joined me - the lamps are below the toll-bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure you saw his person? A. Yes; I had light for more than three hundred yards, and he has worked with me, on the same premises in Duvall's-lane, but we were not acquainted - I knew his voice; he had a snuff-coloured coat, a light waistcoat, and dark trousers. I came to the turnpike, and gave an alarm directly; I then went to the watch-house, and when I returned to the place I saw two officers, as I was looking for my hat, which I had lost in the scuffle - I mentioned it to them. The prisoner was taken about two o'clock in the morning.</p>

On the 8th of February, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night, the prosecutor came to the watch-house - his right side was all over mud, and a little sprinkle of blood just under his eye; he appeared to have been ill-used, and seemed agitated. I did not perceive that he was in liquor. I sent two watchmen with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the watch-house near the tollgate? A. No, it may be a quarter of a mile from it; I heard no bell ring; I was in doors.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 8th of February, about five minutes past eleven o'clock. I was in the Junction-road, and heard of this robbery - I saw the prosecutor at Kentish-town; about five minutes past eleven - he appeared to have been much ill-used; he had no hat on - he said he had been knocked down and robbed, about 200 or 250 yards off the toll-gate, and said what he had been robbed of: in consequence of the description he gave me, I went, with Prendergrass, by his direction to a public-house in Duvall's-lane, to be informed who the party were; Prendergrass got information there - and about half-past one o'clock we took the prisoner, out of bed, up stairs in Pullen's-gardens; he was undressed - this is about three quarters of a mile from where the robbery was committed, if you go across the fields; Prendergrass took him down stairs to Hitchiner, who identified him as the man who had robbed him; Prendergrass brought him up stairs again, and asked where he was at ten o'clock - he said he had been at home, playing at cards with his wife, and he was going to bed at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Was the prosecutor asked "Is this the man who robbed you?" A. Yes, he had not spoken in the prosecutor's presence then; he was dressed - I heard Hitchiner say he was the man; I was on the stairs - if the prisoner had spoken loud, I should have heard him; I was about twelve yards from them: it is about three quarters of a mile across the fields to the Junction-road, where the robbery was committed; it may be a mile and a quarter the road way - there are paths across the field.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the prisoner had not spoken - had the prosecutor given any reason for knowing him? A. Only his dress; he told me before he saw him, that he had a snuff-coloured coat, with bright buttons; a light waistcoat and dark trousers; and that he had worked with him at Mr. Phillip's; I found the snuff-coloured coat in the room, he also described the other man - one was taken who corresponded in dress, but he could not swear to him.</p>

I saw the prosecutor about twenty minutes past eleven, in the Junction-road, about one hundred yards from the toll-bar, in company with Wallis - he was very dirty, and a little blood issuing from his cheek; I thought at first that he had been drinking in the early part of the evening - but he was perfectly collected.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you think he had been drinking? A. By his appearance, but whether it was the effect of the blow or his flurry, I cannot say; I asked if he had been drinking in the early part of the evening - he said, "No, but I have been ill-used, and am much agitated;" he appeared so - he described two men to me, and said, if I went to the Henley Arms public-house, Duvall's-lane, and described them, the landlord could tell me the man's name, and where he could be found; he told me he had a dark coat, but did not mention the colour, or what buttons; I went with him to the Henley Arms - he gave the landlord a description, and I learnt the prisoner's name; I went to Pullen's-gar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210005"/>dens, Holloway, and found the prisoner on the first floor - I first asked where he was at ten o'clock that night; he said in bed - I asked if he had been out early in the evening, he said Yes, for a few errands; I then told him to dress - I brought him down stairs to the prosecutor, who was waiting outside; the light was then nearly the same as it was at ten o'clock - the prosecutor was walking away; I called him back, and said, "do you know this man;" he said,"That is the man who knocked me down, and robbed me"- I then gave him into the custody of Wallis, while I went after another man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You thought he had been drinking in the early part of the evening? A. I thought so, he said he had only had part of four glasses of gin and water; he said he knew the man, by seeing him from time to time in Duvall's-lane, but did not say anything about the man's dress or speech; he did not tell me he had worked with him, but that while he worked in Duvall's-lane, he knew where he worked; I think the prisoner said he had been out for coals and bread.</p>

I am married and live opposite the prisoner; my door fronts his room window; I saw him pass my door about nine o'clock on the evening in question, with coals - he went up to his room; he cannot pass my door without my seeing him - I did not see him come out again; but about twenty minutes or a quarter to ten o'clock, I saw him speaking to James Dye, a neighbour, as I passed his door from the mangler's - I bid him good night, as he stood at his door without his hat - he bid me good night and said he was going to bed; he shut the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any particular reason for noticing the hour? A. Yes: I have a clock in my house - I was folding and starching my linen, and was not in bed till after twelve o'clock; my lodger was out at work - I was waiting for her to come home, and about ten minutes to ten, I fastened my door - I took particular notice of the clock when I went to the mangler's for my things - that was between a quarter of an hour and twenty minutes to ten o'clock - I immediately went out to the mangler's.</p>

C., 3, the other E. C.; 2 boy's shirts, marked J. C. 3 and 4, and 2 black frocks, not marked; I then searched Wicks, and in his waistcoat pocket found 10 silver spoons not marked, 6 are plain fiddle-heads and 4 double threaded - I have had the property ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Wicks give an account of the spoons? A. He said a man gave him half a crown to carry them, but did not say where to.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Doggett - we live in Huntsworth-mews, Dorset-square; we have one room there over a stable, and pay 2s. 6d, a week for it- Mr. Peters is the landlord - his gig is kept there, but no horse: the stable and all belong to us - we keep the key of it, and go through it to get to our own room: Peters has a key of the stable also, and kept a cart there - my husband does not take care of them; Peters lives in Upper Park-place - we do not use the stable. On the 29th of January, at ten minutes to two o'clock, I left home, and left nobody there - I locked the room door and put the key into my pocket, then came down stairs into the stable, locked the stable door, and put that key into my pocket; there is a door at the foot of the stairs that has no lock: in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Richard Peters fetched me from Mrs. Simmond's - I went home, and found the stable door lock wrenched clean off, and hanging to the door; I found my room door broken open - I missed two silver watches, and a silver spoon out of a little mug on the mantelpiece; I had seen them safe when I went out - I have not found any of my things; the prisoner lodged with us when we lived at No. 1, in the mews; I had seen him on the Thursday before, going up the mews - I opened my window, and said, "Jonas, have you any work?" he said No; I said, I had a new clock, and asked him up to see it - he came up; the watches were on the mantel-piece then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner is a carpenter? A. Yes, I know nothing about his character, he behaved well while with us.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. On the 29th of January, at six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner going up Huntsworth-mews - he was about thirty yards from the stable door, and had passed the door; I overtook him, and said, "Jonas, have you any work?" he said, only a job or two on his own account; he asked if my brother's wife was at Peters, at work, (she often works there) - I said, I thought she was working at No. 7, Edward-street, which is just at the back of the stable; he asked again, if she was not at Peters' - I said, she was not; he said, I am pretty sure she is, for I think I saw her about dinner time - I said, she was at Edward-street when I went home to dinner - I wished him good night, and left him in Park-place, at the corner of Edward-street - I went home to No. 7, Edward-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not his master's workshop in the mews? A. Yes, Mr. King is master of the shop where he had a little job; he said he had been working there six or eight weeks - I understand he was then doing a little job in King's shop; he had a basket which lapped over the handles, not a carpenter's basket exactly.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Huntsworth-mews, Dorset-square - my husband is a coachman. On the 29th of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise as if somebody were trying my door to make me hear, as I have no knocker; my dog barked - I got up, looked out, and saw the prisoner coming from Doggett's stable; he looked up at my window, saw me, and immediately put his basket down, and stopped under my window as if for a necessary purpose; my room is over the stable - I shut my window and saw no more; there was a little boy passing on the opposite side of the way - the prisoner was between my door and Doggett's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know King's workshop in the mews? A. Yes; he was more than thirty yards from there: there are three or four stables and coach-houses between us and the workshop - when I saw him he was coming towards King's workshop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is King's workshop on the other side of Doggett's? A. My house is between Doggett's and the workshop.</p>

            . I live at No. 24, Lisson-street, Mary-le-bone, and am a bricklayer. I have known the prisoner about two years - I saw him on the 29th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, at Mrs. Collins', the Portman Arms, Dorset-square - I was at breakfast there; he came in, and took up the paper - I sat opposite him: he called me over, and said, "Will you go with me to break open Doggett's house to-night?" I said No, I would not, and went and sat down in my place; he called me again, and asked if I should be there by six o'clock - I said perhaps I might, as I used the house; I said I was generally there: he pulled a screw-driver out of his side pocket, and said, "I have got the tools that will do it;" I took the screw-driver in my hand, and looked at it - I gave it him again, and he put it into his pocket - that is all that passed. I noticed the screw-driver - it was rusty nearly all the way up - I should know it again; he did not ask me to rob Mr. Morse - it was Doggett's name that he mentioned; Mrs. Doggett was once Mrs. Morse. I went there again about three o'clock in the afternoon, and about six, as I was having some beer with my brother Charles, he came in, and passed Pain at the bar; he came to the tap-room door, and beckoned me out - I shook my head, and would not go out; I remained there till about five minutes to eight o'clock - I did not expect to see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you to give notice to Mr. Doggett, or to any Magistrate? A. I was in danger of my life, for he has a great character as a fighting-man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Give us a better description of the screw-driver? A. It was not very rusty - I noticed nothing more particular in it; I had it about two minutes in my hand: there was nobody else in the tap-room. I am generally at the Portman Arms when I am out of work; my brother lives near there, and gives me a little; the potboy was in and out of the room in the morning, when he asked me to go and break the house open. I was once taken up on suspicion of something; I was never in custody but once, except for making a noise in the streets; I was never charged with stealing a great coat: I was taken up about four sovereigns by a young man; I have heard my mother has paid him so much a week to make it up - she never told me so herself. I have been out of work about eighteen months - I have worked for Mr. Phillips, a builder in Regent's-park, about three weeks; that was just before the hard frost set in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first think of telling this story? A. On the Saturday after the Tuesday it was committed - I told the Magistrate of it because I wished to tell the truth - I told Mrs. Doggett of it the morning after the prisoner was taken, on the Wednesday, about one o'clock; I did not hear of the robbery till about twelve - Gibbs was in the public-house, and asked if he did not see me in Tottenham-court-road last night, going to a dog fight - I said No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about the prisoner before you were charged with it? A. No. Mrs. Doggett is sometimes called Morse, but I mentioned the name of Doggett to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you see Gibbs? A. He came to the Portman Arms next morning; he did not take me into custody; he said, "I want you to come down to the office - your mother and Mrs. Doggett are there;" I went with him - I did not know the robbery was done till then; he said Mrs. Doggett suspected me; my brother William works at St. Katharine's Docks - I have not seen him for six weeks - my brother Charles also works there; I saw my brother William about a week before the robbery, but not since.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long has your brother William been working at the Docks? A. I do not know - Charles was paving some stables at the back of the mews at the time the robbery was committed.</p>

            . I am Thomas Peirce's brother, and live at No. 9, Huntsworth-mews - I have lived there two years and nine months. I have worked at St. Katharine's Docks about nine days: my brother William went to work there a week or ten days before me - we both work there now - we came home together last night - he lives in Sovereign-street, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you, William, and Thomas together last? A. I do not know - it is a good while ago; we do not take heed of him. I have known the prisoner about two years and a half - on the evening after his first examination I went up to see if it was true that he was in custody, and as he was coming out to the van, I said, "Jonas, I am afraid you are betrayed" - he said, "Betrayed! what do you mean? I do not think I am, without your brother William has come against me;" I said, "Mrs. Morse has offered my brother Thomas a sum of money to speak the truth;" he then got into the van, and I saw him no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much had Mrs. Morse offered? A. I do not know; I heard she had offered money - she told me so herself, in her own room; I do not know how much it was: I was at work just at the back of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210008"/>stables; my brother Thomas used to come to me to relieve him - whenever I had a pint of beer he was welcome to part of it, let his character he what it would; I give him a drop of beer if he wants it, but I do not keep his company; it is not my place to expose him - he has certainly been bad, but he has suffered the law for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at the Portman Arms on the 29th of January? A. I was there in the evening, and sat with my back to the door, and my brother sat facing the door: I did not see Jonas come in myself; my brother Thomas was at work in the Regent's-park last summer, for six or seven weeks - it was about the beginning of the summer; he was not at work in the winter.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard of this robbery about half-past nine o'clock at night; I went next morning, before day-light, to the prisoner's house in Princes-street, Lisson-grove, with Doggett - when the shop was open I went up to the second floor room, and knocked at the door; he was in bed, and asked who was there - I said my name was Gibbs; he dressed, and let me in; I said he was suspected of robbing Mrs. Doggett last night; he said, "I am innocent, Mr. Gibbs - I will go with you any where - you are welcome to search the place;" I did so, but found nothing; I asked if he had any tools - he said, "I have a few down in the wash-house, where I keep my work bench;" he took me down, and in a small basket there was a large screw-driver - he said, "That is all the tools I have." I took him to the office, then examined the stable door, and found a very small space had been worked out with a similar tool to this, but I do not mean to say the mark tallied; the lock had been forced off, but was then mended; any screw-driver might have done it; the prisoner told me, going along, that he could account for where he had been that evening. I afterwards received private information that Thomas Peirce knew something of the robbery, and took him at the Portman Arms; he walked down with me, and his mother - he was not in custody; I took him into custody on the day of the second examination; he has been in custody ever since, to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first went to him, did you charge him with the robbery? A. No; I said I wanted him to go down to his mother; I did not tell him he was suspected till Saturday. The lock of the room was inside - it could not be forced off; the bolt was wrenched back.</p>

I have known the prisoner two years - he worked for me the summer before last, and this winter, for about ten weeks; he often worked at my shop; I owed him 10d.: on the 29th of January, he came to my house about ten minutes or a quarter past six o'clock, and stopped and talked at my door for a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the 28th of January, at nine o'clock, and heard Kelly sing out for a watchman; I went up, and he complained to me- I saw nobody run from him; I saw a good many people running after a person - I followed, but did not get up to them. In consequence of information I took the prisoner into custody; the prosecutor had not described him to me, but the publican had - I met him going into the Cock public-house, George-street, in about half an hour, and took him: I heard him tell the prosecutor at the first examination, that he and his mother would make it up to him, if he did not prosecute him; I did not hear him say any thing about returning the property. I have known him nearly two years - the prosecutor had made no offer to him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KELLY re-examined. Q. When I was at the office I said nothing to induce him to offer to settle it; his mother, who stood by me, said if I would not prosecute, they would get me my bundle, and pay me for my time; the prisoner heard that.</p>

               <p>MARIA CLARK. I live at Mr. Beningfield's - the street door is generally open in the day time. On the 5th of February, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I left my things safe on the third floor, and about one o'clock I found the prisoner, who was a stranger, in the two pair of stairs back room; I asked how she came there - she said she had got leave from a young lady, who was down at the door talking to a gentleman - she had nothing in her hands - I found the articles stated in the indictment in a handkerchief, which did not belong to the house; they were in the wardrobe by her - she denied ever having touched them; I am the only person who had care of the house; the cap belongs to Mrs. Beningfield; she had moved that out of the front bed-room; she still denied having touched them; I brought her down to the kitchen, and Mr. Beningfield sent for an officer, who took her.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and live at Chesnut-wood, near Warwick - I am a farmer. My brother had been with me about fourteen months, and left me about three weeks last Saturday, of his own accord; he did not say what he was going to do, or where he was going; when he came home to me he was insane, and I took care of him till the 23d of December, 1826, when I went out, and when I came back I was informed he had half murdered the man I had left in care of him; he has never been right in his head since.</p>

On the 1st of February I was in Newgate-street, going to the Four Swans, in Bishopsgate-street; I had taken more wine than agreed with me - I was not particularly drunk; I was intoxicated I know - I had been drinking at an Inn in the Haymarket, where I had dined; I do not know what time I came away. I came on to Fleet-market, and got in company with a female, close by the market; she asked me to treat her with a glass of wine; I went into the wine-vaults, and gave her a glass - finding I had no change I took out my pocketbook; I then had seven 5l. notes, of Mills', of Hadley Bank, safe; I had taken the numbers down on the Tuesday before - they were Nos. 70, 636, 327, 816, 1351, 1443, and 4128; the landlord said he would not trouble me to change, but told me to take care and put my pocketbook into my pocket; I did so, and went on to Newgate-street; a person stopped me in Newgate-street, and pulled me about - my pocket-book and its contents were taken - I missed it before I got out of Newgate-street - this was on a Friday. About half-past nine o'clock next morning, the 1st of February, I saw one of the notes - I lost it on Thursday night, the 31st of January, after twelve o'clock, I mean - I saw it at the coach-office of the Four Swans; I had stated when I got to the inn that I had been robbed, and in the morning I went to Messrs. Hankey's, where they were payable, and stopped the payment of them, just as they began business; at half-past nine o'clock that morning I found the prisoner in custody in the coach-office, with the note No. 327; he said he had taken it of a person for a watch that morning - I did not hear him say where. The Hadley coach puts up at the Four Swans. I have not found any other note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever go by the name of Hevens? A. No. I recollect perfectly well having my pocket-book and notes that night; I had dined at the John O'Groat, in the Haymarket; I went there about six o'clock; I did not particularly notice at what time I came away: I went straight down the Strand to Fleet-market, and stopped no where; the landlord was in my company part of the time at the John O'Groat - I have known him some years; I paid my bill, but cannot recollect how much it was; I drank nothing but Port - I think there were about three pints among three of us: there was some brandy and water at dinner - I drank very little of that; there was 1s. worth between me and a man who went in with me; I had fallen over some lemon-peel as I went in, and gave him a glass for assisting me; I had no other spirits - this was before dinner; I did not speak to anybody, to the best of my knowledge, till I got to Fleet-market, where a woman spoke to me; I do not recollect going to any house with any female; I will not swear positively whether I did or not; I swear I did not give the notes to anybody. I had been about two days in London; I am not in the habit of walking out at night. I was not so drunk as not to know what I was about; I did not take my pocket-book out to pay for my dinner, as I had a sovereign and some silver in my purse. I know it was about twelve o'clock when I was in Newgate-street, as I heard the watchman call the hour; I will swear I did not drop my pocket-book, for I buttoned it in my pocket; the landlord saw the notes in it.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate; Mr. Iron had slept there for two or three nights before he was robbed; I lodge there, and when I came down at seven o'clock in the morning I heard from the servant that he had lost some country notes; I knew he had come by our Ipswich coach, and Hadley notes are commonly circulated there; our house is about four minutes' walk from Messrs. Hankey's. I went to breakfast at eight o'clock, returned to the office as the clock struck nine, and had not been there many minutes before the prisoner came in and presented me this 5l. Hadley Bank note - he was quite a stranger to me; he asked me to give him cash for it, saying he would allow me a shilling in the pound if I would do so; I said No, I knew nothing about the Hadley Bank; seeing it was payable in London was the reason I would not give change for it: he pressed me to change it - I told him he might go to the banker's, it was near enough - he said he would rather allow me the poundage, which he was in the habit of doing on country notes, at coach-offices, and he wished me to have it to get something by it - that he did not want to trouble himself to go the banker's. I thought of Mr. Iron's robbery, and said if he would wait a few minutes that I might make inquiry, I would; I went out at the back door, called Boots, and sent him to Hankey's, to change the note; when I returned to the office the prisoner asked if I had sent to the banker's - I said No, I had sent to a private friend in Bishopsgate-street, who had come from Hadley; he then said, "I will step up to the fishmonger's a little above here, and return in five minutes;" Boots and the prisoner came into the office together - Boots turned round against the counter, as a signal, and I detained the prisoner, told him the note was stolen, and that a gentle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210012"/>man at our house had lost some - he then told the porter and me that we might as well let him go; he did not ask for his note to be returned; I refused, telling him I must clear myself, and give an account how I came by it; I sent for an officer, who took him; Boots left the note at Hankey's - I had not noticed the number, nor mark it; I only know it was a 5l. Hadley note. I saw it again at the Mansion-house, in the possession of Messrs. Hankey's clerk- the prosecutor saw it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You put no mark on it? A. No, nor did Boots, in my presence; I saw it at the Mansion-house about twelve o'clock that day. No Hadley coach comes to our house; the Colchester coach puts up there - it is about four miles from there. I had not seen Irons that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the same note as you saw afterwards? A. I noticed the back of it before I gave it to Boots - there was some small writing on it: I have no hesitation in swearing to it; I noticed a small letter M, for Mr.; I noticed it in order to know it again - I do not know what words were on it; I was busy, and did not notice it so particularly as I might have done; a mark on it would do as well for me to recollect it by as the writing would: I am satisfied it is the same note; I recollect the small writing on the back of it.</p>

            . I am Boots at the Four Swans. On the 1st of February, a little after nine o'clock in the morning, Shorter gave me a 5l. Hadley note, in the prisoner's presence, but he whispered to me to take it to Hankey's - I took the same note to Messrs. Hankey's directly - I left it with one of the clerks; I returned to the Four Swans, and before I got there I saw the prisoner withing a short distance of the inn - he asked me in the street if all was right - I told him Yes, all was right, and if he would come to the office I would give him his change; he then came into the office: I told him I had an order from the banker's to detain him, as the note was a stolen one, and I must detain him till he could give some account of it - he gave no account then: I left him in the custody of the book-keeper while I sent for an officer - I told him I was going for an officer - he said nothing to that; I did not return to the office till he was in custody; he gave no account in my hearing. I saw the note produced at the Mansion-house by the officer, I think - not by the clerk to whom I gave it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was in the officer's possession at the Mansion-house? A. Yes; I did not see the clerk there - I do not think I should know him again if I saw him. I made no mark on the note. I never saw the prisoner before. I saw Mr. Irons the night before, between twelve and one o'clock, nearer to twelve, when he came home; he was rather in liquor, but had his wits about him.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City. I was fetched to the Four Swans, to take the prisoner in charge; they told me, in his hearing, that a gentleman who lodged there had been robbed of some 5l. country notes; Shorter said the prisoner had presented one to him - that he had sent Boots to the banker's, and it turned out to be one the gentleman had been robbed of, according to the number. I told the prisoner I must take him before the Lord Mayor, and he must explain - I did so; Messrs. Hankey's clerk appeared there, and produced the note; it was given to me when the prisoner was committed; by Mr. Brown, the marshal; I put a mark on it - it is the same note as I received from Mr. Brown, in the presence of the Lord Mayor, and of the prisoner; it is the one he was accused of having received: I produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the clerk here? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. IRON. This note is No. 327, and is one of the seven notes I had in my pocket-book; I received it from the Hadley Bank myself, the day before I came to town.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Did you know the members of her family? A. I cannot say that I did know them personally; I understood she had a son, named John: I had been informed by her, that he had taken sums of money at various times, which distressed her very much; I have given her money, which I understood she requested in consequence of the demands of her son - it was money I had to save for her; I understood he was in distress, and wanted money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You supplied her with money belonging to herself? A. Yes, money she had left in my hands; she requested it in consequence of his being in want; the only particular sum I recollect was two or three years ago: I never supplied her with money on any other occasion, except for the purposes of my house, and I gave her her wages; I understand her son has come to the house, but I never saw him. When she requested this money I represented to her the impropriety of parting with what might be of use to her in old age, without proper caution; it was only on one occasion that I spoke to her about it - it was in consequence of only one application, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in care of the house alone on this occasion? A. I left the house for good in September, 1825, and went to live in Surrey, and from that time to the 31st of December last, she was constantly in care of the house; it is a large house, and has a great many rooms: I was there the evening after this took place, in consequence of information being sent to me; I had left a great many articles in the house, in her care - I am not aware of any plate being there; I really cannot say what was left there. I understand there were some spoons - there was an inventory of the things.</p>

Robinson, upholdsters, of Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. - On the 1st of January I was directed by them to go to No. 11, Montague-place (I had been there before) - I went about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 1st of January; I rang the bell, but could not get admission; the shutters were shut: I then went through Mr. Sergeant Bosanquet's house, No. 12, and went to the back area with Alexander Bonnick (who is Mr. Robinson's porter), and Mr. Justice Holroyd's butler - I dropped down the back area of No. 11, and opened the back kitchen window, the shutters of which were put to, but not fastened; I got in, and then opened the front door to Mr. Justice Holroyd's butler(Hawkins) - he came in, and we all three proceeded up stairs; we examined every room in the house, but found nobody; the bed had not been used: there was only one bed prepared to sleep in - that had not been used; I turned it down myself - it was getting dark; a candlestick was produced, with a candle in it, on the drawing-room stairs - I sent Bonnick to get a light from the next house - we then proceeded down stairs, Bonnick going first with the light; we went into a little room in the front, which I understand is called the servant's hall - it looks into the front area, and has only one window; Bonnick saw the deceased laying on the floor - I took the candle out of his hand, and saw the body laying about four feet from the window; the head was nearest to the window, and further from the fire than the feet - she laid rather on her right side - her right arm was under her, and her other hand was clenched; her feet were planted straight on the floor, as if she had been standing on them, and her knees up; her throat was cut - she was dead; there was a great quantity of blood on the floor, in one particular part of the room; I do not think the body had been moved since the throat had been cut; the blood appeared to have flown from the wound; the blood was on the right side of the body, inclining to the fire-place: I observed a razor-case and a pair of scissors on the floor, near the body; the razor-case was on the right side, the same side as the blood, but it was not in the blood: I observed her left-hand pocket was outside her clothes - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210014"/>cannot say whether it was turned inside out; I did not examine to see if anything was in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The scissors were on the floor? A. Yes; the razor-case laid on the right side, near the fire, perhaps two feet from the body, from that to three feet - it did not lay in the blood; the greatest part of the blood was congealed at that time. I lifted up her left-hand to see if I could observe any sharp instrument about her; I believe it was the left-hand - it was the one that was uppermost - I moved nothing else in the room; I observed a little work-box on the table, with thread and cotton in it, and things - part of them were thrown on the floor; I did not observe any paper; I looked at the table, but did not particularly notice it; there were two or three chairs in the room - one stood on one side of the table, and another on the other, as near as I can tell, as if two people had been sitting in them. I left the things exactly as I found them; this was the last room we went into - we had been into every room up stairs, I believe - I think we went into eight or nine, with the drawing-rooms; there might be six bed-rooms - we did not observe anything out of order in the bed-rooms the first time, as we did not notice, but after going to Bow-street we went up with the officers, and then observed it - this might be an hour after; I had left Bonnick and a gentleman's servant, who was going by, in charge of the house; when I returned with the officers to search, I believe there was something disturbed in each room; the drawers in the front bed-room, which were unlocked, were open - no locks were forced, to my knowledge; I found at least ten or twelve drawers open, I think- there did not appear to be things taken out of them, but the things were rifled over.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any cupboards in this room forced open? A. There was a closet between the front and back room - there was a wardrobe in the front room - I do not think that was forced open; the things in it had been rifled about- the things in the drawers consisted principally of gloves, gaiters, and wearing-apparel; in the cupboard between the front and back bed room, there were two or three boxes, with ladies' feathers - the boxes had been opened in some, and part of the feathers taken out, and laid on the floor - I know there was one chest of drawers in the back bed-room - the things in that were not carried away, but they were disturbed; they appeared to have been looked over. I believe in all the bed-rooms there were drawers open, and things turned over; there was a chest of drawers in the room in which the bed was made; I do not think they had been locked - there were gloves and things in them; I was not very particular myself in looking the things over, for I went to Mr. Lett's, at Dulwich, and left the officers there. It must have taken a good while to go over the drawers in all the rooms; there were several drawers open down in the back kitchen; there was a large press in the back kitchen - that appeared to have been rifled over; that was the room we first entered: I did not observe any food on the table; the fire was out, and there were two ridges of wood to light it with; I did not observe whether it had burnt out, but I think it had been scratched out. I saw nothing of a silver or plated mustard-pot, nor a spoon.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Your attention was not particularly called to the state of the rooms when you first went up stairs? A. No; I was looking for the deceased, not at the state of the rooms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the scissors bloody or not? A. I did not observe; they were perhaps six or seven inches long from handle to point; I saw no scissor-case: I should think it would take half an hour to put the drawers in the state I found them. I think the deceased had been sitting at work at the table.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Robinson's employ. On the 1st of January I went with Dent to Mr. Lett's house - it was a little before four o'clock; Dent rang the bell: we went through the next house; Mr. Justice Holroyd's servant was on the leads, and a woman of the house No. 10; we got in at the back kitchen, went over the rooms up stairs, and came down; we at last all went into the room, and found the deceased laying on her right side, in the servant's hall; it was the body of Betty Jeffs - I knew her by working at the house; her legs were crooked a little - one hand was under her body; her left hand was rather bent. I found a razor-sheath close to the gore of blood, within fourteen or fifteen inches of the body; it was free from the blood where it lay - it was just away from the blood; the snuffers laid on the floor; an ale-house pewter pot laid just at her back, on its side, as if it had been thrown down - I cannot say whether any beer was in it: a pair of common scissors, about eight inches long, laid close to the body. I touched nothing; I believe Dent took up the razor-case, but laid it down in the same place again; the drawers in the different rooms were all open when we came to examine them - they were all drawn out; we waited till Salmon and Fergusson came before we examined them; Dent and Mr. Justice Holroyd's servant went for the officers; nothing was touched or moved from the time they left till the officers came, and took possession of the premises. There was a chair on each side of the table in the room the deceased laid in, as if two persons had been sitting together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you aware that you should be called as a witness to speak to the state of the house? A. No - I recollect every thing very well; the razor-case was free from blood, to the best of my knowledge - I think I saw Dent lift it up, and I said, "Let every thing lay as it is;" I am sure he put it down in the same place again. I think one person could not have done all that was done in the rooms under an hour, to pull out all the drawers, and look at the things; the drawers in the back kitchen were opened, and there was a silver mustard-pot, I think, standing on the dresser. It might have taken less than an hour to do all this - I cannot say: we were not ten minutes going over the house; we passed through from room to room; there was a work-box on the table, and things strewed about - I saw no paper there myself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Were the scissors bloody? A. I cannot say.</p>

            . I was sent to Mr. Robinson's, and to the Public-office, for assistance; I had been let into the house by Dent and Bonnick. On going into the room where the deceased lay I saw a razor-case laying between her right shoulder and the window, about two feet from the body - it was apart from the blood; it was the first thing I observed; this was before I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210015"/>the office; I think it could not have been moved by any one when I first saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the blood standing or flowing at all? A. It was in a thick clotted state, from the body to the fire-place; I saw the blood again afterwards - it covered the same space of ground. I did not see Dent lift the razor-case - I do not think anybody touched it till I went for Salmon; I heard Bonnick say, "Let every thing remain as it is;" he was very much alarmed on entering the room, and went back again; I should think he made that observation in less than five minutes after we entered the room; it was just before we left the room; I did not notice Dent lift the razor-case - he might do it without my observing it, but I do not think it was touched, till it was touched by Salmon; Dent informed me that he picked up the scissors, but I did not see him do so - I did not notice them at all on the floor - I saw some scissors on the table, but whether he had picked them up I cannot say; I observed nothing particular on them.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles', and live at the watch-house. On the 1st of January I was sent for to No. 11, Montague-place - I got there a little after six o'clock; I proceeded to examine the rooms in the house very particularly, with Gardener, Mr. Robinson, and Dent; I found Salmon and Gardener there - I went into the kitchen, and saw the dead body laying on its right side; I saw the lower part of a razor sheath on her right side - I lifted it up, and Salmon desired me to put it down- I placed it in the same situation as it was: Salmon did not take it up that night; he locked the door, and took the key himself, leaving the razor-case there, that the Coroner's Jury might see every thing just as it was; there was a quart pot near her head. I went through every room in the house - I saw some drawers open, and in a wash-hand-stand drawer on the first floor was several things disturbed; I found a glove in that drawer laying on the top of the other things, with a mark of fresh blood on it - the drawer was open; in a little drawer next to that, was part of a newspaper, which I produce - that is also stained with blood, which appeared fresh; I then went into the passage, to go to the back second floor room - there I saw some band-boxes disturbed, and some ladies' feathers out on the floor - that was in the passage, between the back and front rooms; I went to the second floor back room, and there saw a bundle; at that time I did not perceive any marks of blood on it, it being candle-light. After the rooms were all locked up, I left every thing exactly as when I first went into them, and I took possession of the keys till the Inquest, which was held on Thursday, the 3rd of January; a candle had been brought before I arrived. On the day of the Inquest I went up to the second floor front and back rooms, while the Jury were there; I produced the keys - the doors were opened in my presence, and I made some further observations, which I omitted to give in evidence; on searching the hand-boxes which had contained the feathers, there were several stains of blood, both on the feathers and on the papers which contained them; they were enclosed in separate papers, which are stained with blood, and some linen which was in the boxes had blood on it, which appeared fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by fresh? A. It appeared the same sort of blood as was on the glove; Mr. Robinson took possession of the keys after the Inquest. I went, in consequence of information, on Tuesday, the 8th of January, with Salmon and Gardener, to No. 35, Mitre-street, to look for a person named Jones; I did not find him there: in the course of our search there, we stated what we had come about; we went into the first floor back room, which was not then occupied; I saw Salmon take a shirt-collar off the bed, and in a table-drawer I found a razor, which I produce, exactly in the state in which I found it; there is one or two small notches made in it, and the edge appears to me turned; there is a stain or two on the blade, but of what it is impossible for me to say. I found a new umbrella in that room; there was no razor in the room besides the one produced - we searched every place; there was no sheath, nor part of a sheath there: we did not leave a single place unsearched. I continued some time searching after Jones, and found him on Sunday, the 13th of January, in the City Compter; he went there by the name of William Edwards; when he was brought out he came towards me - I asked what his name was; he said Edwards; I said, "Your name is Jones" - he said No, it was not, and then he said, "Yes it is," immediately after denying it. I laid hold of his left hand, looked at his left thumb, in consequence of something, and found he had got a cut on his left thumb, near the nail; I asked how long it had been done - he said five or six weeks; I looked at it again, and told him I thought it had not been done so long, for it appeared to me to be a fresh cut - I thought it had not been done so many weeks; I asked how he did it - he told me in cutting some wood with a knife: I then examined his clothes - he had a blue frock-coat on; he took off his coat, and said, "You see in what a situation I am in - I have not a shirt to my back;" I asked what he had done with his shirt - he said he had pawned it at Turner's, in Brydges-street, Strand, on the Thursday preceeding; I inquired, and found that was the case: his coat appeared to me to have been sponged, and that very recently; both the sleeves, inside and out, appeared to have been sponged between the hand and elbows, ten or twelve inches up from the wrist, and it appeared to have been sponged in the front, outside; he said the person he borrowed it of had sponged it - I think he said it was Mrs. Williams' son: he was left in possession of the coat till the examination on last Monday week - he had it on at every examination but that one; we left him at the Compter: I examined his trousers, but they were too dirty to notice anything - he had a waistcoat on, but it was candle light, and I could not observe anything. We fetched him to Bow-street on the Monday, and Salmon and I took him to the House of Correction on Monday, the 28th of January; he had undergone several examinations then; I examined the coloured waistcoat he had got on, and in the right-hand pocket I perceived a stain, but what it is I cannot say - I brought the waistcoat away with me, and have had it ever since - I produce it; the stain is outside the pocket. Here is the band-box of feathers; there is a stain on this piece of paper. (Seven of the papers of feathers, on being examined, were spotted with blood.)</p>

            . I am governor of the House of Correction. The prisoner was in my custody; when he left the prison at his last examination the coat was left with one of the prisoner's in the Infirmary, where he had been;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210016"/>I saw him every time he went up to the office, and have no doubt of it being his coat.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. This is the coat I saw the prisoner wear, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In the early part of the business, I believe, you suspected somebody else? A. I did - it was Knight; he was examined: it might be three or four days after that, that suspicion fell on the prisoner; I commenced search after him three or four days after the murder; the first lodging I searched was in MItre-street - I did not at that time examine the inside of the handle of the razor; here is a dot and sort of streak on the blade, and if you took inside the handle you will find something of the same - it is just at the commencement of the blade; the spot looked to me as if the razor had been wiped; it appears to me that the handle has been washed - there is a stain inside: the impression on my mind is, that the handle has been washed inside; I cannot say whether the blade has been washed: washing and rubbing it would get a stain out - if it was washed carefully with soap and water it might be got off, I suppose: you will find a corresponding stain inside the handle - there is a something, what it is I cannot say; I have not broken the handle open - I have examined it very particularly; it was compared at Bow-street with some other razors. The stains of blood on the papers of feathers appeared the same as that on the glove.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there anything by which you draw that conclusion, except from finding them in the same house? A. Nothing. I think suspicion fell on the prisoner the same evening as the Jury sat - it was on Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did your suspicions amount to a strong opinion? A. On the Tuesday; I beg pardon, we were in search of him previous to going to his lodgings; my suspicions were stronger on the 8th, before we went to Mitre-street: I had not then seen the razor, nor coat, waistcoat, or trowsers; nor had I seen the prisoner: In every thing I have done since, I have acted under that strong impression, of his guilt; that caused us to make more particular search after him. I pulled the cut in his thumb open, and in my judgment it had not been done above six or seven days - that was my firm opinion. I never said I made a remark on his waistcoat on first seeing him; I said it appeared to have been washed - but I made no remark respecting anything on it; it appeared clean, as if it had been washed within a few days - the stain is on the band of the pocket. I cannot say the trousers had not been sponged; one part of them appeared cleaner than the other; I think I have said they had been sponged, but I would not swear they had; I never swore so; he had a pair of boots on, with hardly any sole to them; the knees of his trousers were cleaner than the rest - the bottom was very muddy; I asked where he had been living, he told me at No. 35, Mitre-street, without hesitation; I asked who he had lived with - he said, a girl named Charlotte Bury; I think he said he had lived in Wootton-street; I found that correct; I think he mentioned Windmill-court to me - we found he had lived there: I have ascertained that he has passed by the name of Edwards for months; I have understood he had a reason for concealing his name - Charlotte Bury has been in my care at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you deny the prisoner's attorney access to her? A. When Mr. Hanson called there one evening, Mrs. Furzeman would not let him see her, but I left word, if Mr. Butler called, he was to see her; I had been desired to let no one see her.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When he said he lived in Mitre-street, did you know that before? A. Certainly; he did not know that I knew it; when I found blood on the glove I put it into my pocket, and wrapped it up; I produced it before the Coroner, and saw the marked papers there: I compared the blood on the glove with that on the papers - they appeared the same marks, and of the same standing: my suspicion of the prisoner made no impression on me, except to make me vigilant and particular in every circumstance I could collect; Knight was examined twice before the Magistrate, and then discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You examined all the drawers? A. I did; every drawer had been disturbed - I found no locks broken - I should think it would not take a person more than fourteen or fifteen minutes, or from that to twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. LETT re-examined. This glove belonged to my son who is abroad; he left about the 8th of November; I had not seen the glove after he left - I know nothing about the feathers, and other articles myself; none of the members of my family have resided in the house since September, 1825; my son has occasionally been there; my daughters have not been there; Mrs. Lett was there repeatedly in the day time, but never slept there.</p>

            . I was directed to go to No. 11, Montague-place on the 1st of January; I saw the pair of scissors; I took them up - saw nothing on them, and put them down again; if there had been blood on them, I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any thing else on the ground? A. I saw a quart pot laying behind the deceased, and the lower part of a razor-sheath very near the body, about two feet from it - it laid partly in the blood, which was congealed. I took up the case - it was bloody; I laid it down again in the same place, I am quite positive, and it remained in the same situation till the Coroner sat; I then took it up, and washed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wash it all over? A. I merely took a wet cloth, and wiped the blood off - there is no blood on it now; I found no difficulty in getting it off. I saw a candlestick on the second stair in the hall, going up stairs, and a small piece of candle in it; I did not notice any blood on it then, but when the Inquest sat, I observed a few spots of blood on it, outside; I do not think it is here; I washed the razor-case, as it was so bloody - I did not think proper to wrap it up in the blood; I left the candlestick in the house - it was made use of. I remained in the house two nights and two days - I cannot recollect in whose possession the candlestick was left; there was a small bit of paper on the table, with some writing on it - I gave it to Mr. Lett; I was present when Mr. Plumb, the surgeon, came; after the Inquest had sat, I saw five or six keys taken from the deceased's pocket, also a thimble, and 5 1/2d.; I did not see the keys tried to any locks; I should have said that a sovereign fell from her person when she was turned about; I have had possession of the razor-case ever since - it is a black one - I produce it; I took it into my possession when the Inquest sat, and washed it almost immediately after: I took it up as soon as the Inquest left the body - it was before my examination at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Did the handle of the razor appear to have been washed? A. I did not notice; the shirt-collar was on the bed, which was unmade; a person might make that mark on it by shaving with a notched razor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went all over the house? A. After the Inquest sat, not before; the drawers appeared much confused; I should think it would take a man at least half an hour to look them all over by himself.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lett. I knew the deceased, and knew she had a plain silver watch, and two silver table-spoons; I have not seen them since her death - I think I saw her with her watch within a month of her death- she wore it regularly; I had not seen the spoons so lately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What makes you say you saw the watch a month before? A. She had observed to me that it did not go regularly; the spoons were marked "B. J." as well as I can recollect. I told Mr. Lett and Mr. Halls what the mark was; the watch had a paper of Mr. Allen's, watchmaker, Red Lion-passage; I informed Mr. Halls of that.</p>
               <p>MR. LETT. I am not aware of any of my property being missing; examination has been made to ascertain that.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury. On the evening of the 1st of January, about six o'clock, I was sent for to No. 11, Montague-place, and saw the body laying in the small room below; she was laying on her back, with her head turned to the right side; I examined a cut in her neck; it extended from the back of her neck towards the front, and separated the whole of the large vessels, and the hemorrhage from those vessels, I have no doubt, caused her death; the windpipe was divided - I should think it not such a wound as a person could have inflicted on herself; her countenance had a strong expression of horror upon it - her eyes were open, and her hands hard clenched. I made no further observations, except on the lower part of her dress, which was pulled up above her knees, or nearly so; when I made a subsequent examination before the Coroner, I saw marks of apparently the knuckles of some person on the left collar-bone; there had been a great loss of blood; there appeared to be a mark of dirt on her left cheek - I thought it was occasioned by the outer edge of the sole of a dirty shoe; her neck handkerchief was thrust into the wound, by apparently the toe of the shoe - it was dirty, similar to the cheek - it was the same coloured dirt; I observed a slight finger-mark of blood on each thigh, also a single drop of blood on the left thigh; the wound in the throat, nor the blood flowing from it, could have occasioned either of these spots.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it be possible for the blood from the throat to occasion either of those marks? A. I think it impossible; her thighs were covered with the clothes, but not the legs; I was obliged to move her clothes to ascertain if there were any marks; there was no appearance of the blood having trickled down internally, nor externally; I could not judge within a few hours how long she had been dead - it might have been twenty-four hours - the body was cold and stiff; the wound had not touched the spine, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it was done with a razor, it had touched no bone? A. It had touched no bone, but had divided the cartilage - I think that would have turned the edge of a razor, so as to render it unfit for use as a razor; I could not tell which hand the knockle mark was of. I saw the prisoner at his first examination at Bow-street, and at the second, which was about the 21st. I saw his left thumb had been cut, but could not judge how long it had been done - it is difficult to say; if I had seen it a week after it had been done, I might be able to say whether it had been done a week or a fortnight, but not to be positive - I think I could not be deceived as to four or five weeks; I should have formed an opinion that it might have been done perhaps three weeks, or a month, when I saw it - I think I examined it at the request of the prisoner's solicitor, Mr. Butler. There was a little blood on the back of both the deceased's hands - it appeared to be the marks of another bloody hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Would cutting through these vessels produce an immediate gush of blood? A. It would, and that was likely to produce a considerable quantity of blood on the hands of the person by whom it was done: in my opinion, the cut was made from the right to the left.</p>
               <p>MR. LETT. I saw the deceased almost every week; latterly one of her arms was rather feeble, but I will not be positive which.</p>
               <p>MR. PLUMRE. I did not peceive any cut on the deceased's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this razor; would cutting through the windpipe produce such an effect as that on the edge? A. I should hardly think it would, to such an extent as this; it appears to me farther that, as I shut the razor, it comes in contact with the handle, and that might produce all the appearances on the edge - I think it possible and probable that it might produce the whole effect on the edge of this razor. The deceased had long sleeves on - I did not discover any blood upon them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SALMON re-examined by MR. COLERIDGE. I saw the prisoner's thumb examined at the Compter - it appeared to me to be recently done; I do not recollect making any remark of its festering - I said at Bow-street that it appeared to be in a festering state.</p>

               <p>GEORGE JAMES ROBINSON. I am an upholdster. I had had taken an inventory of the fixtures and furniture in Mr. Lett's house, but not of the spoons, nor any thing of that nature; I have been there when Mr. Lett was at lunch, and have seen some spoons and table-forks - that was three months ago; this cloth (looking at it), I have no doubt, is one I found in Mr. Lett's house, two or three days after the Inquest sat, when I examined the premises; I took it out because there were two marks of blood upon it, and gave it to Edmeads - it was not in the room where the body was found, but on the same floor; there were several articles which I did not put in my inventory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Had you any thing to do with spoons or plate in your inventory? A. No; Mr. Lett had not moved all his furniture; I am not aware that any of his property was missing - my inventory was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210018"/>only of the fixtures and the planned furniture, not of what was in the drawers; there was considerable property of Mr. Lett's in the house, which might have been carried away.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Gower Arms public-house, Gower-street. I knew Mrs. Jeffs. On the last night in the year I was in Montague-place, about nine o'clock, and saw Mrs. Jeffs at Mr. Lett's door, talking to a man with a blue coat and white apron on - I was on the other side of the way; she called me over, and asked for a pint of beer, which I gave her in a quart pot - she generally had half a pint, but she had had none for three weeks or a fortnight; the man was in the hall, on the mat - they seemed talking together as I was crossing the road; when I delivered the beer to her I went away, and left them there - they did not shut the door while I staid; I afterwards saw the quart pot, when master brought it home - not before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are sure this was about nine o'clock? A. It might be a little after, but not much I know; I went out a little before nine with my beer - I did not see the man's face; the moon was nearly full, and there is a gas-light facing the door - I am certain he had a white apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his front, or his back? A. His front, but did not see his face; I do not know how he was dressed below his apron - I am sure he had a blue coat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sized man was he? A. A middling size; I cannot form any judgment whether it was the prisoner or not; he had not got a frock coat on - it was a tail coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made so as to come forward over his hips? A. It was cut round here - it did not hang over his knees- it was buttoned over his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a coat as a groom wears, or such as a gentleman wears? A. Such as a gentleman wears.</p>

I was at his house on this night, at half-past nine, or nearly twenty minutes to ten o'clock; as I was going off in the cart, I fell, and at the time I fell, I heard a dreadful scream; I could not tell where it came from - my horse went on - its head was towards Bedford-square, it passed Mr. Lett's house as it went on; the scream sounded to me to come from Russell-square way; I think we had passed No. 11, when I heard the scream, and were about No. 10.</p>

            . On the 31st of December I was in the cart with Evans. I recollect starting from Mr. Sergeant Bosanquet's door, about twenty minutes before ten, as near as possible; the horse went on of its own accord - Evans fell back on the seat, and at that moment I heard a dreadful scream - it appeared to come from the south side of the street; we had then got not quite past No. 10 - if we had, that was the outside: I looked round, but could see no one about; the voice seemed to come quite from the house, just opposite the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You thought the dreadful scream was a boy in the street? A. I said so: I thought so then, but not afterwards: when Evans said "Lord have mercy me, what's that?"

On the night of the 31st of December, when I went to call half-past ten o'clock; I was coming down on the left hand side of the way, and when by No. 24, which is opposite No. 11, I saw a man and woman talking to Mrs. Jeffs, outside the door; she had the door half-way open in her right hand, and a candlestick in her left - I heard them bid her good night, and she bid them good night; they went down the street, and turned to the left, towards Bedford-square, I went on towards Russell-square, and saw Mrs. Jeffs shut the door; it was on a Monday night; I am a regular watchman there, but was not there the first night in the year; we come to the watch-house at half-past seven, and are on our beats before eight, and call the hour every half hour after; the man had a blue coat on - I did not observe any apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the length of your beat? A. From the end of Montague-street, to No. 1, Montague-place, and there is a mews I have to go down - if I walk quick I can go round my beat in ten minutes - but it generally takes a quarter of an hour: when I began to call half-past ten, I saw nobody near the house: I was coming back when I saw them - it might be nearly a quarter to eleven; my box is in the rails of Russell-square. I have known Mrs. Jeffs for some years; she held a candle in her hand. it was moonlight - almost as light as day; I am certain I saw the man and woman talking to her.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate of Bow-street. The prisoner was examined before me several times on this charge; I, myself, took his examination down on the 14th of January, when he was first brought before me. The paper I hold in my hand contains my own note, in my own hand-writing, of the examination I then took. No threat, promise, menace, or inducement whatever, were held out to him; on the contrary I cautioned him.</p>
               <p>MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Was that paper, after you took it, read over to him? A. It was, by myself. It is not signed by him; he was repeatedly examined by me - my clerk did not take a note of his examination; I took it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, at his last examination, read over to him, a paper, purporting to be his examination? A. I had read over to him a verbatim copy of the paper I now hold in my hand; that was on Monday week; the copy was made in my presence, and afterward examined by myself, immediately after I wrote the examination; it was only his own statement; nothing more was read to him. I asked him to sign it at his last examination, and he declined; he said there were many inaccuracries in it - I asked if he would sign it subject to that remark; he declined signing it at all; and said though he had made that statement, there were several inaccuracies in it, which he declined explaining to me; he said he preferred giving the explanation to Mr. Butler, his solicitor, to be made use of at his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. In conducting this examination, did you take down the very words he said? A. I did - I left him to tell his own story in such parts as related to times and places, where he said he had been, occasionally putting questions to him; I suffered him to tell his own story in all material parts; I only put questions to him when I thought it necessary, to lead his attention to the particular subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to tell us, as well as you can, the very words in which he declined to sign the statement? A. I said, "This statement having been read over to you, will you sign it?" He said, "I decline signing it;" in the first instance he seemed preparing to sign it; Mr. Butler, his solicitor, then said, "Jones, if you sign that paper, understand you take it on your own responsibility;" he then said, "I decline signing it:" he had said there were inaccuracies in it before Mr. Butler spoke to him. I have returned to the Court the copy of what I hold in my hand; it is signed by myself, as the examination.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he explain what sort of inaccuracies he had to complain of? A. He refused to give any explanation, but admitted the statement was what he had made at the time - he said, "I have made such a statement, but it contains several inaccuracies;" I had taken it correct: he did not complain of my taking it inaccurately, when it was read over to him - I read it to him, in the first instance, on the 14th, when I took it, and asked if it was correct - he said it was correct; it was again read to him on last Monday week, and he refused to sign it. (Looking at the examinations returned to the Court) this is the paper read over to him on Monday week - it is a copy of what I took from him.(The examination was here read, as follows:)</p>
               <p>JAN. 14, 1828. - "It was about a fortnight ago that I first went to lodge at No. 35, Mitre-street, near the Cobourg Theatre, at the house of a person named Stapleton - I cannot precisely recollect the day; I did not take the lodgings myself, but rather think it was on a Friday, the last Friday in the year; the lodgings were taken by a female named Charlotte, whom I have lately lived with - I do not know her real name, but she usually goes by the name of Charlotte Bury - I have lived with her about seven or eight months, and saw her last on Saturday last, in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, at a house in White Lion-passage, and I was to have met her in the evening again, at the top of Shire-lane; I first became acquainted with her accidentally in Fleet-street, she being at that time a girl upon the town. On the Monday evening, the 31st of December last, I went to the Adelphi Theatre, rather earlier than half-past seven - I went alone - I went into the gallery and paid 1s. for admittance; I saw part of Nelson, and the Married Batchelor, and the Pantomime - I went straight from home in Mitre-street, and went out with the intention of going; I went out quite alone and left Charlotte at home - she was alone when I left her; I came over Blackfriars-bridge and along Fleet-street to the Strand, and did not stop any where in my way till I got to the Theatre, nor did I meet any person I knew. I am not now quite sure I left Charlotte at home - she may have gone out before me, but I am quite sure she did not leave the house with me, for I remember I went out with the intention of going to the Adelphi by myself; I had I think not above 2s. in my pocket at the time I went to the Adelphi - I did not see any one I knew particularly at the Theatre - I did not expect it, as I so seldom go into the gallery, I staid through the whole of the performance, and did not go out at all - I think it was a little before twelve o'clock when I came out, and I went home by myself over Blackfriars-bridge again; I think I called in at the public-house next door to the Theatre, and had a glass of something, but am not positive of this. I think the landlord let me in at home - it was either him or his wife: upon recollection, I may possibly have gone home that night with Charlotte, as I was much used to meet her and go home with her - generally about Fleet-street, but I am sure I went out alone. I have no doubt the money I had about me was Charlotte's money; Charlotte paid the first week's lodging in Mitre-street; she paid it with her own money; she paid part on the Thursday, I think, and part on the Friday, the day when the week expired; I saw her go down stairs to pay it both times - I think she paid 4s. the first time, and 1s. remaining on the Friday, and she paid 1s. deposit on taking the lodging - all this was her own money, I am sure of this, for I have not given her any money lately, not for some weeks past. I do not think I have borrowed any money of any person since I have lodged in Mitre-street; I have had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210020"/>few shillings at a time since I have been there, of my own money, by selling one or two pawnbroker's tickets, at different times, about 3s. or 4s.; it was during the first week of our being in Mitre-street that I speak of; I sold the tickets to strangers, in public-houses - one was for a pair of Wellington boots, another for a pair of trousers and a handkerchief, and several other things together, and, I think, a coat, all in one ticket; I think I got 27s. or 28s. for the tickets altogether; the boots were pledged at Cameron's, in the Strand, for 7s., as were also the coat and trousers, for 1l. I cut my thumb about five or six weeks ago, or perhaps more - I cut it, splitting some wood, with a sharp knife, against my breast; it was in Wootten-street, where we lived before we went to Mitre-street; I rather think Charlotte was present when I cut it - it was in the forenoon, lateish, in our own room - I was cutting the wood to light the fire; it was with a case-knife belonging to the house - it was a long time healing; I applied nothing to it but a bit of rag at first, but soon left it off - I have worn nothing upon it since I have been in Mitre-street. I now recollect it was tied round with some tape, which was in our table drawer in Wootten-street, the landlady's table; Charlotte gave me the tape - perhaps it might have been in the table in Mitre-street, and my thumb might have been cut in Mitre-street. I was at the Olympic Theatre on Tuesday, the 1st of January, instant, with Charlotte, either on the Tuesday or the Wednesday, I rather think the former; the piece was Casco Bay, and Touch and Take, and the Pantomime; we went into the gallery - I paid 2s. for the two: it was my own money, out of that I had got by selling the tickets, which I believe she understood I borrowed, for I told her I had borrowed some of a friend. We went from our own lodgings over Waterloo-bridge, and went to the Adelphi first, for I had told her I had been there the night before, and she wished to see the same pieces, but we were told the house was full, and then we went to the Olympic. I was at home all the day on the Tuesday. I have got an umbrella, which is in Mitre-street - I bought it in the Westminster-road, just over Westminster-bridge, on the right-hand side, at a shop which I perfectly recollect, a small shop; I gave 4s. 6d. for it; I bought it during the first week while we were in Mitre-street, but do not recollect the precise day, about Tuesday or Wednesday - I believe a woman served me with it; it was a new one, I believe, when I bought it, it being outside for sale. I have seen the late Mrs. Jeffs twice - once in the presence of Mr. Knight, her son, and once in the presence of Mr. Knight's daughter - his eldest daughter, Mary; the last was in the front parlour in Montague-place; I went to meet them there, and my own sister was there at the time; this was when I met the daughter Mary there: at that time the daughter Mary was boarding and lodging with my mother; this was before I went to Mr. Duncombe's - it was before this that I went with Mr. Knight to see Mrs. Jeffs; I went with him about something concerning a situation - some writing in a counting-house that Mrs. Jeffs had obtained for her son; I was in the parlour with Mrs. Jeffs both times; I have not seen Mrs. Jeffs since I was there with the daughter Mary: I do not know whether my sister has since seen her; my sister's name is Georgiana - she is unmarried, and she lives in King-street, Bloomsbury, with my mother. I lodged myself with Knight a short time before he left the house over the water, in Anderson's-place, Cornwall-road, and a short time after he came to live in Cursitor-street, a few week's altogether - I cannot say how many. I saw Mrs. Jeffs once also at Mr. Knight's, in Cornwall-road - she did not stop there for any long time. I recollect that Knight pledged a picture in Holborn, in High Holborn, above the upper Turnstile - it was a landscape, in a frame, about three or four feet in length, and about a foot wide, I should think. The coat I have on I borrowed - it is not my own; I borrowed it of a Mrs. Williams, who was our landlady in Wootten-street; this was while we were with her, some weeks back. I pledged my own coat before I went to Mitre-street - it was a black coat, and is amongst the tickets in the possession of the officer. The shirt-collar now produced by Salmon, the officer, is mine; I do not know when I wore it last, or how it came bloody.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Valentine-row, Gray's-street, near the Cobourg Theatre - I formerly lived in Windmill-street, and afterwards in Wootten-street, in the same neighbourhood; a young woman lived with me, who went by the name of

             - she first lived with me in Wootten-street - she had one room furnished, for which she paid 10s. a week; the prisoner Jones lived with her - he also went by the name of Edwards: she took the lodging, but he came with her, and occupied it; they lived together as man and wife - they did not say whether they were married. They lived with me from the 29th of October till the 29th of December; I then moved - they also lived with me at No. 1, Windmill-street; we had two rooms, and lived together there; I paid 5s. a week myself- they paid nothing, they were in poor circumstances. I knew Charlotte used to go out of an evening; I have heard her say so, in his presence. I have three daughters - the eldest (Mary Ann) is fourteen years old; when the prisoner left me they went to live in Mitre-street - I think it was No. 35; they had a back room on the first floor; Stapleton kept the house - I used to visit them. I used to lend the prisoner razors when he lived with me in Wootten-street, and I lent him one when he lived in Mitre-street; I had four razors, two with black handles, and two tortoiseshell - the two black handled ones had a double case - one of the tortoiseshell had a single case, and the other had no case; I lent him a tortoiseshell one in a black case, with a top to it, for I have the two black handled ones now - I think I should know the razor-case again, and the razor too; (looking at the razor) I think this is something like the one I lent him - there is no mark on it - I only know it by its general appearance; I think I should know the case by its general appearance - there was no mark on it; it was a black case, and the upper part of the lower case was red - (looking at it) I believe this to be the case - it is something like it, if it is not it - I cannot swear to it; I lent him the razor and case on the 30th of December; my daughter Mary Ann carried them to him - they have never been returned to me; I saw him twice on the 30th of December, first at his own lodging, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - he was then in bed with Charlotte, and said he wished I would send the razor up, and that I would lend him a silk neck handkerchief; he said he wanted the razor that was in the single case; Charlotte, who was in bed, asked me, in his presence, if I would let my little girl go and borrow a shilling or a sixpence for her, saying she had no fire, nor any victuals - I let my girl go to borrow a sixpence, and was there when she returned - she did not succeed; I afterwards sent the razor and handkerchief as desired; he, Charlotte, and my girl came home together, about five o'clock in the evening; they stopped about half an hour or less, and said they were go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210021"/>ing into the City, I believe, but am not positive; they were not in the habit of going out of an evening while they were at my house, for the prisoner had no coat - if he wanted a coat he used to send to a person named Sells to borrow one - it was a largish drab coat, I think; I afterwards lent him a dark blue coat, which was given to my son - (looking at the coat produced) I rather think this is it - yes it is, for there is my work in the back seams.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner and Charlotte again on the 31st? A. Yes, in the morning; I went to their lodgings - I cannot be certain whether they were up; the prisoner said nothing about money then: I did not stop many minutes, and did not see them after on that day - I think my little girl went there. On the 1st of January I went to their lodgings in Mitre-street; they were both up - he was cleaning himself. and said he was going out to meet a friend who had promised to lend him some money; I wished him a happy new year, and he wished me the same - Charlotte said nothing to that; she said he was going to get a trifle of money: he was not in the habit of going out in the day time; he said he had seen a friend last night, and was going to that friend to lend him a little money, and if he succeeded Charlotte should give me a trifle. On the morning of the 2d, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to his lodging in Mitre-street - he was in bed; I asked how he was, and how Charlotte was; he said she was gone out, and said he had been to my house the night before; I said I found he had, for he had left me 2s., which my daughter had given me; when Charlotte came in she said she had been to get the newspaper, and could not get it, and said, "I suppose you won't believe it, but I have;" he said it was a lie: she then said, "If you want it, get up and get it yourself;" he did not say for what purpose he wanted it - they asked if I could get a newspaper - I asked what paper they wanted, and said, "Sunday's?" they said No, to-day's, if they could get it; they both hastily said that; they both pressed me to stay breakfast that morning, and while at breakfast they had words; Charlotte told me, in his hearing, that when she came home on the Tuesday, he was laying on the bed, crying - that she asked what it was about, and he said he had heard his father was dead - he said an intimate friend of his father's had told him so; they did not breakfast together, in consequence of having words; the prisoner had no coat on while he was at breakfast; I believe his coat laid in the chair, and a little while after breakfast it fell off the chair, and made a great rustling - Jones looked very anxiously at it - it sounded as if silver money was in it; a quartern and a half of gin was sent for - I fetched it; Jones produced the money for it - Charlotte would have none of it: I did not stop above three minutes after I fetched it. I did not go there again till Saturday, the 5th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock - nothing particular passed - I went again on Sunday, the 6th, and told him I understood the Bow-street officers were after a person of the name of Jones, and they said it was Mrs. Williams' lodger - (I had heard him say before that his name was Jones, but I did not believe it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us particularly every thing you said to him? - A. As well as I can recollect, I said I thought it was him, and Charlotte said he had committed no murder; I had said it was a charge of murder - Charlotte said, "Oh! he has not committed any murder - it is his friends who have sent after him;" Jones said nothing about the murder - he said he knew how it was - that his friends had sent the Bow-street officers after him; Charlotte said, "Well, Bill, you know you must go home now - you know your friends are in search of you:" I said, William Nicholas (my son) wanted his coat - he said, "You cannot have it now, till such time as I have been home to my friends, and set all things right," and so I left the coat with him; he said they did not wish me to stop - I said I did not want to stop: they desired me to be careful how I went out, that no one should watch me home; I believe I said I should be careful of that for my own sake; he said I was not to tell any one where he lived, and he was not to tell any one where I lived. I saw no more of him after that day till he was in custody - he did not tell me where his friends lived: I have heard him say he had a mother and brother, and, I think, sisters. The coat had been cleaned all over before I lent it to him; my son lives with a doctor - the coat was cleaned, as the person who gave it to him wore it when brewing, and it was stiff with sweet-wort; it was cleaned all over. I never took the razor out of the case after he himself had put it in at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner came to lodge with you in October? A. I think it was then; he went by the name of Edwards then - he did not often go out of an evening: they were both strangers to me before. While he lived with me in Wootten-street he used to be at home all day, and seldom went out; I do not remember his going out before I lent him the blue coat, not half a dozen times, as he had no coat to wear; he said nothing more about the newspaper than I have mentioned, while I was there - nothing passed about it at breakfast. When he lived with me in Wootten-street I believe he sent for a paper once or twice, on a Sunday; I do not know how he employed himself - I was seldom in his apartment. I understood from him that his parents were respectable; he could read and write - I lent him a book or two. I had taken the coat in at the back and side seams, after it was cleaned - I cannot say how long ago that was; it was stiff with sweet-wort; my son cleaned it with a piece of blue cloth and water: it was his practice to sit in the house without a coat, as he had none to put on, and after I lent him one he used to sit at home without it; I observed nothing particular about his clothes on New-year's day - I did not particularly notice them. My son lives with Mr. Guest, over Blackfriars-bridge. My husband died on the 12th of January, 1827 - the razors belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. While the prisoner lived with you, had you received directions to deny him to any one? A. Not from him; Charlotte has told me to deny her if anybody came, and said then that would deny them both - she said that in his hearing. I never heard him say at that time that there were reasons for his keeping out of the way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the coat now, and tell us if you can say anything has been done to it since you lent it to him? A. I cannot say that I particularly noticed that; it is not in the same state now as when I lent it him - it is dirty: I cannot say whether it has been sponged at all; I never looked inside the sleeves.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. My mother sent me to the prisoner with a razor, in a case, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210022"/>a silk handkerchief, on a Sunday - I do not know on what Sunday - it was after Christmas, and before Newyear's-day; that was the only time I ever carried one - I gave it into his own hand - he was in bed, and Charlotte was up in the room; it was about four or five o'clock in the evening; it was a black-coloured case - I had often seen it and looked at it - I think I should know the case again - I did not know the razor - I saw the case before the Magistrate, and had seen it before - it was my father's(looking at it) - I believe this is it; I think it is, because it is very much like it in the shape and colour - there is no mark by which I know it; two or three parts of it are uneven; I had not observed whether my father's case was even or not; the part the top went over was red, and so is this; I often had my father's razor-case in my hand - I did not particularly notice it when I carried it to Jones; I had seen it about before; I believe this is the same razor-case, but I will not be certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why this razor was a play-thing of yours, I suppose? A.

            . I am twenty-one years old. I have gone by the name of Charlotte for the last two years - I never went by that name till I left my home; I have been acquainted with the prisoner for five months before he was taken up; I lived in the same lodging with him over the water, by the Cobourg Theatre; I lodged with him at Mrs. Williams' about two months, in Wootten-street; we then went to Windmill-court, and lived together, then she moved separately, and we moved; Jones lived with me all that time: he went by the name of Edwards - I used to be called Charlotte Edwards. On the 31st of December I went out, about seven o'clock in the evening, with Jones - we came over Blackfriars'-bridge; I parted with him in Bridge-street, about Bride-lane; we had neither hurried there, nor walked slow; he met me again about half-past twelve the same night, in Fleet-street; it was my practice to meet him there about eleven or twelve o'clock every night; I met him that night about Poppin's-court, a few yards from Fleet-market, on that side of the way - he came in a direction from the Strand - I had no money when we went out that evening, and I do not think he had any; he did not say where he was going; when I met him he told me he had been with a friend - that he had been with a young man, a friend, and had borrowed some money of him - he said it was 2s. or 3s.; he did not say where he met him, or where he had been with him; I had got no money then - a young woman was with me when I met him - we went with him to a wine-vaults, in Poppin's-court, and had some gin - he paid 6d. for it; we then went home; we got home about one o'clock; I think a female lodger up-stairs let us in; we lived then in Mitre-street, at Mrs. Stapleton's.</p>
               <p>Q. The following morning would be Tuesday (Newyear's-day) - do you remember any thing happening then? A. Mr. Jones got up; he had breakfast, and went out about eleven o'clock - he returned a little after three in the afternoon with some more money - he said he had been to borrow it of a friend - he did not tell me how much he had - he gave me 5s. - I got some of my wearing apparel out of pledge by his direction, with 3s.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went out that morning did any thing happen? A. As we were sitting at breakfast he said he had cut his thumb - that was on New-year's-morning - he said he had cut it in cutting bread and butter - it was cut up by the nail; I looked at it - it was a deep cut, and looked very red, as if fresh done; he held it against his handkerchief, and asked me for some rag; I told him I had none, and he wrapped his handkerchief round it; it bled again in the afternoon, and he wrapped some white tape round it, which I afterwards put on a dress. which I afterwards pawned, and it was produced before the Magistrate; he did not dine at home that day - we went out that evening, and called in Wootten-street, at Mrs. Mills' - he sent her for some gin, and produced some silver to pay for it - I cannot say how much, for Mrs. Williams and I were talking together - the gin came to 6d. - we then went over Waterloo-bridge, to the Adelphi theatre, which was so full we could not get in, and we went to the Olympic; he had said he should like me to go to the Adelphi to see a play called Nelson - I had wished before to see it, and he wanted to take me there that night, but we could not get in; he said nothing more about it that night, but that he thought it was a good thing; we went to the Olympic, and when we came out we went into the Strand, and had some supper in a court there; he paid for every thing - I had no money - the theatre cost 2s., and the supper 1s. 4d. - after supper we met a friend in Fleet-street, and went to the same winevanlts, and had some gin again - we got home at one o'clock- it struck one as we were in the New-cut. Next morning I washed some things belonging to us both - there was a shirt of his, a collar, and the handkerchief which he held his thumb against, a waistcoat, and a pair of braces (looking at the waistcoat produced) - this is the one I washed; I did not observe any thing particular on it; I was in the habit of putting things in quick, into a little pan - I put the shirt and waistcoat in together, and observed no stain on them, except a stain on the shirt sleeve, which I had observed him make myself, with pickled cabbage; it was about here (pointing three or four inches below the elbow.)</p>
               <p>Q. This was on Wednesday morning, the 2d of January? A. Yes, that I washed; I had been out on the Tuesday afternoon, a little after three o'clock, and when I returned, a little after four, found him lying on the bed, on his back, crying - I asked what was the matter; he said he had heard bad news since he had been out - that his father was dead and buried on the Wednesday before; I asked who the friend was who told him of it; he said nobody that I knew; he did not say where his friend lived; Mrs. Williams came on Wednesday morning, and breakfasted with Mr. Jones; I had none myself - I had asked Mrs. Williams to come to the fire - she said No; I was offended, and had no breakfast - I had been out before she came, and she opened the door to me when I returned - this was about eleven o'clock; Jones had sent me to get a newspaper.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210023"/>Q. What newspaper was it to be? A. Any but Sunday's, I believe; I did not get him one; he was displeased at that, and words passed between us, which was partly the cause of my taking offence. On Sunday morning Mrs. Williams came, and said something about people being after him; we remained at our lodging till that evening - I then went out first, and Mr. Jones came after me; I did not tell the people we were going away; Stapleton's little girl went out into the street to see if any one was watching after Jones - he knew that - this was before I went out - Stapleton did not know but I was going to return that night - I went on as far as the Surrey Theatre; Jones overtook me in about ten minutes; that is about as far from Mitre-street as Fleet-market is from the end of Wych-street; he left me; I walked about some time - he met me again, and I went with him to sleep at a house in the City - it was a house for the reception of women; Jones went out in the morning - I met him again on Monday night; he and I were together all that night in the streets, and on Wednesday night: I saw him on Saturday morning - he promised to meet me that night, but never came; I waited; a young man came, and I was taken up; Mrs. Williams used to come and see us after we left her house; she lent him a coat and handkerchief; it was a coat her son's master had given him; she lent him a razor; I did not see any case to it in Mitre-street, but I saw one in Wootten-street; the way I noticed the case was this - she took them up-stairs to him, and asked him to sharpen them, and told him to choose which he liked from them; they all went away together in Windmill-court, and at night he wanted a razor, and could not find one in the bustle of moving, and this was sent to him by the little girl; I was dressing when it was brought, and did not notice whether it came in a case; I do not recollect seeing the case any where but in Wootten-street; a case was shown to me at Bow-street; I recollected it again, by its being rather freckled and dark, and turned up a little at the small end of it; I thought I knew it again, and that it was the same I had seen in Wootten-street; Jones used to shave with the razor; I never knew him do any thing else with it (looking at the razor produced) - this is the one he had in Mitre-street; there were two alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the case, is it the case you saw before, at Wootton-street? A. By what I can recollect, Sir, Yes; I do not know it by any particular mark, but by its being freckled here (pointing to the narrow end); we stopped at home all day on the last Sunday in the year; we had no money to buy the necessaries of life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COLERIDGE. Q. When you first became acquainted with the prisoner, did he go by the name of Edwards or Jones? A. Jones; we did not take the name of Edwards till we went to live in Wootten-street - we have always been called Edwards since; I heard him say there was a reason why he should go by a false name; he used to go out in the day-time at first, but not often, when we lived in Wootten-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him the last night in the year, how do you know it was after twelve o'clock? A. Because the wine-vaults we went to were shut up; I do not think the bells were ringing when I first met him, but I do not know; I think I heard St. Bride's bells when I was going home, over Blackfriars'-bridge; that was after I had been into the wine-vaults; I believe they begin to ring at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in Jones' manner when you met him? A. No; he seemed more cheerful than he had on other nights; I perceived no hurry or agitation in his manner; there was a light in the wine-vaults; he had no bandage round his had there; I saw nothing particular about his clothes; I saw him pull them off when he went to bed; I noticed nothing remarkable about them; nor in the morning - there was nothing about his hands; there was no stain at all till I saw his thumb at breakfast-time, when he said he cut it; I saw no spots of blood; as we sat at breakfast he was cutting bread and butter - he put down the loaf, and I saw his thumb directly; he had had the handkerchief before, but I saw his thumb quite red, as if it had been bleeding.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say when he had cut his thumb? - A. Cutting the bread and butter at that time; he wiped it with his handkerchief - it seemed as if it had been bleeding.</p>

               <p>MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Did you see him sponge his coat that day? A. No; he put it on to go out, after brushing it down with a shoe-brush - it had been sponged, but not by him - Mrs. Williams had sponged it for her son, before she lent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. On New-year's night he wished you to go and see the performance at the theatre; what made him wish you to go? A. I had heard it was a good thing; he mentioned to me on the Thursday or Friday afterwards, that he had been there on the Monday night, and said he had seen Nelson and some Pantomime, and mentioned Mr. Yates, Mr. Watson, and several other persons, who were in it; the shirt and waistcoat which he wore, were what he had worn on the 31st; I washed twice a week, sometimes but once - that was my general day for washing; he was often in the habit of sending me for the newspaper while I lived with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he sent you on this day, did he tell you to get any particular paper? A. No; over the water they lend out newspapers at so much an hour, and he said, "Try and get a paper if you can, in the same way as they used to lend them in Wootten-street, for I must have something to read:" this was the first time he sent for one at that lodging, for we only went there on Friday, and had no money to spare before: as I could not get a paper, I got him a novel that day, at the corner of New-street, facing the Cobourg theatre; he read it all - it was not returned till the Saturday night; I have been kept at Mr. Furzeman's since, and nobody from Jones has been to see me; Mr. Williams and Mr. Henson came up the other evening - I did not know they came from him; Mrs. Furzeman and the servant-girl were present all the time - I think it was on Tuesday evening they came; Mr. Williams lives in the Old Bailey - he used to keep the Globe tavern; that is the way I knew him; Jones' friends are very respectable, from what I have heard him say; I remember hearing about the murder, and saying his friends had sent the officers after him; Mrs. Williams came up and said, "William, I have got bad news to tell you;" she said the Bow-street officers were after him: I said, "What for?" she said, they said Oh, they could break into any house for murder; I said, "No, he has done no murder - it is his friends after him:" I then said to him,"For God's sake go home, and stop them from sending after you;" he said he would go home, because we did not want Mrs. Williams to know any body was after him; I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210024"/>Mrs. Mills - I remember telling her about getting my things out of pawn, and what money he got for me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever see this umbrella before? A. Yes, in Mitre-street; Mr. Jones brought it there on Tuesday afternoon, the 1st of January; when he told me he had been to see the Pantomime, he said he was treated by the young man who lent him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whether he went with the young man or alone? A. No; I supposed he went with him, as he said he was treated - he did not say whether he waited till it was over; he told me who acted, and said the scenes were beautiful; it was half past twelve o'clock when I met him, for the wine-vaults were shut; the female knocked, and we got in.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that week, when he came home with more money than usual, did you pay for your lodging? A. Yes; I paid 3s. on the Tuesday afternoon when he came home, and 2s. on Friday. I had paid 1s. earnest when we went, as I had borrowed 2s. 6d. of Mrs. Williams; Jones gave me the 3s. to pay, and I pawned my frock for the 2s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed his thumb before he said he had cut it? A. No; I did not see him cut it; but while he was cutting bread he put down the loaf, and said he had cut it. I cannot be sure whether he did cut it then or not; it was red - I did not see blood come from it at that time, for he had it some time to the handkerchief; he put his thumb against the handkerchief, as soon as ever he said he had cut it, and, after some time, he shewed it to me, and I saw it was red; there was no mark in the bed as if it had been bleeding in the night.</p>

            . I live at No. 35, Mitre-street. The prisoner first came to lodge with me, on the 26th of December; the witness, Charlotte, took the lodging. On Monday evening, the 31st of December, I heard them go out together, as usual, between six and seven o'clock; I did not see them go out, but heard the feet of two persons; they left their candle on the stairs, as usual. I was in bed when they returned; my husband let them in - I think it was a little before two o'clock; it might be half-past one. Charlotte paid me 3s. on the Tuesday, and 2s. on Friday; she had paid 1s. when they took the room - it was let at 6s. a week. I saw the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock, on the 1st of January; he had and umbrella. On Sunday, the 6th of January, between four and five in the afternoon, Mills called and enquired for Mr. and Mrs. Jones; I knew nobody by that name, and said there was nobody in the house of that name. I heard a voice on the landing-place; I could not tell whose voice, but Charlotte came down; she wished me to send my little girl to look out to see if any one was standing round the street. I did so; she was to go from the top of the street to the bottom. Jones was at home at the time; he could not hear the conversation between me and Charlotte; I should think, Charlotte went away in about and hour. The child was sent out a second time by Charlotte's desire, and she wished me to look out also. Jones went away about ten minutes after Charlotte; when he came down, he asked if I would do him the same favour: Charlotte had asked me to look out the same for him. I said I would; the favor was to look out for him, and I did; I went to the door and said there was no one there but my neighbours: he told me not to speak so loud - before that he asked if Mrs. Edwards was gone out. I said Yes; I told him she was gone up towards the Crown public-house. I saw nothing more of either of them, till they were in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. While they lived with you, was it their practice to go out of an evening? A. Yes; they used to come home between eleven and twelve o'clock; I do not think I was in bed above one night when they came home; I was sitting up with sick children.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were they ever so late as on the night of the 31st of December? A. No; they usually came home about eleven o'clock - between eleven and twelve.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear them come home on the night of the 31st of December? A. I heard them knock at the door; we had a sick child; I was sitting up in bed with a child I have ill.</p>

            . I am husband of the last witness. On New-year's morning the prisoner came home with Charlotte at two o'clock by my clock; he usually came home at twelve, and always together; they lived with us by the name of Edwards; he told me he had been to spend the evening with some friends; I think he said, we have been spending the evening; he did not say where he had been.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the habit of letting them in? A. I let them in three times, and had to get out of bed; they generally came home after my hours. There was nothing remarkable in his manner, more than on any other night. I had a light in my hand - I observed nothing about his clothes. I did not see him next morning, as I go out at half past nine.</p>

            . I live at No. 31, Wootten-street. On Wednesday, the 2d of January, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, Charlotte and Jones called on me; they said they were going to the theatre, to see something about Lord Nelson performed; they asked me to have something to drink. I said No; I had rather not; upon that the prisoner threw a crown piece down on the table; my daughter fetched a quartern and a half of gin with it, and gave the prisoner the change. Charlotte said, "What a had job it has been for me, on account of pledging my friend's coat; he went out yesterday and got me 2l.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she mean? A. Jones, the prisoner, had got her 2l. and she said, I have got this gown, and this shawl. out of pledge, and paid my rent. I asked what rent it was. she said 6s. a-week, and she paid it before it came due, for fear she should not have it again. I called at Stapleton's, in Mitre-street, on Sunday, the 6th, about five o'clock, and asked if Mr. Jones lived there - I had heard his name was Jones, but nothing farther. Mrs. Stapleton called out, and asked if there was such a person there. I described Charlotte, and she said no such person lived there. I called again afterward, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When she said what a bad thing it was that she had pawned his coat, did she say any thing more? A. She said she had pawned it for 10s. to pay the washer-woman's bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say, "for he is not able to go out among his friends?" A. She did. I only saw 5s. produced.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Clement's Inn. The prisoner was in my employ, as clerk, in July last. I know his hand-writing (looking at three letters.) This letter, marked A, is his writing; it begins,"My dear Charlotte;" this one, marked B, I believe to be his writing, from some part of it; it is not written in his usual hand, and I am not so positive of it; it is a feigned hand - I cannot he positive of any part of it, but I have a belief of its being his - the words, "Jones is not the murderer," is like his - I have a belief that there is a great similarity, and the name "Goodman" is his writing, but is not his usual character; it appears to be a disguised hand - I have a fixed belief of it being his writing. This third letter marked C, I can speak to from his signature - the second is not signed. I wish to be understood as not speaking decidedly to the second letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I presume there is a considerable difference in the hand-writing? A. Certainly; some parts of the second letter, are so like his, that I believe it to be his, and no doubt it is all written by the same person. I believe it to be feigned, because some parts are not like his. I do not swear it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had received that letter in the ordinary way, should you have acted on it as Jones's letter? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>The letter, Marked A, was here read, as follows:-</p>
               <p>"MY DEAR CHARLOTTE, Giltspur-street.</p>
               <p>"I embrace this opportunity of letting you know my situation, by a person who has offered to call for me. All I have to beg of you is, not to let a single soul know of it but yourself. I shall go up to the Hall to-morrow; I don't let a single soul know; if you come ask for Wm. Edwards."</p>
               <p>MR. PLUMBE re-examined. I saw the state in which the deceased's body lay; in my judgment she could not have come by her death by her own hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I feel confident of your attention and favourable consideration of the few words I have now to address to you. If now, for the first time, you learned the charge against me, my situation would be one sufficiently alarming - but how much more frightful is it in consequence of the spreading throughout the country of details which have excited universal indignation; I will mention only one instance of the misrepresentation with which my name has been associated; at the very time when the bill against me was before the Grand Jury, a man was engaged near the Sessions-house, proclaiming with a horn the infamous story that I had made a full confession of this murder, and had committed suicide in the House of Correction. I might complain also of the way in which every little circumstance has been turned to my prejudice, but that I am willing to believe that a desire for justice was a part of the actuating motive - and am firmly convinced you will lay aside every thing said out of Court. From the first moment when this charge was brought against me, I have denied it; would that I could with equal truth declare myself guiltless of all other offence, but I feel that I am obliged to make my own misconduct a part of my defence - whatever may have been my errors, however, the slightest thought of murder never crossed my mind. I owe it to an aged mother and other friends, whose minds have already bled too much for me, to declare that I am guiltless of this charge. Thrown amidst the temptations of the town at an early age, my life was wild and dissolute - dissipation led to crime, and at the time when the offence with which I am now charged was committed, I had not only other charges to fear, but knew that a charge of forgery had been made against me, and thus it was that I fled at the approach of the officers. With regard to my examination before the Magistrates, I beg to say that many questions were put to me; I admit, however, that I did make a statement before the Magistrate, but it is not true; and thus, in order to avoid suspicion of one crime, I was obliged to confess to others. One of the presumptions against me is, that I was intimately acquainted with the unfortunate deceased; I solemnly declare, however, that I saw Mrs. Jeffs but four times in my life: the first time I saw her was at the house of her son, Mr. Knight, in Anderson's-place, Cornwall-road - the second time was at his house in Cursitor-street, when she told me she had invited Mr. Knight's daughter and my sister to take tea with her, and she asked me to accompany them; the third time I saw Mrs. Jeffs was when I accompanied Knight's son and his sister to the house in Montague-place: the last time I called with Knight alone, and believe he alone went into the house. I never saw Mrs. Jeffs after the month of July last; Knight and I went together to Montague-place, when he went into the house, I believe, to ask for money - I saw her upon that occasion, which was some time in last July, and I never saw her after. I took the name of Edwards to avoid detection, knowing that I had unfortunately rendered myself liable to the law, in consequence of what I had done at Mr. Duncombe's; under such circumstances, I should have been more than insane to have gone to Montague-place, where most likely I should have been refused admittance. As to my dress, and the circumstances of suspicion attached to the coat, I am enabled, on the clearest proofs, to answer that part of the charge. Mrs. Williams has a son employed by a surgeon who resides in Blackfriars-road; that gentleman gave him a coat which was damaged, and the stains upon which were said to be occasioned by blood - in my distress I borrowed this coat, and unfortunately for me, the very worst construction was put upon a circumstance purely accidental; in the same way the blood upon the shirt-collar was made use of as a proof against me, and the waistcoat was said also to be stained with blood; as to the stain upon the collar, what becomes of it when it is proved in evidence that I cut my thumb, and tied it with tape, which is marked with blood? So little did the circumstance of cutting my thumb occupy my thoughts, that when I was questioned about it by the officers, I totally forgot how or when I did it, and said it was done cutting wood. With respect to the razor-sheath, I beg leave, my Lord and Gentlemen, to draw your particular attention - I trust you will examine this part of the evidence carefully, and say if any one could swear to a razor-sheath, of which there are hundreds, of a similar make and description, sold daily in the metropolis; it is a common razor-sheath, and has nothing whatever about it to mark as peculiar: with respect to the edge of it being notched, I can answer it - one day, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210026"/>I was alone in Mitre-street, sitting in a state of melancholy, quite unconscious of what I did, I cut the razor-sheath bit by bit, with the razor, and flung them into the fire. I am most anxious to satisfy you as to where I was on the evening of the 31st of December - Mary Parker and I left home that night, and proceeded together to Blackfriars-bridge; I went to the gallery of the Adelphi Theatre in the Strand, and remained there till the performances were over - I then joined her in Poppin's-court, soon after twelve o'clock; the bells of St. Bride's were then ringing what they call the new year in. It has been said if I was at the Theatre I could prove the fact, but it was impossible for me to do so, situated as I then was. It is not pretended that I am a hardened murderer, and if not, is it likely I could be cheerful as usual, and have supported a falsehood by bringing Mary Parker to the Theatre? My possession of money, soon after the commission of the offence of which I am accused, is another charge against me - I am here obliged to remind you of my own delinquencies; I had by a criminal act obtained a supply for my pressing wants; and here, Gentlemen, I must do justice to the unhappy woman who lived with me, by declaring that she was totally unacquainted with many of my offences, and that I carefully concealed them from her. - There is one point I cannot pass unnoticed, I mean the letters said to be written by me in prison - the first letter I wrote - the second I know nothing about, and the third was written under these circumstances: - Mr. Vickery came to me in prison, and asked if I knew a Mr. Morris, who I understood had called at the prison; I recollected a person of that name, at the White Lion public-house, Wych-street, and under that impression I wrote the third letter. Gentlemen, without another remark, I leave my fate in your hands, under the impression that you will throw aside any prejudice that may have been excited in your minds against me. The man who is dishonest may not be cruel; the thief may shrink from the crime of murder, and I can with truth declare that this has always been the state of my mind; no propensity to cruelty, or desire to commit violence on any human being, ever entered my mind among the many evils I have committed. I do solemnly declare before God, that I am innocent of the crime of which I am now accused.</p>
               <p>JOHN SELLS. The prisoner and Charlotte came to lodge with me about the middle of August, and left the middle of October; they were nine weeks with me, and then went to Mrs. Williams'; while with me he had a newspaper nearly every morning, and was always anxious about it; my daughter generally fetched it for him.</p>

            . I am a chemist, and have a shop in Blackfriars-road. Nicholas Halford was in my employ; I gave him a blue frock-coat, which I had left off wearing some time, but my servant wore it when he brewed; it was stained with wort all over when I gave it to the boy - I am not aware of any other stains, but possibly there might be, for when I am in London I dissolve camphor myself; it was most likely stained with muriatic acid, used with spirits of wine in dissolving camphor, but I have so many coats which I use on that occasion, I cannot say whether this was one, but it frequently happens to my coats; the wort would make it feel very stiff and clammy, but it is easily washed out with soap and water; I have no doubt this is the coat - I can perceive, from the feel of it, that saccharum matter is now in the cloth.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago did your servant wear it to brew in? A. It has been worn in March and October, for the last two or three years: we did not brew last year till near Christmas, I think - he wore it then; I gave it to Halford within a few days of Christmas: saccharum matter does not stain - it gives it a clammy feel; muriatic acid stains: I cannot see any such marks on it now; camphorated muriatic acid would take out the colour entirely.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 13th of February, at seven o'clock, I was called by my apprentice, and in consequence of what he told me, I got up, and examined my premises; I went to my shop, and found it in a very confused state; I found the warehouse window had been broken open - the warehouse leads from the shop; it is under the same roof as the dwelling-house: I found the warehouse shutter broken open - it appeared to have been broken by a centre-bit; the window was open - it is a window that slides back; anybody who broke the shutter open, could push it back: I found the warehouse in a confused state - the things all laying about; I missed two sides of bacon, three Cheshire cheeses and some loaves of sugar, out of the shop: the till was broken open, and a sovereign, about 30s. in silver, and 4s. in copper taken out - they were there overnight, and the till locked; the till and money were gone - I missed a drum of figs from the shop window, and two loaves of show sugar; I missed from the warehouse some curd-soap, some sugar, half a tub of butter, and two new sacks; and from the shop, two pair of scissors, a bacon-knife, and a quantity of shot: the sacks were marked"F. Tootell, Edgware;" I missed a leg of mutton from the cellar adjoining the warehouse: I do not know whether the apprentice's things were in the shop; I also missed some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210027"/>harley-sugar, and 3 lbs. or 4 lbs. of tobacco. On the afternoon of the 13th of February, I went with the constable to search Weedon's house at Finchley, and found nearly a side of bacon laying on the floor, which I identified as my property - he was not at home, but his wife and children were: I knew the bacon by having myself cut a piece out of the shoulder a month previous: I had seen it in the shop the evening before, between five and six o'clock; on looking up the chimney, I found a loaf of sugar with my private mark on it, made by my apprentice: I left the constable to search further, and saw him find some figs in a box, in the same room; the drum was not found - he found some barley-sugar in the same box, and a piece of Dutch cheese in another box - there was some tea in a cannister, on the mantel-piece; I went out, and in three or four minutes saw Weedon coming towards his house - I secured him, and gave him to the constable.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Tootell. On the 13th of February, I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, went into the shop, and found it in the state I have heard my master describe, I alarmed him. I had a blue coat and hat hanging in the warehouse, the night before - there was an oil-skin cover to it; the hat and coat were missing; I missed two sides of bacon, which I had seen hanging in the shop the night before: I had not noticed a piece being cut off the shoulder; I found the warehouse - shutter broken off at the corner, and the window open - the warehouse and shop are under the same roof - any one who broke the shutter could push the window back with his hand; the shutter appeared to have been bored with a centre-bit and then broken off. There was snow on the ground, and I traced footsteps from the house up the garden to the summer-house; at the corner of the garden there appeared footsteps of three or four persons - they were quite visible. I found a quantity of sugar laying in the path, and some in a tub by the side of it, in the path. I found a Japan tea cannister empty, in the summer-house - it was in the shop the night before; there were two cakes of curd-soap in the summer-house - I cannot identify them, but we had curd-soap in the shop. I then traced the footsteps up the field adjoining the garden, up to another summer-house at the end of the field, and in that summer-house, I found my blue cloth coat, laying on the floor - there is a sort of cellar under the summer-house; I got down there and found half a tub of butter, with a little green bag over it, sticking to it, without any string - that bag did not belong to master; I had seen the half tub of butter in the warehouse the night before. I traced the footsteps down as far as Brook-lane, which is in the road from Finchley, towards Edgware; some paper was shewn to me in master's shop after Weedon was apprehended, which I can be certain was in the shop window the night before, I had enclosed a show loaf of sugar in it, there was a mark of my own making on it; some Dutch cheese was shewn to me, which I can swear was in the shop the night before.</p>

               <p>JAMES TOW. I am constable of Hendon. I accompanied two other officers to search the house of Waters, at East Barnet.

             (a prisoner). I know both the prisoners; I saw them both on a Tuesday night - I do not know the day of the month - it was a snowy night; I went to see them at Weedon's house - his wife and children were there; Godfrey went with me to Weedon's house, and another person went with us - it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; Weedon said, "Will you go and take a walk?" Godfrey said he did not care; then said Weedon,"We will walk over to Edgware if you like:" we all four went, and got to Edgware about seven o'clock; we went into a barn, and laid down - that was a little after seven; I do not know the prosecutor's premises - if I was taken there now, I should not know them again; we staid in the barn till about a quarter past twelve o'clock, when all four got up and went out - we went across the fields (before that the other man and Weedon quarrelled); we were going to a shoe-shop at first, but we did not - we went to a grocer's shop, as Weedon took us to the wrong door (there was some hay in the barn - Picton took that); Picton and Godfrey got the shutter open, and got in - I do not know what they opened it with; Weedon and I staid in the privy at the time - I do not know whether Godfrey had any thing in his hand; Picton had a centre-bit; I did not see the shutter broken - I heard them at work at it; they got in between the top of the bar - Picton and Godfrey got in; they went into the shop, and put some moist sugar out to us; Weedon stood with me; then he put out some butter, tea, cheese, and bacon, and then they brought some figs and loaf sugar; and then they brought the till out, with 1s. 6d. in halfpence in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the things were got out, what became of Picton and Godfrey? A. They came out; they put the things up, and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go? A. Across the fields; the house was broken into behind, in the garden; we went round the garden-path, and returned the same way; there was a little bit of a place at the top of the garden, and we put all the things down there as we got them out - we left some moist sugar there; that is all I know: we went down the field; there is a summer-house at the end of the field; we put half a tub of butter there, and threw a blue coat in at the window of the summer-house - I do not know where the butter was put; Weedon put that in; Weedon put a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210028"/>green bag in his frock-pocket, when he first went out - I should know it again; we all went home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go home the same way? A. Yes, the same way as we came; Weedon went to his house, and we went down to Godfrey's; Picton brought a leg of mutton out to the window, and gave it to me; I took it up the garden with the rest of the things; we eat it when we got home - we dined off it - it was dressed at Godfrey's house on Finchley-common; Weedon came down to Godfrey's house, and fetched some barley-sugar, and a little tea from there - we had taken it there; Weedon carried the bacon and other things to his house himself, when he went home at first; and the other things were carried to Godfrey's -(looking at the bag) that is the bag Weedon had in his pocket; Picton, I, and Godfrey, went to Godfrey's house - Weedon went to his own house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did you turn evidence? A. I told this before the Justice the first time I was there; I wished to save my own neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEEDON. Q. Do you say that bag is mine; I have got one just like it? A. I will take my oath that is the bag he put into his pocket when he came out.</p>

               <p>WEEDON'S Defence. I did not break into the house, nor tell him to go to Edgware; the bag which I have got, is at home now.</p>
               <p>GODFREY'S Defence. That man said he would swear to any thing to get any body off; he said he would take an oath for any thing, to screen any body. I was at work on the road to Finchley; some things were found in my house; he said he would take this oath that he found them in the road. I am innocent - I was at home, and in bed at the time.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. You say the things were taken to Godfrey's? A. Weedon took a side of bacon, and a loaf of sugar, to his own house - it was about a quarter-past five o'clock in the morning; I do not remember his taking any thing else; the other things went to Godfrey's - only one loaf of sugar was brought to Godfrey's - that remained there; I was never in trouble before in my life - I never quarrelled with Godfrey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GODFREY. He took me before Dr. Owen, for striking him; if I had been guilty, I could have gone away - I heard of it, but went home, and went to bed, after Weedon was taken; I was not taken till Monday last.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Martin's parish. On the 22d of January, about ten minutes to six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was brought into the watch-house by three watchmen, but such was the confusion at the time, I cannot say who - I searched him, and found a latch-key in his pocket, and found a pair of small scissors - about ten minutes after he was given into my custody, a great coat was produced on the arm of one of the watchman, (I think Jackson,) in the pocket of it I found two candlesticks, a black lace veil, and a lady's fur tippet - some silver spons and things were brought in by a watchman; I produce the things found since, which the watchman brought in; I found this china-box in his pocket; while I was searching him, I perceived something fall, and picked up this phospherous bottle - it came down the chimney - he threw it up, I suppose, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. A key and pair of scissors are all you found on his person? A. I believe so, but in the confusion, I cannot say whether I found anything else.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my box stands in Mr. Oxley's doorway. On the 22d of January, about twenty minutes to six o'clock, I heard some glass break inside his house; I directly came out of my box, and went to the private door in Banbury-court, to see if it was fast - I found it fast - I then went to the rear of the house, and found nothing particular out of its place: I began to put my box away, and as I moved it, a man came out at the private door, and walked up the passage, I said, "Here, I want to speak to you," - that was not the prisoner - I ran to the door, which was left ajar, pulled it too, sprang my rattle, and hallooed, Stop thief! he ran as hard as he could into Hart-street, and turned to the right; I lost sight of him in a second; I stood with the door in my hand, and sprang my rattle, till another watchman came up; another person came and took my place; I went to the front and alarmed Mr. Oxley, and while I was gone the person was taken; I searched the house all over, and found a hat which fitted the prisoner at Bow-street; there was a handkerchief in it - they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt that the man who came out at the door heard the cry? A. Certainly - that man had time to throw things away; he ran down Hart-street - I heard the spoons thrown down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is Castle-street from Mr. Oxley's house? A.

            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of February, about two o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Macclesfield-street, and heard Dyson cry, Watch! I ran towards the sound - heard the cry repeated, and as I approached near the window, I saw two men coming along, and saw something drop from them; but what I could not exactly perceive - I thought it looked like papers - the wind blew some of them towards the curb. I took the prisoners. Dyson called out that thieves had broken into his house, and that one had a light coat on. I said I had got them - I took them back to his house; he was leaning out of his window, and said, "Those are the men - I can swear to them." They heard that - some Islington watchmen came to my assistance, and I left them in their charge, while I returned to where I stopped them, and picked up some papers. We took the prisoners to the watch-house. I returned to my beat. Sheldrake called me; we went and searched the spot where I had taken them. I looked about with my lantern, and picked up a small book; and on the threshold of a door, No. 24, Macclesfield-street, I found a file; this was about one hundred yards from the house, and on the window-cill I found part of another file; I gave them to the officer. When I first saw the prisoners, they were walking; but when I got nearer to them, they stopped, and the papers dropped from them - they said they had done nothing - there is a gas-light nearly opposite to where I took them, and one within a few yards of the prosecutor's house; there are three between the spot and the prosecutor's house, which would enable him to see any body who jumped out of window. I could not see which of them dropped the papers; but it was one of them, I am certain.</p>

            . I lost nothing of my own. I examined the closet after Craven left, and saw a book similar to this, and the large file. I think that was on the 12th; there was nothing else in the parlour - the watch-house is nearly half a mile from where the papers were found.</p>
               <p>The prisoners put in a written Defence, as follows: - "On the 14th of February we went to visit a relative in Ball's-pond-road, and on returning to our residence in the neighbourhood of Old-street, when we came through City gardens, the watchman took hold of us, and charged us with robbing the prosecutor's premises; feling ourselves innocent we surrendered willingly - at our examination the prosecutor said he saw us both come out of the parlour window, which he thought must have been left open, the shutters having only been closed the night before. We boldly denying his assertion, and being taken some distance from the spot, we trust will prove our innocence.</p>

I was knocked down; directly I got up some of those men knocked me down - I was kicked outside the door, into the kennel. Costar was served in the same way, I believe - I was taken home. I could not go home without assistance. I was kicked when on the ground - there were six or seven,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210031"/>all on me at once. I was bruised about the body, and struck on my nose, which bled. I have not seen my handkerchief since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. By whom were you taken home? A. My wife, and two or three men; an officer took my companion home; we did not go home together; I saw no officer. I was never at this public-house, above twice in my life. The landlord said, "D-n the window! never mind the window; I have got plenty of money to pay for more." I am sure two panes of glass were broken; I had no hat on. The prisoner was not very sober, nor very drunk - I never spoke to him before, but I had seen him going backward and forward to the Lion and Lamb - he was taken in Playhouse-yard. I had no doctor, but was obliged to stop at home two days from work - I had no money about me - the prisoner was not so drunk as not to know what he was about; he was very violent - I made no resistance. I did not see Costar interfere - I did not fight at all. I would give 6d. for the handkerchief. The landlord is not here; he was in the bar when I was knocked against the window.</p>

            . I lodge with Perry. I went with him to the Lion and Lamb, and called for a quartern of gin; the prisoner was at the bar; and while I was drinking, he threw his bag in Perry's face, and struck him with it in the face. Perry said, "Don't do that, Bill, for I know you." He then struck him a violent blow with his fist; his head went through one square of glass, and his elbow through another - he fell, and the prisoner took the handkerchief off his neck; he whistled, and five or six came came out; we were both knocked down, and kicked about - I got up and was knocked down again. I was hustled and dragged out into Golden-lane; then some of them got round me, and some round Perry; they knocked us down, and kicked us while we were down. I saw the prisoner take Perry's handkerchief off; but could not see who he gave it to - it was passed to some of the men: the landlord was present - he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. No money was taken from the prosecutor? A. He lost some money; he could not say who took it; and I lost 3s. from my right-hand trousers' pocket; but whether I was robbed of it, or lost it in the fall, I cannot say. I did not see any attempt to rifle Perry's pockets, or to rob either of us of money; the prisoner took Perry's handkerchief off directly he fell. I swear I saw him give it to some one; but who, I cannot say; and within three or four minutes, we were hustled into the street; they moved Perry down a court. I was beat so, the officer was obliged to take me away; I could not get on my legs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner live in Playhouse-yard? A. He lived at the back of a house, right opposite Perry's, on the second floor; but he was not to be found in the neighbourhood, till the night he was taken. I have not indicted the prisoner. I attempted to lift Perry up, but these men came out of the room, and knocked me down; the landlord came, and opened the door, while they dragged us out.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the landlord interfere to prevent this? A. Oh, no; I consider him as bad as the prisoner - he stood there and saw it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you tell the officer who took you home, what had happened? A. Yes; I told him I lost 3s., but could not say I was robbed of it - I don't say I was robbed.</p>

Earl-street, On the 10th of February, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was standing with my back against a butcher's door in the Edgware-road; the two prisoners came up, and asked why I stood there - I told them I had had a few words with the person I lodged with, and did not feel inclined to go home; they asked me to go home and sleep with them that night; I told them I would not go, for I thought they had got some persons behind them - there were two men behind them: they said the men were nothing to them - that they were going to sleep together, and I should be welcome to sleep with them; I was glad to embrace the opportunity, and walked with them up Edgware-road, along Earl-street, till I came to a street where there is a public-house, called the Champion, at the corner; we went by that public-house a great distance, to a place where there were very few lamps, and a very bad light: I asked how much farther they had to go - they told me to the further end of that street, which one of them pointed to; I began to feel timid, and said I would not go any farther: I was going to cross the street, when I was pushed into a great place that was dug for a sewer, and one of them laid hold of my cloak - I hallooed out, "Pray don't take my cloak;" they dragged it till the ribbon gave way which fastened it round my waist, and the other ribbon which tied it round my neck, and got it off; I held on with both my hands as long as I was able, and one of them beat my wrist; my hands were beat till they were all colours; Ryan laid hold of my cloak, and it was Bryant who beat my hands; they got my cloak - I followed them down the street as fast as I could, calling Stop thief! no person came to my assistance; I lost sight of them, and did not see them any more that night. On the Tuesday following I saw Thompson, the officer, bring Ryan to High-street Office, and on the Wednesday I saw Bryant at the office - I had never seen them before, to my knowledge; I was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with them, and can swear to them - I took particular notice of them, as I thought it was kind for them to offer to take me home to sleep, being a stranger. I had had some words with the woman I lodge with, and did not like to go in; the woman keeps a dairy - I lodge about one hundred yards from the butcher's shop, and go out washing. I had gone round to the pawnbroker's on the Tuesday, to search for my cloak, and found it at Fairlam's; I then told Thompson, the officer, of it, and he knew the persons I described to him.</p>

On Tuesday morning about ten o'clock, the prosecutrix came to me; she complained of being robbed, described the girls, and said the cloak was pawned in the name of Ryan; I went to No. 10, Nightingale-street, and found Ryan in the first floor back room; I said, "Poll, I want you;" I knew her before - she asked what for; I said for a robbery; she asked if it was for a man or woman - I said a woman; the answer she made was,"B-gg-r you;" she was going to state something, but I said it was a serious charge againest her, and if she said anything further I should be obliged to state it in evidence against her. As I took her to the office we passed Fairlam's shop - I stopped there to tell him to come to the office, and as soon as she saw me stop, she said, "I see what has done me, pledging it in my own name;" I cautioned her again not to say anything, and took her to the office. The prosecutrix described Bryant; I informed another officer, having occasion to go out myself - I afterwards went with him, and directed him to a house in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove, where he found her, and brought her out to me; I knew them both before - they are women of the town: I did not know the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH LOCKER re-examined. This is my cloak; I described the marks on it before I saw it - two of the atraps are not stitched, and I put pins in it; I bought it in November, 1826.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BRYANT. Q. Do you mean to say that I struck you? A. Yes, you beat me over my wrists, and over my hand; I am sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>BRYANT's Defence. I and Ryan were walking up the road about ten o'clock on Sunday night, and saw her standing against the door, very much intoxicated, with three or four boys round her; we told her to come away from them - we came along; she stopped at a public-house, said she would give us somthing to drink, and pulled out a bad halfpenny, and said she was sorry that would get nothing; I told her to go home - she said she had no where to go; I gave Ryan the key to go home with her, as I was not going directly myself; she would make me go with her, and as I turned up Exeter-street, as it was very dark, I said I would not go that way, but she would go that way; I said the other street was nearest- we came to a place where there was a plank; I stood while they both went across, and saw her fall; I cannot say whether Ryan knocked her down or not; I heard her halloo, and she said she was pinching her - I heard her say she was in a fit; I saw her hitting her with the key; she said, "Don't take my cloak;" I saw her take the cloak and run away - I ran after her; she was out of my sight in a moment; I did not know she meant to rob her. When I came back the prosecutrix was gone, and when I got home I found Ryan in bed; I asked what she had done with the cloak - she made no answer; in the morning, when I got up, I saw it under the bed, and said, "Here is the cloak;" she said Yes; it was all over mud, and she asked me to brush it - I would not. I went home to my sister's and told her of it, but she advised me to say nothing of it; I returned at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - she was out, and the cloak was gone - I went out again, and found her at home at tea when I returned; I asked her what she had done with the cloak - she said it was nothing to me - that she should have to answer for it. I went next day to my sister's, and she told me to say nothing about it; the officer came next day; I told Ryan I would tell the truth before the Magistrate, and she said it I did it would be worse for me, and told me to keep my own counsel.</p>
               <p>RYAN's Defence. What she has said is a wicked falsehood; we met the prosecutrix, and went down Edgware-road; she agreed as well as me to take her down that place, and I could bring witnesses to prove she herself look the money that was lent on the cloak, and took it down to a young man who is in Clerkenwell; I did pawn it certainly - she brushed it; she knew more about it than I did, and never left me a moment; she is as much in it as I am - I only had enough of the money to get my tea with.</p>

            . I am conductor of the Bow-street patrol. On the 5th of January, about a quarter to eight o'clock at night, I and Wilson met the prisoners coming down Quaker-street, Spitalfields, in company together, each had a bundle in his hand; I took Glover - Wright directly threw down his bundle and ran away; Wilson ran after him - I picked up Wright's bundle and asked Glover how he came by those bundles; he said they were clothes belonging to his father; that he had been to his aunt's in Long-alley, who gave them to him for his father, who had left them there; I asked what Wright was, who had run away - he said he was his brother; I asked what made him run away if they were his father's clothes; he said he was so timid, he always ran away. I had never seen him in custody before - Wilson returned without taking him; I took Glover to a public-house, and found in his hat a shaw I and some feathers, which he said were his mother's; I took him to the watch-house, and then went and took Wright at his father's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you tell Glover that what he said would be used against him? A. No. nor did I either threaten or promise him - he said he lived with his father.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DARBY. I live at Hopworthy, near Tiverton, Devonshire. I was in town in January, and sold a quantity of butter; I received four 10l., and two 5l. Bank notes from Mr. Edwards, of Crawford-street, on the afternoon of the 10th of January; I took no account of the numbers, but I believe Edwards did; I had no other Bank notes in my possession; I met a man having the appearance of a farmer, just about Holborn-bridge, at the end of Fleet-market- he began a conversation with me; I only went a few yards with him; I met him again after that, by accident, as far as I knew - I had made no appointment; I met him somewhere about the church, coming up to the Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street; he joined in conversation with me again - he proposed to go out of town by the same coach with me; we went and drank some brandy and water at an inn near the New Post-office, in Newgate-street, and while we were drinking there the prisoner came in, and appeared to me to be rather tipsy; when he came in he asked the farmer and I if we had seen a lady in the inn - we said No; he said he had been with a lady overnight, and meant to make her his wife on Monday next, and said he had an old uncle who always said he would never give him more than 1s., and now he was dead, and had left him all that he was worth, which would be 350l. a-year, besides a great deal of ready cash - that he had come to London, and drawn 450l. of it; he pulled out both coin and papers, which appeared to be Bank of England notes and sovereigns; he kept flourishing them about - I persuaded him to put them into his pocket a good many times, and the farmer persuaded him also, quite as much as I did; the prisoner said he had got plenty of money, and would lend 50l. to any man who would give him stamped paper for it - he did not mind that; this continued for about half an hour, and then the farmer and I left the room; the farmer told him he did not know the value of money, or the getting of it, and he had better put it into his pocket; it did not appear that the farmer and him were acquainted; the prisoner said he lived a hundred miles from town.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you and the farmer left the room? A. Yes; the prisoner said he would go with us - I was going to the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-street; I did not know the way, never having been there in my life; I was going to book my place by the Company's coach to Bristol; the prisoner knew where I was going, and said he would go with me, and pay my fare to Bristol. I told him I did not want any body to pay my fare; when we got out, we passed a street between the Castle and Falcon and the New Post Office, and went into a narrow street, as the farmer said it was the nearest way to the Spread Eagle; we went on a good way up several turnings; the farmer wanted to go into another house, to speak to somebody; we all three went in - it was a public-house; the farmer called for brandy and water, which the servant-girl brought; the farmer walked down stairs soon after he came into the house, leaving the prisoner and I together; we sat there for two or three minutes - he then returned, sat down, and drank with us; the farmer then took out some chalk from his pocket, and made a mark on the table - the prisoner at that time had his money in his pocket - he did not explain what he meant by the chalk mark; the farmer then took some papers out of his pocket, which I understood to be bills, and threw them into a hat which stood on the table; the prisoner directly did the same - he threw them into the same hat; then the farmer put a halfpenny under his hand, and said to the prisoner."What will you have, man or woman?" the prisoner spoke, but what he said I do not know - they did that several times, and the prisoner said, "You are gentlemen I see - I dare say you are gentlemen; you are men of property;" (meaning both of us) the farmer said, "Yes, I an Esquire, and this gentleman is an Esquire too;" he repeated that many times, and then the farmer said, "Why don't you show that you are a man of property? take out your money, and let him see that you are a man of property too:" I did not take it out for a good bit - he repeated that several times - the prisoner said nothing then; I at last wanted change for a 5l. note, and took my money out of my watch-pocket - I had it all in a roll, and before I had power to speak, the farmer turned his hand, snatched the money off the table, and said, "You have winned - the money is your's," and threw the money into the hat; the prisoner took up the hat, and both of them ran away instantly - it was done in a second; I had laid no wager, or bet whatever, nor had I any intention of betting - I had not spoken a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210035"/>word about it at all; the farmer was nearest to the door, and ran out first, I think - the prisoner was making his way out as fast as possible; I ran and jumped after him, and caught hold of his coat-flap, as he was going down stairs - he dragged me down the stairs, but I held him fast; I caught hold of his collar with my right hand, and his coattail with the left - he made his way through a passage out into the street as fast as he could, I still holding him; two lusty young men then came up, and asked what was the matter; I told them that rogue had robbed me of 50l.; they said, "You come on with us, and we will make him give you every farthing of your money:" I said, "Why not give me my money here, without going any further?" they then said they should go into some private house, and not do it in the public street; I went on some distance, still keeping hold of the prisoner - they wished me once to let him go, that he should not be made a spectacle of; I refused, and they went into a house - they wanted me to go up stairs; I refused at first, but I did not know what to do, and I did go up four or five stairs; when we were up, one of the men went and opened a chamber door, and the room was hung with clothes on lines; I said I would not go in there, for they had brought me into a bad house, and I believed they were a set of thieves altogether; my speaking pretty loud, a woman came out from between the wet linen, and, as soon as they saw her, one of them pulled the chamber door fast; I rushed back from the door, pulling the prisoner with me - I was not shut into the room; when the door was fastened the prisoner said, "I will give you your money;" I was then in the passage - it was rather darkish there; he put his hand into his pocket, and put a roll of paper into my left hand; I said, "This is not my bills;" I knew my own paper by the colour - it was whiter than that was; I said, "I will not have these, give me my own bills - I want none of your's;" one of the other two immediately went behind me, made a wrench at my hand, and tore it away from the prisoner's collar; the prisoner instantly ran down stairs as fast as he could; the other man on the side of me, took me round the legs, and threw me down on the floor, one of them on each side of me; and, as I laid on the floor, I heard the street door shut too, hard; I got on my legs again as fast as I could, and ran down stairs; I opened the door very quick, looked to the right, and saw the prisoner running as fast as he could, forty or fifty yards off - I ran as fast as I could, and rather gained ground on him at first, but at last I was exhausted, and obliged to give up; I cried "A thief!" a man named Payne then came up, and said he was an officer; I told him that was the rogue who had robbed me, and pointed to him - he was in sight; I saw him in custody in about an hour and a half; Payne went and shewed him to me - I said he was the man; I never saw the farmer afterwards, nor the two men who pretended to be my friends - I lost them as they ran down stairs; I gave Payne the papers which were left in my hands; my notes were produced to me - I had no mark on them, and did not know the numbers, but they were rolled up exactly as mine were, and were the same amounts, four of 10l., and two of 5l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How old are you? A. Fifty. I have lived thirty years where I do now. I have been to town twice before this time; I was here about two years before. I have been up three times in about seven years. I stop at the Castle and Falcon. I am a farmer, and sell butter to people in town. I don't deal in tobacco - I use it sometimes - I may buy two ounces when a friend comes in; I do not deal in spirits - I live thirty miles from the sea-coast; I send my butter to town. I had come up on the Tuesday, and was going back on this night (Friday) - I had not dined, and was quite sober; it might be between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon - I breakfasted about twelve: I saw him in custody just between light and dark - between four and five. I suppose I was an hour and a half, or better, in their company; I cannot speak to half an hour; I suppose it was about two o'clock when this happened - it was on the 11th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would not prosecute him, if you got back your money? A. I don't know; I might be asked the question, but I have not done it. I did not say, I would not prosecute - they offered me money to make it up, but I would not take it. I cannot recollect saying I would not prosecute if I got my money - I was so flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a perfect recollection of all that passed? A. Not all; for I was much hurried when the business took place; the farmer said he lived down Bristol way. I never said I produced my money at the first public-house. I persuaded the prisoner to take care of his money there; I did not toss up, nor call out, "man or woman" - I had not a halfpenny in my hand - I had only a few shillings, and a sovereign besides the 50l. I do not recollect saying, if I got my money and expences, I would not prosecute - money was offered me - I don't know what I said about it. I was in a coach with one of the officers. I don't know what I said there, I was so much hurried; it was the next day - I was more hurried then, than when it happened; considering now I had risked my life with thieves; a woman was in the coach with the officer; they said she was the prisoner's sister; and there was a man in the coach; this was before we went before the Magistrate. I believe I rode a little way with them after the examination, as I was going the same way; they took me where they were going; I don't know where it was - I was never in the place before - I believe they drove to this gaol. Only the officer and the prisoner were in the coach with me then.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were in the coach with the officer, the woman and man, did you say, you did not believe the young man in custody was the man who had given you any notes; but it was the farmer? A. No; I never said such a word; for the prisoner gave me them himself. I did not say, I was an old fool for tossing with a strange man, nor any thing like it - not a word of the sort came from my lips; nor did I say, I did not believe he intended to rob me, or that the flash notes were his, or any thing like it; for I did think he intended to rob me. I did not say, I tossed for a glass of brandy and water, which led to further betting, and I at last tossed for 50l.; or that I was afraid the farmer would cheat the young man - I said nothing like it. I said no such thing in the coach, or any where - I only said, they had been offering me money to make it up - I said nothing of the sort, at any time, to my recollection. Payne was in the coach with me; he had run after the prisoner, and returned, saying he had got him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210036"/>and brought me back my money; that was half or three quarters of an hour after I pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you on the coach with the woman? A. She asked me to go down in the coach, and I went; I went alone with her from Guildhall to her house, and as I came back the officer and a man were in the coach; I believe the house the wet clothes were in is a public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had no notes but what you received for the butter? A. No; I never was concerned in smuggling - or dealt in contraband goods; I farm land of about 400l. a year; this is the third time I have been in London; I know very few streets in London, for I do not stop above two or three days; I was never in town till four or five years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen the farmer and the two others since? A. No: The farmer told me where he lived - but I forget where; it was somwhere about fifty miles from town on the Bristol-road - I should know him again.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 11th of January, I did not see the prosecutor, but heard a cry of Stop thief! about half-past two o'clock as I was coming up London-wall, and just at the corner of Cripplegate-buildings, I saw the prisoner turn the corner of Hart-street - I pursued him, and in turning the corner of Monk well-street I lost sight of him; my son followed faster than me: he turned into Foster-lane, and then into Maiden-lane, into the warehouse of Mr. Nicholls; I saw my son standing at Nicholl's door - he said the man was in there; I looked, and saw him talking to young Mr. Nicholls, and I saw him go into the back warehouse: I left my son at the door, and went to Payne, whom I saw come out of a public-house door, with the prosecutor; I took him to Nicholl's warehouse - the prisoner was there, sitting in the back office; we both said, "You are the man we want;" I immediately saw him put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and heard something drop from him - we took him up from his seat; I pulled the chair away on which he sat, and took up some paper, screwed up, which, upon opening, was four 10l. and two 5l. notes - I have had them ever since; he was taken to the Compter: I turned to Darby, and asked what property he had lost - he said four 10l. and two 5l. notes; he had not seen them then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in a coach with the prisoner and Darby at any time? A. Yes; we took him to Newgate, when he was committed, and I went in the coach from the Compter to Guildhall; another officer, the prisoner, and his sister were in the coach; the prosecutor was not in the coach then, but he was as we came to Newgate - that is the only time I was in a coach with Darby: some questions were put to Darby, but I told him he had better hold his tongue; he said something in answer to the questions, but what I do not know: I believe he said he was an old fool for losing his money - I heard him say nothing about having tossed for it. I heard him say at another time, that somebody got him in conversation, and got him to drink brandy and water; that was not in the prisoner's presence.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 11th of January I was in my house in Grub-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran out, and saw Darby after I came out, and saw the prisoner run past the place - Darby and several others were running after him, but he was ahead of all; Darby came up in Silver-street - I said, "have you lost anything?" he seemed exhausted, and said he had been robbed; I said I would go after the party: I received information, and went to Mr. Nicholl's counting-house, and saw Beck pick up a parcel of notes, containing four of 10l. and two of 5l. - I was searching the prisoner at the time he dropped them. I found two 5l. Bank of England notes, and a country note on him; they have since been delivered up- I found a letter on him, some bills, and a card of his direction, "Robinson, cooper, &amp;c., No. 5, Goswell-street, Clerkenwell" - I found his wife lived there. The prosecutor gave me these flash notes after the prisoner was in custody - I found a letter on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>These flash notes being read, were headed "Bank of Elegance," and engaging to cut hair, &amp;c. in a superior stile, or forfeit 50l., and were in the exact form of a Bank of England note. The letter found on the prisoner, was dated Liverpool, the 5th of January, desiring the prisoner to come to Liverpool with witnesses to prove an alibi in a case to be tried there; but it not relating to the matter in question, was not fully read.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to WILLIAM PAYNE. Q. Were you in the coach with Darby and the prisoner? A. I was in a coach when I took the prisoner out of the Compter - Darby was not with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not in a coach at any time with the prosecutor and prisoner? A. No, neither going to the Alderman nor coming to Newgate; I was not in the coach after I came to Guildhall - I was on the coach-box coming to Newgate; the other officer was in the coach: the country note found on the prisoner was for 1l. - I found no sovereign nor silver on him; there were three bills of exchange, at three month's date, all over-due.</p>

On Friday, the 1st of February, I was out of place - I went to Mile-end, and in returning, in Whitechapel-road, almost opposite the <placeName id="t18280221-27-crimeloc139">London Hospital</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been out of place? A. About a month; Mr. Lighten-house lived in Essex: I was lodging in Kepple-mews Bedford-square - I came to see a friend there till I could get a place; I went to Whitechapel to see a man who had come from the same place as me, with a friend, who left me, and I came down the road: I got there about one o'clock - I went from Kepple-mews; I went round by Mourfields - a person showed me the way there: I met the prisoner as I returned - it had not struck seven o'clock, I am sure; it was before seven; it might be a quarter before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after seven? A. It was not - it was dark; the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending the day? A. I had been walking about with this man, as his business lay, to get his load for his waggon, he being a waggoner - I went about with him: I dined with him at the Red Lion public-house, Whitechapel, but went to no other public-house - we might have three pots of beer between us and some other men - I drank very little, and was quite sober. I was so hurt by the fall, I could not get up immediately - I cut my nose and my face; when I got up the prisoner was standing there; he did not run away immediately - he wanted me to fight him for 5s. when I got up, and he would have pulled my clothes off if it had not been for the boys who came up to assist me; I said I did not want to fight, for it was a thing I never did - I wanted to know the way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of the prisoner? A. No, I had not strength to do it; the boys came and took hold of me, and he struck one of them in the face very hard, because he came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. All three of you did not manage to keep him? A. We had not strength to hold him; the boys hallooed Stop thief! the watchman was not on his beat - it was too early: I did not pursue the prisoner - he was off in an instant; he had neither shoes nor stockings on, and appeared like a begger; his trousers were torn; I cannot exactly say the colour of them: he had a blue jacket and a cap on - I swear to him by his face; the lamps were lighted. The boys led me into Whitechapel, up the road - a woman came and told the boys to take care of me, because that man would rob me very likely; she went away, and who she was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The man was a perfect stranger to you? A. Entirely. Nothing was said about fighting before I was knocked down; I understand he offered to fight me before I came to my senses, and I heard him say it after I had rather revived: a woman told the boys to take care of me, for very likely he would rob me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street, and have been there fifteen months; I have been an officer above five years. I have known the prisoner about Whitechapel between two and three years - he is an Italian, and goes about begging; he can speak English, and understands it as well as I do; I have heard him converse in English - he talks broken English, nut understands it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you apprehend him? A. I did not apprehend him; Partridge, who is not here, took him; I was at the office when he was brought there: I cannot say what money was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, Sir, as you know the prisoner, I ask, did you ever hear of his being charged with any theft? A. I certainly have - as you ask me I must answer.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Evans, of Whitechapel-road. On Friday, the 1st of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, and saw the prosecutor go up to him, and heard him say to him, "Can you tell me the nearest way to Tottenham-court-road, Bedford-square?" I had seen the prisoner a great many times before in the road; I knew him perfectly well, as a beggar - they went across to the wall - I was going to take a pair of shoes home, and when I came back I saw the prosecutor all over blood, in the road, and heard the beggar had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mrs. Evans of any business? A. She keeps a shoemaker's shop in Whitechapel-road. I was quite close to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose, from the prisoner's conduct, that he had any bad intention? A. Yes, I believed so - I did not raise any cry; I followed them as far as the London Hospital; I said to Mrs. Evans' son, who was with me,"We will watch him as far as we can - I think he is going to take his watch away;" it was not very dark, nor not very light.</p>

            . I am ten years old - (the witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the obligation of an oath). On Friday night, the 1st of February, between six and seven o'clock, I was with Langley, and live with my father and mother in Whitechapel-road, I know the prisoner perfectly well - I have seen him a great many times, he is a beggar - I saw the prosecutor and him together - I saw them just by Whitechapel work-house - I and Langley were buying a penny-worth of apples - I saw the prosecutor come one way, and the beggar the other; the prosecutor said, "Can you tell me the way to Bedford-square, Tottenham-court-road?" he said, "Come here,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210038"/>my friend, I will shew you the way;" he spoke English very well - he took him across the road, just by the side of the London-hospital; then Mary said to me, "Jem, I think the beggar will thieve the man's watch;" he went across the road, and went towards Bedford-square, Commercial-road; I did not see him do any thing to him - we watched them, then left them, and went to deliver some shoes, and as I came by, I saw Monk leading the prosecutor home, all over blood, and his nose was cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see the prisoner do any thing to the prosecutor? No; he told me he was robbed.</p>

            . I am apprentice to a cooper - I live at Stratford, and work at Bow. I was going on an errand for my master, and saw the prisoner up by the corner of the hospital - I do not recollect ever seeing him before, but I am sure he is the man; I was going by and saw him and the prosecutor up in a corner - I went up to them, and the prosecutor was bleeding at the nose, and was all over mud; he was then leaning against the wall, to support himself; the prisoner was close to him - I saw the watch-ribbon in the prisoner's hand, and am sure he had the watch in his hand; I went to take the prosecutor away, and the prisoner struck me across the face, and asked what business I had with him - he struck me with his fist, and nearly knocked me down; the prosecutor had not complained of being robbed at that moment - I told him I would lead the man away, and when he found I would not leave him, he ran away, and when to fight the prosecutor, and finding I would not go away, he ran off as quick as he could, Mrs. Evans saw him one day, and pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not get up to the prosecutor till after he was robbed? A. No - I saw the ribbon and seals in the prisoner's hand, and he had the watch in his hand: he struck me across the face; the prosecutor was leaning against the wall - a woman came up and told me to take care of the man - the prisoner made away from us three, and ran; he had on a kind of work-house trousers, speckled, a jacket of the same colour, a kind of Scotch cap, and no shoes or stockings. I am a cooper, and am eighteen years old next June - I was going to Tyler's pork-shop to fetch some soveloys.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor tipsy? A. No; he did not appear very tipsy - he was very weak from the fall - he might have been drinking.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was all over blood and leaning against the wall? A. Yes; I saw a shuffling in the Court, and went to look, and only judge of his being tipsy by his staggering; that might be from the blow - I heard him speak when we asked where he was going - I do not think he was tipsy.</p>

            . I live with my father, an auctioneer at Bow. On the night in question, I was in Whitechapel-road - I came up with Monk, and saw the prosecutor bleeding and leaning on the palisades; I had no reason to suppose him tipsy - he was staggering from the blow - the prisoner was close to him - I am sure he is the man; I went up and said I would see the prosecutor safe, as far as I went; the prisoner asked what business I had there - I saw him push the prosecutor, and ask him to fight - this was after he was bleeding; the prisoner struck Monk on the face; I saw the ribbon and three seals, and I believe from the appearance, the watch was inside his hand: it was a dark red ribbon; he was going across Baker's-row, and there we lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner wanted to fight the prosecutor? A. Yes; for 5s. - he struck Monk on the cheek; he was about three minutes wanting to fight; he did not attempt to run away while he was wanting to fight; I saw the seals, and believe from his hand being clenched, the watch was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you distinguish three seals in the dark? A. There was a gas lamp there, and he held his hand down, and the seals hung out quite plain; I was pretty close to him, and saw them, but did not see the watch, his hand being closed; I did not lay hold of him; there was only Monk and a woman who came up there - it was not Langley, but a woman of the town: I don't live in the neighbourhood - I am seldom at Mile-end; I don't know whether any patrols go that road; there was no watchman up that side; I left the prosecutor just after seven o'clock about ten minutes after; I never saw the prosecutor before; nobody laid hold of the prisoner that I saw; we cried, Stop thief! two or three times, but there was nobody on that side, it is very seldom anybody is there; I led the prosecutor as far as the Bell foundry, then Mrs. Evans took him in and cleaned him I believe; the prisoner had on a pair of speckled trousers, and a jacket something of the same colour, it was between a brown and a blue.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, who represented himself as unable to speak English, had the evidence communicated to him by an interpreter, through whom he made the following defence: -</p>

            . The prisoner has lodged in my house for the last nine or ten years. On the first of this month he came in about four o'clock in the afternoon, and did not go out again; he brought a red-herring in, roasted it by the fire, and went up to his bed-room with a bason of bot water, about five, and remained there; I went up about six to put some clean sheets on the bed; he was then on his knees, at prayer - I saw him; he backoned to me to shut the door after me; he was not out of the house all night; I went up about seven o'clock; he was then in bed; I did not see him afterwards till eight in the morning, and he did not come down stairs - he could not come down without coming through my room; I remained in the house all night; if he had come down after seven I must have known it, for I remained in my room; three other persons slept in the prisoner's room; he is a very honest, steady man, and was never out of bed after between six and seven o'clock at night; I never heard of his being charged with any theft - I never heard him speak a word of English in my life; he wore a pea-jacket, which he wears now - he made it himself, about four years ago - I never saw him in any other; I never saw him wear a cap in my life - he lodged with me till he was taken up, on the 12th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have not told us your occupation, and where you live? A. At No. 8, Essex-street, Whitechapel - my husband works in the West India Docks, when he has any thing to do; he was at home that night, but did not come in till after the prisoner; the prisoner is an Italian - I never understood a word he said, except "Madam;" he used to talk to me by signs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210039"/>Q. He has lived nine or ten years with you, and understands nothing of the English language? A. Nothing; when he wants any thing he speaks by signs to me; I never heard him say a word of English but "Madam."</p>
               <p>Q. What occupation is he? A. He walks about among the Jews, and they give him a few halfpence; I never saw him work; good people who know him, give him a trifle; my house is very near half a mile from the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not a beggar? A. He goes on; he cannot speak English to ask for any thing - if any body gives him a halfpenny he receives it; he puts his hand to his hat; he is a beggar, but not a thief; he never wears stockings or shoes - he is never out later than between four and five o'clock all the year long; he pays me 4d. every night for his lodging; he lives on a bason of hot water, a bit of bread, and sometimes a herring; I remember Friday night, the 1st of February, very well - I went to the police office about this, but the officer would not let me in; I did not say I was come to prove he was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can tell where he begs generally? A. He generally goes among the Jews in Petticoat-lane; I never knew him beg by the London Hospital - I do not know that to be his beat; I have no other Italian beggars at my house; I may have twelve lodgers at present - I can lodge sixteen; I sleep in the bottom room - he lodges in the top room, up two stories high; my front door is always fastened between ten and eleven o'clock at night - it is open till then; they must come through my room to go out; I did not go out that evening; I went up stairs at six o'clock, and he was on his knees at prayer - I see him at prayer every night before he goes to bed - he was on his knees; I am not up there every night, but on this night in particular, I went up to put on the sheets - I have seen him at prayers scores of times.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember this night so well? A. Because I paid some money to my landlord, about three o'clock that afternoon, that makes me remember the day of the month; he did not come in in a hurry - it was a little after four o'clock, I am certain; he has never been later than between four and five all the nine years he has lived with me.</p>

            . I lodge in Mrs. Rankin's house, in Essex-street; I have lodged there for the last six weeks. On the 1st of February I was very ill in my bed; the prisoner came to bed at half-past five o'clock, and went to prayers; I remained there all night - he came to bed at half-past five, and was not out of bed till half-past seven next morning - I swear that positively; I am sure he did not go out of the room.</p>
               <p>COURT to HANNAH RANKIN. Q. Did the prisoner go up to bed when he came home? A. When he had eat what he brought in - that was a bason of hot water, and a herring; he eat that in my room below - he was there between half and three-quarters of an hour, I suppose.</p>
               <p>COURT to RICHARD BALL. Q. What is your occupation? A. I am a labourer; I work by the water-side - I have no regular work, but a day's work now and then; I worked for Mr. Hacket, in the Minories, about two years, as a labouring man; I get my bread as I can by the waterside - I never beg.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us who you have worked for by the water-side, within the last six months? A. No. I never talked to the prisoner - he cannot speak a word of English - I never heard him speak English; I make signs to him; I had gone to bed in the day time, and did not get up till morning - I was in bed when he came home; I have no watch - I judge of the time; it could not have been about seven o'clock, for it was not dark; the lamps were not lighted - I did not see any; I was in bed - it was half-past five, as near as I can guess; it was quite light; I never saw the prisoner begging about - I never heard him say he begged; I cannot understand a word he says; I knew he was a beggar, but never inquired where he begged; Mrs. Rankin told me he was a beggar. I did not attend at Lambeth-street Office - I was never called upon; I still lodge there; I have not talked this matter over with Rankin at all, I am certain - I have come to prove the truth; she asked me to come here to speak the truth about the prisoner; I had no further conversation with her, than she asking me to come here, and state the case, and prove he was in his bed - I had no further conversation with her: I swear he was at home at half-past five o'clock, on the 1st of February, and in my room; and that he never went out of it - it was quite light at half-past five; he brought no candle up; the landlady came up at six o'clock, to put a pair of sheets on a bed - he had said his prayers before she came up, and gone to bed.</p>

A labouring man; I have worked latterly for Mr. Page, of Mile-end, but am not in regular work - I porter about; the prisoner gets his living by charity; I do not know where he begs - it would take a very few minutes to run from the London Hospital to Mrs. Rankin's; I did not go to bed when I first came home; I have no place to sit; I have no watch - it was dark between six and seven o'clock; when I came in first, between five and six, he was in his room - it was not quite dark then; he was then at prayers, on his knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at what hour did he go to bed? A. It was then between six and seven o'clock; when I last came down from the room, I saw him slipping into bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in bed when he was saying his prayers? - A. Nobody but me; he talks a good deal in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but when he was on his knees at prayers, he was out of bed? A. Yes; I was not at Lambeth-street Office - I have come here to speak the truth; Mrs. Rankin asked me to come; I have not talked this matter over with her, further than saying I would come; I was to come in consequence of sleeping in the same room as him - she said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210040"/>nothing to me about the 1st of February, nor asked me about the hour; we did not talk it over further than when I came home, she said he was taken; I did not hear of the robbery till he was taken; Mrs. Rankin never asked me to go to Lambeth-street - I did not go there; she asked me to come here a few days after the prisoner was taken - I never knew him out of bed after six o'clock; when he was taken I asked what it was for, and they said for a robbery, but I did not go to the office - I had no business with it; Mrs. Rankin said the robbery was done on Friday, the 1st of February; I do not recollect her mentioning the hour - I learnt the hour by hearing a man, at the Rose and Crown public-house, Essex-street, read the newspaper; to the best of my knowledge, I never talked with Mrs. Rankin about the hour: I went out between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I always leave him in bed - I never knew him wear any thing but the jacket he has on now; he wears neither shoes nor stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other man who goes without shoes and stockings? A. I have seen a man very much like the prisoner, but in a different dress, in a blue jacket and Scotch cap, and a very dark complexion - I believe that man had shoes and stockings on, but he resembled the prisoner very much, and put me in mind of him - he resembled him in features; I believe he is rather taller; I never drank with that man; I never talked with the prisoner - I cannot understand him.</p>

            . I live at No. 14, Tooksbury-place, Whitechapel. On the 1st of February, I saw the prisoner at No. 8, Essex-street - it might be from a quarter-past four to five o'clock: that is his usual time for going to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A labourer in the East India Company's employ; I am only a letterman there, subject to be discharged when the work is short - I have been there four or five years, but have been out of work seven or eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do in Essex-street? A. I occasionally go up there to see my mother, Mrs. Rankin, who keeps the house; she has been married twice; I fill up my leisure time by writing shop-fronts and boards - I had to do a board for Mr. Batty, and came down about it; the prisoner came and knocked at my mother's door, as was customary, and was told to enter - he never comes in without being told; the door is seldom open - the lodgers all knock; a person could go out without my mother knowing it, but not after being in bed; I did not attend at Lambeth-street, but several persons did - I was prompted through justice and humanity to come here; I heard of his being taken, on the Monday or Tuesday before he was committed; he might have been examined twice; but no person knew the charge till it was gone through - I did not hear of it till he was fully committed - I heard he was in charge, but did not know it was for a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not justice and humanity prompt you to attend the office? A. I was not acquainted with the full particulars, till he was committed; and I considered it useless to state what I knew, till the trial. I was never in a Court of Justice before. I never heard the prisoner speak a word of English in all my life - I have seen boys teaze him, and I have pushed him about. I wish to state that he is rather weak in intellect; for I have heard foreigners who lodged in the house say, he talks all manner of nonsense. My mother's lodgers are poor, working people; there may be others who beg. I have spoken to my mother respecting this, since he has been in confinement - I may have talked to her, on Saturday, respecting him. I was not much acquainted with the circumstance. I read the account in the newspapers; that is all I recollect about it. I have been here every day, and have no doubt but I have spoken every day respecting the trial; but we have not rehearsed the matter; we might say something respecting it. I did not see the prisoner go up to bed. I left the house a little before five o'clock. I have seen a man who bears a strict resemblance to him; his dress is something like his; but much better. I don't know where the prisoner generally walks; he goes to different places.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know his beat is about the London Hospital? A. I have as often seen him come other ways. I endeavour to shun him, for he always kisses my hand in the street. He don't constantly go to one place - I never saw him at the London Hospital - he may go there; I should think it is about five minutes walk from my mother's. I have seen him wear a pair of shoes down at heel; but he told a person, who understands him, that they hurt his feet.</p>

I never knew the prisoner out, after between four and five o'clock - he would come home with a red herring, roast it at the fire, and return God thanks for what he had taken, and then go to bed - I never heard him speak English.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know he prayed? A. He knelt on his knees - I have been in his room after he has been in bed, and I have seen him on his knees at the foot of the bed, when I have gone in at times for things that have been wanting. My husband is a broker - I work for Mrs. Rankin at times - he is sometimes on his knees for half an hour or more; I have left the room and gone up again, and found him still on his knees - I never saw him beg. Mrs. Rankin did not ask me to come here - I have not talked the business over with her; we spoke about the robbery when I first heard of it. I remember the night of the 1st of February, because the landlord's son was ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean Edwards? A. Yes; he came there between four and five o'clock - I don't know when he went away; the prisoner came in between four and five, with a red herring, which he roasted before the fire - he offered the landlady some in his language - she did not take it.</p>

I opened the door, and remarked that he had a blue jacket on under that coat, and at the second examination, I remarked that he had shoes and stockings on - he then said to this woman, "Here, take those," and began to pull them off, but I stopt him from doing it - it is well known to all the officers that he talks English.</p>

               <p>MR. J. ALLEY to MRS. EVANS. Q. You said you knew he had robbed the prosecutor? A. I had heard so, and gave information at the office, in consequence of the description the servant and my son had given me - I believed him to be the man, from their description; I had seen the prosecutor bleeding, and his waistcoat and clothes all undone.</p>
               <p>HANNAH RANKIN re-examined. I was at the office, but no further conversation passed between me and the prisoner, except that he called Madam, and I went to the door to him - that was all; he called Madam four or five times.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the deceased said he had told his master a lie, he was in the pit? A. Yes; the prisoner was twelve or fourteen feet from him- he took the adze up as the deceased was getting out of the pit; the prisoner did not call him any name before the deceased told him he had told his master a lie.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he throw a wooden weight at the prisoner? A. No; nothing of the kind, I am sure of that.</p>

            . The deceased worked for me. I sent the prisoner to the deceased for some tools, and in consequence of the answer he brought, I went myself; the deceased said the lad had brought me a false message - that he said no such words, and Bowden agreed with him; I said, "Well, I would have what I came for," and took the oil, which the men had taken while I was at breakfast; the deceased said the prisoner had spoken wrong, and he would chastise him for it; I said, if he could do without it, it would be better, for I never lifted my hand against the boy, and I thought he might do without it, and if he did, he should cut that job, and do no more for me.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on the 8th of November; he had lost a great deal of blood, and was very faint from the wound in his thigh, which I examined; the chisel produced was likely to cause such a wound; he recovered a little, but never properly; he died on the 21st of January, in St. George's-hospital; the wound was between two and three inches deep; the wound, and the absecess formed from it, occasioned his death.</p>

On the 2d of January my husband had been out all day, drinking - he was very much intoxicated; he went to bed about ten o'clock; my son and grand-daughter slept in the same room as us; she is not the prisoner's daughter - he is single; I helped to undress my husband, and put him to bed- he was seventy-two years old; I was not undressed myself; the prisoner was also very drunk; Mrs. Coray had helped to undress him, and was getting him to bed; he could not undress himself; he got into bed, and as he was shifting his shirt, one of the wrist-bands stuck, and he tore it; my husband said, "That is right, tear it all to pieces;" the prisoner replied, "I would not mind tearing yours;" my husband jumped out of bed, and said to him, "Come on," and put himself in a fighting attitude; my son got out of bed, naked as he was; their beds were so near each other we can scarcely pass between them - they began fighting; I held my husband back as well as I could; my husband struck the first blow, I must say; he did not advance to strike - they did not move, but were in the small space between the beds; my son had used no bad language- my husband said, with a bitter oath, "Let me get at the shovel, and I will cut his head open;" he got the shovel, and stood with it in his hand; I was trying to get it from him; he struck me, and gave me a black eye, which was bad for three weeks, because I endeavoured to restrain his violence; my son was at the door, where we keep a washhand bason; he threw the bason towards his father, to knock the shovel out of his hand - it bounced against the marble mantel-shelf, broke, and cut his father's arm in three places; I am confident he did it to knock the shovel out of his hand, for he was very fond of his father; but his father was a desperate temper, when in liquor; it struck the mantel-piece first, and bounded; my husband's arm was naked - his shirt was off; he took it off to fight, I suppose, for he went to bed with it on; the pieces of the bason cut his lip and his left arm in three places, below the elbow; my son only threw it once; the arm bled a great deal; we sent for a doctor, who had no dressings with him, and said we had better take him to the hospital - he walked to the hospital the same night; my husband persevered with the shovel very much, after the blow - he tried to strike my son, and said he would do it, and then he sat down, and smoked his pipe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not your son visit your husband, and pay him every attention? A. Yes, and showed sincere sorrow; he cried bitterly, and said, "I wish it was my arm instead of my father's;" as we went to the hospital my husband said, "Don't cry, Mary - my arm is not hurt much" - he lived sixteen days.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. The deceased came there about one o'clock in the morning of the 3d of January - he had two or three wounds in the arm, one at the elbow-joint - it was a cut about three inches long: he had lost a good deal of blood, but it had stopped then - he could not see: he lived till the 18th, and died in consequence of those wounds; there was a suppuration and tendency to mortification; no pieces of the bason were in the arm - the suppuration arose from the injury done to the elbow-joint; I have not the slightest doubt of the wounds causing his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they such wounds as must necessarily have been made with a bason - might it not be by his raging about with the shovel? A. I should think they were done with some cutting instrument - he might hurt himself with the shovel, but I should think that not so likely.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What did the wounds appear to you like? A. I should have said they were inflicted by a knife or some cutting instrument; I should not think they were done with a fire-shovel - I think it more likely to have been produced by the broken bason than a shovel: there were three wounds - the one in front was the worst. A consultation was held as to whether amputation should be performed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, regretting the cause of the accident - stating himself to have been intoxicated, and that his father, who was also intoxicated, challenged him to fight, and threatened to split his skull, and seeing his life in danger, he endeavoured to disarm him of the shovel, he had no idea of inflicting any personal injury, but acted in self-defence, his life being in danger. The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I had some more money in my right waistcoat pocket, but the four shillings were taken from the left; the whole six hustled me when I was down - I cannot swear whether my money was taken out or dropped out: they all ran away when the watchman came up- the prisoners struggled to get loose, but I kept hold of them - the watchman came up so soon, the others had no time to get them away from me. My hat was picked up a short distance off, by the watchman, who asked if it was mine - I said it was not, as it was dark, but at the watch-house I immediately recognised it, and a silk handkerchief which was in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time in the evening was this? A. Half-past one o'clock in the morning; I had not left work till late - I was quite sober - I had only drank about three pints of beer; they came behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any force used when your hat was taken off? A. It was suddenly snatched off: I was in the road, close to the pavement - they said nothing to me - I had no acquaintance with them: it was not a lark. The watchman came up in half a minute.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After you were tripped up, what did they do? A. They surrounded me, and were in the act of hustling me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was close to this spot about half-past one o'clock in the morning, in Old-street-road; I heard the prosecutor call out Watch! he was all over dirt and sludge; he had hold of the prisoners - he was standing up then: he said he had been robbed; I took hold of Williams, sprung my rattle, and another watchman came up; I took them to the watch-house; I did not see the others; they were gone round the corner - I was in Old-street-road. It was a dark night; I saw nobody but the prisoners; Best appeared quite sober, and so did the prisoners; Smith struck at Best twice in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this your beat? A. Yes; I was within thirty yards of the spot; I had called the half hour five or ten minutes before. There are gas-lamps in the street.</p>

I heard the rattle spring when I was in Hoxton-square, three or four hundred yards from the spot; I saw nobody but the two prisoners; I found Williams and Best both without their hats; I looked round, and five or six yards off I found a hat; Williams said it was not his, and the prosecutor said the same; there was a handkerchief in it - I do not think Best saw the handkerchief: he said at the watch-house that he had lost a hat and handkerchief, and claimed it, and said he had lost about 4s. - he appeared in liquor a little, but not at all insensible. The prisoners appeared perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far off is your beat? A. It comes within about thirty yards of the spot.</p>

I was going home to Crabtree-row, Hackney-road; as I turned round by the alms-houses the prosecutor laid hold of my neckcloth, and said, "Here is one of them;" Lloyd came by - I asked him to lay hold of me, or the prosecutor would choke me; he did so, and I asked for my hat, which had fallen off - he could not find it.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was coming home with Williams; we had been drinking, and were pretty merry - I might have run against the prosecutor, but not with intent to rob him.</p>

When I recovered, I went on and found I was in the Hounslow road - I called at the first house, and desired a lodging for the night; I said I had been ill used - this house was about five hundred yards off - they refused me assistance; I called at another house, and the gentleman sent me to the turnpike - I sat there all night by the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of night was this? A. It might be ten minutes later than half-past ten o'clock: I do not think it that it was eleven; I had no time piece - I cannot say how far I was from London; I have ascertained since that the place is called Isleworth-corner; I walked all the way from town - I set off about seven o'clock from No. 69, Old Bailey - I was as collected as I am now; I had taken nothing but what was necessary to support my spirits in travelling - I have no recollection of meeting anybody on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told anybody you were going to put your bundle into a waggon, and walk by the side of it? A. I had not; I did not ask anybody to go and drink with me- I did not throw my bundle at anybody's head: this happened on Tuesday - I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday night, at the Queen's Head public-house, at Heston, in the care of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say of one of the men that you should know him again, if you saw him in the same clothes as he had on that night? A. I said I would describe the clothes he had on that night, but I should know his person in any clothes; I did not say I should know him by his clothes - I knew him by his face; it was a fair evening, not moonlight - there was a gas-light on the opposite side of the road: I do not suppose half a minute elapsed from the time the prisoner took my bundle, till the other took my hat off - I had received the blow before the second man came up, but had not fallen into the ditch; I fell into the ditch about two minutes after I received the blow; I might have had two or three glasses of beer on my road, but did not sit down in any house - I cannot state what were the public-houses I called at. I was in London about three months ago; I have been in London three times since I have been in Bristol; the first time was a week before his present Majesty was crowned - I staid about a week then, and a fortnight the second time - which was when this happened, and this is the third time. I am a native of Wales, and never lived in London; I might have called at three public-houses before I was knocked down - I know the Half Moon public-house at Brentford; I will not swear that I did not call there, but I do not recollect it - I think I called at a house at Brentford, but did not look at the sign, that might be about ten o'clock or a quarter past; according to what I can judge, I suppose the Half Moon is about half a mile from where I was robbed - it might be twelve o'clock when I was taken into a house; after I was robbed, I was loitering about, and did not know what to do or where to go, as I had been refused quarters at two or three houses - I did not see any watchman or patrol; I was much fatigued and alarmed.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Will you swear you were perfectly sober? A. Yes; I have not a doubt of the prisoner's person; I never expressed a doubt about it; I was robbed about a quarter or half a mile from the Half Moon public-house I suppose; I suffered very much from the blow I received at the time; I suppose I stopped ten minutes at each house trying to get admittance; I called at two houses, and then at Mr. Chapman's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you complain there of your ill treatment? A. Yes; they did not like to receive me; their's is a private house; I am quite sure that three men were in conversation together, and the prisoner was one of them, he separated from the rest, and came up to me.</p>

            . I am a market gardener, and live at Brentford-end, Isleworth; my house is about four hundred yards from Isleworth-lane. On the 8th of January, about 11 o'clock at night (I suppose), the prosecutor came to me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210045"/>I sent him to the turnpike, and in the morning I went to the turnpike; I afterwards went to the corner and saw a place where there had evidently been a scuffling, and in the ditch was a night-cap, which I produce: the prosecutor seemed in a dreadfully agitated state when he knocked at my door; he held up a handkerchief saturated with blood; I opened my window; he begged of me for God's sake to admit him, saying he had been robbed, and was bleeding; he held up his handkerchief, which he had been holding to his mouth, and I saw the blood on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear sober? A. He stated his case clearly to me, and stated where it had happened; there was nothing to induce me to suppose he was not sober; I directed him to the turnpike, and he went there immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. A little after eleven o'clock; I was in bed, and only looked out of the window; I did not come down stairs; it was a very sharp frost, and a clear star-light night, with a cold easterly wind; he might be a quarter of an hour there; he begged of me earnestly to let him in; I asked why he had not gone to the public-house, nearly opposite; he said he had tried there; I directed him to the turnpike; he had no hat on his head.</p>

            . I keep the Half-moon public-house, at Brentford, which is nearly a quarter of mile from Isleworth-corner. The prisoner was at my house on the night of the robbery, in company with others - I think he came in about twenty minutes before nine o'clock; he came in with William Steers and others - I can swear to Steers. There was no woman in their company - there was one at the bar; she went out - I suppose there were four or five of them in company. I think they left my house about a quarter before ten, together - I cannot say how many of them exactly - the woman had gone out about an hour before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Do you know the prosecutor? A. I know him since this happened - he was not at my house on that night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You say other people were in company with the prisoner; did they come in together, or about the same time? A. Several came in together - I was not in the tap-room myself; I expect they were in company together; they did not all go out together - I cannot say whether any one went out with the prisoner - it was a market-day, and a great many people came to my house; the prisoner went away, about a quarter before ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have no recollection of the prosecutor having been there that night? A. No; I cannot say; I am quite sure that Steers came in with the prisoner and the others - if they did not, they were not a quarter of a minute apart - I suppose they knew one another, for they seemed to be jovial together.</p>

            . I keep the Angle public-house, near Brentford; my house is about five hundred yards from the corner of Isleworth-lane. On the 8th of January, the prisoner came to my house, about ten minutes before ten o'clock at night - there were five of them in company; four besides himself - they were all men - they went away between twenty and twenty-five minutes after ten - they all went out, one after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they drink together? A. Three of them came in first, and called for a pot of beer, and before I had drawn it, the other two came in - that was Steers and the prisoner; they came in together, and when they went away, they turned to the left, towards Isleworth-corner - my house is on this side of Sion-gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the three men who came in first? A. One of them was Alexander and his brother - I do not know the third. They all five drank together - and handed the pots to each other; they only had two pots - I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner. I was before the Magistrate when he was brought there; the prosecutor swore to him - he said Wyeth was the man who knocked him down - he said that of himself; it was not suggested to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he make any remark about his clothes? A. I think he said he had a jacket on, but my hearing is bad. I did not hear him say, he should know him better if he had the same clothes on as he had that night - he described his person to me. I took up four men and one woman - the prosecutor could not identify those. I am the high constable. I took the other men before the prosecutor swore to the prisoner and Steers.

            . I live at Hounslow. I remember the night of the 8th of January - I saw the prisoner that night between ten and eleven o'clock at the Cricketers public-house, at Hounslow; it might he ten minutes or a quarter to eleven - that house is upwards of two miles from where the robbery was committed; William Steers was in his company there; they staid there till eleven o'clock - the house was not shut up at eleven that night, but the landlord would not draw any more beer, and wished the company to disperse; they staid in the house till eleven, Wyeth lives at Hounslow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How late did you stay in the house? A. All night; they did not shut up at eleven o'clock, because the Bishop's waggons were coming that night; the house was open till four.</p>

            . I live at Brentford. On the night of the 8th of January I saw the prosecutor, about a quarter to eleven o'clock - I should know him again if I saw him; that is the man (looking at him); he has not got the same top coat on now. I saw him at a quarter to eleven o'clock, or from that to ten minutes, opposite New Brentford church; I was coming from Isleworth, over the bridge, and he was coming towards the bridge; he had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210046"/>bundle, (it appeared to me a double bundle), thrown over his shoulder, with something in the form of a hat in front; he ran up against me, and pushed me off the pavement. I said, "Halloo, my friend, what are you up to now;" he said, "I am going home." I said, "That is a strange way, to run against me in that manner;" he said, "Don't you like it?" I said, there was plenty of room for him to go by - he said he had been waiting a long time for a waggon to go by, for him to throw his bundle into, and said, "I have been in company with some cursed girls, and lost all my money except 2 1/2d., and that I will spend if you like." I said, if that was all he had got, he had better keep it; he swung his bundle at me - it went off in his hands; he was not able to stoop to pick it up. I took it up - put it over his shoulder, and left him, and before I got to Brentford Church-yard, where I live, the church clock struck eleven; I have no doubt at all but he was intoxicated; I have seen him since in the same way, intoxicated, between the Half Moon, and the lane leading into Sion-fields, within the last ten days.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. How do you get your living? A. As a witness for informations.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you get for your information to day? A. Why, my expences being paid, eating and drinking; and I rode up in a cart with a woman who is a witness for the prisoner - she is not a witness, but came to protect her daughter, who is to speak on his behalf; I am what is termed a common informer - I have been so two years; I do not altogether get my living by it; I have been at work as well, at haymaking, and coal-heaving, or any thing to get a living for my family; I never failed in any information.</p>

            . I did not see this girl before the Magistrate, nor do I believe she was there; I understand she has accused me of having said something, but I could not hear her.</p>
               <p>COURT. She says the prosecutor was talking to you, and said he did not think he could swear to both the men; that you said, "Poh, poh! swear hard and fast against both" Witness. So help me God, it is the greatest falsehood that ever was uttered - it is most shocking! I know the prisoner's solicitor is acquainted with all the thieves in the place; I say it is false - I will do my duty as an honest man at the risk of my life; I never in my life said such a thing- the prosecutor identified them both; he said the prisoner had an immense large fist, and he should know him in a moment - he went into the room, and saw him sitting there; he came out, and said, "That is the man;" (that was Wyeth.)</p>
               <p>I was told this girl was coming forward; I know her family are very bad, and think she will swear any thing she is dictated to by the party.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you entertained that opinion? A. Within six months. His informations have been received, perhaps, half-a-dozen times, upon his oath, but the Magistrates will not convict on his testimony; I have an order from the Magistrates not to receive informations from him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Has he so conducted himself before the Magistrates, as to lead you to say you would not believe him on his oath? A. Most certainly I would not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I think you said these people overtook you? A. They followed me - I arrived at the post before them, and was resting on it, with my face turned towards them - my face was turned to the way I had come from, and I saw them coming up; the prisoner was within ten yards of me when Wyeth attacked me- Wyeth came forward, and left all the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had quite left you, the prisoner came up? A. Instantly: Wyeth followed the other two and the woman, and the prisoner came up instantly, as if he intended to assist me - he snatched my hat, and took the same direction as the rest; he did nothing else.</p>

The prisoner William was once in my service, and left about twelve months ago - he has two club-feet; the robbery appeared to me to have been done by a man who knew the way of the house - the servant gave me a pair of stockings found in the house; (looking at them) - they appear to belong to a very short foot, and that raised my suspicious; I found the prisoners in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner WILLIAM MITCHELL. Q. Is there any difference in those stockings from common ones? A. They appear to have been worn by a man having a short thick foot; not that they have been made on purpose, but they have been worn with such a foot.</p>

I went part of the way to Billingsgate with my brother, who was going to get some fish; and in Queen-street I said, "I won't take the bag all the way - I will leave it in this public-house till we come back;" he could not buy any fish that day, and we stopped and had some beer, and went to a public-house; we stopped there almost all day, till evening - I was very much in liquor: we called at this public-house for the parcel; he was more drunk than I was; I did not know what I did: we fell out about family affairs, and hinted about the bag being stolen; the officer, being in the house, took the bag up - we followed him; I had no objection, as I knew myself innocent.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MITCHELL's Defence. My brother gave me the things that were in my pocket - I did not know what they were for; I was rather in liquor: I said I would keep them in remembrance of him. We fell out at the public-house - he said I was a rogue; I said I did not know I was more one than him, and perhaps the things in the bag were stolen - I said it out of aggravation: the officer came to the bar, and said, "Do you say they are stolen?"

            . I live in Henry-place, White Conduitfields, Islington, and am a carman. On Saturday, the 26th of January, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw three young chaps loitering about, and being suspicious characters I watched them; I saw them go into Poulteny-terrace, open a window, and get into a house belonging to Mr. Vincent: I ran towards the house, after seeing one of them get in; one of them jumped out, and all three ran away - I cannot say whether more than one had got in: I followed, and caught the prisoner about two hundred yards from the house, without losing sight of him; I saw him throw this tea-caddy down: I had seen the window pushed up.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw one of them open it? A. I saw it go up. The other two got away. I gave the prisoner in charge of Essex, with the caddy.</p>

On the 14th of January, I went out about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, leaving my till locked; I locked my shop door, and then locked the parlour door outside. I rent the house, I left two female lodgers up stairs. I returned at twelve o'clock and found the parlour door ajar - I am certain I had locked it, and I had the key in my pocket: I pulled it open, and saw the prisoner standing in the parlour with his right hand resting on my drawers, and his face towards the door. I said "O, it is you is it, I must stop you:" I I knew him before by sight, but not by name - I shut the parlour door too, but he burst the door from me, and I collared him; he kicked my legs till he kicked the skin off: I called Stop thief! and held him for about two minutes; he then pushed me down the kitchen stairs a step or two- I lost my hold and he got away: the neighbours all saw him run away, but nobody stopped him. I recovered myself in a few minutes and followed him to the bottom of the street; he turned down Swinton-street: he was not taken then, but for another offence. I found my till open, which was in my shop, and the halfpence were gone out of it which I had counted in the morning - I keep a chandler's shop; there were about 3s. in pence, halfpence, and farthings: the till was open, but the lock not injured, nor was the shop door lock injured. I missed nothing but the copper - I locked the till the last thing before I went out, and put the key into my pocket: I had put the silver out of it into a drawer in the parlour - I found that safe. The shop door was locked inside, and the parlour door too - none of the drawers were broken; the parlour door was forced open, but there were no marks of injury on it: the shop door was not broken - If I had had the presence of mind, I could have locked him in the parlour. I knew him before, he once before opened my parlour door and looked in at me as I sat there - I cannot be mistaken in his person. I understand he is a bricklayer or slater.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you see me at the shop door when you came in? A. No - you were in the parlour: he did not speak a word to me that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you would serve me directly? A. No - you did not ask to be served with anything.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Mrs. Bagster's, in Long-acre, on the 29th of January, on a charge of stealing a hat from her house: I afterwards heard of this robbery, and had him brought up, and the prosecutrix indentified him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When she laid hold of me she said you have robbed me. I said what do you mean; she immediately collared me and said I must stop: I said I would not, for I was no thief: she scuffled and fell down, I walked out, and ran away.</p>

            . I am a trunk-maker, my premises adjoin Mr. Scambler's. On the 24th of January, a little after six o'clock, I was alarmed by my dog barking; he was fastened up to a place: I went backwards and saw the prisoner on a parapet of Mr. Scambler's stables, fifteen or sixteen feet from the ground: it was rather dark, I called to him, seeing him in a stooping position: he made no answer, but went further on to hide himself. I said if he did not come down I would fetch him; he then came scrambling down the tiles, I called to my son, and he was secured, as he dropped from the tiles; his arm was entangled in his coat, so that he could not extricate himself. We secured him, and found nothing on him; we sent for a constable and gave him in charge: I got a ladder, went on the stable with a light, and found a quantity of lead cut from the main gutter, and rolled up in 3 pieces; it weighed 32lbs.; the edges appeared bright - it could not have been cut many minutes, for the boards under it were quite dry. He begged to be let go, and said he had been told by somebody to go there, and get lead as he was out of work, and if I would let him go, he would tell the truth.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Mansion-house. On the 11th of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was waiting opposite Mr. Turner's premises, on the watch, and saw the prisoner turn off the step of the door, with a paper parcel across his left arm - he turned up Princes-street, but was not out of my sight; I followed him across Bridgewater-square, down Fan-street and Goswell-street; he turned down Allen-street, and knocked at No. 40 - a boy opened the door - he said something to the boy, I could not hear what; I then went up and touched the bundle, and asked him what he had got there; he said, "Lead, for Peter, the burnisher;" I asked where he brought it from; he said, "From myself;" I said, "From yourself?" he said, "Yes, he is my brother-in-law, and we travel the country, Brentford, Isleworth, and all those places, and buy up all sorts of metal;" I said, "How came this piece here, then?" he said it was left at the White Horse public-house, Fan-street, opposite his house, the night before, or opposite where he lived - that he took it home, and had brought it from home; I said,"That story won't do for me; I have followed you from Princes-street, myself," which he denied; I took him to the Compter, and informed Mr. Turner; the metal has had a piece cut off it, to be assayed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he carrying it quite openly? A. Except the paper being round it - he gave this account very readily - he called it lead, and I could not tell it from lead myself.</p>
               <p>MR. TURNER. On the 11th of January, about 12 o'clock, this bar of metal was produced to me, we have a great many more - it is coarse metal, with a very small portion of silver in it - it is the refuse from refining silver; the prisoner was not allowed to collect metal; he was never absent from our business - he could not have been travelling; this is not likely to be found any where but at a refiner's; it is worth 24s. or 25s. - there is no refiner nearer to us than Foster-lane; I never knew the prisoner in possession of any bar: there may be probably twenty bars of one sort; they are not always so poor as this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any particular mark on it? A. No; I could have sworn to it any where, for here is the ingot it was cast in - it is not an uncommon size; I could not ascertain the quality without its being assayed - it has been assayed at Johnson's, in Foster-lane, but not in my presence; I can tell, from its appearance, and from cutting it, that it is not pure lead - it is mixed metal, composed of lead, silver, and, I dare say, a portion of copper; I know that from the assay master.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say that it is mixed metal, of your own knowledge? A. It is; I have been forty years in the business, and have no doubt of it, though I cannot tell of what it is composed, except from the report of the assay master.</p>

Their men brought thirty-two bundles of osier rods to the inn, and pitched them in Fleet-market. I received information on Saturday, the 17th of January - went up the yard, and found our guard holding the prisoner, Ratcliffe; the rods were in a liquor-shop - Waldron was in the liquor-shop, very tipsy; there were two bundles of rods there; the landlady said, in the presence of both the prisoners, that Ratcliffe had brought in one bundle; Waldron immediately claimed them as his property. I asked Waldron where he got them from - he appeared to have his senses about him - he said he had bought them; I said, "as an honest man, you will tell me who of." He said no, he would be d-d if he would. I said if not, he must go to the Compter. I took him in charge; when the officer came, he told me he had bought them of his brother over night, and he had three other bolts at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are they bundles or bolts? A. Bolt is the phrase the trade gives them; one of the witnesses tells me they are bolts - I know nothing of the trade myself. The prisoners were both drunk; but I do not conceive them so tipsy as not to know what they were saying; the officer said, we had better not take them before the Alderman till they were sober. Waldron acknowledged, in my hearing, when he was sober, that he had bought them of Ratcliffe, and paid him 9s.; Ratcliffe said he had only given him 6s. - that was taken down at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not Waldron so tipsy that you would not have put him on his oath? A. I believe he knew right from wrong - I would have put him upon his oath, if necessary; he was not insensibly drunk - he answered me like a man - I believe he was capable of answering any question.</p>

            . I am in the employ of George May, and his partner. I brought some osier rods from them - some call them bolts and some bundles. I brought thirty-two bundles from Twyford to London, and pitched them at the top of Fleet-market, about five o'clock in the morning - the waggoner put me trustee over them. Shackel sent for me down the yard, and when I returned five bundles were gone; this was about eleven o'clock. I saw two bundles found in the gin-shop in about twenty minutes - both the prisoners were there; I know them to be the bundles - they generally sell for 2s. a bundle. While I was minding them, Waldron came up and asked Ratcliffe to sell him some; this was in my hearing, at the corner of Fleet-market. I told him he must not sell them, for they were not his; that I was trustee over them - I told him they were neither his nor mine to sell - that was about nine o'clock - Ratcliffe was standing by me at the time; I had been talking to him; they both went away together - I saw them again before the rods were taken, and left Ratcliffe to mind them while I went down the yard; when I returned, five bundles were gone - we found three at Waldron's house, in Plumbtree-court, about twelve o'clock- I am certain they are part of what I brought to town; I saw no other in the market that day. When I went to Ratcliffe about it, he told me he had sold them, and would give me 1s. not to say any thing about it; that it made no odds to me, as it would be the waggoner's loss.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If a man gave 10s. for them, it would be a fair price? A. Yes; I put Ratcliffe in care of them, openly, in the market; he knew they were not his to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. If he were offered a fair price for them, you would not think it wrong in him to sell them? A. No. I know the bundles, by having tied one up just before; it had come apart - they were found before they had time to untie them; they were just as I had left them. Waldron was sober when he asked Ratcliffe to sell them; he was drunk when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What day of the month was this? A. The 19th of January - I had seen Ratcliffe in the yard before; but never employed him - I saw him about three times a week for the last nine weeks; but never had any conversation with him; I have drank with him when the waggoner gave us a drop of beer; I never drank purl with him; I was told to pitch the rods in the market, for the man who belonged to them was coming to sell them there; and when he did come, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210052"/>sold them for 2s. a bundle - I never told Ratcliffe the price, for I did not know it till afterwards. I call them bundles of rods - that is the proper name; some call them bolts, and some bundles - I should call them bundles - some call them bundles of bolts.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are they osiers? A. No; nothing but withes - I cannot tell whether they are called osiers in the trade.</p>

            . I am agent to the proprietor. I have heard them called bolts of rods, and bundles of rods; we call them osiers; I went to Waldron's house on the 19th, immediately on coming from the Compter; it is in Plumbtree-court, Holborn-bridge; we there found one bundle entire, and two cut open; Bushnell was making baskets of them - it is the third house on the right-hand side from Holborn-bridge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear it is not the fifth house? A. I cannot say; I will say it is the third or fourth. I have lived at the inn twenty-two years, and these things frequently come up; they are bundles or bolts, and I should call them osiers in London; but I may be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is the meaning of the word "Bolt?" A. It is a bundle bound up in a certain number of inches; I heard Bushnell say that; I have frequently heard them called bolts - nobody ever heard of a "bundle of bolts."</p>

            . I am a watchman and basket-maker; I make baskets of osiers, and these are osiers - when they are tied together, the trade call them bolts - this is not a bolt now, but I have no doubt it was, when it was sent up - it is not the regular size now - we reckon forty-two inches round a bolt. Shackel and Bessant found me at No. 3, Plumtree-court, between twelve and one o'clock on the 19th of January; there was a bundle of stuff there, and part of another that I was making baskets of; I was in the market-house that morning, and went to get a glass of liquor: Waldron asked if I had anything to do, I said No; he asked if I would make him half a dozen of baskets called "No. 5, longs;" I said I would- he told me not to deceive him, but go home and make them for he must get them in by six o'clock that night, he told me to finish three of No. 3, (two of which were began) and send them home, as they were paid for, for he had had the money for half a dozen; I went home for my knife, and then went to Waldron's lodgings in Plumbtree-court, and in about two hours Bessant and Shackel came and claimed the rods I was working on - I had not seen Ratcliffe at all; when I first got to the room there was no small stuff to make the baskets with: I went to Waldron, at Wood's house a little after ten o'clock and brought a bundle from there, and another from Scruton's, the Key public-house in Fleet-market, by Waldron's directions - I have frequently bought four or five bolts with him, and left them at public-houses; he came to his lodgings about a quarter-past eleven to see how I was getting on - he was very drunk and tumbled out of the chair; I saw no more of him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was no concealment about it? A. No; the stuff was in a public-house where forty or fifty of the market people are constantly coming - he did not tell me to conceal them: I passed by where they were taken from; he has often told me to do things directly - I think 2s. are more than they are worth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Whatever quantity were tied up together, would they be properly called a bundle? A. Some people call them bundles and some bolts.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoners, between twelve and one o'clock, at Scuton's gin-shop, for stealing this property; I asked Ratcliffe how he came by them - he said, "I have stolen them" and Waldron said "I have bought them" - that is all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did they know you were a constable? A. Yes, both of them. I said"You must tell me where you got them, for I am going to take you to the Compter" he told me he had stolen them, before I asked him; I afterwards said "You must tell me where you stole them from;" he was not sober - I did not say, what he said would be given in evidence against him; I never said I would transport Ratcliffe, or that I would do all in my power to get him transported, I must be a jackass to say so - how could I get him transported? I had never seen him before - I have had half a glass of gin tonight, and that is all, so help me God - I never said I would get him transported - I should be a rascal if I did say so.</p>
               <p>RATCLIFFE's Defence. The guard of the waggon ordered me to sell them and I gave him part of the money, and was to give him the rest in the morning: if I had intended to steal them, I should not have taken them into the public-house.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 14, Crown-court, Grub-street, near the prosecutor's; I have two sons and one daughter: the prisoner slept in the garret - no one else slept there; one of my children is in service and the other is an infant. I do not know who had been to the play with him that night; there had been two or three of them together: he had some bread and cheese and porter for his supper when he came home; he went to bed first, then I went, and my wife last. There are three rooms in the house - I sleep below stairs: there is a lodger in the first floor.

            . I am the prisoner's mother. On the 5th of February, he came home near upon ten o'clock, and asked me to mend his trousers; he had some Irish-stew for supper, and nothing else - he had nothing to drink but water; he went to bed first, my husband next, and I went up stairs after he was in bed, to fetch his trousers; he went out about seven o'clock the next morning: we sleep in the bottom room, and he in the top; there are but three rooms in the house; the street door is locked at night, and I keep the key in my possession; he could not have gone out without coming into my room for it - he is always in the habit of sleeping at home; he goes about selling baked potatoes, and doing any jobs he can get.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How old is he? A. Seventeen; his father got up first the next morning, to take up his trousers, which I had mended the night before, for he had nothing to put on. I know it was on the 5th of February, because he was taken up the next day.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MULLAY. I was in London in January last; and on one day in the beginning of this month, I put an advertisement in the paper; and on the 8th I received a letter, in consequence of which I called on the prisoner, and had some conversation with him. I produced the letter to him; he did not state from whom that letter came, but seemed to know what I came about. I was desirous of procuring some situation, but had not mentioned that it was to be under government: I had provided myself with a sum of money as a premium for it. The place I went to was <placeName id="t18280221-45-crimeloc237">No. 36, Red Lion-square</placeName>

                        targets="t18280221-45-off235 t18280221-45-crimeloc237"/>; I was shown to a room on the top floor, behind the projection of the building: I had to go up stairs as if I was going to the leads of the house, I then turned off down some other stairs, through a narrow passage, two or three feet wide, which brought me into a room, not more than nine feet square; there is a window in it, and a fire-place which projects; there was a table and two chairs: I got there, I think, about three o'clock on Friday, the 8th of February, and staid there until about four o'clock. He told me he had a friend, who was a man of consequence, and had a great deal of influence, though he had run through a large fortune, and through him he could procure me some employment, and as a beginning of the business, I was to lodge 300l. in a banker's hands in my own name, and to call on him the following day, or on the Monday, to lodge the money, I went the following day and told him I had not brought the money, and told him I thought Monday might do as well. We had some further conversation on the business, and I said I did not care, or it was of no consequence to me if I were to lodge more money. It was then agreed that I should, on the Monday, lodge 450l. On the Monday I called about two o'clock, and told him I had changed my mind, and I would only lodge 300l.: he then observed that his employer would think I was going back from my agreement, and think that he had not acted in a proper manner. On that day I saw a long bladed knife, with a buckhorn handle, which laid open upon the shelf; I cannot say whether it was a clasp knife, as I did not take it in my hand - when the prisoner made these observations, I told him I was always a man of my word, or words to that effect; and I would lodge the 450l. in the course of the day, and to prove it, I showed him 400l. He then made me write a note to a Mr. Owen, which was the first time I had heard the name of "Owen" mentioned; in it I mentioned that I would lodge the 450l., and Howard and I were to call on him at one o'clock the following day, which would be Tuesday: I was to call on the prisoner at half-past twelve o'clock, and go with him to Owen's: we parted about five o'clock. On the next day I went about half-past twelve o'clock, and had upwards of 500l. in two pockets - I had three 100l. Bank notes, two of 50l., a Bank post-bill for 98l., and some sovereigns. At this interview, Howard told me that Mr. Owen had to go to 'Change, and could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210055"/>not be at home at one o'clock, but he would call at Howard's at two o'clock, and he begged me to wait till he came, which I consented to do: he made some observations about my being cold; he put some coals on the fire, and put the poker into it; it remained there some time, when it fell out; he put it in again; it remained some time, and I took it out again myself - he put it into the fire again, and observed to me that it would make the fire burn. After some time, it fell out on the hearth-rug and burnt it, and he did not afterwards put it in. I observed in the room a trap bat, which I had not seen before; he had it a good deal in his hand, and said he purchased it to beat, or to keep the cat out of his room - the conversation afterwards turned on various subjects; two o'clock came, Mr. Owen did not appear, but Howard appeared to be every moment expecting him: he did not remain in the room all the time, but went in and out a great deal - as well as I can recollect he walked up and down almost all the time: I told him I wanted to be at home before five o'clock, as I lived at Chelsea, and was going out to dinner. About two o'clock he began to get very agitated, and complained a great deal of Mr. Owen's conduct: I remained till half-past three o'clock, and then told him I could stay no longer, and he proposed that there should be a new appointment made to meet Mr. Owen, and it was agreed that I should call on Howard at ten o'clock, or as soon after as I could, on the following day: this was to be communicated to Owen by a note, which I wrote; when I had done, I showed it to Howard, who said that I ought to have made it a good deal sharper, or words to that effect; and, after a few observations he sat down and wrote one for me to copy - this note is not here, but here is a part of my copy of it: the note he wrote was a long one, and in that he stated that we should call at ten o'clock at Owen's; I said "How can we go to Owen's at ten o'clock, when I am to be here at ten o'clock" - he replied"You are peevish;" I said "on some occasions I might be so." I sat down and commenced the copy of the note, and had nearly finished it, when I saw my hat (which had hung on a nail behind me) in Howard's hand, and he put it either on a chair at the other corner of the room, or threw it on the floor; he immediately came back again behind me, as I was leaning down to write, and hit me at the top of the head with the bat - it immediately occured to me that he intended to murder, and rob me; I got up, he came more in front of me, and hit me with the bat on my forehead - it bled immediately over my face, so much so as to dim my sight with the blood: I immediately closed upon him and threw him; he fell, I think sideways, for his left hand was stretched out, and I observed in it a knife, which appeared to me to be the one I had previously seen; I laid hold of it by the blade: he had fallen about three or four feet from the fire-place, and while I had hold of the knife with one hand, I stretched out the other and got hold of the poker, with which I gave him some blows on the head: he had all this time hold of the handle of the knife, and, by holding the blade, my hand began to be cut: I then threw the poker out of my hand to lay hold of the blade with my right hand, my left being cut - in doing that he got up: we were still struggling, but I did not fall at all; he still had hold of the handle of the knife, and I had only hold of the blade; when he first began on me, I cried "Murder," and he told me in the course of the struggle, it was no use to bawl or cry, as he had help at hand, or words to that effect, and on one or two occasions, he called "John, John" - when we were up, I got hold of the bat, and gave him some blows with it in front of his head, but I let go of the bat, as my whole attention was on the knife, and in a short time I broke the blade off near the handle, and held it in my own hand for perhaps a minute or two, thinking it might be of some service to defend myself, but I found I could not use the blade, and I threw it on the floor. I cannot well say how the prisoner held the handle of the knife, but he held it firmly, and I could not get, but broke it - the knife was in motion when I broke it; I had then nothing in my hand to defend myself, I threw him again, and began to kick him with my heel: about that time there were people at the door; I heard them speak, but the door was locked - he had passed in and out frequently; he had not locked it every time, nor do I know when he had locked it - I did not observe whether I found the door locked on my former visits, but on one occasion (I think on the Monday) I told him to shut the door, which was open, and it appeared to me to have no other means of fastening, but by turning the key. When the people came to the door, I thought they came to help Howard, and he asked me to let him get up, and said he would tell me all about it; I did so, but still held him: he appeared greatly agitated or exhausted, I cannot tell which, and said to me "Will you promise me one thing?" or words to that effect: I asked him what it was; he did not reply for some time, and I asked him again - he then said, "Will you say it was a quarrel?" and, under the idea that he had help outside the door, I promised him I would. We then went and unlocked the door, and I saw the landlord of the house, or the man who keeps the shop; and a painter, whom I had seen in the house, going backwards and forwards, and two other persons; I then felt at ease as to any danger, and came out of the room, and said that Howard had made an attempt to murder me; some one then came down stairs with me, and I showed my money to the first person I spoke to, to the constable, and to the surgeon. When I went into that room I had a ring on my finger, and, when I came out, I found myself without it; I have seen it since, and I have seen a bat and a knife similar to those I saw in the room. My wounds were dressed, and I was sent home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been from Ireland? A. About three months: I had been in England frequently before, and had advertised for some employment, but I do not think I had advertised for a public situation; I had advertised for a mercantile one about four times; not more. The prisoner said I was peevish, and occasionally I am so, if I see a person do an absurd thing; but, if I thought a fraud was about to be practised on me, or I were to be made the dupe of another person, that would not be likely to rouse my peevish feelings. I can state, on my oath, that I was not peevish on that occasion: and the prisoner had no reason for making that observation. My note will show that I did not consider that Mr. Owen was ill treating me, nor did I think that Howard was; I did not consider that the delay was extraordinary. The lodging, into which I went, was in a very obscure situation; there was a pillar and claw table and two chairs in the room: there might be other things, but the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210056"/>room was very scantily furnished - but the furniture was very clean. The whole sum I was to give was something between 500l. and 800l. It did not strike me that this was rather an extraordinary place to go to for the purpose of seeing an influential person or his agent - Howard said I was to meet him there. The only thing that struck me was, that it was a very quiet place, and a curious one; the passage to it is about three feet wide. I think the first time I showed the prisoner the money I had in my pocket, was on the Monday; I did not show him any on the Tuesday, and I cannot exactly tell whether any conversation took place between me and him respecting money on Tuesday: the first conversation respecting the banker's was on the Monday, and on the Tuesday he was making an observation on Mr. Owen's going with me to the banker's, and he was consulting me to know whether he would be wanted to go, he said if I chose he would go: he did not ask me any questions that morning to induce me to show him the money; my going to any banker's, was to depend on whether Mr. Owen came. I think I got there on the Tuesday, at half-past twelve o'clock, and, when I came out of the room it was about four o'clock. I never described the bat as a cricket bat: there had been some coals put on the fire before he put the poket in: I did not state before the magistrate that after he put the poker in the fire, I, myself, drew it out twice; or that he put it in twice, and that I drew it out as often: he put it in three times and I drew it out once - I am quite positive that I did not on that Tuesday drink anything with him; on the Monday I drank some gin and water, which he asked me to do, as I appeared wet: I think I was not wet on the Tuesday; there might be a splash on me. I do not mean to state that his saying I was cold, and putting the poker into the fire, was a circumstance calculated to alarm me; in fact, it did not alarm me - I have never said it did. I was the only person in the room with him; when the poker fell from the fire the second time and burnt the hearth-rug he took it into his hand and put it under the ashes, or by the side of the fire-place; very circumstance, with reference to it, was of an ordinary nature, till I took hold of it: I did not on the two previous days take particular notice of the room and its appendages. The bat and the knife might have been there on the Friday and Saturday, but I did not see them till the Monday. I was writing when I saw my hat in the prisoner's hand, but I did not see him take it down, as it was behind me; it might have fallen. It is a very small room; if he had intended to rob me, he might have stuck me to the heart with the knife. I did not, at the last meeting, express great indignation at Owen for not coming, and never said it was all a "humbug." Howard was making some observations on him for not coming, but I never joined, for up to the time I was attacked, I considered the transaction bona fide.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Sir, upon the oath you have taken, and recollecting your back was to the prisoner when you were first struck, was it not a blow with the fist? A. No! that I will swear - it was a very severe blow, but I was not stunned- when I turned round, the prisoner had the bat in his right hand; he appears to be a weaker man than I - I threw him twice, and the only difficulty I had in any part of the transaction was, to get the knife; he had the knife in his left hand; I could hold the knife and reach the poker, with which I gave him, perhaps, three blows with a good deal of force on the head; I cannot well tell whether the knife continued in his left hand, but I had it occasionally in both hands, and always by the blade; the first time I saw it in his hand was the moment he fell - he did not fall near the shelf, where I had seen it lay - that I will swear; he had the bat in his right hand when he fell - he did not fall from a blow - I threw him; I had not the poker in my hand at the time he fell; when the persons were at the door, he did not add that he would give me satisfaction when and where I liked; he did not state that he bought the bat as a present to his landlord's child that I remember, though I will not swear he did not; a black cat did come into the room, and he used the bat to drive it out - I will not swear that he did not say at the time, that the bat had been bought for a different ball than so black a one and it would answer the purpose as well as any thing else - he might have said so, but I have no knowledge of it; he might have sat down with me, but I swear that the greater part of the time he was walking about - he appeared agitated and irritated, and accounted for it by the absence of Owen; as well as I can remember, I stated before the Magistrate that, in the course of struggle, he called, "John John;" I am almost positive that I did; I cannot call to my mind whe ther any one said at the door that they would burst it open, if it were not opened - it might have been said; I have not examined the premises since; I cried Murder! loudly, but I do not know whether it was heard at the next house - I do not know whether I could have overpowered the prisoner; I admit that I broke the knife before I threw him for the last time; I cannot tell how long a time elapsed between my going out of the room and securing the prisoner, for I was below stairs - I cannot tell whether he was left alone; I did not mind whether I saw any persons in the house when I went to meet him on the Tuesday; when he asked me to say it was a quarrel, I promised to do so, under the supposition that his friends were at hand; I do not think that, in the agitation of the moment, I could have been mistaken, as to the expressions he used in respect of help; I cannot say which of the two were most wounded; there was some conversation about bills, but the 450l. was bona fide to be left.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. A surgeon attended you? A. Yes, and I showed him the state I was in; I was not wounded in any respect when I went there.</p>

            . I live at No, 36, Red Lion-square; the prisoner lodged in the house, and occupied two attics, I believe - I think he had entered on his fourth week. On the day of this transaction, I went up stairs, about four o'clock, upon hearing the cry of Murder! I returned and procured the poker, and, in my passage up again, I asked a painter to go up with me, which he did; I went to the door of the prisoner's apartment, where I heard a scuffling; I knocked, and demanded the cause of it - a dead silence ensued for a few moments, when I heard a half-suppressed voice pronounce the words, "Will you premise -?" I then demanded admittance more loudly than before; some one from within desired me to retire, saying it was only a quarrel, and all settled; I said I should like two voices to tell me that it was settled; the assertion was then repeated, by the same voice, that all was settled, but, on my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210057"/>asserting that I had persons with me who would not be satisfied without admittance, the door was immediately unlocked- I opened the door, and took the prosecutor down stairs to a back kitchen, or rather scullery; he said he had 500l. about him, but I did not see him produce it from his pocket. Cooke, the constable, took the prisoner into custody; when he was taken, I heard him express that, which would lead us to conclude that they had only been quarrelling, he said he thought it unfair that the prosecutor's individual evidence should be received in preference to his own, and they ought to have been allowed to fight it out fair - I do not recollect that the prosecutor made any complaint in his presence about what had happened; the prisoner and prosecutor were both wounded, and the prosecutor was bleeding copiously - I recollect the prisoner saying that the circumstance of the door being locked was against him, but he endeavoured to explain it, by saying that there was no other fastening to the door, and the lock being inside, he had locked it to prevent the inconvenience of sitting in a draught - he had locked it; he stated that he had been accused of assaulting the prosecutor, but made no direct reply; I have a ring, which I received from a little boy, who is now in Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he say that circumstances were against him; or that they appeared against him? A. That they were against him, and he accounted for it by stating that the door was locked, but that that was the only way of fastening it; I stated at the door that I would not be put off with the reply which I had heard; and, to the best of my judgment, it was the same voice said, "It is only a quarrel," as said, "Will you promise?" there was no contradiction made by any other voice, though I had explained the object of my coming - the prisoner all along stated that it had been a quarrel; I do not remember that any thing was said to me by any one when the door was first opened; I took hold of the prosecutor's hand, and took him down stairs; in going down, I asked what it was about, and he said the man had attempted to murder him - he never assented to the representation of the prisoner, that it was a quarrel; he told but one story from beginning to end; to the best of my belief, the prisoner was left alone up stairs - he was apprehended in about half an hour, but he could not well have escaped, as there were persons at the door, and on the stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Why did you take the prosecutor to the kitchen in preference to any other part of the house? A. Because I generally occupy the kitchen for my family, and knowing that his wounds wanted washing I took him there.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live at No. 33, Red Lion-square; I was sent for between three and four o'clock, and the prosecutor gave me the prisoner in charge; I went into the sitting-room, occupied by the prisoner, where I found this bat - I saw a poker there, and the glass of the window was broken; I searched the prisoner, and found on him 5d. in halfpence; I went into his bed-room, and found a hat, a cap, a waistcoat, two old shirts, two or three pairs of stockings, and a few collars; I saw the door which leads to the leads of the house, and found marks of blood on it - that door fastens with two bolts; I did not find any knife in the room, but I told the prisoner what the prosecutor had said about a knife, and his answer was, that he wished he had thrown away every d - d thing that was bloody; I found the papers produced under the grate, in the prisoner's bed-room, not in the sitting room; I found another paper folded up, on the table, in the sitting-room; I looked for the knife on the roofs of the houses that day, but could not find it for the snow; I went again the next day, and found the handle on the roof of No. 34, and the blade on the roof of No. 38; this is the knife - it is what is called a Spanish knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was any body with you when you took the prisoner? A. Yes, Mr. Izard- I took him about four o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can tell; I believe no one had hold of him - he was up in his room; and, as I was informed by some one that he had a dagger, I went home and provided myself with a cutlass, and went back and took him.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Have you examined the knife? A. Yes; it is sharp on both sides - I saw the prosecutor had two wounds on his head, and his clothes were very bloody.</p>

            . I am a chemist, and live at No.7, Orange-street, Red Lion-square. I was applied to for the prosecutor, on the day of the transaction; I found he had a wound on the top of his head, another over his right eye, and his hands were severely cut; the wound on the top of his head was of a triangular form, and there was a slight crack on the top of the skull - it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this bat, and I should think it was done by this round part of it - it was done by a blunt instrument; the wound on the eye was a contused wound, done apparently with the edge of the bat: the cuts on the hand had been evidently produced by clasping some sharp instrument - they were just at the bend of the fingers in the left hand, and the outside of the thumb of the right hand was cut also; the wounds were such, that a person grasping a blade might have received. I dressed the prisoner's wounds afterwards - they were on the back part of his head, and appeared to be caused by a fall; I said to him, "How came you in such an affray as this?" he said, "It was merely a quarrel - he called my friend a humbug." I saw the prosecutor's money - there was nearly 500l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you think the wounds on the prosecutor's hand were inflicted by his endeavouring to wrest the knife from the prisoner? A. I should think they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were all the wounds on the prisoner such as you suppose were occasioned by a fall? A. Yes, except one cut on his hand, and a blow on the side of his head; I bound up the prosecutor's wounds with proper bandages; the wound over the eye was the worst; I do not think there was any danger from either of the wounds - the wounds on the top of the head might have been dangerous had it been inflicted with a heavier instrument; the wound on the back of the prisoner's head was from a severe blow, but it did not present to me an appearance of having received three or four blows with a poker; I, however, do not consider myself competent to decide that.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Suppose a person to have hold of a cutting instrument in his left hand, might he not, by that means, have been disabled, in some measure, from using his right hand? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I examined the prosecutor's wounds - they were on a part of the head where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210058"/>they might have been dangerous - the wound over the eye bled very much; they were such as I would attribute rather to this bat than to a pugilistic contest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Has it ever been in your experience to examine a person who has been in a pugilistic contest? A. Yes, and I have found bleeding wounds from blows on the head in that case; I do not consider that the prosecutor's life was ever in danger.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the wound on the back of the head a contused wound? A. Yes; the wound over the eye was an incised wound - it was a cleaner cut than the other - I should think it might have been inflicted with the edge of this bat; there are different sorts of wounds, what we call lacerated, contused, and incised wounds, and some partaking of the nature of two of these wounds; if I were speaking as a surgeon, I should denominate the wound over the forehead as an incised wound; there was very little contusion in that wound, from there being more integuments over the eye; I should call it an incised wound, produced by some sharper instrument than that which inflicted the other wound; or from the edge of that instrument; the blunt part could not have made such a wound; there was no swelling accompanying the wound on the eye, and very little discolouration; I saw the prosecutor the same evening, and am still in attendance on him.</p>

            . I found this ring in the front kitchen, on the Friday following - I do not know whether Mr. Mullay had been washing there or not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in an exceedingly long address to the Court, stated that Owen and himself, being in had circumstances, had determined to answer the prosecutor's advertisement, and persuade him to lodge a sum of money in a banker's hands in the joint names of Owen and the prosecutor's; conceiving that Owen could then make the banker's a house of reference, and by that means to obtain goods on credit to a considerable amount; that he was appointed to conduct the negotiation. He then entered into a minute detail of his several interviews with Mr. Mullay, who was willing to deposit the sum; that on the day in question, Mr. Mullay called for the purpose of meeting Owen, who did not fulfil his engagement; that he had only placed the poker in the fire for the purpose of making it burn brighter: Mr. Mullay began to express his disappointment at Owen not coming, and he advised his writing a note; that he had bought the bat, to present to his landlady's child, in return for her attention to him when ill. Mr. Mullay at last displayed much anger at Owen's not arriving, and stated that he was humbugged; and the prisoner, feeling irritated at such language, struck him in the face with his fist; Mr. Mullay then seized the poker, and the prisoner the bat, when a scuffle ensued, and both were alternately on the ground: in the scuffle a knife was knocked off the mantel-shelf, and the prisoner, fearing Mr. Mullay might seize it, took it up himself; the prosecutor gave him several violent blows on the head and body with the poker, and, supposing the prisoner might use the knife to defend himself, called Murder! during the scuffle the prisoner succeeded in breaking the knife against the wainscoat, and put both blade and handle into his pocket. The alarm having brought the neighbours up, the prisoner observed to the prosecutor that it was necessary an explanation should be given, as he had called murder; to which he assented, and the prisoner opened the door, and the prosecutor stated to the persons assembled that they had been quarrelling. He declared the only object he had was, to have the money deposited at the banker's, in order to make them his house of reference; and appealed to the Court, whether it was possible he could expect to overcome a person of the prosecutor's strength; that he had only acted in self-defence; and concluded by solemnly appealing to the Almighty for the truth of his statement.</p>

On the 10th of January I hired the cart and mare, to bring a load of fire-wood to town; I employed McCarthy for the day - I was to allow him part of the profit for selling the wood - I had known him about a month - he was with me in Thames-street, Rotherhithe, when the cart was loaded; I came to town with him, to take the money for the wood; I placed the cart at the corner of New-street, Shoe-lane; McCarthy ran away for a quarter of an hour, leaving me in the cart; he came back, saying he had got an order for four hundred bundles of wood, at a private house, and was to have 1l. for it; but first of all, I was to have one hundred and fifty in a basket to take down a court, as he said I could not take the horse down there - I went away, to deliver two hundred bundles, leaving him in care of the cart; when I returned, the horse and cart were gone - I found the mare and cart within half a mile of my house, at Rotherhithe, but the wood was gone- nobody was with the horse; I had not seen the other prisoners all day - I knew King before, but not Lee.</p>

               <p>"DEAR SIRS, Monday Morning.</p>
               <p>"I have this moment taken up my pen to write these few lines to know what your pleasure is concerning me; for my conduct deserves great punishment; but the dread of leaving my poor mother, when she gets past labouring for her bread, and it being my duty to assist her in her distress, and last hours compels me to make this supplication to pray of you, if I confess to you where I took the tea, on Thursday, that you will have compassion on me this time; for I do not ask you to employ me again, for if I am at liberty, and please God to raise me up a friend, I should, to the atmost of my power, try to make you amends as soon as I possibly could; for the dread also of being confined in a place where the worst characters are, might soon be the cause of my death; for I am sure to be made the sport of those who could hear. I am afflicted it is true; but I am sure I could never be sent out of the country, for my hearing is gone, and I could not hear any evidence against me; so I beg of you, that if you have any compassion left for me, you will never hear the like of me again. I pray your forgiveness for the sake of my dear father, whose awful death you are well acquainted with. Pray forgive me! for God's sake, do - for the sake of my being the only friend that my dear mother and sister have to reside with them; and I pray God blessing on your heads, and may you live to see me yet become a useful member of society: for I promise this time, once for all, by God's blessing I will never enter the cursed ale-house again; and will ever pray for you, is the penitent and humble prayer of the unfortunate, disobedient and unfaithful servant,</p>
               <p>"J. H. RAVER."</p>

Whorrod said he did take the flat to Williams, and also a tub of butter at Waite's request; and Waite said he did tell him to take them there; but did not mean any harm, that he had borrowed 17s. from another clerk in the yard, and left it in pledge with Williams, for money he had borrowed to pay him.</p>

I have been living at the City of London Tavern, since I have been a gentleman's servant - I left there the beginning of the summer, and since that I have been at home with my father at Bury St. Edmunds - he is a bookbinder. On the 20th of January, about one o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18280221-51-crimeloc271">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How were you knocked down? A. I received a blow behind my head quite suddenly - I could not tell whether it was from a fist or what - it knocked me completely down; the blow was on the back part of my skull; and when I was down, I received a blow on the forehead; I could not tell what it was from - I resisted as much as I could, and recovered my feet; I can swear there were two men about me; but there might be three - while I was down my watch, chain, seal, and ring were taken from my fob;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210061"/>I felt them drawn out by the man while I was down - I struggled and got up - one ran one way, and one another; there might be a third man - I followed the prisoner, who was one of them - I called "Watch!" and "Stop thief!" and pursued the prisoner - I am confident he is one of the men who assisted in robbing me; I cannot say whether he is the man who struck me - but he is one who robbed me. I was not above ten or twenty yards from him when I got up - I kept him in sight all the way, till the watchman took him; I swear he is one of the men - when he was taken, I asked if he knew any thing of it. He said he was the man who took my watch from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask if he knew any thing of it? A. I mean, I asked if he had got my watch, hoping to get it again. He said No; he had not got it, but he was the man who took it from me, and gave it to his companion, John Francis - I have not recovered it.</p>

I said, "Now you want your friends - where are they? "he said he went with three young women. I said, "Where do they live? I will send for them; "he said they lived at Aldgate; and when I said I would send for them, he seemed much agitated. The prosecutor said,"Give me my watch." I said I had searched him, and he had not got it. The prisoner said he should have the watch by twelve o'clock to-morrow. I said, "You have not got it."He said, "I'll tell you all about it: a man named John Francis has got it, and if you go to Bishopsgate Church-yard you will be sure to meet him." I went with the prosecutor, but did not meet him - I went at two o'clock to Savage-court, where John Francis lived, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He promised me what he would do, if I could get the watch. I said, I happened to know the young man who was in the custody of another watchman - they let him go, and took me. Witness. That is not true.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Gracechurch-street; at the end of Fenchurch-street, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running - he was the first person running, and ran against me. I prepared myself for him; and when he saw me get close to him, he crossed - I followed him; he turned round to me; put his head down, and his hand out to touch me in the breast - I caught hold of him, and asked what was the matter - he said it was nothing but a fight - I took him up to the crowd, and they said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is false - I stopped directly he took me; he said, "What is the matter?" I said "There was a cry of Stop thief! and I think there is a fight or robbery - now take me to the mob, and see if I am the man;" he took me to the mob, and delivered me to another watchman; they had the young man in custody - he went away. I am a Jew - it is our holidays, and my friends are at the Synagogue. The prosecutor was quite intoxicated; he fell down twice, and was obliged to lay hold of the officer's arm; he told the Lord Mayor he was intoxicated, but just as he was saying so the Lord Mayor was inquiring for the watchman, and it was not put down in the deposition.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. It is false; I did not fall down at all - I was not intoxicated.</p>

I saw the prisoner in company with two more; I saw the prisoner pass Mr. Mellish, put his hand to his pocket, and, with his two fingers, draw the handkerchief out, and give it to a man who stood by him, with a boy - that man put it up his sleeve. I told Mr. Mellish, who felt and missed it- he followed me; I said, "These are the two - one on the left, and the one on the right has got your handkerchief, and that is the boy who picked your pocket; if you will take him I will take the other;" I went over to the man, and found the handkerchief up his sleeve: I advised the prosecutor to lay hold of the boy (the prisoner) who had picked his pocket, but he seemed flurried, and I gave him the man to hold while I pursued the prisoner, and took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

He did not return the horse and chaise. We went to Bow-street, and found him there, in Brown's custody, that evening - I am sure he is the man; he was quite a stranger - I never saw him before.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I drove up to the door; he said,"Do you want to sell your horse?" I said, in a joke,"What do you mean to give me for it?" he said 2l., and, being rather in liquor, I took the 2l.; he then said, "What will you take for the harness?" I said 10s. - he offered me 5s.; I have friends, but did not wish to let them know of it.</p>

            . I conduct the business at the Britannia public-house, Gray's Inn-lane-road, for John Andrews, the landlord. On Tuesday, the 15th of January, about half-past nine o'clock, Mr. Smith, Jun. came for half a pint of rum, and a pot of half and half; he tendered me a 5l. note - I gave him charge; I looked at the note - it appeared rather oily, which I made an observation on at the time: I asked him whose it was, and where he got it, and in consequence of what he said, I wrote on it."Richard Smith, Britannia-street, 15th of January, 1828." On the 18th, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at my house with Smith, Jun. - I cannot exactly say at what time; they had a pint of ale in the tap-room, and after drinking it, the prisoner came to the bar, and asked me the price of gin by the gallon - he ordered seven quarts, as that would not require a permit; I asked if he wanted any rum - he said Yes, I might send him a couple of bottles; he put me down a card, with "Lewis, No. 57, Lancaster-street, Burton-crescent on it;" the gin was to go the following day, which was Saturday, about eleven o'clock, as he said the hay-cart was coming; and the rum was to go on the Monday following; he said I might send that to Smith's, as Smith was going to work for him there, or I might send it to Lancaster-street if I thought proper - he gave me a 5l. note; I gave him 3l. 17s. in change, and asked him his address; he gave me No. 57, Lancester-street, Burton-crescent, and gave me the name of Mr. Shorter; I wrote that name and address on the note - this is it (looking at it) - he stood quite close to me at the time I wrote that; I gave him the change - he went into the tap-room, and, I think, drank one glass of ale, and then went out immediately - this was on Friday. After he was gone I looked at the note I had received from him - I had still in my possession the note I received on the 15th; I had put that into a bag - I compared them together, suspecting the other, and in consequence of the observation I made on them, I put on my hat, and went to Mr. Smith's, in Britannia-street; young Smith came out with me, and we went to Burton-crescent; we called at a public-house in Lancaster-street - we could gain no intelligence there, but in consequence of what young Smith told me, I procured Gower, an officer - I called for Mr. Hambrook, a publican, to inquire the sign of a house; we then went in a direction for the Henley Arms public-house, in the Hornsey-road, and about twenty yards before we got to the Henley Arms we overtook the prisoner - Smith, senior, was in his company; they both went into the Henley Arms together - Hambrook followed them- the officer went in, then I, and then Smith, junior. I called the prisoner out of the parlour, and went up stairs with him; I said, "Mr. Shorter, I think this is a bad 5l. note you have given me;" he said, "If it is I will change it for you;" I said I was very much obliged to him - he put his hand into his pocket, and could not find five sovereigns - he pulled out 3l. 18s.; I returned him 1s., saying I only wanted 3l. 17s., and that would settle the 5l. note, not having sent the spirits; I gave him the 5l. note back, saying that settled the 5l.: I then told him I had a 5l. note which I took on the Tuesday previous, of Mr. Smith, which I suspected to he bad; I then called up Smith, senior, and said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "Mr. Smith, this is a 5l. note I took of your son on Tuesday - it is a had one, and perhaps Mr. Shorter will change it; the prisoner could not find money to change it, and he called to another person named Smith to lend him four sovereigns - Smith came up, and said he had not got four sovereigns - the prisoner was searched by a constable the moment after, and I saw two 5l. notes produced from his great coat pocket, and the one I had returned him was found in his waistcoat pocket, where he had put it. I gave the second 5l. note which I had received from Smith's son, to Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember my calling on the 16th, and your coming in and lighting the fire? A. I cannot swear to that - I recollect lighting the fire one day, but cannot say when - the prisoner was there then; that was after I received the note from young Smith, and before I received the one from the prisoner; young Smith was with him - I cannot say how long they were there: my house is two doors from Smith's. I sat down and drank with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you had the best gin 1s. lower than anybody else, if I wanted any for the country? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not say I should be that way in a few days, and would give you an order? A. He never mentioned a word of the kind; he called on the 18th - he came to the bar, and spoke to me first about the gin; I did not speak a word to him about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I told you I was going down to Sam Smith's, at Hornsey, the Archway House public-house? A. He did not tell me a word about that.</p>

            , a carpenter; we live near the Britannia in Gray's Inn-lane. On the 15th of January the prisoner came to my father's about three o'clock in the afternoon - I cannot say I did not know him; but it was between seven and eight years since I had seen him - my father and him went out together - I saw him again that evening between nine and ten o'clock - it was a snowy night - my father was gone to bed; my mother let the prisoner in; he said he wanted to see my father; my mother said he was gone to bed; he said he must see him, and went up stairs to him - he was sitting by the fire in my father's room wet. I was up there - I heard him say he must see my father - he said he was wet, and must have something to drink - he told me to get half a pint of rum, and a pot of half and half - he gave me a 5l. note to pay for it; I went to the Britannia, and gave Owers the 5l. note I had received from him; he gave me 4l. 18s. 7 1/2d. in change, and enquired where I had received the note - I told him, then returned; gave Shorter the change, and told him Mr. Owers, at the Britannia, looked at the note, and said it looked rather oily, and that Owers said he should not put his name on it, but mine - Shorter said that was all right; it made no difference whose name was put to it - he asked us to get him a lodging for the night - I went to Owers, but could not get him a bed there - he did not stay at our house that night; he came again on Wednesday, the 16th - nothing passed about any note then - he came again on the 18th, and asked my father to go out with him; my father said he must go and be shaved first; and while he was gone, Shorter asked me to go to the Britannia and have a pint of ale. I accompanied him there, and had the ale - while we sat drinking there, he went out of the tap-room;' he was gone some minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210064"/>I got up and went to the door to see where he was - I opened the tap-room door, and saw him at the bar with some papers or cards in his hand, talking to Owers; he came into the tap-room after that, and drank a glass of ale I did not see any money pass between him and Owers - he took a drop of ale, and went out directly - I went out also, and instead of going to our house, he was going down the street; I said, I dare say my father was at home - he then turned, and went to my father's house; my father and he went out together - Owers came to our house in about ten minutes (this was about two o'clock), and in consequence of what passed, we went to Lancaster-street - we did not find the prisoner there; we got Gower, the constable, and went to Hambrook's; we then went to Hornsey-road - I saw him proceeding up to the Henley Arms - I followed, and was not present when he was called up stairs - I waited in the parlour, and went up just after they had searched him - he was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not first give you half-a-crown to fetch the gin, before I gave you the 5l. note, and I believe your sister went to fetch it? A. No; we had no gin before you went up to my father - my sister was not sent out that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I say I should go and sleep just by the turnpike? A. No; not a word of the sort, I did not persuade him a not to sleep there - he asked me to go and get him a lodging - we got him one at last; I went there with him - when we got there, he said he did not like to sleep at strange lodgings by himself, and I should stop with him - I did so - I cannot say how long we were at the Britannia on the 16th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. During that time, was any thing said about gin? A. We were drinking gin and water - he told Owers he could not get such gin as that, down in his country, and a few words passed between them, but I did not pay much attention to what they said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not Owers fetch me three different samples of rum, brandy, and gin? A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came and said you had got me a bed, I said I had no money, and must send for something to drink, and must change a 5l. note? A. Not a word of the sort was mentioned.</p>

            . I am the father of the last witness. On the 15th of January, I saw the prisoner at our house about four o'clock, when I came home - I went with him to the Britannia, and had part of a glass of gin and water with him, and went to Lancaster-street, and had some beer; he said he wanted me to do a job in Lancester-street. On the 18th, he came again - I went with him to the Henley Arms; he was taken into custody there - I had known him about fifteen years; but had not seen him for five or seven years before the 15th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I was going to Sam Smith's? A. He said something on the 18th, about wanting to see Sam Smith who used to keep the Bluecoat-boy public-house - he promised me to be on the premises in Lancaster-street, where I was to do the work, by four o'clock - I heard nothing about his returning to my house to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. When the landlord came and said it was a forged note, did I not tell you I knew where I took them? A. He said he could make them all right - he knew where he had taken them. Hambrook went down stairs with the notes in his hand, to fetch a pen and ink to mark them - that was the two found in his coat pocket, and the one found in his waistcoat - I did not say, "They won't change them, will they?"</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him at four o'clock on the 15th, did he come to your house that night when you were in bed? A. yes, between nine and ten; he might stay there an hour; I was present when the gin was brought, and saw my son give him the change, which was 4l. 18s. 7 1/2d.; I did not see him give my son the note.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not the two notes in a pocket-book in my pocket? A.

            . I keep the King's Arms public-house, at Old Brentford, Middlesex. On Tuesday, the 11th of September, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my house - I had known him about twelve months; while he was there my attention was called to him by my wife; a 5l. note was changed for him, in my presence - I gave him the whole change myself, and was going to write a name on the note, but the prisoner said his name was on it - he said he had written it on the back; this is it - (looking at one, No. 56,731) - I pointed out the name to him; he said, I did not know he lived at Hammersmith; he said he did not live there, but had a person carrying on a shop there, and he was to be found there; he had ran a score of 7s. or 8s. that day, which he paid me out of the change; I think he said the shop was a potatoe warehouse; I tried to find him there afterwards, but could not; they said he had been there, but was gone.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes. (looking at the note uttered to Owers on the 18th of January,) This is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature; the one uttered to Owers on the 15th is also forged in every respect, and from the same plate, and is of a similar description; the two found in the prisoner's pocket are also forged, in all respects, and from the same plate; that uttered to Plowman is forged, in every respect, and from the same plate; so is that uttered to Northey, and from the same plate; also those uttered to Woodruff and Drew - they are forged in every respect, and all from one plate; the 10l. note uttered to Field is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature; and the one uttered to Jones - they are both from one plate, I have no doubt; they are coarse imitations, but would pass in ordinary circulation; the one uttered, on the 15th, to Owers, has a thick, greasy appearance, and so has the other one - it arises partly from the quality of the paper, and partly from an attempt to make a water-mark.</p>

            , of Gravesend; his private house is there, but he lived then in Manor-place, Walworth: I delivered him a cargo of tiles out of a French ship; also sixty loads of clover and meadow hay, and some bricks, from Burton-on-the Humber: when we balanced accounts, there was 175l. coming to me - I was paid in these notes: I was paid the chief part in notes, and William Oxley (I being no scholar) used to do my writing for me; when I went I took him with me there to make up the running account between us for twelve months, and a person named Salley was there with him. Oxley made the initials on all these notes - he is now a rider to a person at Bristol, in the wool trade. I sent down for him last Friday afternoon, when I found where he was: my uncle and friends went down, and have not returned - I am informed he is out, and expected back on Monday night, and, if he does return, he will come here by the first coach. I am not sure that he took them from him, because I do not know the names on the back of the notes. I expect him by every coach. I never should have paid them away if I had known them to be forged, but I am sure I took the chief part of them of Salley; I also took 60l. from Tucker, a cow-keeper, and some from Mr. Boddis, a timber-merchant, in the New Kent-road. Oxley generally put initials on the notes whenever I took them - I am waiting for him to bring the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210066"/>accounts up, which he took down with him. I have been expecting to become a bankrupt, and have been keeping the money back - because I endorsed a bill, they threatened to strike a docket against me, and I thought to meet the bill by the first day of the Term in January, and saved some notes for that purpose. Plenty of people in the neighbourhood knew I delivered the goods; there was 41,000 tiles. [After his Lordship had summed up the case, the prisoner added] The reason I did not bring the people I had the notes from is, because I thought it not necessary till I brought the witness to prove I did take them from them: I dare say if the names on the notes were read over to me, I should recollect who I took them from - from June, 1816, to 1827, I turned 15,000l. or 16,000l. As to Smith's 4l., the landlord said, "Give me 3l. 16s." before he gave me back the note, and I did not think of offering him another note. I was going to the Archway House public-house to buy a stock of hay, and meant to give the 10l. as earnest. I took an outer shed of Mrs. Lewis, in Lancaster-street - her husband was coming home out of Whitecross-street Prison, and was then to assign me over the lease of the cow-house. I kept the house at Hammersmith about two months, and, finding it did not answer, gave it up - I let it for 1l. more than I gave for it. I should not have came unprepared with witnesses, but being no scholar, I can not tell what names are on the back of the notes.</p>

In the fore part of the day - it was before dinner, certainly- when I first went up to the warehouse, there was a boy there, and Daniel told him to go - I should think it was about twelve o'clock that I was there; Daniel said to the boy, "You may go down," and he went down before the business began; Mrs. Myers does not live at the warehouse, but I believe it communicates with her house - I was never in the warehouse before; I do not know the boy's name; I most likely should know him again, if I saw him - I suppose he was not more than nine or ten years old; I produced the bill open, in my hand; Mrs. Myers did not take it in her hand - she had no spectacles on; I said, "Mrs. Myers, your son has brought me this bill to be discounted, drawn by yourself, on Walker, Parker, and Co. for 488l. 2s. 2d. is it correct?" she answered, "Perfectly so - we sold them a lot of pig lead for it: if you wish to be further satisfied, Daniel shall show you the book," and it was shown - I said I was fully satisfied; I took Daniel over to my house, and gave him the money; the book was laying on the desk in the same room - it laid outside - I had no occasion to notice whether it was on the desk when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was not fetched from a distant place, by the boy? A. Certainly not - the book might contain more than a quire of paper, but I should suppose not; I saw no writing on it; Mrs. Myers stood by it - I do not know whether she looked into it; I went from Parker and Co's. to her; Daniel Myers asked for Mr. Parker - his name was sent into Mr. Parker's private room, and Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210067"/>Parker came out - I have seen Mr. Parker since, and it was him - Mrs. Myers was taken up about four months after - I found her at the Mansion-house, on a Thursday, I think; she was remanded till Monday; I cannot say whether she went there of her own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you before you saw her there, that if there was any suspicion, she would be there to make her defence to it? A. She never said so to me, nor in my presence; Mr. Charles Isaacs attended at Mr. Gates', and said Mrs. Myers would be ready to make her appearance whenever it was necessary; Mr. Gates told me of that on that morning; Mr. Elias Isaacs attended there, as my friend, not as my solicitor; Mr. Gates attended as solicitor; when a remark was made about a Jew witness, Mr. Isaacs interfered, in a manner that was creditable; I always considered Mrs. Myers a woman of substance; I should think her brother, Mr. Joseph, is a respectable and substantial man.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK here declined proceeding further in the case.</p>

On the morning stated in the indictment, the 7th of December, I missed 43l. in sovereigns and Bank notes, also a cheque for 8l. 14s., and sixteen silver spoons; my money was kept in a large box, in the front room, first floor; I had buried my wife that day - I used to sleep in that room, but did not wish till it was cleaned; I had seen Barry that day, at the house; when I returned from my wife's funeral, about half-past one o'clock, he was in the room where the box was, and I thought he seemed in grief - he went up stairs, to the top-room of the house, and I did not see him afterwards, till he was apprehended; my box was locked - I found, about half-past one or two in the morning, that it was brought down stairs from the first floor into the back yard, and broken open; the watchman called me up at that hour - I found my tap-room window let down; I was the last person up at night; every thing was secure when I went to bed, the doors and windows - the windows bolt, they have no bars; the watchman had come in at the tap-room window, and came up to my bed-room, and alarmed me; I got up, and found the box in the yard, and the cash which was in it taken out, also the silver spoons; I observed no marks of violence in any part of the house - the box had been broken open with a poker - the lock had been started - suspicion fell on the prisoner, as he never came to the house after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who slept in your house that night? A. My maid and man-servant, and two children, the eldest of whom is thirteen years old; I found the servants still in bed, at the top of the house, and the children were in bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You do not know where Barry was when you found the box in the yard? A. No, I do not know who took it down there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the last time you saw him in the house? A. Half-past one o'clock in the day, when I returned from the funeral; I saw him going up stairs at that time; I thought he went up to go to bed, as he had been sitting up the previous night with me.</p>

            . The prisoner, Barry, lodged with me, at No. 5, Well-street, Blackwall, Poplar; he lodged with me one night, about three weeks before Christmas, and came back again after Christmas; I cannot tell on what day of the month he first lodged with me - it was only one night, and he came back about three weeks after he left - that was about a fortnight after Christmas; he had a bundle in his hand; he paid me 23s. for the fortnight he had lodged with me; he said he could not give me any more money at that time; he went away, came back again, said he had no money, and gave me a cheque (looking at a cheque of 8l. 14s., produced by F. Fagan) - I cannot read, but this is very much like it; I showed it on Monday morning, the day after Barry gave it to me, to the prisoner, Murray, who is a pawnbroker - I showed it him to tell me what it was; he said it was out of date, and offered me 5s. for it; I do not know whether he was aware that I could not read; he told me the amount of it; I did not agree to take the 5s.; he said if he was to cash it for me, would I take half; I considered a little - I wanted money, and next morning I agreed to that - he gave me four sovereigns and 7s., and the day Mr. Ross came to me about it, Murray sent me the remainder by a man - that was after Barry was taken - he knew the enquiry was going on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to have received any further money from him? A. No; I had agreed to take the 4l. 7s. - I have not had the cheque since; I did not see Barry afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. He lodged with you one night, then left, and returned a fortnight after Christmas? A. Yes - he owed me 30s. for board and lodging - 10s. for a bed, and 10s. for the time he was with me before; I gave him no change for the cheque - he told me the value was 8l. 14s., and said he had no money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he lodge it with you as security, or were you to pay him the balance? A. He said it was as good as money to me, in case he should leave, and go to sea, if he got a ship.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You took the cheque to a pawnbroker's shop, kept by Miss Wood, I believe? A. Yes; Murray is her shopman - there was nobody present when I gave him the cheque; there was nobody opposite to me - I cannot say nobody was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not represent to Murray that you had received it from a lodger who was a very honest man? A. I never named such a thing to him - I said I received it from a lodger; I did not say he owed me 30s., but showed it to him - he offered me 5s. - I said I would not give it him for that; I said I got it from a lodger, but said nothing about his being honest.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, did not you tell Mr. Ross, after, that you found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210068"/>the cheque in a cook-shop? A. When he first asked me the question; I said so, as I was afraid I could not find Barry, but I went to Gravesend and found him; I did not say when I found it, or where, except that it was at a cook-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Murray over and over again, requested by you to give cash for it, before he consented? A. Never; he did not say he would give me half, and the rest when he had ascertained that it was good; I did not send a woman for the rest of the money - her name was not McCarthy; I never sent her to say I wanted the other part of the money to go to Gravesend, to apprehend the person who gave it to me.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Miss Wood, the pawnbroker, and was in the shop when Roman came - she was in the habit of pawning goods at our shop; we both knew her: Murray is apprentice there; she came on the 18th, 19th, or 20th of January, and asked Murray if he would change her a cheque - he looked at it, and told her it was an old date, and asked where she got it - she said she had it from a lodger, who was an honest man, and it was for 30s.; she pressed Murray very much to give her cash for it; and, I believe, said he might get it changed where he was known, very likely; he went to Wood's, the corn-dealer's, and got change; she had gone away, and returned in about half an hour, and asked if he had got it changed - he said Yes, and he would let her have half of it, and keep the other half till further notice, till he found whether it was good or not.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did he give her any money? A. He put the other half into a drawer, till further notice. Mr. Ross called about it on the 5th of February, and when he was gone Ronan came in and asked Murray to let her have the remainder of her money; he asked her what for, and told her the prosecutor had been there; she said she wanted it to defray her expenses to Gravesend, for the purposes of Justice, to get the man apprehended; she did not mention his name - he asked what she had done with the first 4l. 7s. - she said she had given it to her father, to pay his expenses to Ireland - he sent her the other money.</p>
               <p>Q. When she first came, did Murray offer her 5s.? A. No, he offered her nothing for it; I was by his side, and must have heard him if he had; he said nothing about what he would give for it.</p>

Here is the cash book - it is not entered there: there is no entry of 2l. 9s. received from Mr. Ward: all this page is in his writing; it extends to the 29th of September: there is no entry at all of any money received from Ward; all the entries are in his writing, except one of the 11th of August - I do not know whose writing this is. Mr. Buckle keeps the book, and, when the money comes in, he gives the prisoner the book to enter it: the order-book lays on the desk, and the entries are made by whoever is present, but the cash-book is kept by the prisoner, as confidential clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not other people enter in it as well as him? A.

When Skinner is absent, other people enter that: I have made entries since I have been home, since October; I see no writing in it besides mine and Skinner's - it is always kept locked up in the safe: I do not know what happened before October, except from the book: the prosecutor's son occasionally entered goods that went out: he was there in August: there is no other persons hand-writing in the cash-book.</p>

            . I am one of the firm of Ward and Co., of Water-street, Bridgewell-precinct: I received some goods from Buckle in August, and on the 1st of September, the prisoner applied for payment; I was behind my desk, and gave my clerk 2l. 13s. 1d., which was 4s. 1d. more than I ought to have paid; I saw him take it round, and hand it to the prisoner; he gave me a receipt, which I produce; I believe it to be his writing - the bill is made out by him. Mr. Buckle afterwards sent in a bill, and it was charged 1d. a pound less.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner give that receipt into your hand? A. He gave it to my clerk or me, I cannot swear which, but think I saw him hand it to my clerk. I swear I saw him receive the money; I saw him writing, and the receipt came round to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was anybody but yourself and clerk in the counting-house when the prisoner received the money? A.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The cause of my present situation is the extraordinary manner in which my employer conducts' his business: he received money from me often, and immediately ordered me into the warehouse to pack up goods, before he allowed me to enter it. I had immense business on my hands and have forgotten to enter it, having all the goods to enter which had been sent out during my absence; and thinking he was not in the habit of examining the books, I have omitted to enter it till it has escaped my memory. <rs id="t18280221-63-verdict333" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 10th of November the prisoner was in my employ; he never gave me an account of 13l. 15s. received from Frost and Co., who dealt with me - they owed me a few shillings more than that sum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Mr. Dodson? A. Yes; he is here - this money was taken in November; my son left me about October; he worked in my shop, and occasionally made entries in the journal when the clerk has been out; he never entered in the cash-book, for I kept that locked up for the last six months - I may have left it out occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, in several instances, received money from the prisoner, and then sent him into the factory, before he had time to make entries? A. Never, on my oath - I always said, directly I received money, "George, be sure you enter it:" I always allowed him time to enter it. My son was my journeyman.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you did leave your books about, could an entry be taken out that was once made? A. No; if it was entered it would appear: my son had left me when this was received; the prisoner left in January, and never told me of this sum, nor paid it to me: I sent my son-in-law for the money after it was paid.</p>

            . Here is no entry in the cash-book of 13l. 15s. 6d. being received from Frost: the only entry on the 10th of November is 2s. received from Mr. Richards; that is in the prisoner's writing: there is no entry of this sum at all - the highest sum in this page is 25l. received from Mr. Wood, on the 17th of November: twelve of the entries here are my writing: I received no money of Frost's account - the prisoner never told me he had received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at this page, whose writing is that? A. One line I do not know about; here is one by myself; the rest is the prisoner's: here is one entry of Mrs. Buckle's, but that is money paid - the book is kept locked up; she never enters money received - if she receives money, she tells me, and I enter it. I know there have been quarrels between Buckle and his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the quarrels because that she had received money and not brought it to account? A. I believe the principal quarrel was because the books were not properly looked after - there is no entry of here of money received for six months past - the book was occasionally left out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever heard Mr. and Mrs. Buckle quarrel about her receiving money, and not entering it? A. No; it was, that neither she nor the son had properly looked after the books; as he was unable to do it himself.</p>

            . My father dealt with Buckle. I produce a bill and receipt for goods delivered and paid for- I paid the prisoner the money on the 10th of November, 1827 - it was 13l. 15s. 6d.; I paid it into his own hands, and he wrote this receipt (read.) Another bill was sent in for the same goods, in January, after the prisoner had left.</p>

               <p>JOHN BUCKLE. I am the prosecutor's son. I left my father's house about three weeks or a month before Christmas - the prisoner had a great deal to do when he was there; he was not always busy - my father has, at times received money from him, and sent him into the factory before he had time to enter it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When was that? A. I cannot state any particular time; I never knew the prisoner keep money back. I left my father in October - it is less than twelve months ago that this has happened; it was more than once - I cannot say how often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not, in October, discharged from the factory, and employed at 5s. a day to collect debts? A. Not to my knowledge; I left in October.</p>

            . I am an officer; I am not related to the prosecutor; he lives in Plumbers-row, City-road. On the 17th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, I was opposite his house, and saw the prisoners in company, looking in at the window and door, and then come back again - there was another a little distance from them; I saw them both particularly engaged at one end of the window, as if they were cutting the glass; I saw Towell as if in the act of taking something from the window, and giving it to Dawkins; they turned, and went towards Plumbers-street- I went into the shop, then followed and took them at the corner of Plumbers-street - I had a good deal of trouble with Towell, and gave Dawkins to another to hold while I secured him; Dawkins escaped from that person; I called Stop thief! and Brown brought him back in two or three minutes; I found a knife on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not take another boy that night? A. Yes; one Blizard - that was quite in a different part of the evening; I took him for having a bundle till he could account for it - it turned out that he was innocent: he has been transported before, and I wanted to know if he had his legal discharge. I was about twenty-five yards from the prosecutor's shop - the lamps were all lighted; the knife found on Dawkins had putty on it - it has now crumbled off; and the point has been ground in a particular way; they were three or four minutes at the window.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the horse at the rails - I was standing in Mr. Rees' shop; I received information, went out, and saw the prisoner and a sailor in conversation; I went and stood in a door-way, which was dark- the sailor left the prisoner, and went along Bartholomew-terrace into York-street, then came back to the prisoner, and both went into Cross-street, and returned: the prisoner crossed over towards the horse; some persons came by; he came back, and, in a minute or two, went towards the horse again; the third time he went, he appeared to be stooping under the horse's neck, but whether he untied it or not I cannot say; the door opened, and two ladies came out; he left the door, and went to a baker's-shop window; I went to Mr. Briggs, and in five minutes a cart came by, which darkened the window, and I saw him take the horse from the door-way where it stood - he led it about thirty yards, and just as he stooped down to extricate the bridle or something, I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often have you been with the prosecutor to persuade him to prosecute? A. I never persuaded him - I have called on him four or five times; he was not an acquaintance of mine, but I called when I was going his way - I had no motive in calling; he said, "If you come my way, look in."</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say in one Petit's presence, when the prosecutor expressed his conviction of the prisoner's innocence, "If you don't prosecute, I will?" A. I did; there were some letters on the prosecutor's table; he said they gave him such a character, he had altered his mind; I said if the table was full of gold, I should not alter mine; that I should speak the truth, and if he did not prosecute, I should, to save my recognizance: I do not say he loosened the horse; he stopped, but whether to disentangle the feet I cannot say - it was in the dark.</p>

On Friday, the 11th of January, my wife and I had occasion to go into the Commercial-road. The house only consists of two rooms - we have no servant - I locked the street door myself, between six and seven o'clock and we went out - it was dark then; in about five minutes, when we got to Grove-street, my wife wanted to return for a sixpence, which she had left behind; we returned - I put the key into the door to unlock it, and it was fastened inside - I said there were thieves in the house, and gave an alarm immediately; I held the handle of the door, and the door was pulled inside, to open it - I still held it, and heard persons going up stairs; the window up stairs was thrown open, and out jumped one person - I laid hold of him; that was Nichols; and then the other prisoner dropped down - I laid hold of him - it was the two prisoners; I am quite certain of them - I held them for about a minute, then both broke away from my hold; but I did not loose sight of Nichols - I can safely swear they are both the men who dropped from the window; there were two gas-lights; I could see them plainly, and am certain of them both - I lost sight of Seldon; we went down to the watch-house to give charge of Nichols, and then Seldon was brought in; that was in about ten minutes - I spoke to him with certainly. I went back to my house; found the up-stairs window open, and the table moved into the middle of the room - I did not perceive any thing else - I never saw either of the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all day-light gone at the time the matter happened? A. It was between six and seven o'clock - it was very foggy - day-light had gone; it could not be daylight; but I could see them by the gas-light, as clear as I can see your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know it was between six and seven o'clock? A. It was just as the watchman came on - he comes on at six.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the lamps were away, was there not a glimmering of day-light? A. It is a very dark street.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man was in a wide open place, was there not sufficient light to distinguish his face? A. Quite sufficient. I caught hold of both the men; the second jumped out in about a minute after the other, and he got away in about a minute; they were twisting and struggling with me - I was not frightened; for I had been robbed twelve months before, and wanted to know who the thieves were; I am fifty-five years old - it might be nearly a quarter of an hour before Seldon was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you speak of the time you were robbed; or when you went out with your wife? A. When we went out. Nichols struggled and got away, but I never lost sight of him; he was taken in the same street, about one hundred yards off - I pursued him, and a man, who is not here, stopped him; he delivered him to the watchman, who is here; my street is about three hundred yards long - there were a good many people about; it is a populous little street - three or four persons pursued with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure it was after six o'clock? A. Yes: I went out after six, and returned in five minutes - I did not go into any street or place where there were no lamps lighted.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I left the house with him between six and seven o'clock, leaving every thing safe and fast - the street door was locked; we returned in five or six minutes, and found the door fastened inside - my husband called out, and I saw the two men come from the up-stairs window; the gas-light nearly opposite gave a good light; I could see them perfectly well; the prisoners are the persons; the watchman was on his beat at the time; Seldon got out of my sight, but I ran in the road and kept Nichols in sight till he was stopped. When we were at the watch-house, Seldon was brought in, in five or ten minutes - I could not be certain of him, but my husband swore to him - I saw his face, and was certain they were the two men; I recollected his features, and was certain of him - I found our window wide open, and the table moved into the middle of the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not at first say you could not be certain of them; but your husband swore to them? A. If I did it was a mistake; for I knew them both to be the men; it is not my husband's swearing to them that makes me certain - I could not say so much of one as the other, as he was close by me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you run with your husband? A. I ran by myself - I was about four yards from Nichols - there were people about, but I saw him stopped; there are but two windows to our house; one up-stairs, and one down - there are none behind; there is a back door which I bolted myself before I went out, about five o'clock; there are two back doors, one is up stairs; they were both bolted - the one up stairs had not been unfastened for three or four days - I swear I bolted the one down stairs; there is no other way out behind - my husband shut the shutters - I shut the up stairs window myself; but it was not fastened; it had not been open since the morning; I saw it shut about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before; when I went up to put on my bonnet - I saw the lower window just before I went out, and saw my husband fasten the shutter.</p>

Watch! and Thieves!" a great many people were collected, and Nichols was in hold of somebody - I cannot exactly say who, for there was a great crowd - the prosecutor and his wife were there, and desired me to take him to the watch-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210073"/>house; saying their house had been broken into - they gave him in charge - Seldon was brought in in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes charged with being one of the party who broke into the house - Mrs. Smith was there; I am not certain whether her husband was - Nichols wished very much for his hat; I had taken him without a hat; it was found afterwards; but not in my presence - he wished me very much to let him go, saying that he was a coppersmith and brazier, and out of work - he said nothing to the charge; I did not wait to hear what passed about Seldon - Smith and his wife gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I thought you did not see Mr. Smith at the watch-house? A. Not at first, from the number of people - they both gave charge; I heard Nichols given in charge; but paid no attention to what passed about Seldon - Smith was there to give him in charge; but I did not hear him do it; he was detained at the watch-house on the charge - charge was given; but I paid little attention to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know where Nichols was apprehended? A. It might be sixty or seventy yards from the house - it was in the same street, near a chandler's-shop, nearly opposite the shop; I took him from a person who held him; I do not suppose Smith was a yard from him; Mrs. Smith came to the watch-house five or six minutes before her husband - the watch-house is not a quarter of a mile from the spot; Mr. Smith followed us to the watch-house; I do not know who the man was who stopped Nichols, there was such a crowd; Smith's wife ordered me to take him: whether the man who stopped him followed us to the watch-house, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I am the father of the deceased. My son, John, would be twelve years old in March - he lived with me, and was taken ill on the 26th of December, he kept getting worse till the 23d of January, when he died; he had a doctor, and was admitted into the Northern Dispensary, New-road; the prisoner and him were play-fellows - they had not quarrelled - seven or eight days before his death, he said, "Oh! mother, that turnpike-boy! what he has given me will kill me;" I have no doubt he thought himself in a dying state; he said he had given him some kind of black stuff, in some tea; he did not say how he came to take it; whether it was of his own will, or by persuasion; the prisoner is older than him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Fitzroy-square. I was sent for to attend the deceased on the 18th of January; he was received into the Infirmary, at St. Pancras; he was labouring under the effects of mercury - his mouth was much ulcerated and swollen; I have no doubt he had taken mercury; he said he got something in some tea, from the turnpike-boy, the day after Christmas-day - he considered himself in great danger then - I opened his body after death; the stomach was slightly inflamed; the large intestines were inflamed all over, and there were small ulcers - that might arise from other causes than taking mercury; I attribute his death partly to that and the mouth being slutted.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say his death necessarily arose from taking mercury? A. Decidedly not; the same appearances might arise from other causes; he had taken mercury, no doubt, but I cannot say that occasioned his death.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Crawford-street. I did not know the prisoner before this happened - I was sent for, and found her in bed, and have no doubt she had very recently been delivered of a child - the child was found in a gutter, within ten yards of her bed; there was a bruise on the right side of its head, which might be occasioned by a fall, and I think it was so, from its peculiar situation; it was not moved till I fetched it away; she might have been taken in labour suddenly, and the child fall from her in the street, and that would account for the bruise; I examined the body afterwards, and cannot be certain it was born alive - I cannot say the vital spark was not extinct when it was born - children are often born in a state that requires a medical man; it appeared an eight months' child.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you lived with her Grace? A. Ten years; this equipage always goes to the Theatre with her; I never left any thing in a coach. I do not know Gray, a coachman. A napkin was once left in a coach, and brought back some months ago. The tray and silver candlesticks were in a table-cloth, with two pieces of wax-candle, and a knife; there were two other parcels in the coach, with tea things and refreshments; the coachman could not tell what was in them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you leave these things in the coach? A. No - the housemaid handed the parcel out to me, and I gave it to the porter, who (I am certain) put it within the hall; they were not missed till the morning. I saw them at Marlborough-street-office on the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. About what time in the morning were they missed? A. About half-past ten o'clock; it was before Schofield came: the other parcels were taken down to the housekeeper's room. I went to Covent-garden to see if I could find the link-man, to see if he knew the coachman - I did not go to the office; we suspected the coachman had taken it.</p>

            . I am servant to the Dutchess. The page and I came from the Theatre in a coach; I did not observe the coachman's person. I gave the cloth, containing the tray and candlesticks, first out of the coach, to the page, who gave it to Webb, the porter - when I went in I saw it in the outer hall; I took another parcel out: the page and porter took out a basket which was too heavy for me. I am certain all three parcels were placed within the house. The coachman took his fare, and drove away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you were much enter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210075"/>tained at the Theatre? A. Not much - I had seen the play before; it was late, and I went to bed soon after I came in- the plate was always taken down stairs by one of the servants; I took one parcel down, and the page another - I left the other standing in the hall, and left the porter fastening the door, and thought he would bring it down when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. If you left him fastening the hall, how could any body get it? A. The hall is divided - I left the page and porter standing there; the coachman went as soon as he had his money - I do not say the parcel was there when I went down; I passed it when I first came in, and did not see it afterwards; it was missed in the morning by the under-butler; we immediately suspected it was stolen, and sent to Covent-garden, to ascertain the number of the coach, intending to send to the Police-office. I never left anything in a coach - a napkin was once left, but not by me - it was brought back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these things left in the coach? A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past two o'clock in the morning I stopped the prisoner in Warren-street, Tottenham-court-road, with all this property, tied in a table-cloth; he was near the mews where he keeps his coach; I asked what he had got - he said, only a candlestick - he distinctly said, "A candlestick;" I felt the bundle, and as it contained more than one, I took him to the watch-house; in the way there he offered three or four times to give me the things to let him go - he halted several times, and at one of those times a candlestick fell on the ground; he begged me hard to let him go, and take the property, When he got to the watch-house he said he found them in his coach, but did not say who they belonged to; he said nothing about that before - I at first asked where he got them from, and he said he could not tell; he never told me who they belonged to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not know he was in Thurston's service? A. No - Thurston has lived there eight or nine years; I do not know him to be a respectable man. I have since heard that the prisoner lives in Warren-street; I believe Warren-street is nearer to Stratton-street than the stables are; I think he must pass his own house to go from Stratton-street to the stables. I expect no reward in this case.</p>

On the evening of the 29th, when I was in search of them I saw Liversedge; and on the evening of the 30th I was with some officers, and saw Liversedge again, at his father's house, in Golden-lane; he denied all knowledge of the other prisoners, but after being questioned he acknowledged that he had seen some bundles of linen in their possession, and that they had asked him where they might dispose of it, and where they could get coloured clothes - he denied knowing anything else.</p>

I took them in charge; Taylor then gave me six duplicates, relating to the property, from his pocket; I put them into the watch-house, and went immediately to Liversedge's house, in Hot-water-court, St. Luke's - I found him at home, and told him I had taken the two soldiers - that I knew he had some of the things, and should take him; he then acknowledged pawning two shirts and other things, for 14s., near Cripplegate church, but he could not tell the name; I went and got the things from there, and they were also claimed. I found 9s. on him, which he voluntarily said was part of the money he had pawned them for, and said he had given the soldiers the duplicate.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live in Piccadilly. On Monday evening I and a constable went with the prosecutor to a house in Wardour-street, Soho, to a second floor - the constable went first; the prisoner came out of the front room; the constable said, "Does Mary Ann Hale live here?" she said, "My name is Mary Ann Hale;" there was a person in the back room ill - the bonnet was there; another woman went in to fetch it; the prisoner went into the room once, and wished to go again, but the officer would not let her - the other woman brought us out the bonnet, and a pair of shoes; the prisoner at first said she had never seen Mr. Yarrow, and had never been near his house.</p>

            . I am the proprietor of the sugar. I gave the order for its being fetched: I had bought the lot No. 195, which was twenty-four bags; I was at my warehouse when the cart came, and the man brought but twenty-three bags instead of twenty-four; there were no ink-marks on them then, for the sugar destroys the ink-marks on a wet day; we weighed the twenty-three bags, and found 2 cwt. deficient; we cannot compare the sugars, for they are of different shades - there is nothing beyond the number and weight that we can judge by.</p>

I was coming out of a house, when a man asked me to carry this load of sugar to a grocer's-shop at the bottom of the street; he went on first with my hat; the officer came and stopped me, and told me to carry it back - I could not carry it back very well, and I put it down.</p>

               <p>JOHN MURPHY. It was a very dirty day, but the umbrella was quite clean. <rs id="t18280221-92-verdict479" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am in the same batallion. On the evening of the 22d of January, I came out of the barracks at ten minutes or a quarter past six o'clock, and saw Welch at the corner of Portman-street, about fifty yards from the barrack gate; he had nothing with him at that time; I went up to the barracks soon afterwards, saw a crowd, and heard that two of our soldiers had been robbing a woman- I went out again in about five minutes, and met Welch: I told him his name had been mentioned: he said he had missed no duty, and did not know what it should be mentioned for; I told him what I had heard, and he said, so held him God he had not seen any soldiers or women that night.</p>

The prosecutor applied to me, and said he had lost three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and six shillings; I had one hundred and ninety men there: I ordered the watchman to bring me the two men who had slept near the prosecutor, and I found this money on the prisoner - he said at first that he had no money about him; I desired him to strip - he pulled off his jacket, and I found two shillings in the lining of it - he said he did not know how they got there; I took his shirt, and found four shillings tied up in that, and then he said he could give an account of it; I searched further, and found three sovereigns and a half sewed up in the wristbands of his shirt.</p>

            . I am servant to Captain Simmons - he is a customer to Mr. Dakin; I paid the prisoner the weekly bills, and he has receipted them; here is one for 3s. 4 1/2d., another 3s. 6 1/2d., and another 4s. 8 1/2d.; I paid them all to the prisoner - the last date is the 22d of December.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOSEPH DAKIN. Q. Did the prisoner ever pay you any of these bills? A. No. On the 29th I sent another servant to Captain Simmons, and I told the prisoner he had brought back word that Captain Simmons did not owe me a farthing - he said he had received them, but had lost a sovereign, and did not like to tell me; that the sovereign was one of his own, and he had kept the sovereign which he had received from the customer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you charged him with receiving this money from Captain Simmons, did he not admit that he had received it? A. Yes; I owed him about a fortnight's wages: I have since had the money from his mother.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and asked if he knew what his master accused him of - he said Yes; I said, "Then, you understand you are charged with receiving 1l. 3s. 6d.;" he said Yes; I searched him, and found a sovereign, which he said he had just got from his mother; his master said, "You have not been out;" he said, "Yes, I went out while you was out:" he then said he had kept the money back in consequence of having lost a sovereign of his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of taking money for Mr. Dakin; Mrs. Freeman did not always pay me weekly - sometimes it went two or three weeks, when I received part; I did not give it my master till I received the whole. I lost a sovereign, and went and asked my mother to lend me one - she had not got one, and I did not like to say anything till I got it. The day my master found it out, I had been and got a sovereign of my mother, and just as I came back, my master got the officer and took me.</p>

I took up the prisoner on the Friday after the Tuesday on which the robbery was committed; I said, "You are a pretty son to rob your father - what have you done with the money?" he said he had spent it, and been to Gravesend; Wake was present, and said that he had received 1l. 5s. of it; Gadbury had before that said he had taken it out of his father's pocket - that Wake had been to Gravesend - they had bought themselves some clothes, had been to the Theatre, and had then been sleeping at a public-house at Wapping.</p>
               <p>WAKE'S Defence (written). Joseph Wake confesseth, as follows: That he was at marbles (in the field) with Thomas Gadbury, when Thomas Bransom came up, and took us to Hart's-lane, and shewed us a small black bag, when Thomas Gadbury said, "That's my father's bag," from which Thomas Bransom took 25s., and gave the bag to Thomas Gadbury, who gave me (Joseph Wake) 25s. out of it, and kept the remainder I and Thomas Bransom proposed going together to the play.</p>

On the 13th of January I came off duty about half-past eight, or a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, and found he had brought home the pig the night before - I asked where he got it - he said he bought it with the wages that his master owed him, and he had still 1s. or 2s. due to him - he had been living with Mr. King for seven or eight months - the pig remained there or was running about the street, and on the 20th, the prosecutor and the officers came and took it away.</p>

No; it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening - it was not very dark - the other lad was less than the prisoner - he was walking by his side - he walked from him first, and then ran; when I got out, the prisoner was within thirty or forty yards of the shop; I did not lose sight of him.</p>

On the 4th of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I went into my parlour, and soon after I heard a noise in my shop; I went into the shop immediately, shut the shop door, and locked it; I turned towards the counter, and saw the prisoner's head just above the counter; he got up, and came part of the way round the counter: I secured him - my till was taken out, but had not been carried away; I had shut it too just before I went into the parlour.</p>

            . I am the wife of Patrick Newman. I had this property in a bundle, on the 26th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, and was going down Fish-street-hill; I saw the two prisoners - one was behind me, the other before me; Stone stooped down, and picked up a ring; I cried, "Halves!" he said, "Did you see me pick up the ring?" I said Yes; he said, "You shall have it for 2s.:" I said, "I don't know the value of it, but I will give you 1s. 6d.," Suthmer then came up, and said, "I saw you pick it up;" he said, "I will stand a drop of gin for you."

               <p>SUTHMER'S Defence. I was going along, and this lady tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "That young man has picked up a ring;" I said, "Why don't you have some of it;" she said "Shall I cry halves?" I said, "As you like;" she said to him, "You have picked up a ring;" he said, Yes; I said, "I am entitled to a part of it:" he said, "I will give you a drop of gin for your's;" that is all I know.</p>

On the 15th of January last, I was going home, and the prisoner walked with me up the New-road; I saw a bit of gown hanging out of her muff, but I did not know she was leaving the prosecutrix; when I went home I stated what I had seen, and these articles were missed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason I left the prosecutrix was, because she used me so ill; she is nothing more than myself, a common prostitute; and when I have not been able to walk, she has driven me out in the pouring rain, and took every farthing I got. I wished to leave her, and to return to my mother, and reform my life.</p>

About half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 29th of January, I was on my way home to Pentonville, and by the dead wall, at the back of the Merlin's Cave public-house, I was struck violently by the prisoner, and my watch was nearly pulled out of my pocket; if he had not taken hold of my small-clothes likewise, he would have got it; he ran by me - I pursued, and did not lose sight of him for two seconds, till he was taken - the light shone full in his face, and I am quite certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a young woman in the street, and it was a very narrow road. Witness. I had just noticed the young woman before he came up - the road was wide enough for three carriages to go along.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the mode of the attack, do you entertain any doubt that he meant to rob you of your watch? A. No - I felt for my watch, and it was nearly gone out of my pocket - the seals were hanging down quite low.</p>

I did not see him from the time I was pushed down till the watchman took him; I went to the watch-house that night and got locked up as well as he.

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Leicester-street, and heard the prosecutrix cry Stop thief! I went to the place; the prisoner was running, and she was following him, saying "He has got my property" - I stopped him; she said "It is in his hand;" I looked into his hand, but found nothing; I took him to the watch-house, and found nothing on him but three sixpences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not wish to be searched on the spot? A. No; I did attempt to search him in the street, because I saw his hand near his pockets - not two minutes elapsed before I took him; I did not see him thrown anything away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutrix appear sober? A. Yes: she complained of her neck-chain being broken; she was detained because the prisoner accused her of striking him, and we have some cases where the persons do not appear. I have seen her in the street before, but not that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up the square and saw a young woman whom I had known two years ago; I spoke to her - the prosecutrix came up and asked if I would give her anything to drink; I said "Where can I get it;" she said "Further on;" I objected, and wished to go home - I turned to go home, and the prosecutrix struck me several times and knocked my hat off: I did not with to make any disturbance in the street and ran off.</p>

I believe he is the man who took my watch; I told the Magistrate I had lost 15s. - it was all in shillings; I had wrapped it up in a piece of paper, and put it into my pocket in the public-house, a little after eleven o'clock. I said nothing about the 15s. till I got the watch-house; it was not more than two minutes from his putting his hand in my pocket till the second coming up and taking my watch; I said, "Let go of my pocket - let my money alone."

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter before twelve o'clock I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went up, and saw the prisoner inclining rather to lead and protect the prosecutor, who had been drinking, but I considered him capable of knowing what he was about; he gave a clear account. I took them to the watch-house, and found 3s. on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say he was capable of giving a clear account? A. Yes - he was intoxicated, but did not require assistance to go along; he could stand and walk; they were standing still, with the prisoner's hand at the prosecutor's back. I was standing three or four yards from George-yard when I heard Watch! called - they were not in my sight; that is a very crowded part of Whitechapel: no man could have walked along Whitechapel, and not meet more than ten or eleven persons; I should think he would meet as many hundreds; he did not say a word about any money being taken from him until he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say there? A. He said the prisoner had robbed him of a watch and 15s. in silver; that he attacked his pockets, and he said, "Let my pockets alone;" the prisoner said, "Never mind, it will be all right;" the prosecutor had not hold of the prisoner, the prisoner had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the prosecutor crying, and the night constable said, "You are foolish, you do'nt know what you are about; what are you crying for?" A. Yes, those words were uttered,</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came and asked me where I was going; I said to Westminster; he asked to bear me company home, which I declined: he came to me again as I was crossing the Green Park; he gave me a shilling, and asked if he should see me across the Green Park; I said I would go another way; he then asked me to have something to drink, which we had; we then went and had some rum, and I went with him as far as Tattersal's-mews; he asked me to go down the mews with him, and said there was a house at the bottom where we could have something to drink; in going down he accused me of having robbed him of his watch; I said, "I am sure I have not got it." Two or three persons came up: I sat down and turned out my money into my lap; I had seen the prosecutor put something into his coat pocket; I do'nt know what it was.</p>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! about half-past two o'clock; I saw some women running, and I followed them - I asked them which way the thief had gone; they told me to go after one who had gone across the Bird-cage-field, which I did - I saw two men running in the field before me, and in pursuing them I saw this bundle in a blue woollen apron - I took it up, and it was this property; it laid by the side of the hedge, near where the men had run, and I think one of them was one of the prisoners.</p>

Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 12th of January, I saw the prisoner with the sash in his hand; he was two or or three turnings from the house - he turned up a court, where there was no thoroughfare; I sprang my rattle, but could get no assistance - I went up and took him with the sash; he made a twist, and got from me in Cherry-tree-alley - but he dropped his hat, which I took to the watch-house with the sash - he was taken on the Saturday night following.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you kept this tavern? A. About three years; some single gentlemen lodge there - no other persons. We took it of Mr. Ireland; my husband is a theatrical agent, and our house is mostly frequented by theatrical persons; there was a pair of tongs and a shovel found which I said were mine - the prisoner said they were Mr. Ireland's; I said she might as well say so of all the other articles; she is married, and I have often seen her husband there - he has frequently stopped all night, and gone from the house before we were up; my husband's name is Benjamin Christian Smythson.</p>

On the 30th of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening; he was leaving work - he had passed by me, but I believe had not got out; I called him back into the counting-house, to reprimand him for leaving some work unfinished - I saw something under his coat; I asked what it was - he said, "Nothing;" I said I would fetch an officer, and he produced these tin-plates, which are mine - he gave me a card of his address.</p>

On the 24th of January, 1826, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was moving from Edgeware-road to King-street; I took a hackney-coach, and put two trunks and a band-box into it; I put this writing-desk into one of the trunks; I could not get the key out of the trunk again; the prisoner was the driver, I believe, but cannot swear to him; he put my trunks into the coach - only one man was then with the coach; as we went along he stopped at the corner of Cork-street, and took up a man, named Crane, who has been tried and convicted; the key was left in the trunk - I was in the coach, and was driven to King-street; my trunks were taken out, and I carried them into the house - I saw one trunk a little open - I opened the lid, and the desk was gone; Crane took the things out of the coach - the coachman, I think, stood by the side of his horses; I paid the fare, and took the number, which, I think, was 78l - I offered 5l. reward to the waterman, at the corner of Cork-street, to discover the desk; Crane was taken, and convicted - I cannot positively swear to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Crane only took your luggage out? A. Yes; the coachman stood at his horses' heads, holding them - he staid there, and I paid him; I went into the coach immediately after the boxes were put in; the prisoner was a long time fixing the boxes in the coach - Crane did not put them in - it was dark; the coachman was at the head of his horses all the time they were being taken out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who loaded the coach? A. Nobody but the coachman; Crane was not there then; the box or desk contained the property mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner is much the same size as the man.</p>

I said, "For that concern you was concerned in with Crane;" he said it was not him - I said it was - he said, "No, it was my brother" - I asked his brother's name - he said Charles, and that his was William; I called a person to look at him, who said he was the man - as I took him along he said he had gone by the name of Charles, but that was not his name, and that he was with Crane, but he did not have the money - that the Jew had the money, and the Jew broke the box open when he was in the shop with Crane; I said, "The Jew denies it - why did you go away? I could not find you; and you left your dog behind you;" he said he had been living down the Commercial-road, and had lately come back to Westminster - I had been looking for him for two years, and heard he was about for the last six weeks, but did not know where to find the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Beckenham. On the 2d of February, I was coming from Hanworth, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, when I saw the two prisoners standing still, in company together, in a cross-road that leads to Hounslow; they saw my dog, and I said, "It is only Henry Hubbard." I knew them both before; Chapman lived at Twickenham, and Beaks used to live at Hampton. Beaks said to Chapman, "Find the jemmy." Chapman said, "You find it," and he found it by the ditch - I said, "Let me look at it." which they did, and I asked what the round end was for; they said, "For staple work." I then went on to Mr. Simmons's, and gave information: we went and laid wait for them about seven or eight yards from Mr. King's - they came up, passed, and walked on. We heard a crash, similar to a door being opened - I said, "I think they have got in." We then went and fetched two more men from a little distance - we waited there till about half-past three o'clock, and then saw the prisoners come out with some wet linen, ten fowls, and this thermometer: they were together, and had the property on their shoulders - we went afterwards and saw they had opened a door to get into the hen-house.</p>

            . I am a constable of Twickenham. Hubbard gave me information, I went and laid wait with him; I did not see the prisoners go into the house, but they came out at the back, and threw the bundles over the pails - I jumped out of the hedge and followed them: Beaks was stopped by an officer in about an hour; I am quite sure they are the men. I examined the premises, and found they had broken open the door of the out-house - the crow-har was found on Beaks.</p>

I went to bed about ten o'clock on the Saturday night; I heard the cocks crow at three o'clock - I awoke my wife, and said "The wind rises." The carter came in the morning to do his horse, and he said the fowls were stolen - I got up as soon as I could, and missed six fowls and three geese; I went down into the yard and saw footsteps: I went and inquired at the public-house and saw the constable, he said they were the same footsteps as had been about almost every Saturday night. I followed the prisoners up to London, where I found an officer, and asked him where Lambeth-street Office was - I went with him to some alley; I lost the officer there, but he came to a public-house with the prisoners, and showed me a part of my fowls, which I knew by some private marks on them. I know Cardinell by the name of Ridley - he has lived at Chingford: I have seen Bean about once, but never spoke to him, and did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know Cardinell's parents? A. No. My son Edward was at home and in bed when the fowls were stolen - I do not know what time he went to bed: I went to bed first; I do not sleep in the same room; I saw him go up stairs to bed; he was called up by the servant in the morning - I heard the fowls at three o'clock, and they were safe at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210103"/>ten o'clock - I did not lock them up. I dare say I had twenty fowls; I did not count them that night, but I saw them all safe on the roost. I was awake and heard the clock strike three, within a few minutes after I heard the fowls.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What day in the week did you lose your fowls? A. On Monday, and I saw them before twelve o'clock on the same day at the office.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information from the prosecutor, and I went with his son, who said he could identify the persons - I went to several houses where I knew Cardinell had lived, I found where he was, and went to the house; I went up stairs, and found him and Bean in bed, and Ashton drawing a fowl - I saw a chest, and asked where the key was; Cardinell gave it me, and I took four fowls and two ducks out of it - I took them to the office, and went back and found one fowl in a saucepan, boiling on the fire. In consequence of something that Comley's son said to Bean, he told me that if I went to a turnip field, near Comley's, I should find three geese on the right hand side, under a hedge, I went and found them - I showed the fowls and geese to Comley; he swore positively to them, by some private marks on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the marks pointed out to you by Comley? A. I do not know - he swore he knew them by a private mark. I have got the fowls' feet at home, but did not bring them here - I first met the prosecutor's son near the office, at Lambeth-street; he appeared to know Bean and Cardinell. When he got into the room, he told them they were the last persons he should have suspected of such a thing, when he had been feeding them; there were preparations for dinner; the prisoners did not tell me that young Comley was coming to dine with them. Young Comley told Bean he would speak to his father to do something for him, to get him off, if he would tell where the geese were: the prisoners did not say Comley opened the barn door, and pointed out the fowls and geese, in the middle of the night - Comley said to them, "I did not think you would have done what you have, after what I gave you to eat and drink last night." I knew nothing of young Comley till he came to me. I have seen Cardinell about the Commercial-road with dogs - I do not know his family.</p>
               <p>EDMUND COMLEY. I am the prosecutor's son. The fowls were safe on Saturday night, and on the following morning we missed them. I know the male prisoners. I had been to Woodford the day before, and as I returned between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I met Bean and Cardinell, between the Bull public-house and the swing-gate - Cardinell came behind me and struck me; he rubbed his hands and said,"Have you not got a bit of pork, or a bit of bacon to give us; I have not had a bit of grub all day." I said"Well, come to the King's Head public-house;" he said he would not - he would go to the Bull; I took Bean into the King's Head, he followed, and we had a pot of beer - one Morris came in; they went out - I said to the publican, "I won't to go home with them." I shut the door and hatched it - Cardinell shoved it open again; we then all went on - Cardinell said "Where are old Ash's geese;" I said "They are not here;" we went on; they broke off the top of a gate; I got over the gate to get away, as I was afraid my father would hear it. Cardinell asked me to lend him a fishing-net which I had - we went and dragged a brook which runs up to the river Lea. Cardinell hid the net; he then wanted to fight me; I went on with Morris, who put the gate up: I went home, and knocked; my father came down, and made a noise at me for being out late - I looked at the clock, and it wanted twenty-five minutes to two. I heard the cocks crow several times distinctly, and next morning the fowls were gone. I saw some footsteps of Cardinell's in the dung I can swear; I put a gate over it to keep it, and I found a bit of ran there which I had seen on Bean's hand; I then told my father we would go to London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your father did not go to bed at ten o'clock? A. I do not know; he generally does; Ashton's geese generally feed in our field, but were fetched away about seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoners were often at Chingford, and Bean has been at my father's house - I met them in Bull-lane; I took them to a public-house, because they said they were starving  - one of them said, "Shall I go and kill one of Newton's sheep?" I said No: and that was why I got my net. I parted with them in Cock Tyler's-lane; I did not go home immediately, as I thought they were going to break down our gate, and I watched with Morris. Cardinell said, "My aunt is very ill, if you can give us a fowl I shall be obliged to you?" I said,"I won't, for I won't get into any row or piece of work." I have given him the clothes off my back, when his father-in-law turned him out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go with them to your father's house that night? A. No; we were in the lanes; I went into the cow-house, and got my net; we have a dog called Ranger - I said nothing about him that night - I did not notice him till I went home; I did tell the prisoners not to make a noise, as my father would hear, as they kicked up a row - I did not say I would get rid of Morris, and tell them to stand behind the gate till I returned; nor did I tell them to cook the fowls, and I would come and dine with them.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a Magistrate of the County of Middlesex. The prisoner came to me on the evening of the 12th of September, to make a complaint against the present prosecutor; he charged him with having stolen a 10l. note out of his pocket, at a public-house in Enfield; I understood it was on the 11th (the day before). I asked him where he got the 10l. note; he said from the auctioneer at Mr. Cook's sale, and it had been in his left hand breeches-pocket (there had been a sale a Mr. Cook's just before); I asked if he knew the number; he said he had it on a bit of paper at home, and that the auctioneer had it also in his book; I remanded the prosecutor till next morning, and then took this deposition from the prisoner - I had known him before very well - he is a labouring man, a little dealer in horses, cows, and such things; in this deposition, the nex day, he states that he had the money for a cow which he had sold. In consequence of finding that a 10l. note had not been paid to the prisoner, I discharged the prosecutor; this is his deposition - (read.)</p>
               <p>"The loose 10l. note I received on Tuesday last of a person I don't know, for a cow which I sold for 12l. 14s. I put the whole of this money loose into my pocket; this was in the afternoon."</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live with my father, at Enfield. In September last I saw the prisoner in a public-house at Enfield, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening; I did not rob him of a 10l. note, nor take a 10l. note from him; he did not say any thing to me that night, nor make any charge against me; but about eight o'clock the next morning he sent for me; I asked what he wanted; he said, nothing, but to sit down and drink with him; about three o'clock that afternoon, he asked me to give him that piece of paper I took from him - I had not taken any thing from him of any sort of kind; he said I had taken a 10l. not from him; I told him I had not; some words ensued - he sent for a constable, and gave charge of me: I was taken to Mr. Hardy's. He said if I would give him 5l., he would pay half the expences, if I would pay the rest, and spend half a sovereign; I did not accede to that, and was kept in custody all night; next morning I was discharged: this proposal was made after I was in custody. I am a shoemaker; I am twenty-three years of age, and knew the prisoner; we always lived neighbours together; I never had any words or quarrel with him before - it was on Tuesday night, the 11th of September, that I was in the public-house with him, and on the morning of the 12th he sent for me; I sat down, and drank with him; he said nothing to me about the note then, but at three o'clock in the afternoon he sent for me again, and said I had taken a piece of paper.</p>

            , SEN. I am the prosecutor's father. I met the prisoner on Wednesday evening, the 12th of September, after my son was in custody - I met him accidentally in the road, and he told me my son was in the watch-house: I said, "For what?" he said for robbing him of a 10l. note the night before; but he said he did not wish to hurt him, and if I would pay him a 10l. note he would make it up, if I would pay the expences, and spend 5s. - he did not say the 10l. note, but a 10l. note; he afterwards said he supposed I had not 10l. to give him, if I would give him 5l., he would take the other by instalments, but he still proposed that I should pay the expences, and spend 5s.: the next morning we we went to the Magistrate's - he still proposed to make it up, but I would not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were the words he used? A. He said we had better make it up, and I said, "No, I will not;" I am sure he used that expression - the talk about making it up all came from him; I had never had any dispute with him, nor had my son, to my knowledge - I do not think that I ever saw him with a 10l. note in my life.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Goats, a butcher, of Enfield. One Wednesday in September last, I saw the prisoner at the door of the Fallow Buck public-house, at Enfield; I saw him and another offering to sell a cow to two gentlemen in a chaise-cart, in the road, at the door - I saw them pay for it, it was in sovereigns, half sovereigns, and silver; the cow was sold for 12l. 14s. - I am accustomed to the sale of cattle; the gentleman gave the prisoner a shilling over, which he was to give to the drover, and he was to give him another shilling himself; this was a day or two before the prosecutor was taken up.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a long written defence, stating that he had been paid for the cow in coin, but had a 10l. note in his pocket which the prosecutor had seen; that as they were drinking at the Rose and Crown public-house, the prosecutor had put his hand into his pocket, and on drawing it out, the prisoner saw his 10l. note in his hand, which he demanded, and the prosecutor refused to deliver it up then, but promised to return it presently; the prisoner suffered him to leave the house with it, as they were on friendly terms; that he called on him next morning for it, and the prosecutor promised to return it if he would go and drink at the Rose and Crown, where they went; but after many excuses, as the prosecutor did not return it, he sent for a constable, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>COURT to PROSECUTOR. Q. Were you at any time in any public-house with him when you asked him to show you his money? A. No, nor did he ever show me any money; he never accused me of putting my hand into his breeches pocket, and taking out his money - we were only in one public-house that day, which was the Rose and Crown.</p>

No.; it was at the prisoner's desire that I attended to give the bride away; I knew very little of her before - I have seen her with him, and knew her name was Mary Aldridge; I never knew whether she had any other name - I do not know that I had heard her called Mary Aldridge, except when she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210106"/>married; I should think the prisoner was at that time about nineteen or twenty years old, and I should think her seventeen or eighteen; his parents and friends were not present - I believe it was a clandestine marriage; they did not go home to dine, but dined in Clerkenwell: the banns had been published I believe. I have been acquainted with them since; I never heard they parted by mutual consent; I have not seen the prisoner in this last brewery. but I believe he was in the former brewery, connected with Mr. Aldridge.</p>

            . I became acquainted with the prisoner, the latter end of July last - I then lived at Albany-street, Regent's Park; he called on me for bills from the Blue Lion Brewery, in Coppice-row; we had had some beer which was returned again as not good; he called for the money, and I refused to pay for two casks; the reason I saw him was, because I settled all the accounts for Mr. Sutton - I was at that time under Mr. Sutton's protection. The prisoner represented himself to me as one of the partners in the brewery - I removed afterwards to Speldhurst-street, and the prisoner called there for the money, under an excuse that I had offered him the money in Albany-street; he first explained the objects of his visiting me, when he called one evening in September and took tea, he said a great deal of nonsense to me, which it is not necessary for me to explain; he said he was going to Bedfordshire where his guardian wished him to marry a lady of great property - he had at that time always passed as a single man; he said if he attended to the business, he could make 20l. a week by it, and if he married me he should give up a great part of his property, but did not describe what that property was; some time afterwards a groom called upon me, and brought some game, and a letter from the prisoner to which I returned an answer, that I would receive him poor or rich - three days afterwards, I saw him again - he spoke to me of the message which I had sent; he said he was unhappy in his mind, and wished to have me; he said he should give up a great part of his property; and he could have a lady directly with 20,000l.; and his father wished him to marry that lady, but he would not, for he did not like her; he said he was going to Boulogne, as he had some contract business, which he could do better there than in London; he again said he was unhappy, and if he did not have me, he should not be happy. The first time he proposed to marry me was on the 16th of October; I hesitated and said I could not think of marrying him without asking my family; I afterwards told him, my mother and my friends did not seem to like this match; he said they had nothing to do with it; if I made up my mind; and he was determined to have me; he came one morning, at eight o'clock, and said he was going immediately to Boulogne; and I told him I was about to visit a brother-in-law, Lieutenant Lawrence, who lived at No. 2, Battery, Sandown; he proposed to accompany me as far as Canterbury, and in about a fortnight afterwards we set off; he said he did not know what to do with himself, and I told him, if he could do better by going there to go, but before he got to Canterbury, he agreed to take me on to Sandown - when we arrived there, he was introduced to my brother-in-law as a lover of mine; he staid there about a week; while there, he said he must either go to Boulogne or marry me; I said he might do as he pleased, but on one Sunday morning I agreed to marry him on the Monday, but we could not get the licence till the Wednesday, when we were married at St. Peter's Sandwich, and Lieutenant Lawrence gave me away; we lived together as man and wife for one week at the Bell, at Sandwich, and then came to town to Speldhurst-street - we lived there together about a fortnight, when a Mrs. Truman called, and told me he was a married man; I challenged him with it - he said it was only some servant that he had something to say to, that he had a child by; he denied being married, and I told him I would go with him the following Sunday to this woman; he agreed to go; but while I was putting my things on to go, he said, he thought it was an improper day for me to go on such business, and I did not go, but he went with my sister the next day; I went myself on the Tuesday to his wife's house in Coppice-row; but I never saw him any more till I saw him at the office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What age are you now? Q. Twenty-three - I lived with that gentleman in Albany-street, four years and a half - I carried on his house, and kept his accounts; I had no child by him; I have had one child by a gentleman to whom I was not married; which brought me to my misfortune; he is a lieutenant in the navy; a brother officer of my sister's husband - my child is now five years old; I never had a child by an officer in the army; my mother did live at Southampton, but now lives in the city; when I removed to Spelhurst-street, I was not under the protection of the gentleman in Albany-street - I had parted with him in June - The prisoner got acquainted with me by calling a number of times I did say at one time, that whether poor or rich, I would have him; but after that he had a great deal of trouble, for I did not like his ways - my sister lived with me; but I never heard from her that he was married, and had separated from his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the prisoner know you had had a child? A. Yes; he knew all my circumstances; I told him my situation before I married him - he has not been deceived in any thing; he knew that I had an annuity of 150l. a year. I said I would have him whether poor or rich, because the servant said he was so unhappy, he was going to blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, Q. But was not your annuity to be discontinued if you did an irregular thing? A. Yes; but being married was not an irregular thing - I should have retained that, though he lost his brewery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you committed any actual irregularity, your annuity would have been forfeited; but it would have been continued if you married? A. Yes; I made him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210107"/>acquainted with my having this annuity, and that it would be continued if I married and lived reputably.</p>

            . I am brother-in-law to Miss Jennings. I remember the prisoner coming to my house with her about the beginning of November, I think - I understood from her, in his presence, he was about to marry her, and I received him in the capacity of her intended husband - they were at my house about four or five days; he was particularly anxious to be married; he went to Canterbury to get the licence, and told me he wished Maria would make up the marriage; but she seemed backward to do so - he said his clothes were at Boulogne, and he was on his way there, but did not explain to me the reason of his going. In consequence of the desire which he expressed to me to marry her, I used my influence with her to effect it, and they were married - I was present, and gave her away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; my wife is living with me - she is sister to the prosecutrix - I was not aware of her situation - I had been absent from England a great deal.</p>

On the 4th of January he was employed in thrashing wheat; I saw him come and open the barn door and let himself in- he had a little basket with a bit of victuals in it, I believe; about five o'clock he was leaving his work; I had been on the look out, and was then behind the door; I saw he had the same basket, and it looked very bulky; I called him back and said "What have you got;" he said "Nothing master, I have not indeed;" I said I would insist upon seeing - he sprung two yards from me - I sprung after him, took his basket, and found in it about a peck and a half of clean wheat; he said "Pray master forgive me - this is the first time;" after I took it, he got away, as I had no one to assist me; he was afterwards taken at Kingston - he lived at a place called Thorp, about two miles from Staines.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gleaned it in the summer after my labour; I carried it home, and thrashed it out at my leisure; I took this wheat out to a mill to be ground, but there was no one there; I took it to the barn and left it with my clothes; when I went out with it my master said, "What have you got here?" I said, "Nothing of yours" - he took the basket down and said, "This is a pretty thing, is it not - don't shew your face here, I will hinder your working here, or any where else any more." I stopped to speak to a person, and my master went on - the next morning I heard of a job at Kingston, and I went there; my master had no wheat in that barn; I never said,"Master forgive me."</p>

On the 16th of February, a little before two o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down in the craft on the river, and saw the Edward barge laying outside the dock of Brooks and Penny's wharf; I am their clerk. I saw the prisoner's head just over the barge, which was loaded with coals; he was taking coals out of the barge, into his boat; I came up to him, and he said, "If you will let me go, I will put them back," and he did throw two or three pieces back; I took hold of the chain of his boat, and held him till an officer came - I suppose there were nearly two bushels of coals in the boat- they appeared the same sort as those in the barge.</p>

I saw two men run from the place where they had all stopped; I did not see Atkinson when Mason ran away; but I had seen them together about three minutes before, and am quite certain of their persons; neither of them were taken that night.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Law, and keep a trimming-shop. On the 16th of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, took this cotton, and ran off with it; there was no person in the shop - I pursued him down Cecil-court, St. Martin's-court, and into Hop-gardens; a gentleman gave me the cotton, and I returned; the prisoner was brought back in about three minutes - I am certain he is the man; I had seen him watching for half an hour before he took the cotton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What can you swear to me by? A. By seeing you on the Saturday night before, in the pouring rain; and then for half an hour before you came in the shop - I saw you and a boy watching me through the window, and I was watching you as well.</p>

I sold these books to Garrard on the 24th of January - I bought them of the prisoner the same day for 8s., and sold them for 12s.; I think there were thirty of them: the prisoner called first, and asked if I would buy them - I told him to call in an hour; I knew him before, he has bought shoes and other things of me; I then went to Garrard's, and asked if he would buy them - he said, Yes; I then bought them, and took them to him: I did not ask the prisoner where he got them - he said he was a carpenter; I did not think it odd that he should have thirty books for sale - I do not in general sell books; I had not seen them at the time - I went to Garrard's, and asked him if he would buy them of me, if I bought them of a man: the prisoner told me they were only school books, but I did not know of what description, and could not describe them; 8s. is not very cheap - some of them are no more than waste paper - nothing had been said about the price I was to give for them, before I went to Garrard; I then went and asked if he would buy them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Then the other seemed to employ the prisoner? A. They came together up to the cart - the other man took the keg from the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the other man dressed? A. I think he had a blue coat, a black silk handkerchief, and a white hat.</p>

On the 11th of January, I lost some pieces of wood, which we make from felling timber trees, on the premises of Mr. Fenning, at Manor-house Farm; I had felled the timber, and the wood I made in felling belongs to me; it laid in small heaps on the field - I met the three prisoners on the road, about a quarter of a mile from the field, with each a full sack, but I do not know what was in them; I asked what they had got, and Gobbey said they had got some wood; I told him they had been into Mr. Fenning's field, they said they knew they had; I said it was my property; they offered to carry it to my house if I would settle it - I would not; they said they thought the wood belonged to the gentlemen of the ground; if they had known it was mine, they would not have taken it. I left them and went on to my son; who had been left to watch the wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you left them, where did they go? A. They went home. I took out a summons for them on the Monday, and they were before the Magistrates on the Friday; I have not got the chips here; they took them home I suppose; I never saw them at all - they would have been worth 9s. if they were sacks of chips: the Magistrate did not demand of these men 14s. a sack; or say they should go to the tread-mill for a month; he said 3s. a sack, but the whole expense came to 14s. 3d.; he did not say he would send them to the tread-mill in my presence; their families have gone to the parish since.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw these men come to the field, and fill the sacks with my father's wood; I did not speak to them; I thought I had better not go near them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from them? A. About twenty-five yards; they could not see me, it was very dark; it was about five o'clock; I could see them, because I was watching - I dare say they could have seen me if they had looked: I followed them, when they were going off with the wood, but I was not near them when my father met them - I did not go off the premises; I was not near enough to distinguish their faces, nor the colour of their clothes, but I saw three men filling sacks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know that these were the men? A. By my following them, and my father meeting them directly - I did not see him meet them: if my father had not met them, I should not have known it was them.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 16th of February, in consequence of information, I went to No. 4, Stephen-street, and found the prisoner; she said she was the most unlucky girl in the world, and offered to pay for the gown rather than be locked up.</p>

I employed eight men to unload on the 23rd of October - the prisoner was not one of those men: but he brought a sack to the barge while I was on board; I knew him as a labourer about there; he had come to me in the morning, and said"Ned, you are a working very hard - I'll give you a spell," meaning to assist me. I said, "I thank you;" this was about ten o'clock, and about twelve he came and held a sack to me; I filled it - he carried it out of the barge; I expected he would take it into the granary, where the other men carried theirs - he took the sack from Haley, as it was his turn to bring a sack.</p>

            . I was employed to unload the barge. The prisoner came there - he took sixteen or seventeen turns for another man; I saw him take a sack down a street, opposite King Henry-stairs; I do not know where to - I heard him tell Haley, he would take a sweat for him, as well as another man; he did not go towards the granary with it - I told Long of it; I was coming down the plank from the granary at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long is it since you quarrelled with this man? A. I never quarrelled with him - we never exchanged blows. I was at Kingston three years ago - I was charged with robbery there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner carried sixteen sacks of corn to the granary just before? A. No; about an hour before - he did not abscond.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. Four or five years - he was well known, and has been about ever since, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR.BODKIN to EDWARD LONG. Q. Does Haley live in the neighbourhood? A. I have see him several times. Mr. Young has not told me, he had sent to find him; I heard a Mr. Evans was looking after him one day, and could not find him; Hawkes was in the barge with the prisoner</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed to clear a shed of coals in Tooley-street; I went to Cane's wharf to get a barge to clear a ship, and met Hawkes who wanted a job; we saw these men at work - Long asked me to give him a spell, which I did, and then gave another man about twenty turns; a woman named Murphy sat on the stairs with apples; she spoke to me as I went in and out of the granary; at flood tide, I said I must go, as I was then to have a barge; I called a man and gave him up my sack - I stood talking to Murphy for ten minutes, and then went away to the harge.</p>
               <p> - HAWKES. I was with the prisoner; he offered to give them a spell, and carried some sacks into the granary - I was with him when he left; we were both going to work in a coal-barge at flood-tide; when we left he had no sack or any thing of the kind; we left together about eleven o'clock, and I continued with him all day.</p>

On the 29th of January, about eight o'clock, I came into the shop and saw him with this piece of wood in his hand, and asked what he was making, and said, "Are you authorized to cut up my wood?" He said "I have only taken this one piece." I went to the door, and when I came back he was gone; but in the top of his bench, I found these six pieces of wood; when he came in the evening, I said, "You have been robbing me." He said, "I meant to pay you for it." I never suffer my men to take wood and pay for it afterwards - I am pretty certain it is all mine - one piece I am sure of, and have the piece it was cut from; it is cut for a bedstead which I never set him to make - he has worked for me eight years.</p>

            . I am a printer, and live in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. I was coming along Kingsland-road, and by a street opposite some alms-houses I saw the prosecutor and prisoner in altercation; the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"If you are a gentleman I hope you will stop and act as such - this woman has robbed me;" I asked what he was robbed of - he mentioned a sovereign and some silver pieces, but what I do not recollect; she said she had not robbed him, and had only 2s., which he had given her; I said, "Has he been with you?" and she said, No; I said, "Then give him the 2s., and save yourself from the watch-house" - she then began to struggle, as if inclined to fight - I took hold of her left hand, which was clenched tight - she directly opened it, and gave the prosecutor two pieces of money; I do not think she said what they were - the watchman then came up and as they took her along the prosecutor said to me, "She thinks she has given me 2s., but, by the weight of it, one is a sovereign;" he opened his hand at the lamp, and there was a sovereign and a sixpence; when we were in Thomas-street, the prisoner said, "I have dropped a halfpenny" - I saw something fall, and heard it - I picked it up, and it was half a crown; I kept it till we got to the watch-house, and there marked it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When she said she had dropped a halfpenny, had any one hold of her hands? A. I think not - there was a watchman on each side of her; the prosecutor walked very close to her - she gave the first intimation of it; I was very near her, and cannot say whether anything might fall from her without my seeing it; I did not notice any body behind her with a light.</p>
               <p>Q. When she gave the prosecutor the money, did he say one was a 6d.? A. Not that I recollect, but I did not take much notice; she did not say, "Here is 18d."</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did he say he had lost next morning? A. A sovereign, half-a-crown, and a shilling or sixpence - I believe he said at night it was 47s. or 48s., but she had given him back a sovereign and half; but he could not tell till the morning what silver he had lost - he appeared to know what he was about, but rather fresh.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information, and apprehended the prisoner on the 29th of January; I had been to Mr. Broad's premises and saw some footsteps, which I compared with the prisoner's shoes; they fitted exactly, in size, the number of nails, and the size of the heads of the nails - I traced them from the hen-house to a moat, and then out of the premises into a field, which leads to the road: the prisoner's breeches had a great deal of blood on them, which appeared quite fresh, and some mud was put over it to hide it - a large piece was taken out of the front of his breeches, and only the lining left. He at first said the blood came from his nose bleeding, and afterwards from kiling a pig.</p>

            . I am a headborough, and live behind the Coach and Horses public-house, at Holloway. The prisoner's mother has a room at my house, and since he has been out of work, she has let him lodge there, as he could not pay his lodgings. On the night of the 28th of January, I heard him come home; I was in bed: I awoke and heard the watchmen call twelve o'clock directly after I heard him come in - I was sure it was him; he came to the window and called mother twice; his mother or sister went down softly and let him in; I heard him go up stairs rather heavily; I thought there were two or three people, and next morning early, Mr. Broad's servant came in a chaise and said they had lost the fowls - I took the prisoner's shoes and compared them with the marks; they corresponded exactly: it is a new made orchard, which is very clayey - we traced them mark for mark, and nail for nail; I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, and noticed his breeches, with a piece cut out in front, and more spots of blood below.</p>

On the evening of the 31st of January I saw the prisoner at the end of the dung-heap, loading dung into the cart; he took about half the small load; there was another man with him - I went and said, "What are you doing?" they said, "We have put a load down, and are taking it up again;" I said,"I dare say you are;" they went on, and I told the prisoner's master of it. I spoke to the watchman, and went after the cart towards London.</p>

               <p>JOHN ASHDOWN. On the 13th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18280221-219-crimeloc1165">Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>"You have robbed me;" the patrol came up, and she threw it on the ground; I had about 4l. 10s. - it was three half-sovereigns, one sovereign, and some silver; it was all in my right-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR.PHILLIPS. Q. Are you married? A. Yes, and have a family; I had been in Marklane all day, and had been in a public-house on business, in Mark-lane, and then to another in Crutched-friars, and had some half-and-half with some friends - I did not spend 2s. altogether; I was not quite sober; I cannot say whether I had any gin and water, or rum and water: I went down a dark passage, but for no improper purpose; I did not give her any thing. I live in Harvey-terrace, Commercial-road; she did not say I had given her 2s.</p>

On the night of the 13th of February I heard a cry of Watch! up Barleymow-court; I ran up; Ashdown had hold of the prisoner, and said, "She has robbed me;" I took hold of her hand, and said, "Have you robbed him?" she said No; I held her, sent for a light, and found a half sovereign, three half-crowns, a shilling, and six sixpences; the prosecutor said next morning that he lost 1l. 12s. 6d. I took her to the watch-house, and 18d. was found on her; she said he had offered her 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state was the prosecutor? A. He was not sober; he gave us some beer after we had locked her up - he said that night that he had lost a considerable deal of money; he seemed too drunk to tell how much he had lost - he said he could not tell till he looked at his books - they were about ten yards down the passage.</p>

            . I am an officer, and received the lead from the witnesses, and I told the witnesses if they saw the prisoner to take him, and a night or two after, I went with them and took him - I went to the houses, and could not match the lead except by the width of the gutters which seemed to match.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you see footsteps on the ground? A. Yes; I took the prisoner's shoes off, but did not match them, as I was informed he had got a new pair; the marks were of a shoe with part of the heel worn off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutor speak to you? A. He did, outside the office; he told me to be confident to the lead, and not swear to the wrong lead, as there was other lead about; the magistrate reprimanded him for speaking to me - Beasley was present, but he had sworn to it before he spoke to me - I told the magistrate I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. P. ALLEY. Q. Where do you live? A. At Greenwich. I went from England to Cork to get the copy of the register; I did not know any one at Cork, nor the minister; I went to St. Peter's, and got this from the parson at the church, and then I brought it here; I swear I took the book, and compared the hand-writing - the signature, and that also: the parson was a very old man; I mean to say I had my hand on the book while I read it - the parson did not read it to me.</p>

            . My name before marriage was Ellen Roberts. In the year 1799, the latter part of it, I was living in Cork; I was there, I believe, on the 9th of October - I had a sister named Catherine; I was married then. I know the prisoner - he was then living at Cork, as a carpenter; my sister was married twenty-nine years ago - it was in the month stated; I remember the day of the month - I went with them to the church door, and then returned to help my mother to prepare the wedding dinner - they returned in about three quarters of an hour; my sister went by the name of Catherine Roberts, and after marriage by the name of Catherine Riordan; they lived in my father's house, as man and wife; I heard Riordan say after the marriage, that Mr. Forsyth married them; they lived at my father's for four months, as man and wife; they then lived a short distance off: my father and mother are both dead. In about four months he left my sister in a state of pregnancy, without any notice. Five years ago I came over to England, and saw the prisoner; I had never before seen him since he left - an arrangement was come to; he said he would settle a house on my sister Catherine, and told me he would come to Greenwich on the Sunday following, to settle; he came on the Saturday evening, but so drunk that no business could be done. - About a month after that I met him on Blackfriars-bridge - he gave me 1l., and said that he would allow my sister 2s. 6d. per week - he continued to do so for about two years and a half, and I sent it to my sister at Cork. During this transaction he sometimes called my sister Kitty, and sometimes his wife. At the end of two years and a half, he said he could not live longer with his second wife, and if I would send for her over, he would either take her home, or set her up in business; he gave me 4l. to send over to bring her over; he had three children by his second wife: my sister is still living - my sister did not then come over; she came over last June or July; she was ill at the time the money was given - that was about two years(when she came over) after the money was given. The child by the first wife is dead. When my sister came over my husband wrote, and the prisoner came down to Greenwich he saw her, and said he would put her into business, but she objected to a school, as being too sedentary for her- he slept at my house that night; he said he was living in Exmouth-street, but he did not come down again. I next saw him in Exmouth-street; he was living with a young woman there, and had two children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was in 1799? A. Yes; I do not know that he was apprenticed to his father; my sister is about fifty-six years old - she was then about twenty-seven: I had lived in Cork all my life - I never saw his father; I have heard since that he was an apprentice to his father: I did not then know that he was more than seventeen - I know he was then more than twenty. I remained in Cork all my life; until about five years ago- my sister was Protestant; he was a Catholic - I had heard him say so - I left her in Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not keep a house herself before her marriage? A. She did; in Cold-lane - she kept it about six years; she was not keeping that house when she was married - she was living with my father. I have lately been on good terms with the prisoner; my husband did borrow a little money of him, and he paid it - it was lent before this charge was made, and it was paid before; I swear that my husband is not in debt to him - he would do nothing for her; I did not know the second wife until lately - I heard of it five years ago; we did not wish to make any charge if he would have provided for my sister.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you brought the charge against him at all? A. No. I only know that he is a Catholic by what he said.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210124"/>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old are the children now living? A. One seventeen, another fifteen and the girl eight years; the boy who is seventeen is bound to his father - the other is bound to Mr. Brown of Exmouth-street, tailor; the girl her father took care of - the children were taken care of at both our expence; one he apprenticed to himself - I cannot say who paid the apprentice fee with the other. When I left him, I did not take about 200l. in cash - he is very false if he says so; I only took my clothes and a few books - he made me an allowance for about two years, but it was not paid - he was about twenty-two years old when he married me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, I was living with my father when my brother was said to he married; my brother lived with him also; when they were married he was apprentice to my father - he was about eighteen years of age; my father never gave his consent - indeed neither my father nor mother knew anything about it - he did not sleep one night out of my father's house before the date of the certificate (the certificate of the first marriage.)</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know of the marriage? A. No: I read in the newspapers the date of the certificate; it was in 1799 - he slept at my father and mother's house three months after he was said to be married.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was he born? A. I believe in 1781. I was born in 1778; I did not know Robert's family - she lived in Cold-lane herself; I did not know her father and mother: I have heard my brother speak of her, but I never heard him say that he was married to her: it was reported, but there was no certainty of it - my father never asked him about it: he sent her away that he might not have anything more to do with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. P. ALLEY submitted that there was an end to the case, the witnesses on the other side had only made the prisoner twenty years old. - Mr. BODKIN suggested that the 26 Geo. II. did not extend to Ireland.</p>

            . I was, on the 10th of November last, in the employ of Mr. Winch; the prisoner was so also at that time; I was desired by him to carry about a bushel of beans about the 10th; I was to carry them to his lodgings, at his mother's house; I did not see them put into the sack - he gave me them out of my master's granary; he said he wanted me to take a bushel of beans; he went with me - when we got there, he took them out of my hand, in a shed on his mother's premises - it was about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was at the time when farmers are in full business? A. It was about eight o'clock in the morning; he met me at his mother's; the prosecutor's house is opposite to the farm, and any body could see what he was taking along; Mrs. Roake's house is about a quarter of a mile off; he never said such a thing as, "Don't let my master know it;" I did not know that my master had dealings with Mrs. Roake; he had his victuals at his mother's, but I believe he mostly slept at Weybridge; the prisoner remained with his master till February; he passed by me on my way to his mother's.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WINCH. I am a corn-factor, at Shepperton. The prisoner was authorized by me to sell at all times; he was to make every entry on the day it happened - my book is here; I have examined it - I find no entry of beans sold to his mother on the 10th of November, nor to any other person - not on his own account, nor his mother's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The prisoner is executor under his late father's will? A. I believe so; I am not under any obligations to him - I am not aware that he had lent me money - if it was so, it was his own fault, for not making up his accounts; many times there were monies received, but he never lent me 50l. - I have had money when I have applied for it and he has said, "That is all I have got;" the balance has been sometimes in my favour, and sometimes in his; I remember his going to town on executorship business; he told me he was going to prove the will, and some other business, but I do not know whether it was for dividends; he did not always make entries of advances - I never made any against him; I do not recollect owing 18l. for hay - I owed the mother 15l.; on recollection, the 15l. 18s. 6d. is due to the estate; I have dealt with the mother for coals only; he paid attention to all orders given; the mother owes me 10l. - I owe the estate 15l.; I have tendered the balance; I made out an account, and gave it to Roake for his mother - the bill was not sent back, because the items for which the prisoner is indicted was not therein; Mr. Hyde had lived with him - he gave some information; the prisoner conducted himself well until within the last two months.</p>

These shoes hung on some nails in the shop; the prisoner came in last Wednesday, about half-past seven o'clock - my father had known him about three years ago; he asked if my father was at home - I told him he was not: he said I could do as well - he wanted three or four pairs of shoes for a person at Finchley; he gave me the measure: I looked them out, and while I was making out the bill, he sat down in the shop, where the shoes were, within his reach - I made out the bill; he said he was going to the haberdasher's, and would return in about a quarter of an hour; he left - I looked, and missed a pair of women's shoes: I went after him - he was not above twenty or thirty yards off; I asked him where he was going to - he said to the haberdasher's; I said "I think you have got a pair of shoes;" he shook his pockets, and said, "No, I have not, upon my honour"- I felt, and found a pair in his pocket; I took him back, and sent for a constable.</p>

The prisoner took my lodgings about eighteen months ago; he stayed about twelve months; he took them at 4s. 6d. per week; it was the top room furnished; these articles were let with the room: he left, without notice, four or five months back; he owed four week's rent: I afterwards examined the rooms, every thing was gone except the bedstead; I found that the bed had been cut, and the feathers taken out; about thirty pounds of feathers were gone; I have found some of the things since. He has a wife and two children. I saw him, about two months back, down by Hoare's brewhouse, but did not speak to him - I had before given information to the officers he was taken up about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. C. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you give information? A. About three months since; if I had spoken to him, I should have been knocked about - his wife did not go by the name of Sophia Mendoza; my son's name is Shaw - his name was Jones; I did not, while lodging with me, know that the woman was not his wife; I had never seen him since but that once.</p>

             re-examined. As near as I can recollect, I saw the prisoner in Tower-street; he applied to me and said he was in a dilema; he had been living with a creature who had robbed their lodgings, and there was a warrant out against him at the Thames Police; I said"Your are in a pretty scrape;" he said he went home and found the feathers gone, and asked Shaw to come up and see: I went to Shaw, and said to him "You have a man named Jones living with Mendoza, the fighting man's daughter;" he said that the prisoner had had the woman to the Thames Police, and that he ought at that time to have left her, but he was always coming after her - I asked what damage was done, and he said he did not know, but"I will transport him; I can, if it is six months." I told him what the prisoner had stated to me in Tower-street, and that I had come down to tell him; he said she had taken away every thing piecemeal, but he would not apply to her, he would have Jones. I think that he did say that he knew her name to be Mendoza - I said "Jones with the daughter of Mendoza the fighting man;" he said "Yes, the same." I asked what the damage was; he said he could not exactly say what the feathers and irons were worth: I think he said about 7l.; I asked him if he thought Jones had taken anything, he said "He must, they lived together."</p>

            . I heard Shaw say he would compound, if any person would come on behalf of him. I will swear that Shaw said the woman had taken the things, and said something about 7l.

             re-examined. I did not like the concern; I did not like to meddle with it, and asked Press to go over too. I thought the longer the prisoner staid away the better; it might be five weeks after. I did not tell Shaw where Jones might be found. Shaw never said that he had taken the woman up, nor that she had stolen the property. Jones went out first; it was about seven o'clock, when he left; the woman went out after. He stated that the woman had been taken to Lambeth Street before, but not for his property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHAW re-examined. I had heard that the woman was taken to Lambeth-street Office; an officer came to my house and ran up stairs; he asked if a woman named Jones lived there; I said Yes; he said he wanted her: she returned the same day - she was not committed. Shaw was in the habit of coming home every night to the premises.</p>

I lost a shawl out of my box, between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the 6th of February; the prisoner lodged in the same apartment, and was to go away that morning: she slept in the same bed with me. My box was not locked; I am quite sure it was there - she had nothing in the room; she had slept there for a month - her mother lived in Middlesex-buildings. I got up about eight o'clock and went to my box to get some money; I had 10s. 7 1/2d. there; it was gone: the landlady, who slept in the same room, rose at five o'clock. I saw the shawl at the pawnbroker's on the Saturday evening following - I never had lent it to her; I only went there on the previous Saturday.</p>

I was minding the shop - the glasses were on a table down in the area; I did not see the prisoner before he took the glasses from the table - it was not far from the ground; the table was higher than the ground - persons passing could not take them without reaching over; it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I think on the 16th of January; the lamps were lighted; he came to the table; I told him to go away, or I would call my master - he used a bad expression, and before I could call my master, the glasses and the prisoner were gone: I saw him afterwards in custody of the officer - there was no other person near the table; I saw the officer before the prisoner was taken, and had described him both to the officer and to my master.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your master here? A. No. I was taken near the church in Whitechapel - I believe they took me to the watch-house for safety; I had a long way to go home: I live at Stepney- my master is Mr. Cann, a hair-dresser, living in Fleet-street; I received my money at his shop, and then went with him to a public-house in Fetter-lane; I and three more drank nine or ten glasses of gin and water. In going from the public-house to Whitechapel a number of men and women spoke to me; several females came very near to me: after I left the public-house I showed my money to two of my shopmates, named Scott and Sinclair.</p>

            . I am beadle of Whitechapel. On Sunday morning, the 20th of January, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, but I am not certain whether he was searched or not; while he was there I brought in the prosecutor from High-street, the worse for liquor; I do not know what he had about him, but about six o'clock the next morning he said he was very sorry, and hoped I would let him go home; I said, "Have you got every thing safe about you?" he then felt, and said he had lost a sovereign, some half-crowns, and some silver; I went into the room where the others were, and brought out the prisoner; I found a sovereign, two shillings, and two sixpences in his left waistcoat pocket, and one half-crown in each of his shoes - he said he had it from his father. I saw an apron taken out of a hat, but I do not know whose it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did the prosecutor say he was sorry for having done? A. I was dispersing some low men and women, and he came in among them, and asked what I wanted to do; he was a good deal the worse for liquor - he had a watch when he went in, but I did not see any money.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Whitechapel. I assisted in taking the prisoner to the watch-house, for rescuing a girl from a watchman, in White Lion-street; I saw him searched the next morning, and the money found - Dungate took his hat off, and found in it this apron, which was claimed by Wade; I heard the prosecutor say he had lost 1l. 10s. 6d. - I think he said a sovereign, four half-crowns, and a sixpence; I did not search the other persons who were there, as they were only put in for being disorderly, fighting, and such like, which is frequently the case in that part of the town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the prisoner when he went into the watch-house? A. No - I searched the other persons who went in; and one of them had no money when he went in, but the next morning there was half a crown and a shilling found upon him.</p>

Marlow had burst the door open, and asked Ryan if she wanted any gin; she fetched the gin, and, in half an hour, she took the things out of the room.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As old iron, would it be worth more than he gave? A. It was not old iron; 17s. 4d. is the new price; he went with me to look for Griffiths - the prisoner keeps an old iron shop.</p>

Last Saturday week I was at the prisoner's father's apartment from half-past one o'clock till half-past four - his father is my brother; I went there in consequence of a letter I had from Ireland - the prisoner was there; I believe his brother knew Mr. Bell; the prisoner was not sitting with his mother and me - his brother is older than him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. This funeral was performed on the 12th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon - the corpse laid in our shop, and was to be buried about a quarter of a mile from our house; the prisoner came the day after the corpse came - he merely looked at it - appeared to shed tears over it, and he agreed with a man named Bone, who came with him, as to the orders he had given for the interment - Bone has not been seen since; Bone ordered ten cloaks in the prisoner's presence - he said thirty persons would come, but only ten would follow as mourners, and my husband was to prepare the cloaks; the prisoner came again next day, but only stood on the step, while the other man talked to me a little. On the day of the funeral, it had gone on with only two mourners - the prisoner and Bone came soon after, and said, "We have met your husband and the corpse, on the other side of the way, and he desires you will tie two cloaks on our shoulders; but we won't wait for hatbands; and he will wait in the street for us." I did so, believing my husband had sent them - they went away with the two cloaks - the prisoner returned in about three minutes without a cloak, and said their overlooker from the docks, was coming up the road from the docks, with some more of the men, and as 7l. had been raised for the funeral, they did not like them to appear without cloaks; I was to give him what cloaks I had got on my arm, and my husband would wait for them - I gave him all I had on my arm - I thought there were six, but he says there was but five; I have only seen one since - I am sure he said he came by my husband's authority.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information on the 14th of January - I went to the Bull's head public-house, and took the prisoner there; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210138"/>acknowledged to me next morning, that he had had the cloaks, but did not know what became of them, for he got tipsy, and lost them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE PACKER. On the 12th of December I went on with the corpse; I met Bone and another man, who, I think, was the prisoner, with shovels in their hands; I went up to a mourner named Dawes, and said, "There are two of your men" - he said, "We cannot wait for them" - we went on and interred the corpse; when I returned, my wife enquired for the cloaks - I had sent nobody whatever to her for cloaks, or any thing - the whole story was false: the prisoner said at the office he did not know what had become of them, for some girls of the town put them on; one cloak has been returned - that was taken off Bone's bed, and brought to me by Dawes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was there with Bone - I went with one Scroggins to see the corpse; I called at a public-house, and left about a dozen shovels there - I had met the men following the corpse; they said I might come if I liked - I said No, I would go to the house we were to meet at afterwards; I went next morning to Dawes' house - he said Bone had been to the funeral, and had not returned the cloaks.</p>

            . The nails found on Keating would nail the tin on - it is done with any kind of nails; there was a chasm in the sample-hole; I have no doubt the sugar in the bag was the same as that in the hogshead - part of it was running out when I took it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. If the plate had come off by accident, could they do better than put the bag to catch it? A. No; but that quantity could not have come out of itself; the proper way would be to turn the hole to the top.</p>
               <p>KEATING'S Defence. I met Garrard in Gray's Inn-lane- he could not get on: the sugar was running out - he told me to get up and get a little out, in a bag; I picked up the nails on Galley-quay.</p>
               <p>GARRARD'S Defence. I met him, and said I would give him a pint of beer to go with me; the tin had robbed off, by rubbing against the other hogshead - I had a bag, and told him to get in and catch it; the tin was nearly off when I had it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you sent him? A. To Messrs. Adams and Morris; I think I mentioned the mistake to him on the 18th - he staid with us till Thursday morning, when he was taken.</p>

            . I am shopman to Morris and Adams. On the 18th of February the prisoner came with an order; I sent the goods with this bill - it amounted to 6s. 8d., but since it left our shop a figure of 2s. has been added to an item of 11d., and the 6s. at the bottom is altered to 8s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you enter it in your book? A. Yes, it is 6s. 8d. there - I looked at the entry yesterday; I am certain of it without referring to the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the bill now in the state the prisoner brought it to you? A. It is.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When he returned did he not tell you he had made a mistake? A. He gave the bill to Mr. Adams, and said it was a mistake; Mr. Adams called me and said it was a mistake of mine - I said it was not; the prisoner wished me to write a note, and give him the bill back, but I would not and kept it, saying there was a gross imposition some where.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your deposition copied three time? A. The clerk made so many mistakes, the Magistrate said he would have them copied again, or they could not be read.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure the alterations in the bill are not your making? A. I am.</p>

On the 18th I saw Nathan turn the corner of Lime-street, with something under his arm, which he gave to Fell, and walked back himself; I followed Fell, and saw him putting this cheese into a bag - I went up, and asked what he had there; he said a cheese, which he brought from Rose-lane, and then he said he was going to take it there; Nathan came up just afterwards, and I took them both into custody; I went to several shops, and at last to Mr. Shaw's, where they claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 14th of February, about a quarter-past seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner on Tower-hill, with two others; they conversed about five minutes, and then separated; the prisoner and another went into a dark corner, and took a truck - they took it up the Minories; I went and asked the other man if he knew what they were going to do with it; he said No; I then followed the prisoner and his companion - they took it on to the corner of Goodman's-yard, where I stopped them, and asked what they were going to do with it; they both ran off - I pursued, and took the prisoner, without losing sight of him; Ellis claimed the truck.</p>

            . I was servant at the Black Swan public-house, at Bath. I recollect Isaacs coming there about six weeks before Christmas - he went by the name of Adlam; he came with Burrowes between seven and eight o'clock one Sunday morning - there was no one up in the house but me; it had rained in the night; Adlam was very wet, and went to bed. After Burrowes was gone, a box came, which was taken to Adlam's bed-room, and the next day I saw it on the table - I opened it, and saw in it only a pair of trousers and three shirts - I took it off the table; in the course of the week, I saw some clean papers on the bed; I opened them and saw some black silk in them - I saw the box in the room, but the room was always kept locked, and if I did not make the bed before he went out, I did it when he came home - on the Saturday before he left I moved his box to clean the room, and found it very heavy; I opened it and saw it was full, and the top goods were silk - Burrowes had frequently been in the week to see Adlam, and called Adlam his friend. On the morning Adlam went away, he sent me to Mr. Rose's for a cap and cloak, and to tell Burrowes that he was going - I saw Burrowes, who gave me the cloak and cap - Burrowes slept at our house on the night he left his situation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You say Burrowes came frequently? A. Yes; almost every day in the week, at all times in the day - our house is three or four minutes walk from Mr. Rose's; he lives in Bond-street; I had not seen him at the Black Swan before Adlam came; but it was known he lived with Mr. Rose, and I never saw Burrowes bring any thing to the Black Swan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You made Adlam's bed? A. Yes; his box had no lock; any one who entered the room might have opened it; but no one went in but me.</p>

            . I was porter at the Christopher Inn, at Bath.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see it on the coach or in the boot? A. I cannot say; it went away with Mr. Adlam - it was not locked, but corded.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who gave it you? A. The servant at the Black Swan. I packed the coach and other parcels - I put the box in; the coach-office is about three minutes' walk from the Black Swan.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper's assistant. I know both the prisoners; I first had a slight acquaintance with them about twenty-one months or two years ago; Burrowes was then a town traveller to a house in the City; I understood from him it was Mr. Grimshy, of Huggin-lane. Adlam was then a linen-draper's assistant like myself; I understood his name was Isaacs, till he told me he had changed it to Adlam; we were both out of situations. I did not know of Burrowes' going to Bath; but on the 26th of December last, I met him in Sydney's-alley; I asked him if he was in a situation, he said No, he had just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210146"/>come up from Weymouth and from Bath - I went with him to a public-house, in a street at the corner of Leicester-square, and from there we walked to the Old Bailey; in going along, he said he was always open to buy a quantity of goods, so long as they were cheap; I think he said to the amount of 30l. or 40l.; he said he had a quantity of lace goods which he was going to sell, and he was going to the New Inn to fetch them - I had told him I was in want of a situation; he wished me to go to the New Inn with him, but I said I had an engagement in the City, and he said, if I would meet him at the Dolphin public-house, in Milk-street, in half an hour, he would be with me - he did not say for what purpose: we parted about one o'clock. I went to the Dolphin; he came there, and brought a brown paper parcel, which I understood was the lace he brought from the New Inn; he did not tell me so - I wished to look at it and opened one end of the parcel; I saw several cards of lace in it, a little soiled, in bad condition; there was a young man named Oliver there; we then went away and walked to the pavement, Moorfields; we went to a coffee-house at the corner of Fore-street, and Burrowes went out, leaving Oliver with me; he returned in ten minutes, and said that a young man in the shop, named Bennett wished to see me, and said he had left the goods there - I went to the shop (it was about ten doors off) and Bennett showed me a quantity of lace in a basket; it was the same lace as I had seen in the parcel - I returned to the coffee-house, but did not tell Burrowes what Bennett had said to me. We then went to the New Inn, and staid there till twelve o'clock at night; Burrowes told me he lodged there - I called on him there the next day, about three o'clock; I staid about an hour, when he went to bed, and I went away - I saw him again at ten o'clock the same night, and we went to a masquerade at the Argyll Rooms; I was with him all that night; we went from the masquerade to a place called "The Finish," in Covent-garden, at seven o'clock in the morning; I saw him again that night, which was Friday, at the New Inn, as he was going to bed, and I said the expense was too great for me; he said"Call upon me in the morning, and I will put you into a good thing;" I think I slept there that night - I went with him the next morning to the Mitre public-house, in Chancery-lane; I there saw Isaacs whom I had not seen for twelve months before - Burrowes spoke to him, and they appeared to be friendly. For the next week or two I lived at the New Inn, and paid for my own lodging and provision; during that time I saw both the prisoners frequently; and a few days after I asked Isaacs what situation Burrowes was going to put me into; he replied, "He be d - d; why does he not behave honourable towards me" - he did not say in what respect he was to behave honourable to him; and he said "So help him God, he would split," which means to tell; he said, "I know I have marks, which I have kept in my possession, which will do for Jack Burrowes." I afterwards saw Burrowes and told him of this; he replied, "I don't mind what such a fellow as that says; I don't heed him a pin," and said he would call and see him. I told Isaacs, Burrowes would call and see him - I went with Burrowes to Isaacs; they quarrelled, and Isaacs said he would hang him, and when Burrowes left the room I said"For God's sake, do not do that" - they quarrelled about some money; Isaacs wanted some money from Burrowes: Isaacs showed me some bills of parcels and a receipt for 103l., which was the amount of the invoices. Isaacs asked if I knew Burrowes had lived at Bath; I said I had heard so; he said he had done the trick up nicely there; that he Isaacs, had received parcels of goods up in town here from him; and that he had gone once to Bath and brought up 103l. worth of goods from him, and the invoices he had shown me were for those goods - I asked him what Burrows was, there; he said he lived in Bond-street, Bath, but did not tell me with whom; I asked how Burrowes managed to get the goods away; he said he had stopped at a public-house close by, and used to meet Burrowes three or four times a day; that Burrowes used to bring the goods out, sometimes concealed in his trousers, waistcoat, and hat, and he received them from him - I asked how Burrowes managed to get the goods down; he said he used to go up into the warehouse in the morning, when nobody was there, and conceal them.</p>
               <p>Q. This related to the 103l. worth of goods? A. Yes, and he said he had received other goods in town from him; he said he kept the greater part of the goods from Burrowes, but had sold some to Mr. Olding, in Chancery-lane; I told him I had seen two bills in Burrowes' possession, drawn by him; he said those were the two bills he had sold goods for, and if Burrowes would give him up one of those bills he would be satisfied; I told Burrowes all that Isaacs had said; and he said he should give him no more; Isaacs afterwards showed me one of these bills, and said Burrowes had given it to him - it was for 14l.; I bought a small quantity of lace goods of Burrowes myself, at the New Inn, and changed them for poplin; I saw him offer some shawls and half-handkerchiefs to Mrs. Browning, and some customers, in her private parlour; he was offering a shawl to Mrs. Browning, for 24s., and she said it was no better than what she gave him 26s. for - I think that was what she said, but one was better than another - I cannot tell which; Burrowes, on the same day, took out a parcel, which I believe, was shawls; we walked to Holborn-hill, and he said he was going to Mr. New, or Bew, at Pimlico, to offer them for sale; I did not go with him; I frequently conversed with Isaacs about Burrowes, and told Burrowes what he said; Isaacs afterwards told me Mr. Olding would not pay the bills; I asked why - he said Olding understands the goods were stolen; I asked how Olding knew that; he said Mrs. Barrett, his landlady, had told him; some time after this, Isaacs told me the bills would not be paid, and if Burrowes would consent to give up his bill, he (Isaacs) would give up his, upon receiving 7l., which Olding had sold, and would give up the rest of the goods; Burrowes did not like to go to Olding, and asked me to go; I went, and took Burrowes' bill with me, which was for 13l. odd; I presented the bill; Olding said, "I thought the thing had been quietly arranged;" I said "I know nothing about that" - he said, "I have been waiting at home all the morning, and I shall now go down to Bath;" I went and told Isaacs what passed - he replied, "To be sure, it was so understood - the bills were to be returned, and the goods taken back;" I went with Isaacs and Mr. Walker to Olding's house, and the goods were divided there; Burrowes had told me to take all the Bandanna and black handkerchiefs, which I did, and brought away 3l. 5s. in money - that was for Burrowes - Isaacs had some pink ladies' handkerchiefs, some turban<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210147"/>and crimson handkerchiefs, about ten large black handkerchiefs, and some Canary handkerchiefs, and 3l. 5s. - Olding desired to have something for his trouble, and Isaacs gave him 5s. - a few days after that, I got some goods from Brocock and Co. - I took them to the New Inn, and offered them to Mrs. Browning for sale; Burrowes came there, but did not offer any thing for sale at that time. Burrowes afterwards left the New Inn, and went to lodge at No. 10, Mary Ann-place, Clifford-street, over the water; I went in the coach with him; I saw him go into the house, but was never there myself; I have called there by his desire, and left messages for him; he called it his lodging - I saw a young man there, who had frequently been in his company before; I used after that to see Burrowes at the Olive Branch public-house, and at a public-house at the corner of Mitre-street, at the Prince of Wales public-house, and sometimes at a billiard-table in Waterloo-road; we were very familiar together; I asked him once what situation he would put me into; he said if I would work his oracle he would employ me; I had told Burrowes what Isaacs had said about Bath; and the second time I mentioned it, he acknowledged it; and said he had robbed his different employers, and that to the amount of hundreds; he said he had robbed the prosecutor; I have heard him say that in Isaacs' presence, and in his absence; they quarrelled once at the Olive Branch, when there were four people in the house, and he acknowledged it there; he said, "Oh, Yes, you need not tell me of it, I have had such a fellow as you to deal with - you have robbed me;" Isaacs said he had been subservient to him long enough, and said, "You have robbed your employers, and made me accessary to it; and now left me without money and without shoes to my feet;" they came out, and Isaacs said he would tell - Burrowes said, "Do, do, I would as soon die on a gallows as not, since I have got acquainted with such a fellow as you;" Isaacs told him he had marks which come upon the goods, that were quite enough to do for him; Burrowes replied,"I have enough to do for you, where is the pocket-book you robbed the man of in Waterloo-road." I at last wrote a letter to Mr. Rose, at Bath, as I was not comfortable in my mind, for one thing and another; on the day I wrote, I was with the prisoners, at the Prince of Wales; we walked together to the Elephant public-house; I did not hear what they said, but Isaacs said to me just after, "Burrowes has offered to give me a suit of clothes, if I will contradict what I have said to Mr. Browning;" he had told him Burrowes had robbed his employer at Bath, and sent the goods up to him; and that when he went to Bath he brought the goods away, and Burrowes told Isaacs to take his name, and write down to Mr. Rose for a character - he would give him one which would get him a situation; I said to Isaacs, "You shall not contradict what you have stated, for I have stated the same thing, and won't be made a liar for you;" I said I would write to Mr. Rose, and inform him of it, and I did so; and made a communication to Mr. Caldecott; I was taken into custody, and have been locked up ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know what Burrowes had stated to Mr. Browning? Yes; I was present at the latter part of it, and I myself had told Mr. Browning - I came forward to-day for the sake of public justice, and to case my own mind, which was distressed - that is my chief reason; my name is

               <p>Q. In whose employ were you last? A. I will not tell you; gentlemen do not like their names mentioned - I have lived with Messrs. Young, at Nottingham, and before that with one Ridgway, who, I believe, is now in Whitecross-street; I do not know where he lived while I was with him - I left, because he could not continue his business; he never accused me of robbing him of furs: Burrowes said, Mr. Ridgway says you have taken furs" - I said it was by his knowledge; he had two young men - he could not pay us, and told us to take the furs for our salary; a man once met me in Holborn, and accused me of robbing my employer, Mr. Brooks, but there was no foundation for it - I went to the office and to the House of Correction for a few days, and the person who sent me there bought the goods of Burrowes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular happen at the masquerade? A. Nothing particular that I know of; Burrows lost his watch there - he was mad drunk; he pulled off his clothes and threw his watch into the room; I took it up, but did not recollect that I had it till we got to the "Finish:" I have had, letters directed to me in the name of Smart (my mother's maiden name,) it was by my desire - I never went by any other name; I know nothing of the name of Hyman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever state that you changed your name to Hyman for fear of being transported? A. Never, I declare; I lived at Manchester with Mr. Watts, of Deansgate - I never lived with a person named Smart; I have been examined in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not on a trial in which your brother prosecuted Colonel Arch for an unnatural crime? A. I shall not answer that.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must answer it - it is not an improper question. Witness. I was examined on that trial as a witness for my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Isaacs tell you his mother's name was Adlam; but he was a natural son of Isaacs, and sometimes look both names? A. He said his father's name was Isaacs, and his father's Adlam; I have seen her, and called her Isaacs - I was told her name was Adlam; I bought some goods of Brocock and Co., of Cheapside, in January - I bought about 5l. worth of goods - I took them for a bad debt, they owed me the money; I summoned them, and took it in lace: I swear it was for a bad debt, for expences I had incurred in looking after a person for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you met Burrowes, how had you been living? A. I lived in a situation at Mr. Scott's last - I was going about with the prisoners only a few days; I travelled for myself about a month; I left Mr. Brooks in consequence of not making a cloak properly - there was a charge made against me there about stealing 2 lbs. of mutton chops from his butchers, and he took me to the office; he never charged me with any thing else to my knowledge - he never did charge me with any other robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the charge made by Mr. Brooks or the butcher? A. They did not come forward - the chops were paid for; I was charged also with taking a rabbit from a poulterer's, and some eggs - I do not recollect any thing else - he never accused me of stealing any thing from his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How do you recollect the date on which you met Burrowes? A. Be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210148"/>cause it was the day after Christmas-day - I do not know whether Oliver is here, or any other persons I have mentioned; our conversation at the New Inn was not in Browning's presence: I heard Olding had been threatened to be sued for the bill - the attorney and Adlam were present at the settlement; I remember going one night to Browning's in liquor; I said Burrowes was locked up, and I believed Aldam had given him in charge for felony - he had threatened to do so often; I did not say, if he gave me some money I would get him discharged; he asked what would get him out - I said I supposed 7s. or 8s. - he offered it to me; I refused to take it, and he sent the waiter; the wife offered me the money - I did not say it was for breaking windows; I was in liquor, and do not recollect what I said - I said he was confined for felony or an assault.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have mentioned several circumstances, which show a dishonest life, on your own part - were not the prisoners acquainted with all this? A. Yes; they knew it all; I was charged with having the chops and things, months after I left Mr. Brooks.</p>

            . I am one of the marshals of London. In consequence of information I sent Brown in search of Burrowes, and I went in search of Isaacs on Saturday week; Withers went with me to Chancery-lane, to the Mitre public-house, (I think it is) - Withers called Isaacs into the passage; I made him no threat or promise, but I told him I understood he had some property he had received from Burrowes; he said he had, and he would show it me - he took me up stairs, and produced these twelve pieces of handkerchiefs, which he said he had from Burrowes, who had stolen them from Mr. Rose, of Bath; he then opened a pocket-book, in which I saw some memorandums, and these four small tickets; which he said were taken off some net-lace which was stolen from Mr. Rose; I came down stairs with him, and asked Withers, in his hearing, if he thought I had got all the property - Withers replied he thought I had. We were then coming away, and Withers asked Isaacs if he had told me all the circumstances - he said he had not; Withers then said,"Have you told him about your going to Bath, and bringing away in one week 103l. worth of property, of Mr. Rose's;" Isaacs replied he had not told me that; and then said that he went to Bath one Saturday evening, and returned on the Sunday week following, with a box containing goods of Mr. Rose's, to the amount of 103l., and that he had been in the habit of receiving a great many parcels from Burrowes, containing Mr. Rowe's property; I told him he must come with me to the Mansion-house; I went and mentioned the circumstances to the Lord Mayor, who directed me to take the two prisoners and Withers to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he, when he showed you these things, say that he knew at the time that they were stolen? A. Yes, and that he went down to Bath, and brought away 103l. worth of goods in one week.</p>

            . I am an officer of the City. I went on Saturday to search for Burrowes, at several places round the Waterloo-road; I found him in a street just by the Surrey Theatre - I took him into the Prince of Wales public-house, and told him I had him in custody for robbing his master at Bath, of some property; he said, "I am willing to go with you:" I took a coach, and brought him to the Mansion-house - when I told him I had him in custody he said, "I suppose I shall go to Somersetshire - I told him to ask me no questions, as it was not my duty to give him answers. When we were in the coach he said if he asked me a question would I give him an answer; I said I begged he would not, as I certainly would not answer - I left him at the Mansion-house, and went with Mr. Cope to Isaacs'; he acknowledged before me that he had received 103l. worth of goods from Burrowes, at Bath; I did not see him deliver the handkerchiefs. I went over to Clifford-street next day, to Burrowes' lodging, which Withers had pointed out; I there found a shawl, a piece of black silk, some papers, and four duplicates. I then went to the Prince of Wales, and got this parcel, containing other goods, claimed by the prosecutor. I went to the New Inn with Mr. Cope - she produced a gown-piece or something, but would not deliver it up: I again went to the New Inn, and opened a bureau, with some keys which I took from Burrowes; I there found a duplicate, two pocket-books, a quantity of letters, and a diamond pin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. All you know about Burrowes' lodging in Clifford-street, is from Withers? A. No - the landlord told me so, and showed me the room.</p>
               <p>MR. COPE. I am certain Isaacs mentioned about receiving goods from Burrowes, at Bath; Brown was not present at that time, I think; as I was up stairs with Isaacs; I found in Burrowes' pocket-books two invoices - one amounts to 45l. 7s. 8 1/2d., and the other to 58l. 10s., and this receipt, which is for 103l. 17s. 8d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you go up stairs with Isaacs for? A. He said he had some handkerchiefs in his desk up stairs. When we came down I resumed the conversation; Brown was present then; he was not present all the time - I think he heard about going to Bath.</p>
               <p>MR. ROSE re-examined. I have no doubt that these invoices are in Burrowes's hand writing - they are written on exactly the description of paper I use; the receipt for 103l. is in Burrowes's writing; Burrowes was not out of my service for two days while in my service - the tickets produced are all my writing and were affixed to my goods - I have not been at home since the goods were found, to examine if I miss them - they are such goods as I have in my stock; these pink handkerchiefs are rather damaged with folding, and I bought them under price in consequence of that; here is fifty-two yards of bobbin net mentioned in one of the invoices; and here is the ticket which was on an article of that description.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It is not impossible to make a mistake about the goods? A. It is possible. I saw two pairs of silk hose at the Mansion-house, with marks on them, which I am certain were such as I use, but I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210149"/>not swear to the writing, as it was not mine - these tickets are my own writing; Burrowes was rather more than three months with me - I think he came just after we had taken stock - I may have come to London for three days while he was with me, but I cannot recollect; if Burrows had been absent I should have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Your's is a large concern? A. Yes - I have a stock worth 12,000l. or 14,000l.; I took stock in August - it was at first intended to have the prisoner tried in Somersetshire; I could not swear to a loss unless it was to a very great extent - I have seven shopmen and three apprentices - Burrowes occasionally carried goods out to ladies; he might go out at the private door twenty times a day and not be noticed - I have lace occasionally sent me on sale or return, from Nottingham, but I never mark them - I have been in business five or six years, and may occasionally send out goods with the private markon them; if I had seen these goods in another shop I should not have had any suspicion - I never heard of Burrowes being in business - I gave him warning for being out after eleven o'clock at night - I have been to a Mr. Stokes where I had bought some poplin.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is your private mark a word or sentence? A. A sentence. When I saw the stockings, I said the letters were the same as my marks, but were not my writing; but these tickets are my own writing - if I was in town it must have been on the 2d of November - I was not in town on the 10th of October - I was at home then I am certain - the prisoner could not have come to town in October without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The invoices were here referred to; one was dated "London, 1st July, 1827 - Henry Adlam, bought of John Burrowes; the amount 47l. 7s. 8 1/2d;" the other, "London, 33, Basinghall-street, July 17, 1827; Henry Adlam, bought of John Burrowes, amount 58l. 10s." The receipt was - "Received 1st of October, 1827, of Mr. H. Adlam, 103l. 17s. 8d. for goods as per bills,</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you not sold such articles to other people? A. No doubt of it.</p>

             being called on his recognizance did not appear.</p>
               <p>BURROWES' Defence. Previous to my being employed by Mr. Rose. I was in the habit of buying and selling goods sometimes on credit, and if I had an invoice I destroyed it, and made a fresh one - they were generally five or ten per cent. lower than the regular way. Mr. Rose's private mark is "A Discovery," and many people use that mark - I myself use it, and can prove that the stockings produced at the Mansion-house were bought for cash. I got embarrassed, left off this jobbing, and took a situation. I had 120l. worth of goods in my possession, when I went into Mr. Rose's service; and, knowing Isaacs when in business at Kingston, I gave him the goods to sell, and a list of persons I did business with; I was to allow him five per cent. to sell them for me, but having goods of his own, he could not attend to mine, and sold none, except to Olding. Isaacs came to Bath to know if he might let him have goods; I said he might, and take off ten per cent for bills: both the bills were dishonoured, and I put it into my Solicitor's hands, but afterwards took my goods back. I then came from Bath; Isaacs asked me to lend him 10l. - I lent him a bill of 16l. on Olding: I told Isaacs to sell the goods for money; and the person will appear who I bought them of. When I was a town traveller in the lace trade, I knew Withers - he lived with Mr. Scott, in Ratcliff-highway; I recommended him to a Mr. Ridgway, and before the shop was opened, he and another young man took the whole stock of furs to Rotherham's; sold them, and then started - this was the first I knew of him: I did not see him again till the day after Christmas, when I met him in Sidney's-alley; he said he was in the lace trade: I said if he had anything cheap, I would buy it; he said he wanted a situation, but he had 200l. or 300l. in his pocket, which he spent very freely - he got me into a kind of labyrinth, and we were spending our money together. The tickets for the masquerade were given us, and while there, I was in liquor - he took my gold watch from me, and kept it; I asked him for it at the New Inn, and he deliberately stated that he knew nothing of it; but, by Browning speaking to him watch in possession of a woman of the town. I found Isaacs was not in the lace trade, and on that account I cut him, and he then entered into a league with this person. I shall prove he said if it cost him his life he would do for me.</p>
               <p>ISAACS' Defence. I received the goods from Burrowes, but whether they were stolen or not, I do not know. As to Brown, he was as near to me as Mr. Cope was.</p>

            . I am in no particular business; I have an agent in France; I live in West-square, Lambeth - I send goods abroad; I know Burrowes, and have had dealings with him since the beginning of last year - he was then buying goods in the linen-drapery line, or anything he could get cheap; he bought of me, shawls and lace of different kinds, and silk shawls of a variety of colours;(looking at a book) here is an entry of the 12th of February, 1827, it is a job lot of 10l. 8s., of different sorts of shawls - they were all shawls; here are some veils and lace in September last to the amount of about 16l.; here is "6th July, 6 pieces of Badanna, 13l. 10s.;" and "20th August, 16l." but I have not got the particulars of that; here is an entry "September 10th, 1827, 6 veils, and 6 lace collars, 5l. 10s." I served him with the goods, and the entries are in my hand-writing: the transactions were personal - I knew he was a jobber.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210150"/>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This book you say is in your hand-writing? A. Yes; it was all written at the times it is dated; I keep no other book - my agent's name is William Brewer, of Ghent; he keeps the English exchange-office - I lived in Kennington-lane, before I came to West-square; when I dealt with the prisoner I lived at the Horns public-house, in Gutter-lane: I was not then resident in London - I believe the prisoner then lived at No. 33, Basinghall-street - I believe he had a counting-house or room there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver these goods there? A. He generally came to me; I cannot say whether he came home in July; this entry of September is in pencil - the regular books I have, are not in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Now will you swear you saw him in town in September? A. Yes; I sold him these goods, and delivered them personally, in town; they might be sent to him - they were sent to him on the 10th of September, here in London.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not deliver them to him, personally, in London, where did you deliver them? A. I sent them to him where he was staying in Nichols-square - I did not see him there - he called on me not more than three or four days before the parcel was delivered; he called on me at a house in Newgate-market where I was to meet him; it was at a private house; a coffee-house in Ivy-lane, kept by Franklin, on the right-hand, going to Newgate-street; I saw him there three or four days before the 10th of September, and he gave me this order - I am now living at No. 8, West-square, and keep the house; I cannot swear these are any of the goods I sold him - there are hundreds and thousands like these.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you any dealing with Burrowes for goods of this kind in 1826? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever go by the name of McQuire? A. No: nor any name but Knowles.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Fleet-market; my brother sold Burrowes six pair of half silk hose; a short time ago - he sold three pair; the money was returned, and other goods taken - I believe Mr. Rose came to me about them, and said he supposed they might be his: but I compared the three pair with others, and said I believed they had been bought of me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It appeared that the prosecutor's shop mark corresponded with yours? A. Yes; he was satisfied, and it went no further.</p>
               <p>- WARNER. I am in the employ of a lace house, in Lad-lane. I have sold Burrowes linen-drapery and haberdashery, and have bought lace of him - I have known him three years; I have sold Knowles goods, perhaps, to the amount of 200l.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you sell Burrowes any thing? A. Not within the last twelve months - I think he then lived in Maiden-lane.</p>

            . I keep the New Inn, Old Bailey. I have known Burrowes about two years; he lodged at my house now and then - Isaacs came there two or three times - I knew Withers; he came once or twice, and stopped a night now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. Has ever any conversation passed, in your presence, between Burrowes, Isaacs, and Withers, respecting a robbery at Bath? A. Never; he never admitted robbing his master at Bath in my presence - I heard of Burrowes going to a masquerade, and I heard Withers say he could tell him where his watch was, and he told me so - Burrowes was complaining of its being taken from him - Withers came to my house about a fornight ago or more; he said Burrowes was in confinement for breaking glass, and if I would give him 7s. 6d. he could release him - I had not a good opinion enough of him, to give it him - I did not offer it to him. Mr. Rose came to my house, and said he was robbed, and looked at some goods which had been bought of Burrowes - the poplin was not bought of him; there was a shawl; I do not know whether he claimed that; Burrowes maintained an honest and respectable character.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did he go to Bath? A. About six weeks ago; I did not see him again till November; he sent no parcel to my house during all that time; there was a little child's cloak; nothing else; nobody came to my house for parcels sent by him; not to my knowledge - he was there some weeks in November, and has offered shawls for sale - I never saw lace - there was handkerchiefs - I am not able to say where he lived; I have heard people speak well of him at Woolwich, where his parents live, and in London.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you give him a fair price for the shawl? A. Yes; Mr. Rose said so - there was no concealment about it - I have known his parents seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often, while Burrowes was at your house, have you seen Withers with him? A. It is only recently that I have seen Withers with him at all - I never saw him and the prisoners there all three together, to my knowledge - I have no doubt of their being friends.</p>

            . I am the son of Richard Early, who tenanted the house of Mrs. Campbell; I and a friend let it to the prisoner, by my father's consent; a paper was drawn up; the prisoner took possession of it; I was all over the house the day before; I gave him possession; I am a plumber, and repaired the flap at the top; I was all over the roof; it was in a good state; the lead would have lasted for many years - the cistern was in a good state; it was a heavy substantial one - the lead pipe was in a good state; part of it was quite new - there was no reason to remove any part of the lead. The prisoner took possesion on the 5th of September, when he signed the agreement - I have not been there since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your father? A. At home; he is a carpenter and builder; he is ill; I do not know what is the matter with him; he was out yesterday; he knows nothing about Gray; he is under Dr. M'Donald's hands; I am not a carpenter - I swear all the lead was in perfect order, when the prisoner took possession; it had been repaired about two months before by myself and brother, who is twenty-six years old; he is in the same line of business; he is not here. The prisoner was to take the house as a tenant at 45l. a year, then there was a written agreement made, and I believe he was to take the rest of my father's lease - I never examined the house after he took it; I have been to the door; he took it for four years and a quarter - my father lives with me in County-terrace, New Kent-road.</p>

            . I am a labourer; I live in Essex-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner applied to me two or three weeks before Michaelmas to take the lead off the top of this house, in Devonshire-street; he came up while I was at work, and told me to cut the lead off the flat and cut it to pieces; it was the lead which goes over the roof to protect it from the wet; there was no plumber there - the prisoner went away and left me at work; the lead was put into a cart, in Devonshire-street, by the prisoner's order, about twelve o'clock in the day - the cart drove away; I was afterwards employed by the prisoner to take away the lead of the sink, which was fixed; that lead was very bad indeed - it was cut up and put down in the yard; it could not be used again; I said nothing to him about it, but did what he bid me - I took a leaden cistern away from facing the kitchen window; I chopped it up and put it into the kitchen; I said nothing to him about it; the sink and cistern were carried out in the cart; I helped to load it; the prisoner paid me for my trouble - I was there again nearly three months after, but took nothing more away; there was a leaden gutter went under the floor; I took that up by his order, and it was taken to a plumber's place, and I came away, leaving the prisoner there; nothing was said about selling it in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything done to repair the roof from which the lead was taken? A. We pitched some part and, were going to pitch the rest, but the rain came on, and it came through the ceilings; a tarpauling was put on one night, and some boards were put on - they partly kept the rain out; Mr. Gray slept in the house; only the first floor bed-room was furnished, besides the kitchen - there was no servant there; I was there nearly every day - I do not know why the tarpauling was moved - it was only there one night; I left the premises before Christmas - they were in the same state as I put them in in September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you white-washed and painted about the house? A. Yes; some part of the lead was very bad; I cannot say whether it was fit to remain there; the cistern was in very good order - the other things were bad: Gray remained in the house all the time - he did what he could to keep the wet out: he did not direct me to conceal anything; it was all done in open day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was any repair done while you were there? A. A trunk was afterwards put from the top of the house, to carry the water away; the flat would not last many years. I am not a plumber; I was bred to no trade - I am no judge of the state of the lead: there was no pipe put to carry the water to the trunk. The house is two stories high - I painted and washed the kitchen, nothing else; I only painted the dresser - the trunk was put up about a month after I moved the lead - it was a wooden pipe, down from the bottom of the house to the top.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I came to London on the 10th of September, and met the prisoner at the Poulterers' Arms, Leadenhall-market; I got into conversation with him; he said he knew my brother; I said I wanted a house, or part of one, as I was coming to town, and I and my brother were to live together; he said he had a small house, and should have part of it to let; I went there on the 15th of September - he took me into the kitchen and the first floor; I saw Walkington chopping up lead, and bending it into a small compass; the prisoner took me to the second floor, to show me the apartment, and then on the top of the house, and while I was there he ordered Walkington to rip the lead from the top; I left Walkington there, and came down with Gray; a genteel man was in the shop, whom Gray said was going to have the parlour on the first floor - we all went and had some thing to drink; a person then came for the prisoner, and we all went over to the house; there was a cart in the street; the man said, "I have come for the lead;" he asked me and the young man to help put it into the cart, which then went away; the prisoner then said he had some business to look after, and told us to go to the public-house, and he would come to us in half an hour; I did not go, but went away. On the 17th my brother came to town - we both went on the 18th, and took two rooms on the second floor; I slept there that night, and next night the rain came through so much, we were obliged to go up to the third floor, to put things to catch it; we told Gray of it next day, and he said it should be repaired. In about a fortnight I saw Walkington cutting up the gutter, which ran through the passage; Gray was about then generally; the first floor was taken up to get at it - it carried the water into the sewer: it was cut into pieces - it looked to me a good thick pipe; I staid there about eleven weeks - the house was never repaired; we repeatedly told him of the water coming through, and some boards were laid on the top,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210152"/>which kept it out a little - there was a wooden cistern, and a wooden gutter; the flat on the top was never repaired. I saw Gray one Sunday morning, putting some pieces of painted paper on the top, to make the rain run into the trunk; I asked if he did not intend to put the lead on again; he said No, he should give it a good pitching.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live now? A. In Swan-street, Minories; my brother is a carver and gilder - I live with him; the lead in the house looked very good lead; nobody could call it bad lead - Gray never told me to keep anything secret; every thing was done in the day time; I did not know the landlord. - The lead was taken off before we went there, but he said he was going to replace it directly; he put a new wooden spout up.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You heard him order the lead to be ripped off? A. Yes, and he said there should be new lead; it would have been better for us if the lead was left on - there was nothing in its place but paper pitched.</p>

            . I live in Somers-town-terrace. I am a house-agent and appraiser; I went to this house, and put a man in possession, by Mrs. Campbell's direction, on the 22d of January - I went on the roof, and saw all the lead taken away, and the fencing gone, so that any person might have fallen off; I then went down stairs - the water was running down the walls - the ceiling dropping down, and the whole house in such a state as would strike a person with horror - it was occasioned by the lead being removed from the top; the cistern and leaden pipe were gone; a wooden trunk was put up, but that was not to be compared to the value of the lead; Gray called on me on the Friday following - I asked why he took the lead off the house; he said there were several holes in it, and that the cistern fell down - I had put in a distress for 44l. 10s.; the effects were valued and sold for 13l. 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the rent due from Gray or Early? A. From both, I suppose; I did not see the lead before it was taken away, and cannot say it was lead; there were no repairs done.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you not communication with Gray? A. Yes, he spoke of it as lead; I was not there after the 29th - no repairs were done then.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a written defence, stated that he had bought the fixtures, and given his acceptance of four months to Early; that he found the premises dilapidated, and got Mr. Cole to survey them; that he had not moved the lead for his own benefit, but that it was done in the course of the repairs.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and builder. I have known the prisoner many years; I surveyed the house, No. 4, Devonshire-street, in September last, by his desire - I found the back part in a most dilapidated state - it was weather boarded, but the boards were quite rotten - the lead-flat leaked in three or four places, and had bagged the ceiling under it; there was an old lead pipe down the angle of the weather-boards - it was in a very bad state, and had rotted the weather-boards; it was necessary to have them repaired - the pipe must be taken down to repair the boards; the sink had rotted the boards underneath it, and was stinking; nobody could have lived there comfortably; the floor was not rotten, but damp through it; I have been there within this fortnight; there was a water-closet, the pipes of that were bad - I suggested what repairs I thought necessary - I certainly considered the repairs necessary, considering he had four years and a half lease to run; the prisoner has commenced the repairs, and was going on with them - he bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He did not get you to look at them before he took them? A. No; he called the day after; I sent no notice to the landlord of what was to be done; I advised him to carry the boardwork higher, and make a lean-too roof; to remove the privy, and suggested that a woodden trunk, well-pitched, would carry the water off the top; I advised the removal of the sink, and a stone one has been put up - I saw that about a fortnight ago, since he has been custody - I do not know when it was done; the cistern was in the way, and I thought a wooden one would answer the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not in two days have had fresh lead put on? A. Yes, but I advised him to have it done different; he lived Islington before that, and at Holloway, four or five years ago - he did what I advised him; the water appeared to have come through the ceiling recently - the stains were on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he do what he could within the time? A. Most assuredly; it would cost him a considerable sum to do all I advised - I think the lead would not have sold for what he has done.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and have been so twenty years; I was employed by the prisoner; I saw the lead-flat of the house - it was in a very bad state, cracked in ten or twelve places; I put my trowel under it, and tore it up very easy - it did not appear to me to have been repaired for eight or ten years; a crack or two might have been repaired; the ceiling was stained, bagged, and the wet had come in; the boards had given way, and the ceiling had sunk down; the lead was too heavy; I advised him to put on tiles - he ordered me to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were attacked with the gout in your stomach? A. No; the prisoner was; that prevented his attending to it for four or five weeks, and he recovered it temporily during the time - I knew he was ill; I saw the cistern that evening in a good state; he said the sink stunk; I advised him to remove it, and have a stone one; I fixed a wooden cistern over the sink - I moved the privy, and made a new cesspool; the gutter was removed, as it was then unnecessary; and I repaved the yard; he repaired the place as much as I would have done for myself; my account was 12l. or 14l. - the lead was not worth more than 6l., according to my idea of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When was you called to view the premises? A. Two or three days after he went in; Early was not apprised of the alterations - I should think the lead weighed eight or nine cwt. I advised that the gutter should be taken up; the wooden cistern was to be leaded - the stone sink was put up the latter end of September - it was in the yard, visible to all; he has paid me partly for what I did - I should think him 20l. out of pocket.</p>

            , I am a plumber. I saw the lead on the flat, and had orders from Gray to repair it, but it was impossible to do so, the boards under it having given way - it leaked in more than twenty places; I advised him to take it up, and send it to a lead merchant, and take new lead - it might have been done in two or three days, and I expected to hear more of it, but I heard he meant to have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210153"/>tiled roof, and that would be 5l. out of his pocket after selling the lead.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. But was it done? A. No; there was some painted paper put over; it would take eight or ten days to make the tile roof - the cistern did not stand safe; the bearers were not strong enough to support it - it must be taken down to have new ones - it leaked in half a dozen places - the pipe must be taken down to repair the weather-boards, and would not go up again; the repairs would be to his loss - a new wooden pipe was put up; the leaden one was very bad; it is worth more than the new one; but the wooden one is most useful.</p>

            , (see page 262.) The prisoner was tried at the Borough Session for the felony charged in this indictment, before the Learned Recorder; who directed an acquittal there, on the ground, that the felony having been committed in the City, and not in Southwark, although within five hundred yards of that District, yet that the Statute of 12 Geo. IV., sec. 64, extended to counties only. Upon the prisoner being indicted for the offence in London, he pleaded his formal acquittal, which was submitted to the consideration of the Twelve Judges, who determined, that the clause in question did not extend to Boroughs, and that the plea was not good.</p>
