               <p>I am servant to a pawnbroker in Bridges-street, Covent Garden.

               <p>Mr. Thompson. This mug is my property; it has been in the family about two years; it has my crest and motto upon it; it cost four guineas. With regard to the curtain I think I can safely swear to it, but it has no particular mark; I cannot positively swear to it. I can only swear to one of the sheets, worth about 7 or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020004"/>8s. this shirt has my mark, it is worth about 8s. the milk pot I think is worth 13s. I know it by the crest and motto; the pepper castor has the same, and is worth 10s. the four window curtains are mine; I think they are worth a guinea and a half; the two sheets are mine, they are worth half-a-guinea; the shirts are mine, my name is on them, they are worth 15s.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, about six or seven weeks ago (I don't know what day of the month), between six and seven in the evening, I was going with the last witness and another person in a chaise cart; I sat at the outside on the left hand; Maddox sat on the right hand and drove; a man stopped the head of the horse; he came up on the right hand side I know, because while Maddox was thrashing him I did all I could to see his face, but the horse's head was between him and me, and of course I could not see the man; immediately the man at the horse's head said, blast you, fire at them: I did not see any body till I had received the fire; it was fired at the left hand, close to me; it was the man that stood at the horse's head that fired, I am certain of that; he gave the order to fire: directly as he ordered the man to fire, I naturally put my elbow up, and received the ball in my elbow, and the fire struck my face; the next morning, when I went to put on my coat, it fell out; as soon as I had recovered from the blow, I turned round and saw a man close to me, but who it was I don't know.</p>

Joiner caught hold of one of the men as he came through the posts, and desired me to catch hold of the other. The prisoner said he had been shot at he believed, for he heard the shot go over his head; I said, now then we will go back and see who has shot you. We took him back, and took him to the cart, about one hundred yards, as near as possible, and there they said that was the man that held the horse by the head. We then took him and put him into Highgate cage. I did not see him searched; I tied his hands behind him; he said, for God's sake, let me go.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross examination he said it was a dark night, but that there was a stage going by with two lamps, that Mr. Fox the constable had him in custody afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

One of them said, I came from him the day before yesterday, and brought a letter from him for you, and left it at the Lower Wrestlers, Highgate; he wrote down the name of Warwickshire and Gloucestershire, where he had been, and I paid a pot of beer, and went home to South-street, Manchester-square, and had some tea; I told my wife I should be back by nine o'clock at farthest; when I got to Highgate it was dark; I asked a man in Highgate whereabouts it was, and he directed me to keep strait forward, and I should see it on the right hand; I went forward, and seeing a light lower down the hill on the right hand, I imagined it to be the Lower Wrestlers; I made for that light, it being dark; I did not know the Lower Wrestlers; I walked on a great pace, and just before I came to this light I overtook a man with a light smock frock, and asked him which was the Lower Wrestlers; he said, my friend, you are coming beyond it; says he, it is farther back; I thanked him; he wished me good night, and we parted; I had not left him I dare say above thirty or forty rods before this cart stopped, and a pistol fired, though I did not know it to be a cart or a chaise, it was so dark; and by the pistol being fired, I dare say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020006"/>I might run twelve or fourteen yards in a fright, not knowing whether the person in the dark might shoot at me or not, till I came to the posts, where I met with these two men, who asked me what was the matter; I said I could not tell; I did not know whether I was shot at or not; these two people passed me four or five yards; I went towards Highgate, and they went towards the place where the pistol was fired; they turned back, and one clapped his hand upon one shoulder and the other upon the other, and said you are the man I have been looking for; I made answer - then I suppose I must go with you, and then they took hold of me and pulled me right in the middle of the road, and kept crying out, - We have got him, we have got him! Upon that, they took me to the cart, Maddox was there, and he said he believed I was the man that held the horse; upon that they tied my hands behind me; upon which, Singleton laid hold of me, and said he was a constable, and would take care of me, and put me in the care of these two men that took me up; one of them was so intoxicated, he tumbled backwards. Maddox got out of the cart to secure me from running away, and they took me to Highgate, to a public house, I believe the Red Lion, and there they sent for a constable and searched me, and found nothing about me but a knife, four shillings, a pocket-book, with a direction to the person at the Lower Wrestlers, where I was going for this letter.</p>

               <p>Q. How many yards is the Wrestlers from the place where the cart stopped, an hundred yards? - A. A great deal more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the place where the cart stopped further from London than the Lower Wrestlers? - A. Yes, five or six hundred yards; I dare say a great way; the Wrestlers is the last public-house in the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any houses near the place where you were stopped? -

               <p>Q. Was he sober or tipsey? - A. He had been drinking: they found about four shillings, I believe, in a little bit of a sob in his watch pocket, and the prisoner said he had a paper in his pocket to call for a letter, and said he had got past the house and lost his road; it was a very dark night, I could hardly see my hands; when I went out to the door there were so many people about him I was obliged to push them away; I saw them pull a bit of paper out of his pocket, but what the contents were I don't know, nor did I hear it read.</p>

Yes; I have known this man more than sixteen years; he was a postilion to my father three or four years; he behaved extremely well; I had directions from my father to get him a better place; I did; he behaved extremely well in that place; a few years ago I recommended him to another place, after having made an enquiry into his conduct in the former places, which I found to be as good as when he lived with my father; I have had the opportunity of hearing from him constantly; from that time to the present he was always industrious, and supported his wife and family by his labour; he is a most excellent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020007"/>coachman, and I have, since he was taken up, heard such a character as few men in his situation could boast; he was confined in the hospital about five months ago; after he recovered he came to me, and I gave him some money, and have been trying to recommend him to a coachman's place; unfortunately Mr. Watt is out of town, who assured me he recommended him to Mr. Bolton. I declare, my Lord, if he was acquitted, I would take him into my service to-morrow.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. I should suppose you had a good opinion of him? - A. The lease was a very good security: I had a good opinion of him at the same time. The prisoner's wife applied to me on Wednesday the 7th of October, in the evening, about six o'clock, to tell they were overburdened with halfpence; I told her we were also overburdened with halfpence; I consented to take ten or twenty pounds; I sent the man down to their house, and he brought up twenty pounds; about half an hour after that, Edwards himself brought up twenty pounds more, to my counting-house in Liquor-Pond-street; I expostulated with him upon the impropriety of bringing twenty pounds more, when I consented only to take twenty; he said he had got twenty more, which made sixty, and was particularly impertinent; upon which, I said, you are a very impertinent man; I desire these halfpence may go back again, and it is not of any use for me to talk to you - you put in ten words to my one - you are an impertinent fellow, and I with you would not come here any more, but go to another brewhouse, and pay off your account; and then I left him; I did not stop to hear any reply.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you took him up you got all your beer out of his cellar, by your servants? - A. Yes: it was not in condition to draw.</p>

            You must know whether it was a contrivance to get the beer out of his possession before you took him? - A. It was not in a condition to draw.</p>
               <p>Q. I must have a plain answer; was not that a contrivance to get away his property, before you took him up? - A. I cannot pretend to say that was not a consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it or was it not the reason that you would not take him up till you had got the possession of the property? - A. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that it was not with an intention, first of all, to get away his property before you took him up, that that was done? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was it taken away at the request of the prisoner? - No; he consented to it, for it was really not in a condition to draw.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not make any remonstrance against it, but behaved in an orderly way? - A. The beer was out of condition and had; he was going on in such a riotons way, in drunkenness, fighting, and playing in such a bad tradesman-like manner, that I did not think the property safe in his hands, that was one reason.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was another reason that you would not take him up till you had got the property from him? - A. That was not the whole reason, coupling the two things together with the letter he wrote, and the manner in which he was living, that I did not think it safe even if the letter had not been read.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was not this the reason why you wished to get the property from him? - A. Both coupled together was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to take away this beer before you suspected he was the author of this letter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the man endeavoured from that time to do all the justice in his power as to any demands you had against him? - A. He has certainly paid me all; he does not owe us a shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. You did not order him to be apprehended immediately? - A. No, the reason of that was, I wished to consult my friends upon the subject what steps were proper to take.</p>

               <p>Q. Independent of your memory of the character of his writing, and having seen the instrument that he wrote, independent of any comparison of the one with the other, can you take upon yourself to say whether you believe this to be or no this hand writing? - A. No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. I see there is no name to that letter, therefore the only character of hand writing you have had an opportunity to observe has constituted his name? - A. Yes.</p>

            Does your Lordship think we are intitled to read the letter now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He says he has seen him write, to be sure; that he believes it, which is all that a man can say, but he cannot swear to it. This witness has gone so far as that, and therefore I think I am bound to receive it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. It is matter for the Jury. the man is uncommonly cautious; the way to prove a hand writing is, by asking the witness called to prove it to ask, if he has seen the party write, and if he believes the paper produced to be of his hand writing? The witness I understand to say he believed it to be his writing; and he says further, he cannot swear to it; he does right in saying he cannot swear to it; but so far as he believes it to be his hand writing is the evidence that has ever been admitted; how far it applies is for the Jury.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, from having seen him write, do you think you are able, upon looking at any instrument, to say whether you believe that to be his hand writing or not? - A. I think I can. (The letter is shewn to him.) This letter I have seen before.</p>
               <p>Q. But from having seen him write before, notwithstanding you have seen that identical letter before, from that ground of forming your opinion do you believe that to be his hand writing or not? - A. I am certain it is more his hand writing than I ever saw any man's in my life; I have looked over it minutely, and I believe it to be his hand writing.</p>

This is the letter I saw at Bow-street, and I saw it was very much like what he had wrote and sent up there: I will not take upon me to swear that it is his hand writing; I believe it to be wrote by the same hand as wrote the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't talk of comparing it with any hand writing you saw at the Office; but whether you, upon the view of it, believe it to be the hand writing of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I don't believe it is; I cannot take upon me to say, that it is, or that it is not.</p>

            When was this? - A. On the 1st of June we took it out of Mr. Weedon's field, about eleven o'clock at night, at Mile-end.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was Mr. Weedon's? - A. The prisoner at the bar said it was, and that he had one out of the same field a little while before; we took it to Fenny Stratford, and sold it to Lucas, who keeps the public house there, for 6l. the prisoner and I were both together, and we shared the money; two guineas were paid at first, and as we came out of the country the prisoner called for the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the two guineas paid? - A. The next morning, after we took it out of the field; we went lower into the country with two more horses, down to Birmingham; we crossed the country, and sold another horse at another place; we returned to Fenny Stratford, about a week after, and received the rest of the money, in gold and silver, making altogether 6l.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went into the field when the mare was taken out? - A. The prisoner and me both together, and brought her over the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the prisoner took you to the field, or how? - A. Yes, the prisoner lived just by there; I lived almost by Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A tineman and brazier.</p>

No; Bowtell came for the money; the prisoner at the bar did not claim any of the money; nor I did not pay him any; I paid Bowtell two guineas; I think they said they were going down into the country; and I was short of money; they called again in about ten days, or thereabouts, and then I paid the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present? - A. Yes; I paid it to Bowtell.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Miles's defence. I was rather disguised in liquor; a man offered me these boots for sale; I told him I was a hard-working man; I did not want them, but being in liquor I bought them; I gave 6s. for them; I was going to get some money that was in arrears from the regiment that was with the Duke of Yord; that man knows I carried them publickly in the street; one man offered me 5s. for them, and I thought it was not enough; this man would not buy them, and I thought it better to lose 1s. than lose my time; I went back with the boots, and then he told me they were stolen, and he would swear they were; the man was sent for, and he owned one pair of the boots; I went along with the constable very quietly; he never held me; I might have run away, but I would not, because I know myself innocent; this man said he knew them that sold them to him; that they were such rubbish he could not make them up for his own shop; I asked this young man to go along with me and I would treat him with some beer when I got the money from the major; and the man at the bar said he would swear that this young man took them; he wanted to make it up if I would give him the boots, and I would not.</p>

(The boards produced in court.) They have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Remnant. These are the boards that were shewn to me next morning; I compared them with others I had in the lost, and they corresponded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man, in Mr. Remnant's yard, asked me to stop and help him out with them; the place is twenty feet high; it is impossible I should get them out without assistance; he desired I would take them to a public house at the corner; Kelly passed me, and said, what have you got here? I made no answer, knowing myself to be innocent; he asked if they were mahogany; I said, I believe they are: what is your name? I told him my name and where I lived, and then he took me to the watch-house; I made no resistance; and at the time he stopped me he was at the distance of a yard from me; and when he took me to the watch-house, I begged he would let my wife know, and gave him the same direction that I had given before, to let her know, not to be uneasy at my staying out all night, which he did; I have a wife and three children, and I don't know that she has another hour to go.</p>
               <p>Kelly. You told me you had a wife and three children, and begged I would let you go; I told him it would not answer the ends of justice, and I would not.</p>

            Had I not the boards upon me, and then called for a light; and while you was getting the light, when you had no hold of me, I made no resistance, knowing myself to be innocent? - A. I did not say you did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Remnant knows that it is impossible for me to have got them out without their being given to me.</p>
               <p>One of the jury. I know this wall, and I think it totally impossible for any man to get a plank out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Remnant. I am persuaded it was given out by somebody; it is a part of a system that has been carried on for a considerable time, and has been committed in the open day; the wall, I suppose, is fourteen or fifteen feet high, that is the utmost; they must have been given out by somebody on the premisses.</p>
               <p>Jury to Kelly. Q. Did you go round to the timber yard to know if there was any body in the premisses? - A. I sent, and the porter was suspected, who absconded the next morning.</p>
               <p>Jury to Remnant. Q. Did the porter go without his wages? - A. Yes, but he sent for them next day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to be perfectly sober at the time? - A. He appeared to be quite sober; we went to her father's apartment; we called her mother by name; she refused to let us in; the door was not locked, and we went in and found the prisoner in bed with a little girl; as soon as the prosecutor saw her face, he said, that was the same woman that was in company with him; we asked her if she knew any thing of the watch, and she said no; there were three boxes one over the other; and a key lay on the box; she said that was a key that belonged to a box she had in the house; I asked for the keys of the other boxes, and her mother delivered them to me; I searched the boxes, but could not find the watch; there was a cupboard of which she would not let me have the key; one of the watchmen took a pair of pincers that lay in the room, and wrenched open the lock, and I found the watch in the cupboard.

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; we went and searched, but no watch was to be found; we had information of her father's house, and went and found her in bed with a child; there was a cupboard in the room, we demanded the key, she would not give it, and my partner took up a pair of pinchers and forced open the lock, and found the watch.</p>

            There was a great many people running at the same time? - A. Yes; I might take the right or the wrong. I cannot tell.</p>

            Most certainly; I made strict enquiry after it; in the course of an hour after, the prisoner, Jesson, was brought to the ship, to the best of my knowledge, by William Elby, and another person whom I should know if I saw him; when Elby brought him on board, he said, he stopped a box of sugar from the prisoner and another person; the prisoner informed him they had it from the ship; he asked me if I had lost such a thing; I said undoubtedly I had; he said Jesson informed him it came from my ship, the Rose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the company of Elby. - A. Yes, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was not brought with him? - A, No, I said I had lost a box, and supposed it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of this, go any where with the prisoner and Elby? - No, I did not; they left the ship, and at five or six o'clock I went to the Public-office, Shadwell, there I saw the box, (The box produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the quantity of sugar in it? - A. About forty pounds; when I saw it at the office there was more sugar in it than when I saw it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sugar the same sort with that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you the sole owner of this ship? - A. No; no part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the captain? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you know that he was in the service of a lighterman? - A. I do not know; I suppose he belonged to a very bad one, from his hovering round the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether it is not the custom of the servants of lighterman, after they have seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020024"/>a lighter at the place of its destination, to wait tis return, and ply about the River for any thing they can earn for their masters? -

               <p>Q. Had not you some coopers working on board the ship at the time? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not one of the cooper's who had access to this box absconded since? - A. I have heard so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This cooper had more access to the box than the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner Jesson on board? - A. No.</p>

            , the constable; the box was put in the corner of the tap room; I kept my eye on it that it might not be taken away; when the constable came, we put it on Paine's back, and went with it to the Office in Shadwell; Elby has had the custody of the box.</p>
               <p>On his Cross-examination by Mr. Knowlys. He said there were two other persons in the boat besides Jesson; that it is common for watermen to help in lifting boxes out of the boat when they are hired to bring them on shore; that he did not see the two men pay Jesson for bringing it, but that it is not customary for lumpers to pay any thing till they have disposed of their goods; that he told them, before he stopped them, that he could get a customer for them, in order that he might have an opportunity of sending for a constable.</p>
               <p>On being asked where he came from to give evidence, he said, from the New Prison, where he was for a quarrel; that he had been there a week, or rather better; that he did not ask any body to be bail for him, because he did not chuse to trouble any body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. - Q. How came you to say, first you should take them, and afterwards that you would get a customer for them? - A. I did it in order to be able to take them.</p>

               <p>Q. How many persons were in the front and back shops? - A. I believe about four; I saw the prisoner in the back shop, looking at some goods; after she went out of the shop, the person who was serving her went after her and brought her back, and accused her of stealing something; his name is Pennington; she said she was an innocent woman, and no thief, and made a number of excuses; we sent for a constable to search her; she wanted to get to the counter where the muslins were; we surrounded her, and kept her in the middle of the shop; the constable not coming very soon, I set a chair in the middle of the shop, and desired her to sit down; there was nothing on the ground then but the carpet; when the constable came, I proposed to go into a private room, and search her; she rose from her seat, and I saw a piece of muslin under her petticoats, on the floor; it was a piece of about twenty yards; it is charged 5l. it cost 6l. 5s.</p>
               <p>Q. It sells for more than that, I suppose? - A. Yes; more than that; I took it up, it felt warm; I gave it the constable; we then took her to a magistrate; her examination was taken down in writing; after the magistrate left the room, she said, she was not afraid of what we could do to her; she could live in another country as well as here, alluding, I suppose, to Botany Bay.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said, his master was not in the shop, he was confined to his bed; that there were two persons in the shop besides Penhington and himself; that there were muslins lying on the counter; that they were about three yards from the fire, they might be more or less; that he did not know that they could be warm from the fire; he did not feel the other muslins; that she offered to be searched before the constable came; that they did not search her, but she turned her pockets inside out; that she had purchased something to the amount of fifteen or twenty shillings, and paid for it; that he did not say they had transported several women, and the prisoner would be a good one for Barrington.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Woolloton; On Thursday last I was in the front shop, the prisoner came in and asked to look at some clear muslins; I shewed her some; she said, she wished to see some whole pieces; she wanted a whole piece for a dress; then I asked her to walk into the back shop, and after looking some time, she made choice of one, which was to be 9l.; then, she said, she wanted to look at some sprig muslins, which I shewed her; what led me to suspect she was a shop-lister was, she asked to look at some Irish, for a body lining, at the same time; I told her the Irish linens were in the other shop, and desired her to walk there; she said it did not signify, she would not have it; she looked a long time at the sprig muslin before she would tell me whether she would have the sprig muslin, or the plain one she had chosen; at length she fixed on the plain one; she then asked to look at some remnants of printed cotton; all the pieces of plain muslin I had shewn were lying on the slab, in the back shop; I put them on the slab, at the end of the shop, to have a clear place to shew her the cottons; she bought two remants of cotton and two yards of flannel, which came to 19s. 6d.; she told me to send the muslin to No. 42, Newman-street, that night, at seven o'clock, or the next morning, at eleven, and she would pay for it; she afterwards said, if she did not call for it that night, I might send it the next morning; upon her going out of the shop, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020026"/>followed her, and brought her back again; I stood on one side of her, and the clerk on the other, in order that she should not get rid of any property she had; she sat herself down in a chair, and upon her getting up, there was a piece of muslin under her petticoats, lying on the floor; it was taken by the constable to the Office; Mr. Rundell took it from the floor, and delivered it to the constable, immediately on his taking it up; he said it had been in a very warm place, for the muslin was very warm; I examined it; it is Mr. Woolloton's property; there is a private mark upon it, in Mr. Woolloton's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any pains to see if there were any missing? - A. It is impossible, the quantity is so great, to miss a piece; when she was brought back, and sat down in the chair, there was nothing on the floor.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, she came back very readily; and upon his mentioning his suspicion, desired to be searched; that there was a third person there, but when the constable came in, he went out; that he believed the chair she sat in was about two yards from the counter; that when he took up the muslin, and found it warm, he felt the muslin on the counter, because the prisoner said, the muslin found under her was warm from the fire; that on the counter was not warm; that the chair she sat in was a yard, or more, from the fire. Being asked, if a person, going by, might not have brushed that muslin off the counter, he said, no; for they were not at that time on the counter; he had removed them, and put them on the slab; that they were on the counter when she was looking at them; and they were on the slab, at the end of the counter, when she was in the chair; that the muslins on the slab were nearer the fire than the piece he took from under her; that they did not search her on her being brought back, because they did not know that they had a right to search her without a constable; that she was searched by the constable, and afterwards by a woman, at the Office, but nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Court. - Q. Did you look to see if there were any mark upon it? - A. Yes; the shop mark, in Mr. Woolloton's hand-writing; I put my name upon it at the Office; and there were the initials of the house, where it was bought, in his hand-writing; I don't know it by any other mark.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for to Mr. Woolloton's, on the 26th of November, between three and four in the afternoon; I found the prisoner sitting in a chair in the hack shop; Mr. Rundell and Mr. Pennington were with her; Mr. Rundell took up a piece of muslin from the floor, and gave it into my hand; it was close by the prisoner's feet; I took it and the prisoner to the Office; Mr. Pennington took it from me at the Office; and has kept it from that time to this; I should know it again, because I put my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, there were some muslins on the counter, or slab, about two feet and a half from it; that they might have tumbled from that place to where she sat; that the made no objection to be searched; that there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Pennington. I received the muslin from the constable, at the Office, and have kept it ever since; it is my master's property; it cost 125s. it is marked G D; it is one of the muslins I shewed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to insist upon it, independent of the marks, that you shewed that piece of muslin to the prisoner? - A. Only from the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that is one of the pieces you shewed her? - A. Yes, by the marks on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you shewed her that piece? - A. I shewed her all that were in the wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the plain muslins in the shop of that mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember all the marks of the muslins you shewed her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my desence to my counsel.</p>

As far as from here to the bottom of the Old Bailey, or not quite so far; I cannot say exactly; one of the bundles was tied up in a sheet, and the other in a table cloth; we took them to the watch-house, and went back again; at the back of the Barleymow, in a lane that goes to Labour-in-Vainhill, we found a sheet and two table cloths lying loose on the ground, and this iron crow(producing it) lying by them; we took them to the watch-house; they have been in my custody ever since; the two bundles were close to the front door; the others close to the back door; as soon as the Barley-mow was open I went in, and observed Jackson in the Barley mow; he had called for some purl and gin; I asked him what his name was, he told me his name was Thomas Jackson (I should have mentioned before, that when I came to the watch-house; I observed several of the sheets and cloths stained with blood; it appeared to me to be fresh); I asked Jackson where he lived; he came a false direction; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020028"/>said he lived at No. 1, Green-arbour-court, Dowgate-hill; I went and enquired, and there were no lodgers in the house; I took him into custody immediately; in consequence of the linen being bloody, I asked him to let me look at his hand; he told me he would see me damned first, or any bloody constable like me; I did not look at his hand; he said if he must go to the Compter he would have some purl and gin before he went; he took the purl in his left hand to drink, and I observed some blood on his little finger; he said he had cut his finger, and, damn me, what was that to me; he said to the landlord, I am going to the Compter, I may be robbed by some damned rascal of a constable, I will give you what money I have, and he gave him 2l. 9s. 6d. I received it from Mr. Curtis, at the Barley-mow (producing it); I can swear this is the money I received from him.</p>

            Where is the Barley-mow? - A. In Thames-street, almost opposite Mr. Crawshaw's yard; when I went to Mr. Wilson's wharf, I found every strain in the warehouse door, in the counting-house door, and the desks, corresponded with this crow.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole; Going round on my duty, a little before five o'clock, I picked up these two bundles of linen, about twenty yards from the Barley-mow, the side nearest Mr. Wilson's; I went to the watch-house and informed Mr. Willoughby, the officer of the night; we came back, and found at the back door two table cloths, and a sheet, and an iron crow, near the Barley-mow door; they were taken to the watch-house; Willoughby has had them in his possession; we sent two watchmen to take care of the back door of the Barley-mow till the house was opened; then Willoughby and I went in, and found Jackson in the public house; this was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before six o'clock; he was drinking some purl; Willoughby challenged him, and rubbed him down his pockets to see if he had any thing in them; he had nothing but a pen-knife.</p>

               <p>I am the landlord of the Barley-mow public-house; the prisoners both used my house; they were both there on the evening before Mr. Wilson's warehouse was broke open; I cannot recollect the time they came; I believe it was before ten; they went away a little before twelve; there were more people in company with them; they went away at the same time, and another person with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from Mr. Wilson's warehouse? - A I cannot justly say; it is above one hundred yards, I suppose: they both called me, up; I cannot say th hour; I went down, Jackson said his wife was ill, and desired I would let him have some gin; I think that was nearly about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the third person in company with them then, or were they alone? - A. The third person was not with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where they lived? - A. No; I let them have some gin, and they went out of my house directly; about twenty minutes before six Jackson came in again, at the front door, and asked for some purl; before I had lighted the fire to heat the purl, the watchman came in, and began to speak to him; they asked who he was, and fest down his cloaths; I was about my business, and did not attend much to what passed; he was taken into custody before he went out of the house; I received 2l. 9s. 6d. of him; I put it in my right-hand breeches-pocket; I had nothing in that pocket before but a bad sixpence, and that was done up in paper, and not mixed with the money Jackson gave me; I gave the money I received of him to Willoughby; before I delivered it, Mr. Wilson's son desired to see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. - Q. All you mean to say is, you delivered the amount of the sum you received from Jackson to Willoughby? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know any thing of the money itself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. - Q. Did you deliver to the officer precisely the same money Jackson delivered to you? - A. Yes; the money was told into my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. What, was the money told into your hands? - A. Two guineas, and the rest in silver.</p>

            (To Mr. Wilson, jun.) Do you know any part of that money? - A. Yes, the sixpence; I saw the money in the hands of the landlord; the sixpence was among it then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. Is there any mark besides its being an old sixpence, and battered, by which you can swear to it? - A. Not that I know of; it is a very remarkable sixpence; it is battered and beat about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see a sixpence besides this that was beat and battered? - A. No, not as that is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. - Q. You take upon you to swear to the identity of that sixpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you pick it out from any other money? - A. Yes; I picked it out at the Lord Mayor's.</p>

I gave Mr. Colquhoun information two months before that; I was a long time before I could find it out; they would not sell any before me; as soon as I could come at the bottom of it, to purchase any, I always acquainted the magistrate with it every week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever act as a porter at an auction? - A. No; I lived as clerk, fifteen years ago, with Mr. Williams, the second door in Pall Mall; he sometimes had auctions, and I perhaps used to clerk down for him, or the like of that, and received the money for him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. He had half-a guinea, two half-crowns, and a shilling, good? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>EDWARD ROGERS sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of September last I went to the house of the prisoner, in <placeName id="t17951202-24-crimeloc126">Saffron-place, Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, he gave information to Mr. Colquhoun, the very next morning, that there was nothing found at the prisoner's house; that he had been a bankrupt but once; that near 60l. a year was settled upon his wife previous to his bankruptcy, and that he delivered the trust deed to his creditors, in case he should be the survivor.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 11th of October, about three quarters past ten o'clock, I went to meet the prisoner, by appointment, at <placeName id="t17951202-25-crimeloc132">the Mitre, in Goswell-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. How am I to know that this was not a fair transaction between the prisoner and the witness; it might be a fair exchange? I have nothing to do with French money, sitting here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gullen. A. I believe we can prove the value.</p>
               <p>Rogers. I did not know that they were French till I examined them afterwards, they were mixed with the others.</p>
               <p>Court. You have failed in proving your second count; it is now for you to make out your first: they are charged as being in the similitude of an English shilling, and that they were sold at a lower rate than they imported.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed afterwards? - A. I went away, and immediately communicated it to the Public-office; I went with the officers; Mr. Pullen was sitting in the same parlour where I purchased the money, and he was apprehended on the 16th of October; he was sitting with three or four other men at the table; there was an old stocking lying on the table; where he was leaning; it was opened, and found to contain a quantity of dross or folder, or something of that sort: Lillywhite went out for the officers, and when they came they apprehended him.</p>

            You have seen this man frequently at this house before? - A. I believe three times before; I went with a view to find out the business; when he was examined before Mr. Colquhoun he denied my having seen him before, but I had seen him at that house three times before, getting parcels out of the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you tell the magistrate that you had seen him sell bad money three times before? - A. I told him that I had seen him take money out, and deliver it three times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear now, that upon the prisoner's examination before the magistrate you said you had seen him selling bad money before? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was taken down in writing, was it not? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw him do this? - A. In the parlour; Mr. Ward, the landlord, was in the bar, I think, I am not quite sure; I saw the prisoner there the very night before; I went into the passage, and asked a young man if Mr. Pullen was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean young Mr. Ward? - A. He was standing in the passage, at the place where the serve the gin.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: On the 16th of October, I went with Rogers to a public-house, in Goswell-street, to apprehend the prisoner; we went four or five times before we could find him; we had something to drink; every time we found him there about seven or eight o'clock in the evening; Rogers gave me the signal that that was the man; I saw some lead, or something in a bag upon the table; I went out for the officers, and he was apprehended; I did not see any thing taken from him; there were several persons in the room.</p>

               <p>I am a police officer: On the 16th of October I went with Rogers, to apprehend the prisoner, to the Mitre, in Goswell-street; I searched him, and found nothing but some loose papers; I went the next morning to search his house; I saw his wife there, whom I knew; I found no bad money, but I found a part of a frame for a press, calculated for the business of coining, and nothing else; I have seen a great many of them; it seemed to be very lately split.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp - Q. So that in that state it could not be used? -

               <p>I keep the Mitre, in Goswell-street: I have kept that house thirteen years; I saw Rogers at the office in Worship-street, last Saturday; I never saw him before; I asked who he was, because he asked me many impertinent questions, and they said, it was Rogers, and then I was satisfied he was the man that was the informer.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether he was ever in your house? - A. I cannot say, because so many people come into a public-house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Do you remember the prisoner being apprehended in your house? - A. No; I was not at home.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar; he lived some time ago in Little Turnstile, Holborn, but afterwards moved to Weston's Park, Linculn's-inn-fields: On the 2d of October, I called at Mr. Gilbert's house, in <placeName id="t17951202-26-crimeloc138">Weston's Park</placeName>

I looked at them, and they were of a very bad quality; I said I would only take half a piece, that was 15s. she gave them to me, and I gave her half-a-guinea in gold, and she gave me a half-crown piece in change; I have counted them since and found but 14s. 101/2d.(produces them): I think, if I recollect right, there are 375 pieces, or 357, I don't recollect which, but I think it is 357; there were two women, appeared to be market women, by their dress, purchased a piece, and there was a pockmarked man, dressed like a blacksmith, came in for some; I told him they were of such an indifferent quality, I should like something better; he said, if I would give him an order, he would make them to any size or thickness I liked; he said, he would have a partern for me, if I called again; I called again, and he shewed me a few halfpence of a thicker quality, much better; I asked him the price of them by the piece, and he said he could not sell them for less than nineteen shillings; I offered him eighteen for one paper, and he seemed to be rather affronted; he said, he thought I was such a customer, and I came away; I went afterwards with the officers; Mr. Armstrong, I believe, was one; I went to the door and rung the bell, one of the daughters came to the door, she looked through the hole of the door as before; when she saw it was me she opened the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020037"/>door, and the officer immediately went in; a search was made, but I only saw part of it; I did not see any thing found, and I came away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you been acquainted with this man? - A. It might be two months; Macan gave me a direction to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take him up till fourteen days after this? - A. The magistrate thought the best way was to have them all taken up on one day, for fear of giving an alarm to the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you have never done business with Macan and Dunlop? - A. Never in my life in the bad money way.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never gone about with them when they have been passing bad money? - A. Never; I might have been in their company when they were felling.</p>

               <p>Q. You left your house in a state of perfect security? -

            Perfectly so; the servant shut the door after me.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this office door the inner door? - A. Yes, it is an inner door, and is a part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That door, you say, you sastened yourself? - A. I did, with two bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the other parts of your house were sastened? - A. I have none.</p>

            How soon after you had been in bed were you alarmed? - A. I went to bed about a quarter before one; I was alarmed about half past three; I thought I heard a noise, though not a very loud noise, it was an unusual one; I got out of bed and looked out at the window which looked into the court-yard before the house, which is inclosed with folding doors; it was formerly a shop, which I knocked down for my own convenience to make it more airy; I saw a strong light either in or upon the office of Mr. Mangnall; we had a pair of large reflectors; I was not certain whether it was from that, or what it was.</p>
               <p>What connection had this office with the office that you bolted yourself? - A. It is no more than a large closet; in that office one goes out of the other; they all communicate and form a part of the house; I was not certain whether some of the servants might not be up; I desired Mrs. Welch to pull the bell; I immediately saw four men run down the yard as hard as they could run.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they appear to be running from? - A. I saw them run from the steps of the office door; I called out thieves, and recollected I had a rattle immediately under my hand, and sprung it.</p>
               <p>Court. How was your office situated? - A. The house door and the office door are together from the court-yard; there is only a partition between; they had some difficulty in getting out, the gates being new and swelled with the wet weather; they

             the gates some time before they could get out; I dressed myself as soon as I could, and went down stairs; when I got down stairs, I went to the door that I had bolted with two bolts the night before, and found that some of the people, that had been in the pursuit, were in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the names of those persons? -

            Peter Bricknell, belonging to the Aldersgate-street Coffee-house, and one of the watchmen; when I came down stairs, I unbolted both the bolts; the door that I bolted was the inner door of the office; I found the outer door open; but the inner door was in the same state that I had left it; I unbolted it and opened it; it fell, having been wrenched off the hinges; some person, which I believe was the waiter, caught it upon its falling; on the inside of the door there was a piece of iron that is termed a dog, or otherwise upon the hinges being wrenched off, the door must have been opened; it prevented them from drawing the door off, and prevented it from being pulled away; then I got into the clerk's office, and there I found that one of the desks that was locked was broke open, and all the papers in confusion; I went into Mr. Mangnall's office; we have three offices, which are all connected; the clerk's office is nearest to the street door; it opens upon the steps where I saw the persons running down from; then we go from there to Mr. Rutherfords's office; Mr. Mangnall's, which has a sky-light in it, is to the left; Mr. Rutherford's is at the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Which of these was the one that you bolted? - A. The clerk's office; the door which leads into the clerk's office, from the court-yard, was made by me; there was only one door till, for my own convenience, I turned that window into a door; I went into Mr. Mangnall's office, and found two panes taken out of the sky-light, and the remainder of the glass lying about; I discovered, likewise, the print of the foot of some person upon the inside cell of the window, and upon an armed leather chair that Mr. Mangnall sits at his desk to write in.</p>

            Was the aperture large enough, that was occasioned by the breaking of these two panes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020039"/>to admit any body coming in? - A. Yes; there was plenty of room, for they were lap-lights, not cross framed; but the same as green-house lights; I observed upon the plaister stucco work that goes up to the window where this sky-light was, at the top, something like a man's foot, that had scratched it a great deal; it was only done a few days before; I saw a mark of dirt upon the iron railing in the front of the window; the sky-light is at the top, and the windows of the office meet it; it leads into our court-yard; when I made further observation, I found that the outer door of the clerk's office had been attempted; and part of it broke to pieces; the pieces were laying about; I then went into Aldersgate-street, and in consequence of some enquiry that I made, I went to the watch-house, and there I saw the prisoner Jones, in a very dark coloured coat, and boots.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were making away from the steps, as you have described, did you see them beyond your gateway? - A. No, I did not; I found some watchmen in a passage leading to a warehouse belonging to a man of the name of Wyllie, a paper man; we heard a noise that seemed to proceed from the back of that warehouse, as if somebody was clambering over; in consequence of information from some of the neighbours, we went into Golden Lion-court, which is in Aldersgate-street, nearly opposite our house; the waiter of the coffee-house, and some watchmen, went with me; the court has a very narrow entrance for near twenty yards, so narrow that two people can hardly stand a-breast; it then opens into a wider part of the court, and there are houses on both sides of the way; the back of which houses look into Parliament-court; we were then in pursuit of them; I saw the two prisoners, Smith and White, in their shirts; Smith, the middle man in the dark hair, was without either coat or waistcoat; White had his waistcoat on; they were close to a man of the name of Spires, who lives in the court; somebody said out loud, these are the thieves; upon which, I challenged them, both of them said, they were not thieves; that they were looking for thieves; they had all three of them boots on. The prisoner Smith, the middle man, was in a most excessive heat, the perspiration ran down his face; I never saw a man in so great a heat in my life; White was very hot too, but not so hot as Smith; Smith was remarkably hot, as if he had ran a race of twenty miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they hats on? - A. I cannot be sure; Smith had not, I think; White, I believe, had, but I will not be sure; Smith, I am almost positive, had not; but I think White had; I then took them from the spot to the watch-house; I then went back again home: with respect to the office door, we have a bar, two bolts, and a chain; they were all open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that door in that state before you went in pursuit, or did you observe it when you came back again? - A. Before I went in pursuit of them; I wanted them to give some account of themselves at the watch-house, but they would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house is this? - A. Mine; I hold it of the Wax-chandlers' company; and for my own convenience, as well as the business, I made these offices, meaning, upon the settlement of our accounts, to charge something for it; but that is not yet settled; I never had any acknowledgement yet, and it is possible that I never shall.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay the rent and taxes? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the property? - A. No; I did not miss any thing of my own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Shephard. - Q. I believe I understand your description of the house, but I should like to be sure that I do; there is a court-yard before the whole building? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it there is a door to your dwelling-house? - A. Yes; and there is a door to the office, leading to the same stairs that the hall door does; there is an outer door to the office that comes into the court-yard, so that you can go directly out of the court into the office, without going into the dwelling-house, which communicates with the door that I bolted; I bolted the side of it next the dwelling-house, that nobody in the office could come into the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. That inner door you found bolted in the same state, after the alarm? - A. Yes, with the hinges wrenched off; I found in the yard a dark lanthorn, a crow, and a picklock.</p>
               <p>Q. The inner door had not been opened, whatever attempts might have been made? - A. It had not.</p>

            Neither of your partners reside in the same dwelling-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020040"/>Q. Of course they do not contribute to the payment of the rent of your dwelling-house? - A. I have not ascertained it with them, between the Midsummer and Michaelmas quarter; we found it convenient to move our office into our house; it was before carried on in Mr. Rutherford's house; we found it more convenient for business to remove it to our house; I told Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Mangnall, I should wish the business to go on there; and with respect to what the business was, to pay me for the use of the offices, we would settle that at some other time; the lease cost me above two thousand pounds; I proposed that they should pay me the rent and taxes, and in our books I debited to the partnership the rent and taxes; I pay for the whole house; I consider the dwelling-house as an equivalent to the purchase of the lease.</p>

               <p>Q. So that in fact the result of the whole enquiry comes to this, that for the use of these offices and carrying on the business, they are to contribute something towards the rent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you must have had a very transient view of the persons you saw running away? -

            Certainly.</p>

            After you had seen the four parties go from the steps, you dressed yourself and went to the watch-house? - A. Yes: the watch-house is about thirteen or fourteen doors, or rather better, from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Although the partners have not ratified the terms you mentioned, in point of fact, are not these the terms upon which you carry on your business? - A. I have entered one of the taxes, which I paid the other day, and no objection has been made.</p>
               <p>Court. - Q. Whether your partners saw them entered in the books before this robbery? - A. No; since.</p>
               <p>Court. - Q. Had you come to any specific agreement? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. - Q. Can you recollect whether it was before or after that robbery that you mentioned this to Mr. Rutherford? - A. I had some conversation with Mr. Rutherford, and he rather conveyed the idea that he did not agree to it; and I firmly believe now, that they will not agree to the proposal that I made.</p>
               <p>Q. You considered, and they considered, that something was to be paid? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The objection that they made was so the quantum that they were to pay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time of this robbery your partners were liable for part of the rent and taxes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time of your seeing the four persons go from the courtyard and seeing Jones in the watch-house? - A. Seven or eight minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you went in search of other persons; what time was it after that that you saw the prisoner Smith? - A. It might be about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you know would carry the time of your seeing him then to from between twenty-five and thirty minutes? - A. I cannot tell to a few minutes.</p>

               <p>I am in the service of the East India Company: I was a supernumerary watchman in Aldersgate ward; on the night of the 23d of October last, in the discharge of the duty of a watchman, about half past three in the morning, I was coming up Aldersgate-street, I heard a cry of watch; I stood still, considering where the voice came from; I thought it came further up the street from where I was; but almost instantaneously I heard the screech of a rattle; I thought the noise of the rattle came from the same place that I heard the voice from; I was proceeding up the street, but hearing a very great noise at Mr. Welch's gate, I made a stand, and in the space of one minute out rushed three or four men, I cannot be positive which, from within the gates; as they came out I made a seizure of one of the persons; but, owing to the velocity with which he came out, I could not keep any hold.</p>

That is the man, Jones; I caught hold of him somewhere about his breast, but could not keep him; they made their retreat across the street; they ran up a court nearly opposite to the gate; I followed after them; I saw him afterwards in the watch-house, and to the best of my knowledge he was nearly the same stature, that is all I can say about it; one of the watchmen got into the court before me, and got hold of the man; I attempted to seize him, and when I came up to him, the watchman made use of an oath, and told him, if he stirred, he would cut him down, nothing more transpired, but the other watchman took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. - Q. Did you see Jones in the court? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your going up to the prosecutor's gate three men pushed by you with the utmost velocity? - A. Yes; I could not keep any hold, by the velocity with which they rushed out.</p>

            Were there two or three? - A. I cannot say, they were so altogether; I took him to be about the middle; I believe him to be about the second, I cannot say; I had the lanthorn in this left hand, that was partly a hindrance; I snatched hold of him with the lanthorn in my hand; I never saw him before.</p>

Yes; they went out with their coats off; they chucked them on the ground in my room; one had a brown coat on, and the other a blue one; I cannot say whether they had boots on or not; the waiter said, don't let these men go, they are the thieves; Mr. Welch said there was another, and they laid hold of me, but the watchman said, no, I was an inhabitant of the place; I did not particularly observe them till they got to the watch-house; I saw my lodger pick up a hat in the court, after they were gone; I saw the prisoners at the watch-house; they are the same persons I saw in my house; one had a waistcoat on, the other had none; one of them asked for a hat, I don't know which; I said it was given to the watchmen, and they all had boots on.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, the cry of thieves was from the watchmen; there were several persons in the court; he supposed they would have taken him, if the watchman had not said he was an inhabitant.</p>

            What is the value of it? - A. I gave four guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. My Lord, it is not for the fake of occupying the time of the court, to have an opportunity of making a speech to the jury, or to combat any one single fact that I now rise, but to address you on a legal point as it arises on a part of the evidence. The indictment, in the first count, charges the prisoners with breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch; and in the second count, laying it to be the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch and partners: one of these propositions must be made out, either that it is the dwelling house of Mr. Welch, or of the partners. Mr. Welch describes his house thus: he had the whole house; he has made a part of it into offices; there is an inner door which communicates with the offices, which he found unbolted and the hinges broke; but as far as relates to that door there was no burglary committed; the part he inhabits was not broke, but only the offices, which I submit are no part of the dwelling-house either of Mr. Welch, or of Mr. Welch and the partners. If I take an outhouse or shop to my separate and distinct occupation, and the rest of the house is occupied by others, my shop is not a part of that dwelling-house; it can only be a dwelling-house as there is an unity of occupation, the dwelling-house of one person; the dwelling-house here is of one person; the offices belong to others; and if the dwelling house is that of one person and the adjoining part that of another, it will become a question, whether the persons occupying the adjoining part have any right in the occupation of the house at all? Mr. Welch does not left out parts of these offices to Messrs. Rutherford and Mangnall, but takes them in as joint temant of the offices, and there by they become so much joint possessors, that neither could bring an action against the other. The landlord of a house, who letts out a room to an individual, is occupier of the whole, and not a tenant in common. Now here Mr. Welch takes these partners into the offices, and proposes that they shall contribute something to the payment of the rent; this proposal has never been executed, either by writing or agreement, but they are let into possession, and therefore he has done that which, in point of law, would amount to an agreement; a proposal is made on one side and assented to on the other; the only thing not agreed to is the quantum that shall be paid; that is an agreement on which an action would lie. If a man offers me a house at a certain sum, I say, no, I will not give that sum; but, says he, take the house, and at Midsummer we will settle the sum; certainly that is a contract to become a tenant, an acquiescence to pay something, but not an adjustment of the sum; that makes no difference in point of law, the contract is the same. Then, if it be so, the question is, whether a man possessing a dwelling-house, and having let in two partners as joint tenants, can bring an action against the the others for entering into these officers, if he had chose to have fastened the door against them. He cannot if they are joint tenants; and this office, which is only and adjunct to the other part, cannot be the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch.</p>

               <p>My learned friends will say then, it is the dwelling-house of all three: that I deny, because it can only be a dwelling-house, as it is an adjunct to a dwelling-house; but to make it the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch as an adjunct it must be in the same occupation as the dwelling-house; and if this office were in the possession of other persons, it could not be their dwelling-house; if this dwelling-house be not the dwelling-house of Messrs. Welch, Rutherford, and Mangnall, neither can the offices be the dwelling-house of Messrs. Welch, Rutherford and Mangnall. Suppose there were a brew-house and a dwelling-house upon the same premisses, or a dwelling-house and a mill, it the mill were in the occupation of the man that had the dwelling-house, it would be a part of the dwelling-house; but if the mill were in the occupation of three partners, it would not be a part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020046"/>The question then is, whether, when an outhouse is in the occupation of one person, and the dwelling-house in the occupation of another, you can state the outhouse as a dwelling-house? Does not Mr. Welch let these persons in as joint tenants? if he does, it is not Mr. Welch's dwelling-house; the office bears the character of dwelling-house, merely from its being a part of the dwelling-house; is then that part of the dwelling-house the dwelling-house of all three? Certainly not, because they have no part of that dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys and Mr. Knapp, on the part of the prosecution, contended, that the office was a constituent part of the house; that it was not parted off from the house; that Mr. Welch has the lease to himself alone, and pays the rent and taxes himself; that no contract had taken place; that a proposal had been made, merely that they should pay something, not for occupation, but for coming into Mr. Welch's house to do their business; and that if Mr. Welch had put a turn-up bedstead into the office for his servant to sleep in, it could not have been contended that it was not a part of the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, on the part of the prisoners, replied to the arguments of Mr. Knowlys and Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Court. - This case has been argued with great ingenuity, by Mr. Shepherd, on the part of the prisoners, but I cannot agree, that there is any separation in these premisses. The question is, what constitutes a dwelling-house. Now what is the case with this house as proved? Who takes the house? Mr. Welch; he takes the lease and occupies the whole. Has he divested himself of the occupation of any part of the house? But, because he has his business carried on in this house, it is contended, that that is a separation of the premisses; I cannot agree in that; I consider it as not being out of his occupation; he resides there himself and his servants.</p>
               <p>The next question is, whether the partners have any share in the house? do they contribute to the rent? do they contribute to the taxes, or to the servants? Now let us see whether the servants of the partnership are confined to this office; so far from it, that one of the clerks sleeps in the house of Mr. Welch. That does away the separation: I am of opinion it is to be considered as the dwelling-house of Mr. Welch, because neither of the partners are bound to pay rent nor taxes; and to consider them as occupiers of this house, it is necessary not only that they should have a servant sleep in the house, but that they should contribute to the rent and taxes; they do not pay rent and taxes, and therefore it is in the sole occupation of Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>If it were a fact that they are to contribute to the rent and taxes, that would let them in, and the second count would apply, for then it would be considered as the dwelling-house of the three partners; but, I think, upon this evidence, it is not made out to be the house of the partners, but the house of Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones's Defence. - I was passing by this street, on the morning that Mr. Welch says his house was broke open; I was going from Cheapside to the Jolly Carpenters in Old-street-road, to meet my brother, who is a news-carrier; I heard an alarm of fire; I asked the watchman where it was; he said he did not know; I saw a number of persons going up this court, crying fire; I went up, and the watchmen surrounded me; one laid hold of my hand, and another threatened to knock me down; I said I should make no resistance, but go with them; I then asked them what was the matter, and they did not know; I heard afterwards, that a house had been broke open; I am innocent of it; I was only passing at the time of the alarm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner White. - My Lord, I understood the trial was to be put off till to-morrow, and have sent home the witnesses to my character; I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. - I have not any thing to say; I am perfectly innocent; I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

Yes; they called to me to come and take him out, and I told them I was afraid they would serve me the same sance; I went down upon the craft afterwards, and saw the prisoner Basset; when I had hold of the mate's arm, and I spoke to him, and told him it was certainly him that had done it, he made no answer that I heard; but we were all in confusion getting the corpse away.

               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, it was an old coat, the collar saded; that it had been mended, and new buttons put on it; that it was made for him two years ago, and he knew it by those marks; that he employed the prisoner, and had a good opinion of him; that he had had the great coat in his possession ever since.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of October I was employed by Mr. Harlow to bring a load into the Old Bailey, from his warehouse; the prisoner delivered it to me; it was a glass door, a nest of drawers, and sundry articles; while I was packing up my load I saw him come out of the warehouse with a blue great coat under his arm; on the Tuesday following I heard that Mr. Harlow could not find his great coat, and gave him some information respecting it.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, he did not mention it till the Tuesday following, because he did not know what he was going to do with it; and he did not know it was missing till that time.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner: Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on Tuesday morning, the prisoner asked me to let him have a great coat in my apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before Mr. Harlow came and asked you if you had seen the prisoner? - A. About a quarter of an hour; I have two rooms; the inner room has a bed in it; he went and put it under the side of the bed, on the floor; he said nothing, but went away immediately.</p>
               <p>On her cross-examination, she said, it was plain enough for any body to see it if they went into the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been entrusted with many, many pounds, by that gentleman; he never found me deficient in his life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>In consequence of an information from the counting-house of Messrs. Sutton and Sharpe, I went to Mr. Stevenson's, the Apollo, Tottenham-court-road, and he shewed me a cask of beer in the cellar; the cask appeared to be Mr. Sharpe's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any quantity of beer? - A. Not that I know of; I know nothing but that the cask appeared to belong to Messrs. Sutton and Sharpe.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, two years ago the partners were Cherrington and Sharpe, but that the mark was not the same now as in his time; that Mr. Sharpe had served the Apollo with beer two or three years; that they might have served him with beer in casks marked as this was: he was asked if ullages were not considered as the perquisite of the draymen? he said, no such perquisite was allowed at their house; that ullages are what is left at the bottom of casks.</p>

               <p>I keep the Apollo, Tottenham-court-road: About three months ago the prisoners brought a cask of ale to my house, and asked if I could do any thing with it, in regard to selling it; I asked them what was the price of it, they told me I should have it for 12s. for if they took it home they should have but a trifle for it; they said, they had made it up from gentlemens houses, out of different casks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If it had not been ullages it would have been worth much more? - A. It would have been worth 45s.</p>

               <p>I lost a hand saw, a plane, a square, and a cloth jacket, from a building near the Foundling-hospital that is uninhabited: On the 23d of October I went home to dinner, between twelve and one o'clock; when I returned I missed the things; I was at work in the building in the course of a week after; I went to several pawnbrokers to endeavour to find my tools; at last I went to one in Leather-lane, and found the plane and square.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the pawnbroker's name? - A. Notley. When the man was searched, the saw was mentioned in a duplicate found upon him; it was pawned at Clerkenwell-green; the justice sent for the pawnbroker, and the saw was produced at the office in Hatton-garden. The prisoner owned to me, that he had sold the jacket to a Jew, on Clerkenwell-green. The magistrate committed him to Clerkenwell-bridewell.</p>

               <p>I am porter to Messrs. Smith and Campbell, grocers, in Swithins'-lane: I heard the cry of stop thief; I was coming to the door as the prisoner passed it; there was a man stopped him before I came to him; his name is Walker; I overtook him about one hundred and fifty yards from the warehouse door, in Swithins'-lane; he said he was not the man that robbed the porter; he was going on an errand for his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him the porter had been robbed? - A. Yes; he did not say who his master was; I told him that, as an honest man, he would have no objection to come down to the porter, to see whether he was the man or not; he said he was not the man, and wished to go about his business; I told him he should not, and Walker and I brought him to the porter; the porter said, he was the man with the goods upon his back; we then took him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Upon his cross-examination, he said, there was nobody in the lane when he was running; that he lives opposite Salters' hall-court; that when they brought him to the porter, he said, he was the man.</p>

            , the constable, George Taverner, and a Mr. Munday, who is not here; he denied it; we told him of a hamper, which we supposed contained wine; he said it did not contain wine, but that it contained china; I told him he had been seen to take a hamper across Tower-hill: we then went to his lodgings, and upon going into the room, he took this bottle of port from under his bed, and he accounted for it in this way-that it was the remaining bottle of three bottles of wine that he had bought in Bond-street, and it was the only wine he had ever had since he came to London: we then desired him to open his trunk, and on opening his trunk, there were three bottles of rum, and a number of letters, and other papers; and among those papers I found a lift of the wine which the hamper contained.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether that is the paper? - A. Yes, it is; and I found the wharfinger's receipt for a hamper at Glasgow wharf, and a counter part of the letter dated the 25th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the thing you say you found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And is this the hand-writing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I went to Hawley's wharf; he said it was a contrivance to take away his character: he was examined before the Lord-Mayor, and the examination taken in writing.(The hamper was produced in Court).</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the direction, and tell us if you know the hand-writing of that direction? - A. It is the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You seem extremely well acquainted with the prisoner's hand-writing; how often have you seen him write? - A. There is a book in which he entered every thing daily.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you have such a knowledge of his hand-writing as to swear to it positively? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any money delivered to you to take care of for him? - A. Yes; 81. 3s. 6d. his attorney came to me upon his second examination, and asked me for it, and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it delivered up to him by your own voluntary movement, or by the direction of the magistrate? - A. The magistrate did not give any such direction; he said it would be better to give it up, which I did.</p>

               <p>I am the brother of the prosecutor: I went to the prisoner's lodgings with Mr. Harrison, the clerk; and I am not certain whether I went with George or not; but I went to the constable, and desired him to come before I did any thing; and as I thought I might do something improper without him, we did nothing till he came: we found a bottle of red wine under the bed; we searched all over the room after we had found the bottle of wine;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020054"/>I said I thought it was high time we called the prisoner: I told him I had very strong suspicions he had robbed the cellar; and asked him for the key of his box, which he gave me, and the constable opened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to the prisoner before you took him to his lodgings? - A. Yes; I taxed him with having had a hamper in his possession; he said it only contained china; he said three bottles of wine was all the wine he had had since he had been in England; and that he had bought them of somebody, I think, in New Bond-street; and we discovered, I think, four bottles of rum, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in his box? - A. Yes; a great many papers; and, among the rest, one respecting a hamper.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these papers; tell us if you know the hand-writing; and tell us where you found them, if you found them at all? - A. I think this different from his common writing; it seems to be more of a running-hand than his; but this I can swear to be his writing; I believe this to be taken out of his box; but as they were not opened till after I came home, I cannot say; I sent the porter to the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and see if that is the direction you talk of about the hamper? - A. Yes, that is the same direction.</p>

               <p>Pagett. I was present at the conversation between the last witness and Mr. Harrison; and more that that, he said, they had transported one porter, and hanged another, and they would hang him; I thought it was all a piece of spite and malice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know that this is all malice against me, and I am innocent: this man in particular, the porter, told me, I had a right to sell all the beer bottles in the vaults; he wanted me to sell them and give Mr. Allnutt half the money; there was scarce a day but they were trying to bring me into a scrape; I told Mr. Harrison so, and he cannot deny that I told him of these circumstances.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of November I went along with Adshead, the other headborough, to Mrs. Tracey's, in Saltpetre-bank.</p>

            What condition was he in? - A. His face and the frill of his shirt was dyed in blood; I asked him, who we were to take charge of; he pointed to the prisoners; I told them they must go along with us; Mrs. Tracey said, she would not go out of her own house; she said, I might take her word till the morning; I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. You know her? - A. I live close by her</p>
               <p>Q. What is she? - A. I believe it is a disorderly house that she keeps, and we took her before a justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ann Tracey's defence. - I was not in my house from two o'clock till within about half an hour of eight; I had been on board a tender; as I was coming home, a neighbour called me into the White Swan; somebody came in, and said, Mrs. Tracey, there is such a fight at your house, I cannot think what is the matter; I immediately went out, the man had a fire-shovel in his hand, and he knocked me down; that did not satisf him, but he caught me by the hair, put his foot upon my breast, and off went my cap, and tore my hair; my child said, you are a bad man, don't tear my poor mammy so; upon that, the house filled, and they got quarrelling; I asked them if they could get the sense of it; I asked the prosecutor, what was the matter; and if I could make peace, I was willing to do it; with that he knocked me down again; and what passed afterwards I don't know; I told him I had kept the house many years, and never had a row in it before; Coates took me up, beat me severely all the way to the watch-house; he tore me to pieces, and threw me into a dark dungeon, and would not let me have any thing to eat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown's defence. - Mrs. Tracey was not in the house when he came in; I was sitting in doors by the fire side, and he came in and began to pull me about in a scandalous manner; he struck me, and I struck him again; I did not see his cups and faucers; his apron and tinder-box he put upon the table by him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor met me, and said he knew me at Liverpool; I came from Ireland, and he named several people that I knew very well at Liverpool; he asked me where I lodged, and he walked home with me, and the kitchen being dirty I asked the woman in the house for a candle, and took him up stairs; he sat down on the bed, and talked about people at Liverpool; and he wanted to behave in a very indelicate manner; he sent the poor woman for a pot of beer, and put a guinea upon the table to relieve her, being distressed; and while she was gone for the beer he used me very ill, and tore my cloaths to pieces, till I was almost naked; and I took up the guinea and said, that was the least he could give me for tearing my cloaths to pieces; and he said if I did not go to bed with him he would cut my head off.</p>

No; I laid hold of him by the collar, and charged him with robbing the stables; he said, the man that had run away (for there were two of them) had desired him to hold the candle while he tied up some things; I called the watchman, and he threw away the candle; I gave the watchman charge of him, and went into the stable, where I found the box-coat and the other things tied up in a bundle, in the first stall of the stable; as we were going to the watch-house, somebody said, it was an Old Bailey job; no, says the prisoner, I know better than that, for there is no locks broke: I locked the door when I went out, and I found it open when I came back; I don't know whether it was opened with a picklock, or what, for the locks were not broke.</p>

I went down in a hurry, and left the key upon the chest in a mistake; I forgot myself; I went down stairs, and did not recollect the key till a man came in for change for another guinea, about an hour, or an hour and a half after; I felt in my pocket for the key, which I always carried on the right side of my breeches; I immediately recollected I had left the key upon the chest; the room door was locked, I opened it, and as soon as I opened it there lay the key, at the top of the chest, as I had left it; I opened the chest, and took 20s. more out, I locked the door of the chest, and the door of the room; I had no thoughts of the girl taking any of the money; I had no notion she had robbed me; I was rather busy; I did not go up stairs till we went to bed; I happened to be unwell; next morning I made my wife get up before me; when the brewers came, early in the morning, they waked me; I recollected I had put up thirty guineas, having to pay my brewer; I opened the chest, and counted my money immediately; the first thing I did was to count the gold, and I threw it down upon the table, and there was only twenty guineas in it instead of thirty; I opened a little bag that had thirty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020062"/>shillings in silver in it, I missed five; I then counted the halfpence, ten pound, made up in 5s. papers; I missed two papers; I then came down stairs, and enquired for the girl; she had absconded; she had been away between two and three hours; I went in search of her; I enquired, and found out where she was; I found her over the way at a neighbour's house, up stairs, among some of her old acquaintances; I came and told my wife she was there, and we fetched her over to our house; we took her into a room where the money was taken from, and I sent for a neighbour that keeps a chandler's shop, and told him of what had happened; he questioned the girl, I was by at the time; she denied at first, but I locked the door and left him with her, and sent for Treadway, the constable; she told him she took the money out of the chest; she said, she took the money to a woman in St. Giles's; the constable then took her, and I went with them.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did she say how much money there was? - A. Yes; she said she took 5s. of silver, she mentioned the halfpence, and as for the gold, she said she took a piece of paper off the table, and put it on the floor, and took out of a purse some guineas; she did not know how many; she put the guineas into a piece of paper, lapped it up, and gave it to a woman in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take the prisoner with you to this woman in St. Giles's? - A. Yes; when we came to the place where she said the women lived, we could not find the woman; we took her then to Bow-street; and when she came there, she said she had robbed me of my money; On the Sunday evening she was sent out for pots, and came home very much in liquor, and my wife was obliged to put her to bed.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Q. Did she ever return you any part of the money? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any body been in the room between the time you left it and the time she brought you the key? - A. Nobody.</p>

No; but it is a back way; it was the nighest way for me; I sent for some rum, across the way, to the public-house, and ordered them to bring change for half-a-guinea; when they brought it, I would not pay for it, and the landlady took it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to refuse to pay for it? - A. I was doubtful of getting my change again; the prisoner Hutton then knocked me down into the entry; I was shoved right back wards against the stair-case, and Mary Ash took my watch from me; before I could get up, I felt my watch go from me; I immediately holloa'd out, watch, and they run off; we pursued them, and caught them in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, there is a warehouse in Hart-street, opposite Seething-lane, and another in Tower-street, that takes in Spanish wool; that they lock up the warehouse as soon as it is dark, except they are taking in goods; that it was locked up that evening about six o'clock; that he was there that evening about five or six o'clock, that he supposed the gate was shut that evening about half after five, or a quarter before six o'clock; that if a person had carried out a large parcel of wool at that time, he must have been observed; but that there are other ways of getting it out, through the windows that look into the street.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, in the city; I know the prisoner; On last Thursday evening, the 28th, between five and six o'clock, I was in Crutched-friars; I saw the prisoner come out of Seething-lane, with a pack at his back; he was between a run and a walk; he went across the road into London-street, and up the steps into another London-street; I suspected by his running he had got something he had not come lawfully by; Charles Phillips and I followed him: In London-street I observed another man going close to him; they turned down Fenchurch-street, towards Whitechapel; at the corner of Jewry-street, Aldgate, the prisoner pitched the bundle on the post, the other man then came close up to him; I crossed them, and went across Jewry-street, that turns down to Crutched-friars; again the prisoner took up the bundle, and went down Jewry-street, towards Tower-hill; about half way down the man that was with him went up to him, and said something, what I could not hear; then they immediately crossed Jewry-street into George-street, that leads into the Minories; I was on the right-hand side of George-street, and the prisoner on the left; the man who was with him came on the right-hand side; I crossed him, and looked him full in the face; he then went off, and we saw no more of him; the prisoner then went down the Minories, and crossed into Swan-street, which leads into Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields, about half way down, there is a dyer's there; the prisoner slung the bundle down, and we came up to him, and asked him what he had there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he knew that you were following, before he threw the bundle down? - A. I cannot say; he said he had got a bundle that a person gave him at the corner of London-street, and he was to have 28d. for carrying it; he did not say where he was to carry it to; I asked him what the bundle contained, he said he could not tell; I took him into custody; I then took a piece out, and said it was cotton.</p>

            Then if it had been given him at London-street, you must have seen it? - A. Yes; he had it before he came to London-street; he said he was to carry it to Church-lane; that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020070"/>man that gave him the bundle was to meet him there, and give him 1s. 6d. and begged I would go there with him; we went with him to Church-lane; he pitched the bundle, and said, he was to wait till the person came for it; we waited about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my knowledge, and nobody came.</p>

            Whereabout was the weight of this load? - A. It appeared to be above fifty pounds weight; the way he went from Seething-lane to Church-street is, I suppose, half a mile about.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said, he did not know that the other man was in company with the prisoner, till he saw him speak to him at Jewry-street; that he first saw the prisoner in Seething-lane, close upon London-street; that there were many persons passing when he pitched the bundle in Aldgate-street; that he did not know the man that was with the prisoner; that he was a constable, and had been sworn in about a month; that he did belong to the Police-office, but had left it; that the reason of his leaving it was, he had taken half-a-guinea of a black, who had been ill-used on board of ship; and that he had been ordered before the magistrate, and refused to go; that the prisoner went very readily with him when he took him.</p>

               <p>Pearson. - It is impossible to swear to wool; there is no mark, and it is impossible to speak to the matting in which it is packed; as to the wool, we never pack found wool in that way, only damaged wool.</p>
               <p>Jury. - That is not damaged wool? - A. No; it is found wool, it is worth about 3s. 6d. a pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. - I had taken that of a man, to carry it for him to the corner of Church-lane; he followed me, and came up to me at Jewry-street, and said, take that down to Church-lane, and I will come to you; I went that round with my employer; I have but 14s. a week, and often porter after I have done work.</p>

No; it was between three and four in the afternoon; on his going into the cellar, I went and told Wade, the other witness, as I was ordered to do; I returned to the cellar, and Wade followed me; I then saw a man, with a basket on his shoulder, come out of the cellar that Taylor had gone into.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the bladder? - A. According to the smell of it, it was rum; it smelt very strong; Wade took him to the Compter: I left them at St. Mary-Axe, because I wanted to go back to my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there was but one bladder? - A. I am not certain; I did but just look into the basket.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, what conversation had you with Mr. Knapp's clerk, about this prosecution? - A. When I came to the house, he said, come in and sit down; I had no conversation with him after I came in and sat down; I don't think a word passed after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent you to watch the prosecutor's cellar? - A. My father; he told me, if I saw any body go into the cellar, to tell Mr. Wade.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you did not see that man go in? - A. No; nor did I see Taylor come out; as soon as Taylor went into the cellar, I went to tell Wade.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it contain the same things it contained before? - A. Yes; two bladders of rum. I attended the magistrates on the Monday; as I was taking Webb to the Compter, he said, he was taken in for the take of a few shillings; Taylor did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You saw Webb come out of the cellar? - A. Yes; I did not see him go in.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you cannot tell in what manner he went in, nor what he took into the cellar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. For ought you know he took that into the cellar, and brought it out again? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. This basket lay some time at the public-house? - Yes; I suppose half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not opened these bladders? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the contents of them might have been changed, for any thing you know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was out of your possession half an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Taylor said nothing to you when you took him up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had they the appearance of being the same bladders that were in the basket before? - A. I will swear it; I set a mark upon them; one of the bladders had burst, and run out a great quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what was contained in the bladders at all? - A. Yes; by the leaking of them, and putting my finger to it, and tasting it; and I tasted what laid upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did it taste like? - A. Very nice rum, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You were set to watch upon this cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cellar in a state of security? - A. It was when I first went round; there are two ways, and it was fastened secure.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it afterwards? - A. I cannot say.</p>

            , and Wilham Chatfield.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not expect you will be able to swear to the rum, but have you any samples of rum here? - A. Yes; I have a sample taken out of the bladder that was burst; I saw the vat made up, on Thursday last, myself to a particular strength; I took it out of the bladder that burst; it was about half gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same sort of rum? - A. Exactly; I have tried it with the instrument; it is usual to let it alone for a week, that it may be perfectly fine; it is a store vat, and we never draw out of that, but for the wholesale trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you use such bladders as these in the basket, now produced, in your trade? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Taylor your servant at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given any orders to him to go, between the 26th and 28th of November, to this wholesale cellar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any drawn from these vats to your knowledge? - A. No; nor by my orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined the vats since? - A. I have examined the dip; there is a decrease of about sixteen gallons; in our dip we allow a little for the slow, which we reckon about two gallons; so that there is a decrease, I am positive, of fourteen gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you use such baskets as this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is three o'clock a usual time for your servants to go to this store cellar? - A. If they have orders so to do, but not else.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to take candles into this cellar, or go without candles? - A. It is not safe to work without candles; our cooper always takes candles, to see if the cocks are safe; for, upon hearing this. I was alarmed, and immediately went with a candle to see if all was safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. When they go with candles into the warehouse, and a number of men are at work, the superintendant takes candles to see that they do their work? - A. They go to the counting-house and take candles.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants do you occupy in your business? - A. At that time only two,

               <p>Q. Has it not been usual for Lloyd to give directions to the other man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call him your cellar-man? - A. No; we had a cooper who had the superintendance of them; he was ill a fortnight, and I superintended myself; Lloyd took upon himself to order the other servants, and I took him to task for it; Taylor had complained to me that he made him work too much in drudgery of a morning; I told them to do it equally alike.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did Lloyd leave your service? - A. I received a note from him, telling me, that he should be very sorry to appear against his fellow servant; when the hearing was over, if I pleased, he would come to work again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he abscond from your service? - A. He went away on Saturday night, when he was paid, and I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. The same night these men were apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no person at all connected with you in business, but those you have mentioned? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. None who derive any benesit from your business? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been fortunate enough to obtain Lloyd? - A. No; I had a warrant today from the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find fault with Lloyd for giving orders about conducting your business or trade? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020074"/>Court. Q. What is the size of this cellar? - A. I suppose about twenty or twenty-five feet square; there is a cellar beyond it much larger.</p>
               <p>Q. Could Taylor get to the cellar beyond it? - A. Yes; there was a door way and no doors; nothing was kept in it but empty casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether your cellars are so situated, that your man being busy in one, another man could not go down into the other, and take something without his knowledge? - A. If he did not see him, he must hear him; if he has any ears, for there is a large open door way without doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it impossible for a man to go into the other cellar without his knowledge? - A. He could not draw the rum out of that vat, being full, and the cock large, without being heard the length of this court.</p>
               <p>Webb's defence. I was hired as a porter to carry that basket out of the cellar; I had nothing to do with filling it, or any thing else.(Taylor left his defence to his counsel, who called Mr. Chatfield,

No, I was making liquor in the bar; I saw them in the tap-room; they called for a pot of beer; the box was standing before the prisoner, and when I went in he put it under the table, and sat down by the side of it, as if it was to be hid; then there came in a third man and called for a glass of gin; he sat down in the tap-room by himself, in another box; then Mr. Peppercorn came in, and said, he suspected they had got some stolen property; that he had got a constable, and should take charge of them when they came out; the constable came in; the man that came with the prisoner was gone to fetch a coach; the third man came up and drank with the prisoner; then the second man came in and told the prisoner he had done as he desired him; he said, very well, then we will go; he got up and paid me for the porter, and the constable immediately took charge of the box and the prisoner, and the man that came in third, but he was discharged at Guildhall; the man that went for the coach said, he was going to the waggon-office, in Newgate-street, with it, and that he brought it from the Six-Cann's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020077"/>in Holborn; the constable said, that is enough, if you came from that house, for I know it to be a bad house, and I am convinced it is stolen, and he took him into custody; when the coach came we discharged it.</p>
               <p>- WETHERALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable: On Wednesday the 11th of November, in consequence of an information I received from Mr. Peppercorn, I went to the Blue-posts; after standing at the door sometime, I went and had a pint of beer; while I was drinking it the prisoner got up to go away, and dragged this box out from under the table; I immediately told him I did not think it was honestly come by, and I should know the particulars before I let it go there; I then took the prisoner and a man who had been drinking with him, who was in another box, but not being in company with him, he was discharged; the other man came in while I was there, but he did not interfere in any thing; and I could not cleverly d in him; I have had the box in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into this public-house and called for some beer; a man asked me to take care of this box; I staid there till I could not stay any longer, and I thought I would give it into the care of the landlord; I took it from under the table to give it to him, and the constable took me, before I had taken it two yards from under the table.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker, in Whitechapel; I was recommended to the prisoner to buy a horse, by Bowtell, of whom I had purchased a small poney; I bought this gelding of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the gelding that was stole? - A. I should imagine it to be so; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? - A. Sometime the beginning of June, I think; I did not make a minute of the time; it was delivered to me at a public-house, at the entrance of Hackney; I think it was the Rose-and-Crown, I am not positive; I gave the prisoner ten guineas and my poney, which cost me five, for it, he warranted the horse found; if I hah found it found I was to have given him a new pair of boots; but finding it not found, he never called for them; I kept him near six months; I generally keep one in the summer, and generally sell it in the fall; I sold this horse to Mr. Chamberlayne, about five weeks ago, for 9l. 3s.6d.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the gelding you delivered to Mr. Kirby was the same you bought of Mr. Tweed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no other geldings in your stable? - A. Yes, a black one; but this was a brown one.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BOWTELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a brazier and tinman: I was with the prisoner when he took this gelding out of the field; the magistrate at Bow-street admitted me as an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tweed.) You cannot tell when it was you bought this? - A. No; I took no particular notice of the time; I thought I had been dealing with a very fair man; as nigh as I can tell, I have had it in my own use nigh upon six months.</p>
               <p>Bowtell. I went down to Birmingham with the prisoner, with three horses; I have been there a great many times with the prisoner, with a great many horses that he has stole; in coming back, we called at Bicester, in Oxfordshire; we staid at the Rose-and-Crown, till about nine o'clock in the evening, on the 31st of May; and, as we were coming towards London, at a place called Aylesbury, the prisoner saw this gelding in a field on the left-hand side; there was another horse with it; he got off the horse he was riding, and got over the gate and looked at this horse; he came back again, and said, that will do very well, we will have that: he then mounted his horse again, and rode on till we came to an old barn, the same side the way as this field; we went into that barn, and put our horses into it, and went to sleep till about twelve o'clock; then we took a halter off the horses in the barn, and went back to the field where the gelding was; we lifted the gate off the hinges, and I held it while he fetched the horse out of the field; we left the gate off, we could not get it on again; we brought the gelding with us to the barn, and then we took the saddle and bridle off of one of our horses, and put on this gelding; we brought them all three to London; we quarrelled about who should ride the gelding; I did not like to ride it for fear of being thrown off; he said, I should ride it, and I did ride it part of the way; we took it to the Horse-and-Groom, Hackney-road; it staid there for two days, till the prisoner at the bar sold it to Mr. Tweed; I was present; Mr. Tweed gave me half-a-crown for riding it, and the prisoner gave me half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the purchaser again, if you were to see him? - A. Yes; he is a shoemaker, in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after the robbery was it that you sold it to the shoemaker? - A. As near as I can guess, on the Friday, about twelve o'clock; that we took it on Monday the 1st of June, between twelve and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a horse stealer? - A. I believe it is as much as between four and five years; I was servant to him.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were in the secret that they were stolen? - A. Yes; I used to go with him; sometimes he would give me two guineas and a half for taking a horse one hundred miles; and sometimes five guineas, but never more, if he sold it for fifteen; he dealt with a man in the country, a dealer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never steal any on your own account? - A. No; the man that dealt with him would not deal with me; there are a great many more horses in town now; that he has brought up here.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020080"/>Q. How came you to come forward as a witness; were you taken up for stealing this horse? - A. No; for stealing two cart-horses that we took from a field near Worcester; he came from that part of the country; he sold them at Edgeware; and the man agreed to pay for it on Wednesday morning; he sold one, and I sold the other to a farmer; the prisoner and I were to meet the two men, on the Monday, at Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to know whether he has any witness that ever saw me and him together when he stole any horse? - A. He and I have stole some scores; I have got a list of them, my Lord; here it is (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tweed.) Look at the last witness. - A. He is the man I bought the poney of; he recommended me to the prisoner; he came to buy a pair of boot-tops of me, and seeing my saddle hanging up, he asked me if I wanted to buy a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him half-a-crown when you bought this horse? - A. Yes? for recommending me to the prisoner; the back of him was in a shocking condition; he took the saddle off my poney, and put it upon his back, to deceive me, or else I should not have bought it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the Horse-and-Groom, at Hackney, that you went to? - A. No; the Rose-and-Crown; but the horse was not there; I waited near half an hour, while the horse was fetched; they might get it from the Horse-and-Groom, for any thing I know; I understood it was the prisoner's house; I bought it of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bowtell.) Is that the person who bought the horse? - A. Yes.</p>

            . is a most beneficial, salutary, and necessary statute; that it is to prevent men going armed with fire-arms, in disguise, in defiance of the laws; and to enable all persons wounded by such offenders, or executors of persons wounded by such offenders, to recover a recompence for that injury which they have received, and for that breach of the law, and when it is farther considered, that this law was continued, and has been uniformly acted upon since the last of these statutes passed. The argument used is founded upon three cases; one is, 2 Salkeld, 609; another is, Croke Elizabeth, 210; and the third is, I Lord Raymond, 343; these are cases where persons bringing actions upon penalties: have taken upon them to recite the statutes, whose business it is to know what they claim under, when they recite that as the ground of action or defence; the objection is well known in law under the title of variance; he that sets out pleading a grant and warrant, upon the foundation of a statute, must set out faithfully, he must know what that foundation is; but this is not a question of variance, it is a question of construction and intention; and therefore these cases do not apply to the case before us: when the legislature mean to continue a law, pass a law, or repeal a law, they are not bound to use any precise form of words, if what they meant is clear and obvious, whatever the form of words may be, it must be carried into execution: that this is so in the present case, is clear beyond a doubt; and there are authorities for it both ancient and modern. I will refer to an authority to be found in Foster, page 79:"That by an act passed in the 19th of the King, reciting, that Alexander Lord Pitsligo, and other persons, therein named, had been in actual rebellion, and were fled from justice;" 'it is enacted, that the said Alexander Lord Pitsligo, &amp;c. &amp;c. shall stand attainted of high treason, unless they surrender themselves to justice, on or before the 12th day of July, 1746.' Lord Pitsligo did not surrender in obedience to the act, and thereupon his lands in Scotland were surveyed and seized for the use of his Majesty, by order of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, pursuant to the act of the 20th of the King, upon a presumption that he stood attainted by the act of the 19th. His Lordship put in his claim to the lands, in the Court of Session, by the name of 
               <persName id="o17951202-1-person722">

               <p>To this claim the King's Advocate put in an answer, by which he admitted the patent of creation as stated in the claim; but insisted, that the claimant is the person meant, and sufficiently described by the act. The cause coming on to be heard in the Court of Session, their Lordships pronounced their interlocutor, by which they find that the said Alexander Lord Forbes, of Pitsligo, is not attainted by the act of the 19th of the King, and therefore sustain his claim, and decree possession to be delivered to him.</p>
               <p>From that interlocutor his Majesty's Advocate, in behalf of his Majesty, appealed, and the cause came to a hearing in January, 1750: It was referred to the Judges, and the Judges were of opinon, that if he was the person intended and named in that act, he was sufficiently described by the name and title of 
               <persName id="o17951202-1-person723">

             Pitsligo. Upon that ground their Lordships reversed the interlocutor and dismissed the claim.</p>
               <p>This is a very strong case in point, and the doctrine has been recognized and confirmed in the case of Lord Strathaven, which is so much like the case of Lord Pitsligo, that it is unnecessary to cite it; they both prove, that in the constituting words of the statute, the intention of the legislature is alone to be considered; it is not pretended that there is even a doubt but that some act was intended to be continued; it is not pretended that these words are applicable to any other act, or that there is a doubt whether any other statute is continued by it. Then the argument is this, that these words mean nothing, if it was not the intention of the legislature to continue some act, and that no man can doubt what that act, and that the intention is the whole that should be carried into execution; the intention is most clearly here to continue the statute, 19
