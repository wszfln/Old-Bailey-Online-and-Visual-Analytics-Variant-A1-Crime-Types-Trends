On the night, 25th November, I was in plain clothes, about 11 o'clock, near the Angel, Islington—a gentle<lb/>man named Govey came up, and we walked on towards Claremont Chapel, Pentonville—it was rather dark at that place—as we were walking along the prisoners came tumbling against me, apparently intoxicated—they had hold of each other's arms—I said "Hold up, gentlemen, don't roll about"—I could scarcely get the words out of my mouth when Henderson caught hold of my chain with his left hand, and struck me id the face with the other—it was a severe blow, and blackened my left eye—I put my hand to my waistcoat pocket, and called out "I have lost my watch"—Henderson struck me again as I held my watch with my hand—I said "You have made a mistake, I am a policeman"—I still kept hold of Henderson till the officers in uniform came up, and took him into custody—my watch chain was broken by the pull—I had it round my neck, through my button-hole into my waistcoat pocket—I never left go of Henderson—Miles was at the side of him—I had severe hits from some person—I could not tell who it was—I had black eyes for a week afterwards, and my forehead was much swollen.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 256, St. Paul's Road, Highbury—I am a clerk—on the night of Saturday, 25th November, I was going to see a friend—I got to the Angel about 11 o'clock—I saw two officers there—I walked on with Tew—when we got as far as Claremont Chapel the two prisoners rolled up against us—Henderson snatched at Tew's watch chain with one hand, and struck him with the other—Tew called out "I have lost my watch"—I went to catch hold of Miles when he knocked me down—I got up again, and saw that Dudley had hold of Miles, and Henderson was slipping into Tew; striking him, and struggling with him—I went to his assistance, and caught hold of Henderson—he struggled very violently, and threw us both down, himself going down also—we held him till some men came up in uniform, and he was taken to the station—I should not think Dudley was very far behind when Miles knocked me down, because he got hold of him directly I got up—he was in plain clothes—I fell into the mud when I fell, and so did Tew and Henderson.</p>

I was sent for on the morning of 24th November, to 41, St. George's Square—I examined the premises and found that an entry had been effected by climbing a water-pipe at the rear of No. 43, getting on to the roof, getting in at the sky-light window, dropping into a passage, entering the scullery window, and forcing open the pantry cupboard door with a pair of tongs, the marks of which were on the door—I telegraphed at once to the different pawnbrokers, and on the 28th received information that the prisoners were in custody—I assisted in searching the room, and found some pawn-tickets—I had received information—I told Johnson to take off her dress—she said "What am I to do for another?"—I said "I will bring you one from the workhouse"—she said "No, go to where you have been and bring the one from behind the door"—I did so and she put it on—I found in the room, behind a looking-glass, a pawn-ticket relating to some silver articles which Mr. Beasley has identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at 21, Grosvenor Mansions—on 20th November, about 7.45, I received this letter from last witness—I put it in the pillar letter-box at the corner of High Street Place, Victoria Street, as near 8 o'clock as possible, with this other letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), addressed to Mrs. Coulson, 132, Lower Bagot Street, Dublin—she is a tenant who has apartments in the house, but was then staying at Dublin—I enclosed in the letter another letter directed to her, and also a little memorandum—I posted the letters in the usual way; I put them into the pillar box the same as I always did—I have been living in that street ten years, and I have been in the habit of posting letters sometimes eight or ten times a day—I put the letters in at the top—there is a plate that goes in, and you can drop or slip them in, and they will either fall out into the street or fall into the box—I am certain that I pushed them in (<hi rend="italic">model produced</hi>)—that is the way I put them in, and they dropped over—if they did not go in they would come out into your hand—I am positive they went over that ledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The letter now contains just what it did when I posted it—I posted the letters in the ordinary way—I had no other errand—I simply went out and posted the letters, and went back; it is just across the road—this box has not been there very long, not a year—it has not always had the same aperture, the old one was different from this, it was taken away and a new one put—I don't recollect that I heard the letters drop in the box, there is such a noise in the street—I saw them disappear, that I swear—the mouth of the letter-box is towards the railings of the houses; it stands on the kerb—I have seen the inside of the box when the postman has taken the letters out, but not to notice it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 20th November, about 10 minutes past 8, I was on duty in Victoria Street, and saw the two prisoners standing close together, side by side, close by the pillar letter box; they did not touch it—they were standing quite still—I was coming from Victoria Station, and when I got within about 20 or 25 yards of the box they walked towards me, and as they passed me I heard one say to the other "We must look out for him"—they had just got past me—I went on, and as I passed the box I cast my eyes into the mouth of it, and could see nothing in the aperture—I am sure there were no letters at that time sticking in the aperture, not to my sight—after hearing what they said, my attention was called to the box—that was the reason I looked—there is a gas lamp not quite 20 yards from the letter-box, which shows a full light on it—it stands on the same kerb as the box, in a line with it—there are no lamps over the doors there—after I had got a few yards past the box I looked round, and I saw the prisoners looking round, watching me—I went a little farther on, looked round again, and saw them still looking round, but they were walking on at the same time—I went on about 40 yards from the box, and they went about the same distance the other way—they then stopped on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187112110017"/>
               <p>the pavement, and I stopped for about five minutes—I then saw them walking towards me again, and I walked towards them, and we passed each other—just before I got to the turning they had come past the letter-box—I then turned round to the left in Ashley Place, by the area railings, and there I secreted myself, and watched them—they went up about the same distance that I did, and there they stopped again for about two minutes—they then walked back to the box—I got round the other corner into Ashley Place, and there I could see the box perfectly plain—the prisoners came and stood by the box in the middle of the pavement for about half a minute, then they placed themselves side by side by the box, and I saw Bradley place his hand into the mouth of the box, and I could see something white appearing from it (<hi rend="italic">describing it with the model</hi>)—at that time I saw Smith touch Bradley, and they walked away, leaving the white sticking out nearly an inch, or it might have been quite an inch—it was out far enough for me to catch hold of—the prisoners walked towards Victoria Station—I went directly up to the box, and found these letters sticking out, so—I did not notice how the top one was, but this one was sticking out corner ways, like that—they were both there, but I could only see one—I am quite certain they were not there when I passed the box before—I pulled the letters out, took them with me, and followed the prisoners—they looked round and saw that I was after them, and Smith separated from Bradley—they walked some distance like that; I stopped on the pavement, and Smith looked round and then joined Bradley again—there were three gentlemen walking towards Victoria Station, and I walked on behind them until I got opposite the prisoners, when I took them both into custody—I told them I should want to take them to the station—they said "What for?"—I said "I will tell you that when I get you into the station"—Smith said "Tell me now?"—I said "It is for attempting to take these letters out of the pillar letter box"—Smith said "I shan't go"—I said "You will"—he said he should not—I asked a young man who was stand<lb/>ing by to go to Victoria Station for a constable—Smith then said "I will go," and I took them both to the station—on the way Smith said something about waiting for a brother or brother-in-law of Bradleys, that they had to wait outside a public-house for him—they had every opportunity of parting with anything after they left the letter box, they were some distance in front of me, and there were several people passing by—I afterwards examined the letter box—I found that the aperture was a little bit wet and damp—it was a very foggy night, it might have been caused by that—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards I saw the box opened; it was not full—there were not above forty or fifty letters in the box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I started with the notion that these men meant to rob the letter-box—that was my idea from their conduct, and my intention was to see whether or no they did rob it—at the time I saw them move some<lb/>thing white, there was no one else near the box that I could see—I could not see into Victoria Street—there was nothing to prevent their taking the letters if they had so liked—I was in uniform—I heard the words "We must look out for him" quite distinctly—they had just passed me—I noticed on five different occasions that they were watching me—four occa<lb/>sions before they tried to get the letters out of the box, the fifth occasion was after they had got the letters to the top, when I was walking after them—I hid myself behind the railings in Ashley Place—I could see straight to the letter-box—I was twelve yards from it—I should hardly</p>

               <p>think they could have seen me, because I was in the dark—was peeping through the railings—the lamp would not throw the light on the front of the letter-box—I could see the aperture by the light of the lamp—I did not go to the public-house to ascertain if there was anyone there the prisoners knew—I did not lose sight of the prisoners till they got round the second corner, just for a minute as they turned the corner—it was Bradley's hand that I saw at the box—Smith was then standing on his right side—when I first passed the letter-box I saw nothing white sticking out—the box is about 5ft. 4 in. high—the height of the aperture is about 5ft.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk of the works at the General Post Office—I have examined the letter-box in question and made the model produced—if a letter is put in the aperture and over this incline, there is nothing to stop it from going down, the interior of the box is quite clear, there is a cavity of about 16 or 18 inches in diameter each way—there is a wire guard in front of the door to prevent the letters dropping out when the door is opened—when I examined the box there was no imperfection, or anything to obstruct a letter from going to the bottom.</p>

"Take it out!"—I ran to the bar, and told Mr. Turner, who sent me for a policeman—I was absent two or three minutes, and when I came back I found Benson in custody, and Thornton up the yard, sitting on a form, bleeding—I know Henry Tull as a witness in the case—I cannot say whether he was in the room, because I was not there at the time it was done—there was no pushing the elbows or scrambling for money while I was there—Thornton struck no blow in my presence, and I did not hear any noise; in fact, it was quietly done altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter, of 68, Regent Street—on the night in question, at 1 o'clock, I was in Tottenham Court Road and met Dooley—she said would I stand something to drink, ginger beer or something—I said it was too late—she said she could get some close by where she lived—I went home with her—I don't know where it was, but it was in the direc<lb/>tion of Long Acre—she asked me if I would mind going upstairs; it was a poor house, but she was an honest woman; and then she asked me if I would give her sixpence to fetch the ginger beer—I could not find a six-pence, and gave her a shilling, which I took out with other money, and she had the opportunity of seeing it—the moment she left to get the ginger beer another girl, who I believe was Price, came in and said that her friend would not be long—she stopped a few seconds, and down she went—three men then came up together—one was dressed as a soldier—Higgs and Morgan and the soldier said "Now pull your money out, we know you have lots of money," and at the same time gave me some blows on the chest and knocked me over on the bed—they all three put their hands in my pockets and took all they could find, four half-sovereigns from one pocket, and over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from another—the door was left open a little, and I saw Dooley look in—Higgs had on a soldier's overcoat, not the uniform coat he has on now—they all ran down, and I called "Police!"—I met a policeman—at once went back with him—we saw some people standing there—I think it was the prisoners—we spoke to them, and they ran away—we followed and caught Morgan behind a doorway—I heard him drop some money—I gave a description of Higgs—I recognise all the prisoners by their faces except Price.</p>

I had had a drop of drink. He struck me in the eye, and I came into the hospital on Tuesday last"—the prisoner then said to her "Now Jane, did not you tell me that you were ill last Friday week?"—she said "The blow was given three weeks ago, and last Friday week I told my husband that I was ill; he told me to go to bed. Dr. Champneys attended me on a parish order. Mrs. Patterson saw my husband strike me"—I asked her if she would sign this statement—she said "No, I can't, I don't want him locked up"—the prisoner said it was all false, he never struck her—on the way back to the station, in a cab, he said "It is a bad job"—I said "It is"—he said "I have never struck her since I had the three months"—he was charged at the police-station with violently assaulting her—he made no reply to the charge—the persons who were round the deceased's bed were the police constable, Mr. Archer the house-surgeon, and the sister of the ward.</p>

I am opthalmic surgeon at St. Bartholomew's—the deceased Jane Cox was brought in on Tuesday, 28th November—she was admitted on account of a swelling on the right side of her nose and round the right eye—there was no wound or bruise—she was taken to the opthalmic ward—she made a statement to me—an operation had to be performed—she did not appear to suffer from the effects of that—it relieved her very much—the signs of improvement continued for about three days—I think the operation was on Saturday, 2nd December, and she was taken very much worse on Monday evening, the 4th—inflammation of the brain set in—she had convulsions, and lost the use of her left side, and from that time she was more or less unconscious until her death on the 7th—I can in no way connect her getting worse with the operation—it was merely the opening of an abscess—I made a post-mortem examination on Friday, the 8th—I found the bridge of the nose on the right side was broken—the bone was broken in two or three pieces—I found extensive inflammation of the bones behind the nose—the bones of the right eye were in the same state of inflammation, and the whole of the right side of the brain was inflamed—I believe that had spread from the nose—in my judgment the cause of death was inflammation of the brain,' caused by the injury to her nose—that was my decided opinion—those injuries were most probably caused by a violent blow—I think it must have been a violent blow—I think a blow with a fist would produce that kind of injury—had she fallen upon anything she would probably have fallen with great weight and have cut the skin—the skin was not cut at all—I think one well-directed blow would have caused all the injuries—I should have expected an external wound if she had fallen upon anything, still more if it had been done with any instru<lb/>ment—on the left side of the base of the skull, when I removed the brain, I found a hard, bony tumour, about the size of a walnut, attached to the bones of the skull—I should think that was of some years' standing—the brain above that was quite healthy—it had nothing whatever to do with the cause of death—on the calf of the left leg were the scars of two ulcers of long standing—I connect them with the mischief in the skull, but they had nothing whatever to do with the cause of death—I don't think the blow on the nose was a very recent one, because there was no evidence of blood around the bone; no bruising, in fact—I should say it could hardly have been more than three or four weeks old—from what I saw of her in the hospital while she was alive, I think she must have been a woman of intemperate habits—that would go far to account for the severity of her symptoms—I should like to add that Inspector Hodgkinson did not come to the hospital until we communicated with him—I was not present at the bedside when the statement was taken—my house surgeon was.</p>

               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">POOLEY</hi>. I am a fireman belonging to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—on 7th January this year I was in charge of a fire escape in Old Street Road, Shoreditch; the prisoner came to me about 4.50 a.m., and told me there was a fire just down in the street in Old Street Road, at a carpenter's shop—I went there, and he assisted me with the escape—smoke was coming from the windows, and I got some people out at the windows—after I had rescued them all, and the fire was put out, the prisoner returned with me—he did not ask me for anything, but I said if you will call in the evening when the officer is here, he will pay you; he then went away—he came again in the evening—the officer gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I handed it over to the prisoner—there is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for calling the escape and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra if you rescue people—I had this receipt—I wrote this "William Anthony, 3, Golden Lane, St. Luke's"—I wrote that because he could not write it himself—he gave me that name and address, I did not know it in any other way—on 11th March, about 3 o'clock, he came to the same station and rang the fire bell—when I got to the door I found the prisoner there and another man with a van—the prisoner told me that there was a carpenter's shop alight in John Street, Curtain Road, Shoreditch—I went there with the escape—the prisoner assisted me, and afterwards helped me back with the escape—there was a fire there—I paid him a shilling, be claimed a half-crown, but I could not tell whether he or the other man had given the first information—I told him to call in the evening and see what the officer said, but he said he would not be bothered to call again—I made an entry on this memorandum, this "William Anthony, 7, Princes Street, Ropemaker's Street,"Is my writing—I entered that because he told me he could not write—on 5th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock, the prisoner came again to the same station, and told me there was a fire in Boot Street, about 100 yards from the station—I went there with the escape—there was a fire on the ground-floor—I got some people out of the house, and the prisoner assisted me back with the escape—he gave his address, John Smith, 7, Chapel Street, Whitecross Street, and was told to call in the evening, but he did not do so—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I saw him, with other persons, at the Thames Police Court, and recognised him—I have not the least doubt of his being the man—he stood in the cell, looking out at the door, and said "You have no occasion to open your mouth too wide, it will not be anything in your pocket."</p>

                  </hi>. I have had a very long experience in considering the characteristics of handwriting—I have made it my study—I have looked at the signature "W.

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Younghusband—on 18th November, I delivered some hampers of poultry to Mr. Howard, of Leadenhall Market—in consequence of what was said, I looked at one of the hampers, and found that the string had been cut—Mr. Howard's man opened the hamper, and there was a space for four fowls at one corner—I fetched Murphy, and showed him—he said there was every appearance of four having been taken out, but he did not know anything about it—I then delivered a package to Mr. Miller, a poulterer, of Leadenhall Market—that package was smashed in—I went to Mr. Miller for the purpose of borrowing a hamper to repack the package, so that the poultry should not be damaged—there were eighteen geese and four turkeys—I don't know how many there should have been—I could not say whether the package had been disturbed, because it was so broken.</p>

I live at 175, New Kent Road—I am a tobacconist, and I also sell toys—on 8th November a man came into my shop and asked for some birdseye tobacco, and then he spoke about boot laces—he said he belonged to a school, and he wanted some boot laces for the school, and they must be got that day—I had not got any then, and he went away—after that an old man came with a van, of whom I ordered some toys—I asked him if he had boot laces, and I took a dozen and a half of his whip<lb/>cord laces to try—he had not got the toys with him; he said he should be round again in three-quarters of an hour, and would bring the toys—after the old man had gone the prisoner came in, and I thinking he was the man told him I had the laces he was inquiring about—he said "Oh, have you, let me see them?"—he said he would take a dozen and see if they would do—he paid me for them—he said he would see if they were the sort that would be required at the school, and if it was he would come back and let me know whether he would have any more—he said he could get a good many orders if I would allow him a penny off every shilling, and I agreed to do so—he left, and in a short time he came back again with a young man, who he introduced as pupil teacher at the school—he then produced a written order for seventeen dozen whipcord laces, and eighteen dozen of a different kind—he told me several times that it was useless unless I executed it at once—I said the man I bought the others of would be back in a short time—the prisoner went out saying he would be back in an how and a half—about five minutes after the old man came in with the order I had given him—I showed him the paper, and told him I would take two gross of each—he only had one gross and nine dozen of the penny ones—I took them and two gross of the twopenny ones, and paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—the prisoner never called for the laces and the old man never came again—I have the laces now; they are useless—when I found the young man did not come, I tried to sell them to someone in the trade, and they said they were worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross, and I had given 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I don't understand them myself—I never had anything to do with them before—I met a man that same afternoon and gave him in charge—that was the same man I had seen in the shop in the morning—I took him to the station and he was discharged—I was quite mistaken—when I said before the Magistrate that it was the prisoner, I made a mistake—I apologised to the gentleman since I knew he was not the man who brought me the orders—I am quite sure that the prisoner is the man who ordered the laces; I have no doubt whatever.</p>
