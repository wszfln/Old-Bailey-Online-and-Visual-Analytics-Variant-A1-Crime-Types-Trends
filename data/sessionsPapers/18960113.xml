I am a labourer; I live at Walworth—I have known the prisoner about five or six years; I went through the form of marriage with her on the 1st of May, 1894, at St. John's Church, New<lb/>ington; I married her as a widow, and she has been a good wife to me—I had lived with her for about two years before I married her—we had no children—I had no reason to think that she was going to have a child before I married her—she did not tell me that her husband had deserted her, and that he had never done anything for her for fifteen years—her husband came to me, and said he was her cousin, and asked me to take a child of his, because his wife had run away from him—that was before I married her—he did not tell me who his wife was—he visited me three times—I did not take the child; I never saw it.</p>

On December 2nd I was on duty at the station—the prisoner came in with her husband, William West, and a constable—she said that the man was her husband; he had given her into custody for bigamy—at the station she said, "Quite right, I did commit bigamy; I may as well make a clean breast of it now, as I shall get no peace while this man is alive"—I said, "Do you wish to make a statement?"—she said, "Yes"—she did so, and I took it down; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "I now live at 69, Wellington Street, Walworth, where I have lived for the past three years—about eighteen months ago this man, West, came to me with a paper and asked me to sign my name to it, that he would not acknowledge me</p>

I live at 106, Balcombe Street, and am an upholsterer—on Christmas night I was with Brown at the Boston Arms for about three minutes—when we came out I followed him across to Norman's house—Brown knocked loudly at the door, which was opened immediately by Walsh, who came out and mumbled a few words to Brown, and ran away—the door is about a dozen yards from a street lamp; I saw Walsh's face as he ran away; he turned towards the lamp—Brown shouted for the police; Bradock came out—I took hold of his collar; he said it was all right, nothing was the matter, and started struggling—he took a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> from his pocket and tried to hit me—I caught hold of it; he broke away—Russell came up the other way and Bradock turned into Hill Street, where he put his back against the wall and hit left and right at Russell with <hi rend="italic">the jemmy;</hi> it flew out of his hand after some time, and went over the wall, and the constable arrested him—on January 4th I went to the station and identified Walsh without hesitation from a dozen men—I have no doubt about him—my friend had not said a word to me when we crossed to the door; I did not know what we were crossing the road for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We started playing dominoes about seven o'clock—there were a good many of us there, and a good many children, in two rooms with folding doors between—there was not much beer there—we had cigars fetched from the public-house—about 10.45 we went out and fetched some in—my mother went in the evening for some beer—none of us men went out about eight—if Walsh said he did he would be telling an untruth—some of our friends went to Baker Street to go home—to the best of my recollection Walsh did not go to see them off, I think he wanted to do so—if he had gone he would not have gone at 11 or 11.30; as our friends did not go till 1.30 or 2; they did not five a quarter of a mile from Baker Street—they did not go to Baker Street to take the train, but that was their nearest way—Mr. and Mrs. Ray would go home by Baker Street, but they did not go home till next morning—Mr. and Mrs. Barnes walked home at 1.30 or 2—Ray, Barnes, Walsh and myself fetched the beer and cigars at 11—I have worked on and off for Audrey and Patterson's for ten years, and I have worked for Hobbs in the Hamp<lb/>stead Road.</p>

I don't know anything about it"—I asked if the writing was his, he said "No"—I confronted him with Cartwright, and said, "This man followed you from your house this morning, he has been watching you three or four days by my instructions"—he said, "I shall be able to prove where I was at the time"—I told him I was of opinion that the writing was his—I identify the postal orders because I had recorded the numbers.</p>

I am now undergoing a sentence of twelve months for larceny from Mr. Leach—while undergoing that sentence I made this statement to Detective Nicholls, who wrote it down in my presence—all the statements in it are, I believe, correct—I have known Brooks six or seven years as Frederick Brooks—he knew me as Edith Francis—in November, 1894, I went into the service of Mr. Myers, of the White Lamb public-house, Whitfield Street—he wanted a reference, and I gave Mr. Brooks as a reference; I think I gave Brooks the name of Barnett; his real name is Brooks—I went under the name of Ada Cootes—I said I had been Mr. Barnett's barmaid at Greenwich for six or eight months, and gave his address at 63, St. Oswald's Road, West Brompton—I went into Mr. Myers' service, stopped there four or five days, and was then discharged—I had not been in the service of the prisoner for six or eight months—it was arranged between us some time before that he should give me a reference—he was to receive for doing it whatever I could afford to give him after going into the service—I never lived with him—I suppose the money I gave him was to come out of my wages, I did not say where it was to come from—he did not come to Mr. Myers while I was there—on October 4th I went to Mr. Leach, of the Varieties Theatre, Hoxton—I saw Mrs. Minnie Leach, and made certain statements to her before she engaged me as a barmaid—I told her I had been for twelve months in the service of Mr. Fowler, of Shepherd's Bush, and that he had left and gone into private life, and I gave his address as Halstead House, St. Ann's Road, Stamford Hill—that Mr. Fowler was Brooks—I had not been in his service as barmaid for twelve months—I gave him as a reference through my meeting another barmaid advertising for a situation—I did not see or write to the prisoner; I gave his name in consequence of what the other barmaid said to me; I knew from her he was passing under the name of Fowler—I saw Brooks once—I entered Leach's service on Saturday night, October 5th, 1895—while I was serving there on the Saturday night Brooks came into the bar; he came in twice, I think, between the 5th and the 9th, when I was taken into custody—I did not give him anything; I don't know what he came for—I did not expect him to come—I think I gave him a drink when he came; I cannot remember if I gave him anything else—I might have given him a few coppers—I did give him money belonging to my master out of the till on each occa<lb/>sion he came—I was afraid of Brooks and acted under fear—I gave him a very small sum, I cannot remember how much—I had no money when I went there; I had been out of a situation for some time—when I was</p>

               <p>at Myers the money I paid Brooks was to come out of my wages—when I was discharged, after a few days for absenting myself without leave, I saw the prisoner and gave him something, I think, for giving me a false character.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Brook.</hi> I gave you money twice at Leach's, the first time on the Saturday night, the first night I was there—you used to give the character to Lizzie Church, not to me—I never knew you in the name of Fowler or Barnett, only by your going by that name—when you took other names, Barnett and Fowler, I knew you by them—on several occasions I saw you in the name of Fowler before I went to Leach—I only heard of your passing as Fowler in this case; I heard it from Church and other barmaids; I don't remember the dates.</p>

I am a gun-maker, living at 40, St. Charles Square, Kensington—on the night of December 23rd I locked up the house; the bath-room window, which is at the back of the house on the first floor, was safe—the plate-basket was left safely in the dining-room—about 5.30 next morning I heard some noise, of which I took no notice; then I heard another noise, much more violent, and I got up, and found the bath-room window-latch had been broken—entrance had been effected through there, the window being reached from the stable yard by means of a ladder—I found the plate basket in the kitchen, empty—about £35 worth of plate was taken, and clothes, boots, a raw turkey, and two Christmas puddings—I identify these four spoons, two of them have my initial "W., and two have not.</p>

I examined her and found a bruise of recent origin on her left hip, about three inches long by one inch wide—I think the wound would have been caused by this knife—it would have required very con<lb/>siderable violence to cause it—I don't see, from the position of the wound, how it could have been caused by the prisoner trying to get the knife in a struggle, because it was on the outside of the wrist, and of such an ex<lb/>tent—if it were accidental it would have been a mere notch, and not so long or deep—in my opinion it was deliberate—most likely the bruise I examined would have been caused by a kick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 324, Lancaster Road, Kensington—on December 31st, about 7.30 p.m., I was in Labroke Grove, and on approaching a turning I saw five men in front of me, and as I slipped off the kerb the first two crossed their hands and pulled my head back with great force—I thought it was a joke, and said, "Why don't you leave off?"—the prisoner butted me with his head, I was thrown down, and the prisoner dived his hand into my pocket—I put out all my strength and they relaxed their grasp round my throat—the prisoner stammered, "Hold him tight, he is getting loose"—I thought I could recognise his voice among ten thousand—I pulled them round and pulled their faces towards a lamp—they let me go, and the prisoner took his hand out of my pocket—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man—I chased them—they turned into a back road and picked up some large pebble stones; I did the same—they let go at me with five stones but I fell back and threw a stone at them—I followed them down Chesterton Road and spoke to a policeman—I caught the prisoner at the corner of Apland Road and gave him in custody.</p>

"I took the prisoner in custody—he said he knew nothing about it—I found 1s. on him and 3d. in bronze—the prosecutor said that the five men had garrotted him And robbed him—he was nearly exhausted, and not able to run after the other four—I have been out several nights to find the others—I know the prisoner well by sight; he occasionally works at a gas factory—he was walking when I arrested him—he said, "I was by myself at the time"</p>

On December 28th I watched Catherine Street from 4.15 to 5.15 a.m.—I went to 10<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, where there is a large loft, and spoke to the proprietor who took me to the loft, where I saw Pearce standing—it was dark—I said, "You are the man they call <hi rend="italic">Mug's Eye</hi>, you have not got your whiskers on now"—he said, "You have made a mistake, governor"—I omitted that at the Police-court—he said, "What station are you going to take me to; Carlton Terrace?" I said, "Yes"—on the way there he said, "I was with him, I suppose I shall have to suffer for breaking into the Eagle Tavern"—I said, "I did not know anything about the Eagle"—he said, "Well, I have done ten years for breaking in there and if I do all my time I shall get fifteen"—I took him to the station, and found these two screws on him, which I should say belong to a lock.</p>

I am a tailor, of 36, Hunt Street, Spitalfields—on Tuesday evening, November 26th, a fire broke out in my top workshop about 8.15—I was insured in a French insurance company—I was coming into my house when I heard of it, and I ran out and whistled for the police—when I came back several people were in my house—I stood in the passage to see them go out when the fire was out, and the last of them was the prisoner—he came up and said, "Which way did the fire break out?"—I said, "I don't know"—when all the people had gone he was waiting, and he called me outside and said, "What am I going to have out of the fire, as I have been helping in the fire? I am only a poor fellow, and, of course, if you won't give me some money, I can get you into trouble"—I asked him what he meant, and he said, "You know very well what I mean; you made the fire; I can go and say you made the fire"—I said, "How can you go and say that? You did not see nothing"—he said, "If you don't give me some money I shall go to the company, and I can get £5 if I tell them that you made the fire"—as I was excited I thought it was no good my standing talking to him, and I said, "You can leave it for a day dr two"—he said, "All right; I shall call to-morrow evening, at eight o'clock I shall be here"—the conversation was in Yiddish—he began by asking which way the fire broke out, and said, "Are you insured?"—I said, "Yes"—I had never seen him before—he called next evening at eight o'clock I was not at home—when I came home my tenant spoke to me, and I went to the Commercial Street police-station after nine o'clock, and made a statement to the officers—next morning the prisoner came between 8 and 8.30 a.m.—I asked him if he could wait till I had my breakfast—he said, "Yes, I have to go to work at 11 o'clock; you can have your breakfast"—I gave a sign to my tenant, Joseph Imber—I had my breakfast, and then, to gain time, I said, "We will go over to the public-house, and have a drink"—we went and stayed at the public-house for some time—Imber came to the public-house, and made a sign to me, and I left the public-house with the prisoner, and went across the road to my house and had a conversation with him in the passage in Yiddish—then I said, "Don't speak in Yiddish or my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> will understand you"—my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> is English—he said, "All right, I shall speak in English"—said, "You</p>

               <p>wanted £2"—he had mentioned £2 in the public-house, where we had a long conversation—he said, "You only had a small fire, and I only want £2; I have had such cases before; I have had £8 in the Tottenham Court Road, and £5 in other places, but they were bigger fires than that"—I told him I had not got the money with me—he said, "Then I cannot wait any longer, because the surveyor may come and look after your place, and then it will be too late; I shall go to the company"—and then Imber came in—in the passage of my house, I said, "You want £2, as you did not see nothing of the fire"—he said, "Of course I did not see nothing of the fire, but if I should go to the Company I should get £5, it will be worth more to you than £2"—I said, "You did not see nothing of the fire, and you want £2; it is rather too much. You will take less than £2"—he said, "No, if I go up to the Company and speak what I know, what I have got to speak against you, that you made the tire"—I said, "You did not see me make the fire; how can you go and speak to the Company about such a thing?"—he said, "I know, but if I like I can go and say"—I said, "Will you take a sovereign'/"—he said, "No"—I said, "Will you take thirty shillings?"—he said, "No, I won't take a farthing less than £2"—I said, "If you want £2, I must give you two men instead," and I went to the back door, which was half open, and said, "Will you come and take this man for asking money by false pretences?" and the two detectives took him and I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first conversation on the night of the fire was in Yiddish; I was standing on the doorstep, and the prisoner in the street—Mr. and Mrs. Imber stood right behind me in the passage—they under<lb/>stand Yiddish—the prisoner did not say that from what he saw there had been great carelessness, I sure about it—the conversation took about five minutes—he did not say he was sure the Insurance Company would not pay if they knew how careless I had been—I asked his name and address, and he told me, Jacobs, 10<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Booth Street; that is his right name and address—I believed then that he was trying to extort money by threatening to accuse me of causing the fire wilfully—the police had left the house about a quarter of an hour—I asked the prisoner's name and address, so that as soon as he had gone I should get a policeman to give him in charge—I did not go to the police that night; my tenants kept me back—when he came in the morning he stopped with me about an hour before we went to the public-house—we talked about the fire, and other fires he had had—before the magistrate I said that he said he had one other case of fire; I did not have a chance of saying about the other case he mentioned—my solicitor examined me—we had a quarter or half-hour's conversation in the public-house before Imber came, and made a sign—what he said in the house and the public-house was not that I had been very careless, and he was sure that the insurance company would not pay if they knew that; he said nothing about being careless, or anything of the kind—my wife is English, she understands Yiddish—I told the prisoner she did not understand English; it was not true, but the detectives would not have understood him if he had spoken in Yiddish—I wanted more evidence than my own as to what he said—he said that if he went to the company he would get £5 from them for his information—he said nothing about my being careless—we had not been</p>

               <p>out two minutes on the night of the fire—it was in the second floor in the work-room—I had not been in that room since about twelve in the morning—I expect the shop girls had been there in the interval, they usually are there—I cannot say whether or no there had been any carelessness—when I ran out and whistled I did not pass a fire alarm—I only knew afterwards there was one in Buxton Street; I went out at the back not the front—I was very excited—I cannot say whether I might have got the fire put out sooner if I had been a little cooler; as I ran upstairs I saw a big flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not help to put the fire out—he had never been in my house before—my business hours are from eight to eight; I first went for a policeman to make this charge on the Wednes<lb/>day evening after business hours—an officer came to my house; I expected the prisoner that night.</p>

I am the last witness's wife—I was born in England and speak English—after the fire there were plenty of people in our passage; as they went out the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, gave a wink to Cohen, who refused him at first, but afterwards went to him. and stood on the doorstep—the prisoner said to Cohen in Yiddish, which I understand, "Mr. Cohen, what am I going to have from the fire? I was here from the beginning"—Cohen said, "I am upset; leave it for to-morrow night"—I then left—on Thursday morning, the 28th, about eight o'clock the prisoner knocked at our door, I opened it and the prisoner went straight upstairs to Mr. Cohen's place—after that Cohen and the prisoner came in together; I opened the door; they stood in the passage opposite my bedroom door—I went into ray kitchen which is at the end of the passage, next the bedroom—I did not close the door behind me—I heard the prisoner say to Cohen in Yiddish, "I want £2"—</p>

On November 28th, about ten a.m., I went with a sergeant to Cohen's house, 36, Hunter Street, and into a back room on the ground floor, and stood behind the door, which was partly open—I saw through the crack of the door into the passage—Mr. and Mrs. Imber and another woman went upstairs—the prisoner and Cohen came in, and spoke first in a language I did not understand, and after<lb/>wards in English—they stood at the foot of the stairs, opposite to where I was—Cohen said to the prisoner, "What is it you want?"—he said, "£2"—Cohen said, "Cannot you take £1?"—the prisoner said "No, you know you set fire to the house"—Cohen said, "I did not; you did not see me"—the prisoner said "No, but I know you did. If I take you into court it will cost you more than £2. If I write to the Insurance Com<lb/>pany I can get £5" (I made these notes as soon as I got into the charge room)—Cohen came into the room in which we were, and said, "You hear that"—we walked out, and I took the prisoner into custody, and told him we were police officers; and that I should take him into custody for trying to obtain £2 by threats—he made no reply—at the station, when the charge was read to him, he said, "Why should I want £2? I know nothing about it," or words to that effect—he was taken to the Police-court the same afternoon—he said there, "Why do you want to push me into prison? I have not done you any harm"—he was quite sober—I was not at Cohen's that morning by accident.</p>

I am a builder at Market Street, Watford—on September 28th, 1894, I received this letter with the prisoner's signature (I have seen him write), and with the address York Buildings, Adelphi. (<hi rend="italic">The letter stated that the writer was desirous of obtaining tenders for the erection of several pairs of villas at Northwood, and that information could be obtained at York Buildings.</hi>) North wood is between Uxbridge and Watford—before I received that letter I had had no dealings with the prisoner, and did not know him—I showed his letter to my son, who works for me, and an estimate was prepared, which my son took to London—in conse<lb/>quence of what he said on his return, I and my son went to York Buildings, Adelphi, and saw the prisoner three or four days afterwards, at the end of September—the prisoner said the estimate was too high, and we had a conversation as to reducing it—he said the houses, were to be erected for a client of his, Miles Atkinson, of Blackheath, a gentleman with a lot of money, and that as soon as we had pressed far enough with the work the money would be paid by him—I believed in and relied on his statement about Miles Atkinson, at the time—I returned home, and prepared another estimate, which. I sent to York Buildings—after that I received this letter of October 3rd, signed by the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that the estimate was too high, as the houses could be built for</hi> £1,000; <hi rend="italic">that he had had at least a dozen built from the same plans; that if Eames could build them for</hi> £1,000 <hi rend="italic">a pair he should advise the acceptance of his tender.</hi>) I replied, and received this letter of October 6th, (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the written contract was ready, and that he would make the price</hi> £1,030.)

               <p>that I went to Northwood, and commenced the work, and went on till about 14th November, when I reached the stage of the building which would entitle me to the first instalment under the contract—on 14th November I wrote the prisoner a letter, of which this is a press copy. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that all the first floor joists would be up on Thursday, and asked for a cheque for</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">on the Saturday.</hi>) I received this reply on 16th November. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Pinchbeck had sent a man to Northwood, who reported that the brickwork was far below the first-floor joists, and would not be up in time for a cheque to be sent that week, and that the value of the work done was about</hi> £170.) I say the value of the work then done was £200, and I had asked him not to deduct twenty per cent, from that, and I went on with the work for another week, and on 23rd November I wrote again to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Asking for a cheque next morning, as he was depending solely on it for wages.</hi>) I received this letter from the prisoner in reply. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that his client was out of town, but that he would look into the matter on Monday.</hi>) I wrote on 26th November to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him to send the cheque at once, as he had heard from the Northwood Brick Company that he could have no mare bricks till they received a cheque from him; and that unless he received the prisoner's cheque he would have to stop the work for want of bricks.</hi>) I received this answer on 27th November. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he should see his client on Friday, and would tend cheque at once, and that delay should not occur again, as he would see to it beforehand; that he would set the receiver to the Brick Company next day, and would tell them to let Eames have everything he wanted.</hi>) There were one or two other letters, and then I received this of November 30th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner would have some money coming in next week himself, and enclosed a cheque for</hi> £50, <hi rend="italic">and a receipt from the Northwood Brick Company for £100 from Kent Pinchbeck on account of bricks supplied by them to Eames on buildings in the Hollowett Road.</hi>) That was the first money I received from the prisoner—at this date I had put about £300 into the buildings—the next instalment, another £200, became due on December 24th—we were entitled to £170 for the first, and £200 for the second instal<lb/>ment—I applied for that second £200 by letter, and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he considered the instalment should be</hi> £160; <hi rend="italic">that he had been obliged to pay up the brick account on his guarantee, and enclosing a cheque for</hi> £112, <hi rend="italic">and a receipt for</hi> £47 15s. 8d.) At the time I received that, on January 14th, I had put £500 into the building—I went on with the work and shortly after applied for some more money—I received £50 on February 13th, and £100 on March 11th—altogether we did work worth £750, and we received altogether £460—we kept on working and applying for money, but we could not get any more, so we stopped work—I applied for money by letter, and I went to the office several times, three or four times in one week—I went three or four times without being able to see the prisoner; I saw Martin, his manager, when I did not see the prisoner—Martin came down to the buildings every two or three weeks, I think—the prisoner said Martin was his manager—when Martin said the prisoner was out, he assured me the money would be all right—I saw the prisoner the last time I called; when I made application before we left off; I told him, "You cannot expect me to finish these buildings and have £570 to get when I have done them"—he said, "No, Mr. Eames, I don't think you can"—he gave no reason</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189601130047"/>
               <p>why the money was not paid—Atkinson's name was not mentioned then—that was about April, 1895—my solicitors, Broad and Riggall, of Wat<lb/>ford, tried to find Atkinson, but could not—I have had no part of the balance due to me—I was subsequently employed by Mr. Boyce, another solicitor acting for the mortgagee, to finish the buildings I had begun under an entirely different contract—I did not receive from Mr. Boyce any payment in respect of the balance due from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know what the prisoner's position was when I first entered into negociations with him; I had never heard of Miles Atkinson before I went to the prisoner's office—I depended absolutely on what the prisoner told me; I had nothing else to depend on—he showed me nothing by means of which I could have gathered Atkinson to be a man of property—we were entirely led by the prisoner's repre<lb/>sentations about a rich client who would pay the money—I made no inquiry about Atkinson at that time, except of the prisoner—I relied on the prisoner—the agreement was between me and Atkinson; the prisoner said the money was placed with him, and would be paid by him—nothing would be due till the drains were laid, and the first floor joists fixed—we depended on the architect for his report; we look on them as honourable men as a rule—when I applied first for money the drains were not laid, the joists were laid; it is a very rare thing to put in drains while the scaffold-poles are about—I did not know Martin before I began to work for the prisoner; he came to supervise the work—he made no com<lb/>plaint about the work; it gave every satisfaction—there was no dispute between me and Martin as to the amount of work that bad been done—I do not remember receiving any letter from the prisoner to that effect after my first application for money—I see all my correspondence as a rule, and my son sees most of it—directly after declining to go on with the work I consulted my solicitor; that was shortly after April—I gave up working at the latter end of April—about two months ago I thought of making a criminal charge against the prisoner—Mr. Gregson, a solicitor, wrote to me, and I attended at his office, and after that preferred this charge—I had taken civil pro<lb/>ceedings against the prisoner before that, but no criminal proceedings—under the agreement there is a penalty of £1 a day for leaving the work un<lb/>finished, but there is a weather clause that put that on one side; the weather was so bad that it stopped us for about a month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On May 21st I issued a writ against the prisoner; that action is still pending—when I attended at Mr. Gregson's office in conse<lb/>quence of a letter from him, I met some other builders and had Rome conver<lb/>sation with them, and in consequence I joined in these proceedings—I said to the prisoner at the time that it was a very unusual thing to put in drains while the scaffold was erected, and the prisoner said, "Yes, put them in when you like," and in consequence we went on, so that when the building was up and the scaffolding out of the way we could put the drains in properly—we agreed verbally it should be so—the drains are in now.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189601130048"/>
               <p>were in for a good thing—I went back to my father and an estimate was prepared, and I and my father came to London, and I was present when my father went through the estimate with the prisoner—the prisoner told my father that Miles Atkinson was a rich gentleman living at Black<lb/>heath, but the money was perfectly safe as it was placed in the prisoner's hands and would be paid to my father as soon as it was due—I was not present when my father signed the contract, but I saw it in January when I went to the prisoner's with my father, who did not seem satisfied about the representations made, and wanted further proof of Miles Atkinson's ability to pay—that was after we had done a lot of the work—the prisoner then intimated that the contract had been signed by Miles Atkinson, and pulled open a drawer, and showed a document lying there, and I saw Miles Atkinson on it; I cannot swear what it was, but I believe it was a contract; he did not take it out—my father asked him for Atkinson's address, as the one he had got was not sufficient; he refused to give it, saying he was his agent, and that he was not going to have his client bothered with letters—we were applying for money on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Scanlan and Hayes, builders, of Richmond—in the latter part of 1894, plans and specifications were shown to my partner, Hayes, for work at Northwood, and, in consequence, I went to see the prisoner on February 1st, 1895—we had had no previous dealings with him—the prisoner or Martin said the buildings at Northwood were to be for Miles Atkinson—the prisoner said Miles Atkinson was a very wealthy man, living at Blackheath, who could keep us building for years, and that he had a small estate somewhere in South London, I believe, for the erection of twenty-eight houses—I be<lb/>lieved and relied on those statements—I called at the prisoner's office on February 5th, and then entered into these two contracts to erect two pairs of houses, one pair at £1,000 and the other at £1,150, at Northwood—the signature of Miles Atkinson was not on them when I signed. (<hi rend="italic">The contracts were in the same form as that entered into by Eames.</hi>) I had no counterpart—I wrote to the prisoner for one, and received this letter of February 6th. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he would supply copies of the contracts on receipt of</hi> 10s. 6d. <hi rend="italic">each for the copies, and</hi> £2 2s. <hi rend="italic">for previous costs</hi>). I did not ask further for copies—I began to work as soon as possible, and carried out work to the extent of £250—I applied for £200; the worth of the work was £300, but we were entitled to £250, as we had carried the work higher than was specified for—after applying many times we got £40 on April 6th and £60 on May 10th—we went on with the work till about £250 was owing; we applied for the balance of the £200; we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189601130049"/>
               <p>were not entitled to more, as we had not got a second certificate—we have never had more than the £40 and £60—as we did not receive any more we refused to complete—we had done about £350 worth of work—I do not recollect seeing the prisoner when we applied for the balance; I went to the office many times; I saw Martin, the prisoner's manager, who said the money was all right, but that it was not paid because the prisoner was out of town—he was out of town whenever we called until we had the £40—the prisoner paid us the balance of £60, and then he said he should not pay more than £60 as the balance of that £100 was all we were entitled to; he or Martin had measured the plans, not the work, and according to their measurements we were not entitled to more—that was not correct—the contracts contain the usual clause to pay on the architect's certificate; the prisoner was to be the sole architect—he still repeated that Miles Atkinson was a man of means—I placed the matter in the hands of my solicitor, Mr. Knight Gregson, and ultimately took proceedings to recover the money; they are still pending—I have not been able to discover Miles Atkinson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw Miles Atkinson—neither the prisoner nor Martin told me they were dissatisfied with some of the work—I was not always present at the works—I did not know that one of the walls was built six inches out of plumb, or that the flues were wrongly built; I know now that one three-inch wall had been partly taken down; it was slightly wrong and had very slightly to be rebuilt; I did not know it was wrong till lately—we told the prisoner the joists were not up, but that they would be before the week's end, and he said the money would be there, but it was not—the joists were up before we got the completion of the £100; we had done extra work, and the prisoner said that would be sufficient to make up for the joists—we received the £60 perhaps a fortnight after the joists were up; we applied for pay perhaps three weeks before the joists were up, at the prisoner's suggestion—the district surveyor thought it would be better not to lay the drains till the houses were roofed in—I am not a builder myself—I cannot say if this agreement is similar to those we generally enter into—I never saw an agreement like this before—I do not think Mr. Hayes is here—I never saw the prisoner or heard of Miles Atkinson before we called on him—the prisoner did not show us anything by means of which I could gather that such a person as Miles Atkinson existed; my partner, I believe, made the necessary in<lb/>quiries in 1894.</p>

Mr. Pinchbeck told me the work was to be done for a very rich gentleman named Miles Atkinson, who lived at Blackheath—he said Mr. Atkinson had instructed him to accept my estimate—that was all that was said on that occasion, beyond making an appointment for next day, in conse<lb/>quence of which I called next day—on that day I entered into a contract, dated June 26th—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—at the time I signed this contract I do not think the name of Miles Atkinson was mentioned again, unless it was to reiterate what he had previously said—after receiving this letter of July 1st I had another interview with Mr. Pinchbeck before starting with the work—I told him I had not been able to find Miles Atkinson's address at Blackheath, and before I started the work I must have either a banker's or a solicitor's address—he was rather indignant at that, say<lb/>ing it was most unusual, but he would see what he could do, and he could even guarantee payment himself—I was not satisfied with his guarantee, and the following day his manager, Martin, took me to the office of Mr. Jellicoe, a solicitor and commissioner, Queen Victoria Street, Mansion House Chambers—I saw the name of Jellicoe on a plate—I had never seen Mr. Jellicoe before—I was introduced to him by Martin—I asked him if he had ever acted for Mr. Miles Atkinson in a legal capacity—he replied, "Yes, on many occasions"—I asked was Miles Atkinson a man of means—he replied, "Yes"—I asked was he a man who always honourably fulfilled his engagements—he replied, "Yes"—Martin introduced me to Jellicoe as a builder who was about doing some work at Northwood for Mr. Miles Atkinson—in consequence of the statement made to me by Jellicoe I went on with the work till about the 12th of August—I then applied for some money on account—at that time the roof was on ready for the slating—on August 12th I received this letter from the prisoner requesting the slating to be done at once, or someone else must be got to do it—at that time I had done work to the value of £235—after that letter I put the battens on to enable him to get the slating done—I then made further application for money—I saw Mr. Pinchbeck on one or two occasions only, he promised a payment within the next week or ten days—I did not receive payment—I called a great many times—I sent a surveyor down to measure up the work—the total amount of the work done altogether amounted to £248 in the one case, and £120 or £130 in the other; roughly speaking £278 on the, two—I did not get any of that money—from first to last I have not received a penny in respect of either of these contracts—it was never suggested by Pinchbeck at any of the interviews that I was not entitled to that money—I had completed the work with</p>

I am a member of the firm of Boyce and Sons, solicitors, 8, George Street, Hanover Square, London—I produce six leases from Kent Pinchbeck and Mr. Ellerby to Mrs. Pinchbeck; the first two are dated November 21st and 22nd, 1894, granted by Mr. Pinchbeck and the mortgagee, Mr. Ellerby, and apply to the plot of land known as 71, Hollowell Road, Northwood; those leases, split it up into 71A and 71B—the next two are dated April 16th and 17th, 1895, and apply to 70A and 70B, Hollowell Road; and the last two are dated April 23rd and 24th, 1895, and apply to 69A and 69B—Ellerby had a mortgage on the freehold—these six leases comprise the whole of the building plot at Northwood on which the builders who have given evidence did work—there is a pair of houses on 69, a pair on 70, and a pair on 71—the leases are for 99 years, reserving a ground rent of £10 a year for each house—from my own knowledge I can identify these houses as being those on which the builders worked—I acted for Mr. James Rickett, who made advances to Mr. and Mrs. Pinchbeck in respect of these leaseholds—Mr. Rickett took over Ellerby's and Armstrong's mortgages—the original mortgage to Ellerby was on the freehold, before the plots were divided and the leases executed—when we paid off Ellerby we took a fresh mortgage on the freehold from Pinchbeck—the ground rents had not been conveyed when the mortgage was granted to Ellerby; when he paid him off they had been—the ground rents were subsequently sold, and our mortgage on the freehold was paid off out of the purchase money—on these leaseholds the total advances to Mr. and Mrs. Pinchbeck were £1,700—we arranged with Pinchbeck that the limit of the advance was to be £700 a pair, and upon our architect's certificate—shortly before the first mortgage had been completed, the prisoner handed me this letter, dated May 23rd, 1895, as coming from Miles Atkinson—there had been previously a conversation in which the prisoner had stated that he con<lb/>sidered the value of these leaseholds to be £1,400 a pair; I told him that seemed to me very much more than their value, and at the next interview.

Jellicoe, solicitor, 16, King Street, Cheapside—I produce a conveyance, dated January 13th, 1895, of two freehold ground-rents of £10 each, arising out of two plots of land, described as 71A and 71B, Hollowell Road—Kent Pinchbeck was vendor, and Ellerby and Armstrong mortgagees, and the purchasers were Neal—it was a trust purchase—the consideration was £510—from the deeds and plans I see that the two plots, 71A and 71B, make up the piece of land described in the conveyance of 13th August, 1894, as 71—the ground was sold free from the mortgage; the two mort<lb/>gagees concurred—I produce this conveyance, relating to 70A and 70B, dated 30th September, 1895, for £510 between Kent Pinchbeck, Rickett, and Percy E. Beard, the purchaser—those two plots are Plot 70 in the conveyance of August, 1894—I produce this conveyance of 30th September, 1895, with reference to Plots 69A and 69B between Kent Pinchbeck, vendor; James Rickett, mortgagee, and James George Swan Taylor, purchaser, for £510—those two plots are the same as Plot 69 in the conveyance of August, 1894—that was an out-and-out sale—I have no recollection of ever hearing of Miles Atkinson in connection with these transactions.</p>

I am senior house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—on November 9th, about 12.15, Lynch was brought to me, bleeding very profusely—he was unconscious—he had a wound in the upper part of his chest, gaping wide; it went into his chest, in the direction of his heart—there was another wound on his abdomen, two inches long, upwards and inwards; it went under the skin, but did not penetrate the cavity of the abdomen; a wound on his side, three or four inches long, and one on his temple, which may have been caused by a fall, if he struck his head against something sharp—the five wounds could have been inflicted with this knife—his condition was dangerous; we did not think he would live through the night—he has been in the hospital ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence stated that Lynch attacked him, and they fought and felly and in the excitement he forgot that he had the knife in his hand, which he was using to cut a splint for his chestnuts. He denied saying that he would make Lynch's white shirt red, and said that Haynes did not say so before the Magistrates.</hi>

               <p>for 25,000 of them; he wished to know what I would charge for making a stamp or marking them with those letters—I said I could mark them if I fixed the stamp on a machine which I used for another pur<lb/>pose, at 7s. per 1,000—he said he would consult his partner, and let me know next day—he came next day and instructed me to get on with the stamp—I asked him for a written order—he said he had not brought one—I handed him this paper, which is one of Mr. Lugdon's billheads, on which he wrote, as it now appears, "James Ford, 22, Downham Road, Kingsland, N.E."—I wrote the words in pencil underneath, the lettering appearing rather indistinct on the brass-work—from that I supposed him to be the person he represented himself to be, and he left this brass with me—he said he would call in a few days with some of the brass-fittings he wished to get marked—the lettering was done by a man I employed, and I fitted the stamp (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the machine—on October 19th he paid me a deposit of 10s.—on the 26th October he had brought me 71/2 gross of these fittings in small quantities—he took them away when they were stamped—I have made this copy of a small leaf of my diary, which enables me to give the dates: on October 31st he received one gross; on November 2nd 11/2 gross, and paid another 10s.; on November 4th he received two gross one dozen; on November 11th one gross eight dozen; 15th, seven dozen; 22nd, six dozen; making fourteen gross ten dozen—sometimes he waited for them and sometimes called again—afterwards the police came, and I made a statement of what I could remember—I was shown some of the fittings, which I recognised as having stamped.</p>

I am manager of the Electrical and General Engineering Company, Leadenhall Street—I knew Attride by his applying for a vacancy as traveller in December, 1894—he told me he had been employed by Edison and Swan, and by the Electrical Company—he came again in July Or August, and offered some Edison and Swan holders for sale, with their stamp upon them—he quoted a price which was under the ordinary price, and I inquired how it was that he could sell them so cheaply—he said that a firm with whom he did business owed him some money, and as he could not get it, they handed over these holders as a sort of security against the debt, and, being anxious to get money, he offered them to us at the price mentioned—his explanation seemed satisfactory—I went thoroughly into the matter with him, and believing his statement, I bought two gross and six dozen on August 22nd, and paid him for them—they were sold in two lots—this is his receipt—I paid him £5 on account, and the balance of £21 by cheque afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">The holders were described as a job lot.</hi>) He brought some more Edison and Swan holders in November, and quoted a low price—I asked him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189601130061"/>
               <p>why it was so low—he said he got them from a bailiff's assistant, who employed half his time with the bailiff and half with Ingold, and that they were bought in job lots at sales—I purchased from him on that occasion 143 holders for £36 10s., and seventy-two on November 12th for £7 10s.—Attride, who had delivered some of Ingold's holders, called in November, and asked me to buy some holders—I said, "Where is Ingold?"—he said, "He is away travelling, and I want some money, I have a few holders to sell; will you buy them?"—he called three times; I refused to buy at the first interview, but at last I did—he said he was Ingold's servant—I said, "Are you a bailiff's assistant?"—he said, "Yes"—I bought half a gross of holders of him for £2 12s. 6d., marked "Edison and Swan;" this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is an open cheque, endorsed "James Ford"—these are two of the holders, the others are sealed up; I have not disposed of any of them.</p>

I am a clerk in the Edison and Swan Electric Light Company at their London office—I knew Ingold as an invoice clerk—he left their service in 1892, and went into the service of the Electrical Company, Charing Cross Road, who are licensees of Edison's patent—I met Ingold from time to time after he left; he was living at Ilford, and I at Walthamstow—at the beginning of 1895 I used to meet him at a public-house, 97, Moorgate Street; he told me he was receiving electrical holders from Germany, and getting them stamped with Edison and Swan's patent mark, and then sold them to different firms as genuine Swan holders—he asked if I would receive a parcel of holders from Mr. Freeman at my house at Walthamstow, and I consented—they were in the name of T. M. Findlay and Co., electrical and railway contractors, and there were almost immediately consigned to me 1,500 holders by Mr. Cramer in that name—these are some of the invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I brought them into the City to Ingold in parcels of about a dozen at a time—they were without a mark—I knew I was doing wrong—we took them to Putney and got them stamped by Cosgrave, who was in their employment, and then brought them to London, and left them at cloak-rooms of some of the railway stations, and they were called for as they were sold—Ingold Always took the ticket, unless I left them, and took the ticket afterwards—I did not leave any at the public-house at Moorgate Street, but some<lb/>times we left them at public-houses—the letters to Cramer were typed, and I signed them, "T.

Ingold received the money; I got £2 for receiving goods and about £8 besides—I was out of employ<lb/>ment, and still am so—I have always been a clerk—I received very nearly 4,000 holders from Cramer from time to time—I have been with Ingold to the cigar-shop kept by Pauline Pastori—holders were also consigned to Ryder and Co., of Wandsworth, Woodcock at Peckham, and Adamson at Clapham—I know Side and Edwards and Attride and Co.—there was no such firm as Walters and Co.—Ingold went to Cologne in August, and told me he had seen Cramer, and arranged to pay by bill, and he would send more goods—bills were sent to me, which I signed and sent back; this is one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was the acceptor—Cramer drew them on me—I accepted two, but I never paid them—as far as I know, Walters and Co. never paid any bill—Ingold told me that Ryder was his father-in-law; he did a little in the electro trade, selling lamps—when this had been going on for some time, Cosgrave was discharged from his employment—he used to take the stamp home from Pattesson and Cooper's to his house, and use it at night; but when he was dismissed he had not access to it—I introduced Attwright to Ingold at the beginning of October; he had nothing to do with electrical business—Ingold said that he would have a stamp made, and Ingold said that one had been made, and that he was getting holders stamped at a place in Old Street, and Attride was taking them there,</p>

Co., Limited"—the holders I refer to as stamped by Cosgrave were stamped under Marsden's directions, I understand—I do not know that Ingold said that he was going to see Cramer about payment; he said that he had to make arrangements that the thing should be met by a bill—I did not type any of the letters myself; he dictated them and got it done—Marsden was in the country when I informed on August 14th or 15th—I cannot explain why nothing was done till November after I informed—I introduced Ingold to Attride—I had been in communication with the Edison and Swan Co.—he did not suggest to me that I should take Ingold to somebody to receive goods—I have not suggested to anybody else that I would give anybody anything out of the £100. Ingold has not said to me that he would defy the Edison and Swan Co. to touch him; he said that he did not fear them, meaning that he would be able to get out of it—I be<lb/>lieve he thought they would bring a civil action against him—I have never discussed the Merchandise marks Act with him—I said at the Police-court, "I introduced Attride as a friend of mine to Mr. Ingold, in order that he might receive a parcel"—the parcel was goods from Germany, and I think it would contain holders—trapping Attride did not come out of my own head; Ingold suggested it—I was with Attride, and Ingold asked to be introduced—it was simply as you might introduce an <hi rend="italic">employed</hi> to an employer—I did not know at that time that a person who fraudulently applied a trade-mark was criminally responsible; I thought it was a case for a civil action.</p>

A number of our holders have been made in Germany from a pattern we supply—we are not obliged to make them to a certain pattern provided the essential elements of the patent are present—before our licence we bought them from the Edison and Swan Company and afterwards, but which are those particular holders I could not say—we pay a royalty of £100 a year to Edison and Swan—I consider we are entitled to get them from Germany—we have not received a remon<lb/>strance from Edison and Swan for so doing—it is a general custom of the trade—the holders had been made by myself and other people without taking out a licence—I was thus liable to an action—I agreed not to do so—the trademark, "Edi-Swan," was modified—I did not think it neces<lb/>sary to stamp the holders "Made in Germany"—I had an agent named Campbell—I had no difficulty with him—I knew nothing about Campbell selling holders at less than cost price—all I guarantee is that the royalty on the holders shall be paid, and that they are well made, and in accord<lb/>ance with the patents—I take care the holders are as well made as they can be in England—an expert might find something different, but the holders are practically undistinguishable from the holders Edison and Swan sell in England—anyone would say they are as good a holder as sold in the trade—they are perfectly good for the purpose for which they are made.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Defendant</hi>). I am an electrical en<lb/>gineer, employed by Cremer, of Cologne—I was with Edison and Swan; I tendered my resignation; they had a manufactory in Germany there as well—Cremer was with them in Germany—fifteen or eighteen months ago Marsden showed me in a book that a trademark must be a fancy word or a name printed in a particular manner, and that "Ediswan" was their trademark, and Edison and Swan was nothing at all, and if contested he would not mind fighting the matter out—Davidson was present at the interview—there were many interviews—I informed Cremer that I wanted holders made, and he promised to send the whole over here to be stamped—I stipulated that the trademark was to be "Edison and Swan," not "Ediswan"—they granted licences—I did not regard the words "Edison and Swan" as a trademark when I applied them—I was always pre<lb/>pared to meet Edison and Swan—last September Mr. Burgess, a clerk in the Edison and Swan Company, came to my house with a message from Mr. Moffat, of Edison and Swan, to come and see them at their London office—I went and saw Mr. Moffat; he offered me a lump sum of money if I would give information respecting licensees who were selling at more than 33 per cent.—he asked me not to stamp holders without a licence—I told him that in my opinion the licensees stamping "Edison and Swan" were using words which were not the trademark, and I refused to entertain his offer—all the bills due have been met except one—I gave my wife directions not to destroy any letter of Savory's, or anyone else's—there was no secrecy whatever; my wife frequently complained that there were holders in every room in the house—I employed Attride, and gave him 15s. weekly, but I only employed him from 9.30 to 3—he was a rough-rider—Sergeant Scott arrested me—I said that I was very sorry Attride was brought into it, as he was my servant at 15s. a week.</p>

               <p>did not tell him to pass himself off under the name of Ford—being my servant, I should have to take the consequences of any action against him—I knew he was using the name of Ford—I heard him say he and his partner had contracted to supply 25,000 of these, and should he get them in a different name—I told him for trade reasons he had better not get them all in my name, as, being Leon's rough-rider, he would be known—I did not go myself, because it was out of my way; I had not time to spare; it would take me about an hour—I did not know that he was out of employment and without means; I supplied him with 10s. a week—I know that Attride had apartments at 6, Richmond Road, Kingsland; I never went upstairs—Walters and Co. carried on business at Madame Pastori's—I got some 13,000 holders delivered here from Cologne; I did not have 3,000 at the time of my arrest, because the larger part were stamped—I left them at different cloak-rooms, as any commercial traveller would—I do not know that Cosgrave was in the employ of Patterson and Cooper; I know where he lived—I did not take an order to his house; I sent Ryder, my father-in-law—I did not have them fetched away in the morning—I did not know that this man was taking the stamp home at night and bringing it back in the morning—I was in the employ of the licensee—I swear that I never inquired who Cosgrave was; I never saw him till June 4th, Derby day—I do not know that he was in the employ some time, but at the end of December I think it was, Marsden told me that he and Cosgrave were to be discharged, and Marsden said he was very sorry about Cosgrave, because he did not know anything about the stamping—what he did was under direction—I swear that I did not know that they were being stamped by Cosgrave in the evening—I found that he was a working man employed by Patterson and Cooper; I did not then make inquiry about the stamping—I knew he was not under Marsden's direction, and I think it was about three weeks after that I saw him again—I knew that he was acting fraudulently as far as his employers were concerned, yet I went on just the same—I did not stamp because I had something else to do that is the only answer I can give—I represented to Mr. Bower that I employed a bailiff's man—that was spoken of as a joke; Mr. Bower must have known that—Attride took the part of the bailiff's man—I believe I told Attride what had passed between Mr. Bower and myself—Mr. Bower must have shut his eyes very close not to know that these things had forged marks on them—I don't suggest that he knew it, but the probability was that he did think so—I think he must have known so from the price—that was not the biggest order I had ever given; I had given orders for £1,500 before—I think this was the largest order I had put through Mr. P.; it was given me by Baxen<lb/>dale, of Manchester, a firm established before the commencement of this century—I can't say positively that I had made this jocular remark to Mr. Bower about the bailiff's man; I certainly believe that I did—it was a passing excuse—I was anxious that Mr. Bower, or any other customer, should not be involved in any action with Edison and Swan in the matter—I did not consider this to be a trade-mark—I did not know it was Patterson and Cooper's stamp for some time afterwards—I do not remember saying that I got the goods as security for a debt—I did not tell Mr. Bower so; I deny it entirely—Attride never seriously represented</p>

               <p>himself as anything but my servant—I sent him to Tucker because I had had a stamp made there before, last November twelve months; Edison and Swan's stamp—I went myself to Tucker on that occasion—I sent Attride to repeat a similar order, only altering the form of it—I expect he would know about that—I did not know anything about electric light—Tucker would know exactly what I should want—either Attride or I wrote these letters of Attride and Co.—I think the first one was written at Finlay's dictation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Alfred Day, of 76, Mill Road, Lewisham—I knew Mrs. Morgan, the prisoner's wife—she lived on the opposite side of the road. On the evening of December 20th, about twenty minutes to seven, I was in Mill Road, opposite the Mill House—I there saw the prisoner and his wife, they appeared to be quarrelling—I heard their voices; I only heard the woman say that she had been a good mother to the children—they walked along in the direction of the corner of the blank wall opposite the Mill House; a little further on I saw the pri<lb/>soner pull her down on to her knees; I then saw something glitter in his hand—he raised his hand, and struck her twice in the throat, across the neck—she got up off her knees, and ran toward a pony barrow that stood near the Mill—she struck against the pony barrow, took two or three staggers, and then fell on her face in the middle of the road—I did not notice what the prisoner did then—I ran to the Mill House door and raised an alarm—Mr. Catt, the manager, and three others came out—the prisoner was then standing at his wife's head, muttering something, I could not hear what it was; he appeared to be clasping something in his hand—I pointed him out to Mr. Catt—the prisoner walked away—I did not see him again that night—I saw that the woman was bleeding very much from the neck; she was making a very dreadful noise from the throat, a rattling in the throat—I left the prisoner there with Mr. Catt and the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, practising at 19, High Street, Lewisham—about quarter to seven on the night of December 20th, I was fetched to Mill Road, I there found the dead body of a woman lying on her back on the road; she had been dead only a few minutes—the clothes round her neck were soaked with blood from a wound on the left side of the neck—two days afterwards at the mortuary I made an examination of the body; it was well nourished and healthy—I examined the wound on the neck, it was about an inch in length and between three and four inches deep, its direction was downward, forward and inwards, just below the angle of the left lower jaw; it penetrated the external carotid artery and the internal jugular vein—there had been considerable loss Of blood—there were no other marks or wounds, with the exception of an abrasion of the right knee-cap, that was slight and recent—the wound in the neck was a clean cut wound—this knife was afterwards shown me; the wound could have been caused by it; it must have required considerable force; blood would have spurted either from the artery or the vein—on December 22nd I was shown the cuff of a coat—I found on it two small spots of blood—the marks on the knife I thought were blood marks—the cause of death was hæmorrhage from the wound.</p>

I met my wife to-night and asked her how we were going on. She said, Bill is coming along directly, and if you interfere with me he will kill you, then I let her go, and I out with my knife and stabbed it into her. I will pay my life for hers; but she was a good one. Bill has given me two black eyes, and that is after keeping him thirty-two years. I have had one or two half-pints now, but when I did it I was honest and sober"—he was then taken to the station, and put in the dock, and as he commenced to speak he was further cautioned by Detective Inspector Fox—he then said, "I went up to my daughter when I had done it, and they are the vagabonds who caused it. I have been sparring about ever since I done it. I will stand to it; I'll tell you straight. I said to her, 'What about the ones that are going to be married?' I had one or two words with her, and asked her to go to the Mid<lb/>Kent; that is a public-house just by the Lewisham Station—then I thought that Bill was coming along, and I thought, 'Here goes!' and how I did it I don't know, and I made no more to do, I jobbed the knife into, her neck, and dropped it to the ground"—next day he was taken before the Magis<lb/>trate, and made a statement in the Male Prisoners' Waiting Room—I had previously cautioned him not to say anything to me, but he said, "Have you found the knife?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I put it through, the railings at the approach to the Lewisham Junction, opposite the Mid-Kent public-house—it was a black-handled table-knife, with the top broken, off"—that is the knife produced by Sexton—the prisoner was wearing a coat when I arrested him—I took it off, and showed it to Dr. Barnett, together with the knife.</p>

My husband is a labourer—I went into this public-house on an errand and the prisoner asked me to have a glass of ale—they were quarrelling before I got down the street; I heard the noise and went back and they were fighting; there was a crowd outside—I saw the man lying on the ground with blood on his face—he was getting up and the prisoner was getting up too—I live in the same house and I know she was living with him—I had not heard them quarrelling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and am a hawker—the prisoner and prosecutor have been bad friends for some weeks; they quarrelled—Sheehan said that he did not want to live with her; he had a woman and was going to leave her—I was at the Police-court, but was not called—Sheehan came home on Saturday and gave her 15s., which was 10s. for his mother and 5s. for herself—his mother lives in the house—I heard him tell the prisoner to pack up her things; he was going—he went out and I heard no more till it occurred.</p>
