                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of No. 38, Fleet-street. On the evening of 30th Jan., about 6 o'clock, I was in Fleet-street—I stood for a few seconds at a window, looking at a placard—it was nearly opposite the police station, a little further up than St. Bride's Church—while I was there I felt something move at my left hand waistcoat pocket; there were several other persons apparently looking in at the window at the same time—immediately I felt the movement in my pocket I turned to my left, and the prisoner was right in front of me, and I saw his hand go from my waistcoat pocket, and the chain was hanging down—it was his left hand, it was clenched—he put it behind him—when I felt something pass from my pocket I immediately heard a click, as though a pair of pincers had clipped my chain through—I immediately seized him by the throat, a gentleman undertook to go for a policeman, and I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the prisoner into a passage close by until the policeman came—I charged him at once with stealing my watch—he said, "I have not got your watch, you may search me if you like"—the policeman came, and took him away—this is the chain I wore</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040002"/>
               <p>on that occasion, it was not cut; the bore of the watch was twisted off—I have never got the watch again—this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to it—the policeman produced it to me next morning—I had felt my watch safe a few minutes before; I am quite sure that I felt it go at that moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship's joiner, and live at No. 5, St. John-street, West Ham. On Saturday, 12th Jan., about 7 o'clock in the evening, I was with two friends, at a public house, in Addle-hill, and saw the prisoner standing in front of the bar—she came in to sell some oranges, I bought some, and we went into the tap room—after some time she came in there, and wanted me to buy some more oranges, and I bought all she had, about two dozen or more—I afterwards came out into the passage, and had a dispute with the landlord—while I was talking to him, the prisoner came into the passage, put her hand into my left hand trowsers pocket, and took my purse, containing eight sovereigns, and which I had seen safe ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before—I caught hold of her hand before she took it out, and held it till I took her into the taproom; but she must have slipped the purse from one hand to the other—I did not see her do it—I told my friend, John Manning, to go for a policeman, but before he went I saw the prisoner drop the purse under the table from her lap, and three sovereigns came out of it—I picked one up, and Manning picked up the other two, and went for a policeman—my other friend was named Alfred—he left before this happened—while I was picking up the sovereigns the prisoner threw a glass at my head, and struck me with a pewter pot—a policeman came, and took her in charge—I had picked the purse up from under the table, it then contained five sovereigns, a policeman took it from me at the station—that was the first public house I had been to that day, and I had only had two or three glasses of ale.</p>

I am a joiner, of No. 4, Plaistow-grove East, West Ham—I was with Hosking in front of the bar, and asked the prisoner how she sold her oranges—Hosking went into the taproom, and I stopped there till I had drank my glass of ale—I did not ask the prisoner to follow me into the taproom with her oranges—words arose between Hosking and the landlord in the passage when I was at the bar—I went out to them—I passed between them, told them I would have no disturbance, and tried to put an end to it—the prisoner was in the passage, and Hosking cried out that he was robbed—he had hold of her hand, and dragged her into the taproom—I followed them, and one sat down on one side of the table, and the other on the other; the prisoner dropped a purse, and three sovereigns dropped from it—Hosking did not continue to hold her when they sat on each side of the table—I told him that the prisoner had dropped the money, he picked up one sovereign, and I picked up two—while he was doing so the prisoner threw a tumbler, which struck him on the head, then hit him on the head with 4 pint pot, and then threw it at him—she had no appearance of being in liquor—Hosking was not in liquor, I think he had had about two glasses of ale—he had come from Doctors' Commons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, and lodge at No. 3, Old Norfolk-street, Stepney. This brown coat belongs to Mr. M'Dowell, he is the housekeeper—this piece of Coburg cloth is mine, it has my mark upon it—I left it on a shelf in the shop on the Sunday morning at half past 10 o'clock—when I went out, I left the house in charge of Mrs. M'Dowell—I returned about half past 9 o'clock at night, and then found my property in charge of the police.</p>

I met the prisoner in Farringdon-street, and he told me he had been to Richards and Co. to endeavour to get them to give him a reference, and that they would not do so, unless he could satisfy them that he had, as he had been telling them, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he commenced business at Chatham six months previous; and that the only way he could satisfy them was to refer to his old father who had given him the money, and he said, "I have done so, and they are going to write down to night"—he said that he had given his father as a farmer at Ullesthorpe, and he must write down that night to the post master, and direct him to take the letter to his father, who is a butcher, as there was a farmer in Ullesthorpe, named Stevenson, and the letter would go there; and he wrote the letter in my presence, and said that he should go down to Ullesthorpe and endeavour to get his father to answer the letter, and if he did not do it he should then answer it himself—he wished me to return to Chatham that day, and I asked him for some money,—he gave me!1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said, "You can go back to Chatham"—I said, "I prefer waiting in London; I will wait till I hear from you"—and I waited for about a fortnight—he then came to me, and I told him I thought I had lost him, not hearing of him, and asked him how he got on—he said that the old man was ready to kick him out of doors for asking him to answer the letter from Richards and Co.—I said, "You did not do it yourself, then?"—he said, "Certainly not"—I asked him what he intended to do, and told him he was in a terrible scrape respecting a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which was coming due on the 19th, which he had drawn on his brothers, and cautioned him that it must be met—he merely made a laugh of it, and said that it would be all right, and he was then going to Mr. Duckworth to endeavour to get another bill cashed for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and he told me the day after, that he could not succeed—that was on 5th Dec.—I asked him what he intended to do, he said that his wife had been persuading him to go down among her friends, and tell them what he had done respecting this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I asked him what he was going to do—he said that he was going down home, and he thought he should sell off all that was left, and take a situation as farm servant—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 125, Wood-street, Cheapside. I am manager of the South London India-rubber Company, which is also known under the name of Richards and Co.—I first saw the prisoner at the end of Sept or the beginning of Oct., when he purchased some goods for ready money, and after going on for some time we allowed him a small monthly account—we have trusted him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when this had gone on for some time we received a reference from Spence, Bagallay, and Co., and one to Neville, Jordaine, and Co., but did not entertain it—those parties applied to us and also Morley Nephews, and Anstead, and Devass and Co.—those are all large wholesale warehousemen—in consequence of being referred to, I sent for the prisoner about 17th or 18th Nov., and told him that we had been referred to by Spence, Bagallay, and Co., and that he ought not to have done so without first consulting me, and that if he wished us to give Spence and Bagallay a reference he must inform me how long he had been in business at that house, and the amount of his capital—he said that he had been in business about six months, and had a capital of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he started—I said that it would be necessary for him to satisfy us by other means that he had that capital—he first referred to Mr. Duck<lb/>worth, but I was not satisfied with that, and a day or two afterwards I required a further reference—he referred me to his father, who he said was a farmer at Ullesthorpe in Leicestershire—he gave me the address, and I wrote it down in his presence in the diary—I wrote to the address he gave, and received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on, I believe, the following day—I cannot find the envelope, but it had the Ullesthorpe post mark on it—it was addressed to our firm—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Nov. 2nd, 1855.

Yours respectfully, James Stevenson ")—on that I communicated with the gentleman from Spence, Bagallay, and Co.—I have seen Etches at our warehouse—I think it must have been about the middle of Dec.—he made a communication to me about the prisoner at that time, and I, in consequence, took some steps, and went to the prisoner's shop at Shadwell, after which he came to our counting house—that was about the latter end of Dec.—I had a conversa<lb/>tion with him, the purport of which was that we had been informed that the letter purporting to come from his father was not in his father's writing, and requested him to enable us to satisfy ourselves whether it was so or not—he said, "You have already written to my father, and here is the letter," taking the letter out of his pocket," and if you write again, my father will send your letter to me, and will not reply to you"—we had written again in order to test whether it was the father's writing—he also said that if I sent down any person from Messrs. Devass's house, he had left word with his father to set the dogs on us—I then pressed him, if he had any respect for his position as a tradesman, to enable us to satisfy ourselves that the letter was genuine—he treated it in an off-hand way, and left the warehouse.</p>

Q.</hi> When that took place was the prisoner going to Chatham? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—the goods he took in the cab were five half pieces of flannel, and three pieces of lining; that was all—they were worth between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those were the only goods that were removed in the fortnight—whatever other articles went, were sold in the ordinary course of business to customers—I should say, at a rough guess, between 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods were taken from the shop when the officers came in—I cannot say how much had been obtained—I had bought about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I under<lb/>stood that the officers also cleared the shop at Chatham, but I was not there—these flannels and linings were the sort of things that would be sold at Chatham—I never saw the prisoner's wife but once before the prisoner was taken into custody—she had nothing to do with the business that I was about to start at Shadwell—no directions were given to me to get rid of goods in any way, except in the ordinary course of business—I was engaged in London—I had been in the same sort of employment for twenty years before, with Messrs. Dent, Sewell and Cross, and others—I gave the pri<lb/>soner my reference, he had the opportunity of ascertaining that I had been in respectable employment, and bore a good character—some few claims were made for payment while I was there, they were always met—from the short time we were open, I should say the business would have got on well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Robinson Coppin, of No. 9, Munster-square, Regent's-park. On 26th Dec. last, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw from six to seven persons round the prosecutor, in Little Charles-street—the prisoners are two of them—I saw Everson jump on Mr. Walker's back, and I saw Saunders come away from Mr. Walker with part of a guard chain hanging through his fingers—I saw it, it looked like a gold watch chain; it was in his left hand—I said to him, "You have got that man's watch"—I repeated it three times—he made no answer, but turned his head on one side, and went round the square—I saw some of them, I can<lb/>not say which, knock the prosecutor's hat over his eyes; I should say there were full eight of them surrounding him—I had seen Saunders before in the neighbourhood—I am sure the prisoners are two of the men.</p>

On 26th Dec., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners in Little Charles-street—I saw from six to eight young men come in a direction from a public house in Frederick-street, but I did not see them come out—three of them went up to the prosecutor, Saunders put his left hand under Mr. Walker's arm, and took something from his pocket—he had not his back to me, he was sideways—they turned him round by leaping on his back—Saunders was the first that came away from the mob, and I saw</p>

               <p>part of a guard through his fingers as he drew his hand back—Mr. Walker's hat was knocked over his eyes, but I could not tell who did it—I have seen Saunders before, but do not remember seeing Everson till the day of the robbery—I am quite sure that they are two of the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Truby, we keep a beer shop, the Brickmakers' Arms, at North Hyde, in the Precinct of Norwood. On Monday night, 21st Jan., the prisoner came in a little after 6 o'clock—he called for a pint of beer, I served him—he had another pint of beer, one before Price came, and one after he came—the prisoner was quite sober—Price came in; I knew him, he had been in my house twice before—he came in with two men, Tripp and Johnson—when Price came in the prisoner was sitting on the left hand side of the fire, in the taproom—Price was tipsy—he called for a pot of beer—I demurred about drawing it, but at last I did, and he paid me with a shilling—he drank some of it, and oflered the others some—I then went to the bar, and I afterwards returned to the taproom—Price was then sitting in the chair by the right hand side of the fire—he began to say to the prisoner, "You villain, you rascal; I have been to your mother's and asked for a pint of beer, and she had not got any"—the prisoner said, "I cannot help it, sir, I wish I could; I would fill my mother's cellar</p>

               <p>full of beer if I could"—Price called him a b——, and said, "You have got a good mother"—the prisoner said, "I know I have, and well I love her"—Price kept calling him a b——; the prisoner said, "I don't want to have anything to say to you, you are quite a stranger;" and he turned away from him—Tripp was in the house—I left and went to the bar, and Tripp came out after me, and went round the corner—I left Price and the pri<lb/>soner together—after that I and my daughter went to supper—my husband came to the bar to me, and asked for a pipe—while I was there, I heard a blow, and the taproom table moved against the settle—that was a little before 9 o'clock—on hearing that I went to the taproom door—my daughter was behind me—about that time Tripp returned while I was at the tap-room door, which was open; I saw Price sitting down on the floor in the taproom against the table with his nose bleeding—the prisoner was sitting in the same place in the taproom where he was before—Tripp went to Price and tried to lift him up; he could not, and my husband assisted him—Tripp asked for a cloth to wipe the blood from Price's nose—when he and my husband raised Price, I did not hear him speak, but I heard him make a snoring noise as though going to sleep—Tripp wiped his face, and I saw I a scar over bis left eye—there was a little blood on his face—he was placed in a corner, so that he should not fall either way—I remained with him—my husband said, "What shall we do with him?"—Tripp went home in about half an hour after this occurrence—Price moved about, and made a noise—I did not hear him speak—I said to my husband, "What shall we do with this man?"—my husband said he could do no more, shut him in the taproom, and let him be—I said, "When he has had a good sleep per<lb/>haps he may wake up and go home"—we were waiting about from ten minutes before 10 till 12 o'clock—he remained in that condition—the pri<lb/>soner was in the taproom all this time—I was close to Price—I looked at him at 12 o'clock, and said to my husband, "What shall we do, wake this man up and let him go home?"—he went to him to wake him up, he could not perceive that he moved at all—the prisoner went up and shook him to wake him—he said, "I can't make any sense of him"—I went to him, and I said, "O dear, dear, dear! I think he is dead!"—the prisoner said, "I hope not; I hope not"—I ran up stairs and alarmed the house, I came down and sent for the doctor, or the policeman, or any one they could find—the doctor is Mr. Leese—my husband and the prisoner went for him, and a man named Jones, a lodger—Mr. Leese came as soon as he got dressed—I asked the prisoner how this happened, and he said the man hit him first, and he returned the blow—there is a table in the taproom, and an iron rim round it, which stands up higher than the wood, because the wood has been scrubbed away, and is lower than the iron rim—there was blood on the iron rim.</p>

On Monday, 21st Jan., I, and Price, and Johnson, met at the Jolly Brickmakers, kept by a widow lady, named Slingsby—we went from there to the Brickmakers' Arms—I found the prisoner there, sitting on a chair by the fireside—Price did not appear to me to be tipsy—he walked very well to the house, which is about half a mile from the Jolly Brickmakers—he called for a pot of beer—he began to upbraid Smith for his bad conduct to his mother—I left and went to the sink, and when I came back Mrs. Truby was there, and Price was lying on the floor with his coat off, bleeding from the nose and face—I said, "What is the matter now? what are you up to now? I hope you have not hit this old gentleman; if I thought you had, I would hit you"—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Norwood-green, about a mile from the Bookmakers' Arms. I was called up about 1 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, 22nd Jan., by the prisoner and Truby—I went to Truby's house as soon as I could dress—I was shown into the taproom—I saw the body of a man lying on the floor—he was quite dead—there was very little heat indeed about the stomach, and some part of his chest—there was blood about his face, and a good deal of congealed blood in his nostrils—there was a wound over the nose, and a clean incised wound on the inner angle of the eyebrow, quite down to the bone—it had ceased to bleed—there was merely some little clotted blood about it—it appeared as if it had been inflicted by something sharp—I went the next morning, and I noticed there was an iron rim round the table, which projected in some places, where the wood was worn away, about the sixteenth part of an inch—the wound could have been occasioned by a person falling against it; and there was a fender shown me in the room, which might have occasioned it—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body forty hours afterwards—I examined the head, chest, and abdomen—that incised wound going down to the bone did not go into the orbit—it did not seem of great importance—there was an extensive swelling behind the ear, which seemed to have been inflicted by something very hard—I think that could have been done by a blow from a fist—that had nothing to do with the cut on the nose—it was on the same side—the cartilage of the nose had been smashed—the integuments of the scalp were much filled with blood, and other parts as well—there was a sudden arrest of the circulation in the membranes of the brain—either a fall or a blow would occasion that—there was a good deal of serum in the ven<lb/>tricles of the brain—that might have arisen from the man having drunk a great deal—I think a blow would have assisted that—I examined the body—the lungs were perfectly healthy, and did not contain blood—the heart contained a good deal of blood on the right side—there had been a sudden arrest of the circulation—the stomach was healthy—the kidneys were con<lb/>gested, which might have been caused by drink—I should think a fall or a blow occasioned his death—he was in very good health, and had a great quantity of fkt—there were no internal causes which would have caused his death.</p>

On Christmas day I was at Mr. Burton's, in the Minories, with my husband, the two Mr. Marleys, the prisoner, and his wife—we went there about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—we all of us re<lb/>mained there all night—the females retired to bed about half past 2 or 3 o'clock, the men sat up—we had been playing at cards before we went to bed—there had been some drinking, there were spirits provided—we got up before 9 o'clock in the morning to breakfoat—I saw the prisoner in the morning, I saw him leave the room to go to the warehouse, he wished me good morning, that was about 9 o'clock in the morning—he was employed in the East India warehouse, in Leadenhall-street—he and his wife lived at No. 10, Selby-street East, Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green—the two eldest children of the prisoner were stopping at my house—I went with Mrs. Corrigan to my house, as she wished to go, and we took their children with us, and mine also, from there to Mrs. Corrigan's—we got to her house about half past 2 or 3 o'clock—while we were sitting there talking, the prisoner came to the window and looked in—he looked very cross—he was in the</p>

               <p>street, the window was not open—some one opened the door to him, and he came into the room—he said to his wife, "Where have you been?"—she said she had been with me to look after the other children—he said, "You might have come home and looked at the baby first"—I said the baby was all right; and there were other persons present who said the baby was all right, and had been very good—he was cross for some time—I almost forget what he said, there were some other words between them—he said he would have his tea at home—I advised him to have tea at Mr. Bur<lb/>ton's, as Mr. Fearon was waiting there for us—he objected to it for some time, but afterwards he agreed to it—he said he would prefer having his tea at home, but the children were playing with some fruit, and I advised him to leave them as they were very good, and go to Mr. Burton's; at last he said, "Very well, I will have a wash and go"—we all three then left the house—I was rather before them—we went on foot to Whitechapel, it rained very hard, and the prisoner said, "Are we to get wet? shall we have a <hi rend="italic">cab?</hi>"—we had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and rode in it to Mr. Burton's house—the pri<lb/>soner appeared rather cheerful till we got to Mr. Burton's house, and then the horse shied, and nearly turned us over; and the prisoner never offered to save us, which seemed very remarkable for him—we jumped out while the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was going on, but he never put out his hand to save us—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was not quite overturned—we all got out—it was about 4 o'clock, or a little after, when we got to Mr. Burton's; we first went into the sitting room where the tea things were prepared, all three of us—Mrs. Corrigan and I directly left the sitting room to go into the bed room, to take our wet clothes off—we left in the sitting room Mr. and Mrs. Burton, the two Mr. Marleys, Mr. Fearon, and the prisoner—the bed room is on the same floor as the sitting room, a small passage divides them—we did not shut the bed room door—we had not been in the bed room a minute when I observed the prisoner come on to the landing which separates the two rooms—I was speaking to his wife—there is a gate at the top of the stairs, which shuts with a spring, to prevent the children from falling down the stairs; it is on the first floor, above the parlour—I thought the prisoner was opening that gate, because there was a sound like the gate clicking—I did not know what it sounded like, but I thought he was opening the gate—the deceased said, "Who is that?"—no answer was given—I said, "Who is that? is that you, <hi rend="italic">Tom?</hi>"—by <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> I meant the prisoner—the passage was rather dark, he made no answer, but came into the room, walking hastily—I was standing close to commenced striking her—I rushed towards them and tried to separate them, but I could not, the prisoner had his back towards me—he was rather to the left, the deceased was more to the right, I put up my hands and felt a slight pain in my arm, I did not notice it for the moment, but still kept screaming out for help—I began screaming for help directly the prisoner began to strike his wife—I felt that my hand Mrs. Corrigan—he separated me and Mrs. Corrigan, and threw her towards the child's bed—I rushed up to them, and said, "What do you mean; what are you doing?"—he then threw her on to the child's bed, and commenced striking her—I rushed towards them and tried to separate them, but I could not, the prisoner had his back towards me—he was rather to the left, the deceased was more to the right, I put up my hands and felt a slight pain in my arm, I did not notice it for the moment, but still kept screaming out for help—I began screaming for help directly the prisoner began to strike his wife—I felt that my hands were wet, I looked at them and found they were all over blood—I became alarmed and rushed out of the room—Mrs. Corrigan began to scream directly the prisoner began to strike her—she was lying on the bed with her face uppermost, and he appeared to be striking her about the body, I could not say where, with his right hand—I was not aware that he had anything in his hand—I was so frightened that I rushed down stairs—Mr. Marley overtook me on the staircase—I told him what had happened, and rushed down stairs towards Mr. Cook's, the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Burton, and live in Church-street, Minories. Mrs. Fearon is my sister—Mr. and Mrs. Corrigan came to our house on Christmas day, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I did not observe anything particular about the prisoner when they came in; he ap<lb/>peared very cheerful and happy—after tea there was gin and water and brandy and water taken—I left the room, I think, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, or it might have been later; I do not exactly remember; it was at the same time as Mrs. Fearon left—the prisoner was very dull when we left—he looked very dull from 11 o'clock; I remarked to his wife how dull and excited he looked, and she said he well might, for he had been drinking for some months—I did not exactly remark him when I left, I only remem<lb/>ber that he looked dull, and, I believe, intoxicated—I saw him about a quarter to 9 o'clock next morning, up and dressed, ready for business—I saw him for about ten minutes at that time, he had to hurry off to business—he took two cups of cocoa before he left; he took it standing, as he was</p>

               <p>supper they were about to retire, but it being wet I persuaded the females to go up stairs to bed, instead of going out into the wet—there was some drinking going on during the night, but not more than you would find in the most rational society that was ever formed—the prisoner breakfasted hurriedly in the morning—I saw him drink some cocoa, I believe—I do not think I spoke to him—he was hurried to get to business, and stood with the cup in his hand while I passed from one room to the other—he did not appear intoxicated then—I cannot say that he was intoxicated when the females retired to rest, but he looked remarkably strange at some part of the night, after the females had retired—I saw him again somewhere about half past 2 o'clock, that same day—he came up stairs at my house, and said, "Where is my mistress?"—I said, "In the other room," but she was not there—he then left the house, and I saw no more of him until about 4 o'clock, when they came in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not see Mrs. Fearon and Mrs. Corrigan go into the bedroom—the prisoner came into the adjoining room, the sitting room—the first thing of any importance that I heard was some screaming—that was two minutes, or not so much after the prisoner had come into the room, it was what a person would call immediately.</p>

I remember the day after Christmas day—when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came that afternoon, I opened the door, and saw the prisoner, his wife, and Mrs. Fearon—they went up stairs into the sitting room—I saw the prisoner in the sitting room afterwards—I saw him cross the landing place from the sitting room to the bedroom—I saw him part his wife from Mrs. Fearon, as she was untying his wife's bonnet—I then screamed out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the Minories. On Wednesday evening, 26th Dec., I went with Mr. Burton to Aldgate Church, and saw the body of Mrs. Corrigan—I did not see her at my surgery—she had been removed from there to the Church—she had then been dead about two hours—I examined the body, and found three wounds, one on the top of the left shoulder, about an inch and a half in length, and about half an inch deep; one on the inner side of the shoulder, about an inch long, and super<lb/>ficial; and the third on the inner and upper part of the left breast; that was about an inch long, and in depth to the breast bone—I traced that wound with a probe, and found that the instrument had entered the cavity of the chest—by the direction of the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation of the body—continuing my investigation of the wound, I found that the instrument had struck the bag that covers the heart—I laid it open, and then came to the heart itself—I found in it a longitudinal wound,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040038"/>
               <p>about half an inch long, and nearly a quarter of an inch in depth; which wound was the cause of death—they were such wounds as might have been occasioned by a knife of this kind—it would require some force to make a knife penetrate to that part of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had not known any of the parties until you were called in on this unhappy occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the disease called <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> is the result of a constant habit of drinking—I think it is a disease which generally gives signs of its coming for hours before—it depends upon the stage of the disease whether it produces entire delusion—it does in extreme cases produce entire delusion upon every subject—it is generally the case that when a person has been subject to attacks of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, a very little will excite another attack—a swollen appearance about the pupil of the eye would be one of the signs of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—it is gene<lb/>rally one of the symptoms—it shows the state of the brain—I mean the swollen appearance of the eyelid—a fulness and prominence of the eye is indicative of the state of the brain—I am speaking of a swollen appearance of the eye itself—a swollen and wild appearance of the eye is one of the indicia of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I have seen cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—a thick perspiration on the face or lip is an indication of it—it is mentioned by writers as a strong indication of it—there is an extreme state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> which is decided insanity—that is the cane where a man requires five or six persons to hold him down and control him—he is perfectly unconscious of what he says or does; and when he recovers, if you ask him if he is cognizant of anything he said or did, he will tell you he was not aware of it—some kinds of insanity may be cured, even such insanity as, while it lasts, prevents a person from knowing the' difference be<lb/>tween right and wrong—there are forms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> in which a person does not know the difference between right and wrong—unless I saw a patient while under a fit of that kind, I should not be able to tell from any description.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have been labouring, upon a previous occasion, under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, what effect would drinking all night have upon him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have a tendency to throw him into the same state—the drink would reproduce it—<hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> follows upon drunkenness—it often occurs after a person has been drinking exces<lb/>sively that taking away the stimulant will produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—sometimes a fit of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> lasts for days, at other times but for hours—it all depends upon whether you are able to procure sleep—if you procure sleep, the disease generally subsides at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does a person labouring under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> from intoxication of necessity not know right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not necessarily, I think—it may come on during intoxication, during excessive drinking, and it may also come on by the stimulus being withdrawn—a great deal depends upon the consti<lb/>tution—an attack generally comes on within about twenty-four hours after the stimulant has ceased—I find persons suffering under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> labouring under delusions, and expressing those delusions—if a man had been drinking at night, and went to his business in the morning with nothing the matter with him, <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> might come on the same afternoon, if he had been drinking excessively the night before, and been in want of sleep and rest.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if a man had been drinking much the night before, <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> might come on the following day, although he had exhibited no symptoms of it in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although he had exhibited no signs of delusion in any way whatever, will you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it might come on after excess—delusion is a part of the effect of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremena</hi>—after the disease is set in and established, then delusion is manifest—I have seen several cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I have remarked in extreme cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> that there is an absence of the knowledge of right and wrong; for instance, I go and find a man requiring five or six persons to hold him down, and prevent his doing himself some bodily harm, and everything he says and does is inconsistent—generally in <hi rend="italic">delirium tremena</hi> the party who com<lb/>mits an act of violence is labouring under the delusion that somebody is about to hurt him—that is a very frequent delusion—I have met with a case where a man would fancy that the police were after him, and he would jump out of bed suddenly, and go the window, and break a pane of glass, and endeavour to get out, and if there had not been some one there to prevent him he would have thrown up the window, and precipitated him<lb/>self into the street—there would be a plain indication of delusion in that case—violent excitement from drink very much simulates a weak state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—a man who is very intoxicated would have symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, but not all the symptoms—he would probably be very violent—you often see a man intoxicated in the street, requiring five or six policemen to take him to the station house, but that man is conscious nevertheless, and there is no tendency to injure himself—want of conscious<lb/>ness is one of the symptoms in extreme cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium trement</hi>—I never saw the prisoner until he was at the police court.</p>

Do not pay any money out of that trifle I left you; please God, they will be able to get up a benefit at the theatre, or some other place, and I expect there will be 61. allowed for the funeral.

               <p>Betsy, if you knew the anguish of my mind, I have no rest night or day now that I have come to my senses. Oh! Betsy, save me a lock of my poor Louisa's hair; now that she's gone, I would give anything to undo what I have done. Be kind to my poor helpless children, and the great God, that I trust in for mercy for my crime, will reward you. When you come up with my shirt, bring my blue waistcoat, and take the one I have got on away with you; you must get the most you can upon it for the children; also a collar or two, and my black necktie: if you can carry baby with you I should be glad to see her. Oh! Betsy, forgive me for what I have done, and beg of your father to do so too; none of your feelings, bad as they are, can be like mine, as I am the cause of all If you cannot come to<lb/>morrow, you cannot come till Monday; when, if you will bring a little butter with you, I shall be glad. Give my love to my poor father and sisters, and accept the same for yourself, from your heart broken and wretched brother-in-law. You most try and come at 12 o'clock.")—(" House of Detention, Friday night. My dear Mrs. Fearon,—In the midst of my dreary solitude I write to you, to beg you will forgive me for the injuries I inflicted upon you in my madness of Wednesday, though I honestly feel assured you believe they were accidental; but, my God, if I had wounded you in a vital part, as well as my wife, what would have been my torture to know that I had committed two murders. Let me beg of you to forgive me for the harass of body and mind I have caused you, and also Hannah, and your sister Lucy; tell them that I hope their fates may be happier than mine; give my kindest and best respects to them both; ask them not to hate me; tell them that I would not deliberately hurt a worm, either drunk or sober, much less go so blood thirsty to work as to buy the knife in cool blood to murder a woman. Little did I think when I bought it what would become of it; but it is done, and may God have mercy upon me for it. Give my respects to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, and all who inquire after me. Thank them for their interest in my behalf. If you have an oppor<lb/>tunity, can you see <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and ask him to exert himself about a counsel for me as soon as possible. I have written to <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Rose. I have never been very backward in assisting others, and among them all something may be done, but do not have Pelham; have somebody better than him: have a counsel for criminal cases, and send him to me before Thursday, so that he may meet the case at Arbour-square on Thursday morning, if possibla I will en<lb/>deavour to collect my energies together, and pray to God to give me strength to go through it all. Pray for me too; none of us know what hangs over our heads; who would have thought on Christmas night I should have been here now. Good bye, God bless you, and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, and Hannah, Lucy, <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi>, and all of you. I can be seen any day, except Sunday, from 12 till 2 o'clock by two friends.

               <p>Roffey—they were in bed at the time we knocked, but another lodger came and opened the door—we asked if Mr. Roffey lived there; they said, "Yes"—we saw Roffey; he had the appearance of having been in bed—we told him we were two police officers, and he was charged with being one of three persons who had been in Mr. Cropland's house in Fenchurch-street, about 8 o'clock on the previous evening; he said, "I know nothing about it, I was down at Dockhead at that time"—I told him to get his clothes, and they were brought to him—on taking him to the station, after we had told him we had Greenland in custody, he said, "Now you have Greenland and me, you had better find Daniels"—I do not think Daniels' name had been mentioned in his presence before he mentioned it—he said we might find Daniels at 8 o'clock the next morning at a public house in Russell-street—I think he named the public house, the Coopers' Arms—we went there next morning, we did not find Daniels there, but at his house, No. 5, Rowland's court, where his father and mother live—we told him he was charged with being one of three persons who were concealed in Mr. Cross<lb/>land's house, and beating his housekeeper—he said he knew nothing at all about it—his mother said he was at home at 8 o'clock in the evening—that was the hour that was mentioned—he said, "Mother, the gentlemen are right; I was one of the three that were there"—he said there were two of the boys at Mr. Grassland's concerned in it as well—he said they let them in, and one of their names was Toone and the other <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>—this pair of boots was found on Greenland.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living at Mr. Sims' office, No. 45, Elgin<lb/>crescent, Paddington-road—Mr. Sims is my master. On 23rd Dec. he was repairing the house of Mr. Alexander Rea Thompson, in Paddington-road—I was pot in charge of the house, and of Mr. Thompson's goods—it was my business to sleep there—about 7 o'clock on the evening of 23rd Deo. I left that house by the front door—I shut the door, and fastened it with a spring lock—I went to my own house—I returned a little before 9 o'clock the same evening—I was very poorly, and I got another watchman—I returned with Jeffery, and on applying the key to the street door, I found it was fastened on the inside—I staid outside, and sent Jeffreys round to the back of the house—I heard him, when he was inside, call out, "<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, here is one; and I think there is another gone up stairs"—I said, "Open the door"—he opened the front door, and I saw the prisoner just behind the door; Jeffery had got hold of him, and he delivered him to me—the prisoner struggled very violently—Jeffery went to look over the house—I asked the prisoner how he came there—he said he had just come from Reading, and he came there for a night's lodging—I asked him how that hole came there—there was a hole cut through the brick wall, leading from the hall to the drawing room—it was large enough for a man to get through from the hall into the drawing room—he said it was not him—I searched him, and took from his pocket a chisel, and put it into my own coat pocket—I found a couple of little sash lines laid down close by him, and there was a jacket lying on the bricks where the hole had been cut—he said the jacket was not his—he afterwards asked me to let him put that jacket on—I then left him in custody of Jeffery, and I went over the house—I went into my bed room and found the things all strewed about the place—I</p>

About 9 o'clock at night, on 23rd Dec. the last witness called on me, and in consequence of what he said I went to the back part of Mr. Thompson's house—I found the window of the billiard room half open, sufficiently to admit the body of a man—I went through into the hall, and found the prisoner behind the door—he had two window blinds under his arm—I opened the front door, and gave him in charge of the last witness—on searching the house I found the prisoner's shoes in the billiard room—he afterwards put them on—he was taken to Mr. Sims's, and given into custody.</p>

I am surgeon of the G division, I live at No. 63, Bunhill-row—I saw Mr. Chopping, the prosecutor—the Magistrate gave directions that I should examine him, and the prisoner was remanded—the last time I saw him was on Monday morning—he was very ill, and not able to leave his bed—he would not be able to come here to day, certainly, not without risk of his life—his illness arises from the extreme injury his head had sustained from this blow—erysipelas had supervened, but that had gone off, and he had an abscess on the right temple—it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post<lb/>office. The prisoner was employed there as a labourer, in the vaults, and to carry books to and from the Money Order-office—on 7th Feb. he was so employed, and I was on duty there, and, about half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon, saw him leave, with a bag containing something which looked very heavy—he went up Newgate-street—that is away from the Money Order-office, which is in Aldersgate-street—I followed him, stopped him in Newgate-street, and asked him what he had got—he said, "Some books"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "I am going to take them to the printer's; I am sent by Mr. Dobson"—I asked him to let me look at them—he did so, and they were books of this description (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were about twelve—I opened one of them, and he pointed out the difference between the two, and said he was going to take them to have a set printed from them—the covers were on them then, and the numbers on the backs—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040055"/>
               <p>said, "I would rather you would go back with me to Mr. Dobaon, or come to the printer's," so I let him go, and returned to the Poet-office, and saw Mr. Dobson—in consequence of what he told me, I went after the prisoner, and found him at the Fulham-bridge public-house, Brompton, about 8 or 9 o'clock, the same evening—I asked him where the books were which I had stopped him with in Newgate-street—he said, "I have got them at the vaults; if you will come back with me I will show you"—I searched him, and went with him to Aldersgate street, where I had arranged to meet the foreman of the labourers—I gave him half a pint of beer, and said, "Now come along with me, and show me where the books are"—he said, with an oath, "I will not go with you"—I said, "You said that you would go with me"—he said, "You have no business to ask me any questions about it; it is not your duty"—I took him to the station, and next day went round to several marine store shops, and ultimately to Mr. Taylor's, a marine store dealer, of No. 236, Upper Thames-street, near Blackfriars; and, from what he told me, I went to Mr. Lee's, a waste paper dealer, at Nog. 10 and 11, Trinity-lane, where Lee and Taylor pointed out a quantity of books to me, some of which I produce—one of them is similar to what I saw in the bag, and there were also some covers which had been taken off—I took possession of all—there was 1 ton 16 cwts. 2 qrs. of books, and 9 cwts. 1 qr. of covers—there were some hundreds of, books, but I did not count them.</p>

I returned from a voyage to Balaklava—the prisoner was a seaman on board—we had no freight, as we were returning after taking navigators to Balaklava—when at Balaklava, I had a gold watch and chain and seal, which I last saw safe I think lying on the table—I seldom wore it on board—there were port holes on one side of my cabin-scuttles, through one of which the watch could be taken if a man was in a boat alongside, loaded with bags: a man's arm, standing upon them, would be on a level with the port—I had two seamen named Osier and Allen on board, and an ordinary seaman, a lad named Campbell—about a fortnight after we arrived in Victoria Docks I received information from Campbell, in consequence of which the prisoner was apprehended, and I was sent for to prefer the charge—I did not see him privately, or converse with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am examiner of accounts in the East India Docks. On Christmas ere, at a quarter to 10 o'clock, I was at an oyster stall in High-street, Shadwell—while there, the prisoner came up, put her hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I saw it in her hand—she ran away, and I followed her—I did not overtake her, but was not far off her—some men, her confederates I presume, came up—I think there were four men; one of them put his arm behind me, and threw me down on my back—the prisoner said, "All right, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, I have got it, all right;" or words to that effect—I then missed my gold watch and chain—the prisoner came to me when I was down—this was at Palmers-folly, which is a court or alley, right opposite the Bull's Head—my watch was safe in my waistcoat pocket when I was at the oyster stall, and was fastened by a gold chain—the prisoner ran into the first house past Palmer's-folly, and I gave information to the police—I had had a glass or two with some friends, but was perfectly sober—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to Mr. George Waugh, a solicitor, in James-street, Bedford-row. He was engaged in some legal proceedings on the part of the prisoner—I do not know how long he was acting as solicitor for the prisoner—I was only there nine months—it had commenced before my time—whilst I was in the office some correspondence took place between Mr. Waugh and the prisoner—he was acting for the prisoner and other members of his family—I posted several letters from Mr. Waugh to the prisoner—I have afterwards seen the prisoner at the office—letters have come from the prisoner to Mr. Waugh—I am acquainted with the prisoner's writing—on 10th Oct. I posted a letter directed by Mr. Waugh to the prisoner—I have a copy of that letter—these letters of 11th and 28th Oct., and 5th Nov., are in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">The following letters were read</hi>: "To Mr. C. Westron. 10th Oct, 1855. Sir,—Your conduct was so insulting, and your remarks so impertinent and unwarranted, at my office this morning, that I find it necessary to revert to the decision I some time since adopted, when you pursued a similar course, of declining personal intercourse, and desiring that any further communication may be made either by letter or through one of my clerks, and kept within the bounds of reason and truth; in answer to which, every information will be given you as to the Burrow and Munscomb estates. Had you taken a proper course of conduct and conversation this morning, instead of using such expressions as and—scoundrel, and other infamous ones of a like nature, I should have shown you the agreement, signed by your brothers and sisters, for granting a new lease of the property to Mr. Howse for ten years, at the same rent and the like covenants as those in his present one, with the addition of a power from the lessors to determine the same upon any quarter day, upon giving one year's previous notice so to do, and pay<lb/>ment of the usual outgoing tenant's valuation, and for any permanent improvement made by him to the property, with their consent in writing. I now have to ask if you will sign such agreement, which is left with my clerk for your inspection. I remain, your obedient servant, George Waugh." "11th Oct. (<hi rend="italic">To Mr. Waugh from the prisoner.</hi>) "Sir,—You have been told by me, over and over again, that I will not sanction, on my own behalf—that is, you say, I can do nothing—Mr. Howse taking a fresh lease at a rental of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, subject to such swindling deductions as are made through you, namely, expenses, collecting the half year's rent for me, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, taxes against income, making 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, upon the rent, besides other expenses. The first part of your letter contains a quotation of some expression you state I made use of in your presence. It is possible I have, but more probable I have not, exactly as you write it, without an additional consonant tnat would have given a more significant bearing, and have been a more apt return of a <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi> benediction of your own to me. With respect to the other part of your letter, wherein you state you will not see me, I must distinctly give you to understand, that you are too dear to me to allow of my breaking a five years' acquaintance in that abrupt manner; and therefore I shall take the liberty of not only calling, but requesting that you will be visible on the 21st of this month, which will be three months from the time I last wrote you, of which you appear quite oblivious, as also the lapse of time since you served me with a notice of your intention to dispose of the property. I shall have nothing further to say to you, but simply this, that it is my intention to see your son, as I presume he will be placed in your shoes before long, and I should like for him to know how he will be situated</p>

               <p>with me when such an event occurs, as there seems more truth than you may perhaps fancy in the remark made by Mr. Ellis, at Tiverton, when he observed that my life hung upon a thread, and had he completed the sentence it would have been, 'and this gentleman's life on my right hangs on a puff of smoke.' I do not intend to have any more correspondence with you, having answered your letter. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, C. B. Westron."—"Oct. 28th. To. Mr. Waugh. Sir,—Since you now seem to be quite oblivious, or rather I should say regardless of time that has elapsed after the first notice you gave me of your intention to dispose of the property, I will thank you to forward me particulars of your account, that some mode of settlement may be devised, and a balance struck between us, as I have a little set off against you. At the same time have the goodness to inform me what your views are with respect to the property; and if, in accordance with mine contained in the late correspondence between us, let me know, as I am desirous of carrying out the promise given to Mr. Coombe, although extorted under a threat of not going into your office, and thereby creating a return of that serious delusion of which he informed me at the same time you laboured under. I am, Sir, yours most respectfully, Charles Weatron." "5th Nov. Sir,—In answer to your letter, I have only to state that you must have been as well aware as myself its contents only amounted to a part of a promise of something being done between this and Lady Day next, provided nothing occurred to prevent it. I have now instructed Mr. Sandys to dispose of my share in the property by 10th Dec. next, let the loss that very probably will occur be what it may. He suggested what perhaps never occurred to you, that my brothers or the other branches of the family might, through your assistance, be induced to give me a trifle for my interest, and then you might have succeeded in your original purpose of managing the property, and your son, of course, would follow in his parent's pattern. Previous to all this taking place, I think it but right to let you know that although my judgment might err in condemning a solicitor who acts in behalf of both plaintiff and defendant, yet I cannot be made to understand how a person is expected to sanction the sale of a pro<lb/>perty previous to his having seen the title or description of it, as you were so anxious for me to do at the time of compromise; nor how any solicitor calling himself respectable could induce a client to accept a compromise to the value of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., now states that the purchaser won't have it, but the client must take what he can catch, or perhaps 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided nothing occurs between this and Lady Day. You are perfectly aware of the terms of compromise, but not perhaps quite so enlightened as to the difficulty I had of procuring a sight of my title to the property, or either my reason for sanctioning 6,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a public auction, which was not carried out; I therefore consider that I am entitled to have the original offer of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. carried out. I am afraid, from the letters you have written me, that you have made a very slight mistake with Mr. Burridge's affairs, but you will excuse my speaking a little enigmatically—thereby hangs a tale, but not an entail. You had better make out particulars of your account, and furnish me with same, when I trust, if a settlement is made, it will prove satisfactory to both parties. Mr. Sandys' address is No. 4, Gray's Inn-square, and he will call on Monday or Tuesday. Sir, I am yours respectfully, C. B. Westron.")</p>

I am the wife of Charles Ogborn, a City policeman—in March, 1854, we lived in Angel-court, Skinner-street—we are now living in Paternoster-row—in March, 1854, the prisoner came to take a lodging at our house—my husband went up stairs with him, I went also—the prisoner said that he could not believe the bed was long enough for him to sleep upon, and before he took the lodging he should like to measure it—it was a full sized bed, quite long enough for my husband to sleep on, and he is about six feet high—it was a six foot bed—my husband told him that it was long enough for him, we quite laughed at the idea—he still persisted in measuring the bed—he ultimately took the lodging—and remained until May—during that time I had opportunities of seeing him—I used to notice his behaviour every day, and I named to my husband how very eccentric he used to appear, different from what I ever noticed any other gentleman—if I spoke to him on any matter of business, such as letters, I have had brought to me, I would speak to him three or four times, and he would make me no answer whatever—I used at one time to think he was deaf, but I found to the contrary, that he was not deaf, it was only his manner—he used to hold conversations with himself very loud, at night as well as in the daytime—he used very bad language at times, and seemed in a very excited state, when by himself—I have heard him knock his fists on the table in the bed room when he was by himself—I was ill at one part of the time, and lay in bed in the next room to him, and he used to disturb me very much—after I had made his bed he used to strip it almost every day—whenever he was going out, he always stood two or three minutes in the small garden in front of the cottage, eyeing the house over—it was very seldom that I could get him to enter into any conversation, even respecting himself, but when I did, he would break off very abruptly, and say no more—at times he spoke rationally, and at times his conversation was very frivolous, it was quite nonsense, childish talk—when he used to enter into any kind of conversation he used to talk quite childish and silly talk—from what I saw of him while he was with us, I thought he was not correct in his mind, and I spoke of it to his brother.</p>

I live at No. 78, Margaret-street, Bagnigge Wells-road—about the end of 1854, or the beginning of 1855, the prisoner took an apartment at my house, I think it was about Dec., he remained about three weeks—he carried on a very strange conduct altogether while he was with me—he used to shove his things about and get very much excited at different times, and aroused our suspicions very much, in fact, we got rather fidgetty, and afraid of him—his symptoms altogether were those of a person not in his right state of mind—he used very often to look up the chimney, and say it was too large, there was too much wind and too much draught—he also found fault with the key hole, and said that the door did not close tight enough—there was no draught, the door was as correct as any door need be; there was no more draught from the chimney than usual—it was a very comfortable room, he very frequently used to pull his bed about the room, and sometimes swore—I do not know whether he alluded to any one, it was chiefly to himself—he used to appear very much excited at times whilst he was alone—I could hear what he said very plainly, because we lived in the next room to him—he said if he did not have this, or that—he was in such deep conversation, and talked so fast we could hardly under<lb/>stand what he did say—I can hardly explain distinctly what language he</p>

"Because when people are not well they can't eat"—he turned about to me very abruptly, and said, was it anything peculiar to me that he was not taking any breakfast—I said, "Oh, no, not the least"—so I took the doth off the table, and he went up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. In Sept last I lived with my mother, at No. 94, Lisson<lb/>grove. I had previous to that time been one of the attendants at Grove<lb/>hall Lunatic Asylum—whilst I was living with my mother, the prisoner came to lodge there—I think he came in April, and he remained about five months—the greater portion of the time he slept in the next room to me—I frequently used to bear him talking very much in the night, and some<lb/>times he would appear to be shouting out to somebody—I have heard him say sometimes very bitterly, "No, d—you, you shan't do it," and that sort of thing—that was sometimes at 12 or 1 o'clock in the night—it disturbed me very much, and I used to notice it—I got used to it, I had been used to it long before—I cannot say that it was every night, but it was very frequently—I have often conversed with him—sometimes he would speak very ration<lb/>ally, at other times perhaps in the midst of his conversation he would break off in a very strange sort of manner—sometimes he would not answer at all—I have frequently gone in, and he would not speak to me at all—he seemed quite lost, and would take no notice—I have sometimes noticed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040076"/>
               <p>that he has looked very wild—I was five months at Grove-hall Asylum—there were about 140 patients there—I thought at first that the prisoner was rather eccentric, and hearing these sort of things I said to my mother that I thought he was not exactly right—I think he was at times in his right mind, but I do not think he was always—I have gone into his room, and found him lying about on the floor and on the bed, apparently quite lost, lying straight down, as though he had thrown himself down in a languid sort of manner, but quite lost, as if he was deep in thought—I have on those occasions perhaps made an observation, such as "Good morning," or "Good evening," as the case might be, but he has never answered me—he was not asleep, but he did not move or seem to take the least notice.</p>

The prisoner came to reside there on Monday, 5th Nov. last—he remained till the following Monday—he left because he complained that the room smoked—it did smoke—I frequently heard him in his room at night as if he was knocking things about the room—I heard him two or three nights, in the middle of the night, when I awoke—he never closed his door very early—I heard this after he had dosed his door—I heard him talking a little—I remember one evening seeing him on the landing with a handkerchief round his neck; he had got it very tight round his throat, his face looked rather discoloured, and with great difficulty I undid the handkerchief, then unbuttoned his collar, and I gave him some water—he said he was ill, he thought he was going to have a fit, and I perceived his handkerchief to be very tight—he was on the landing—he made a noise in his throat when he drank the water—his handkerchief was tied in a tight knot—I have every reason to believe it must have been pulled very tight, it was with great difficulty I undid it—it could not have fallen into a knot out of a bow, it was tied—after I had untied it, he went into his own room, and I went down stairs, and in a few minutes after he walked up and down the garden, and then he came in by the back door—I heard the door make a noise as if he had gone back against the door, and I took the candle and came out, and he was then standing on the top of the stairs with his handkerchief tied round again—I undid it again for him—he said he was very ill, he looked very wild about the eyes—it was tied quite as tight as it had been before, I had very great difficulty in undoing it—I have seen him standing on the steps of the stairs about twice, quite lost in thought—shortly before he left, I cooked a mutton chop for him, and took it up to him, and he cut it in pieces, and took it out in the garden, and walked about eating it—it was raining at the time—he had no umbrella, he walked about without his hat on, eating the chop.</p>

I have got you now, have I; I thought I should catch you"—I was in my front parlour, and he was in the back parlour—I did not go in to him—I found out afterwards thai he was by himself—a few minutes afterwards, I heard him say, "I shall set the place on fire presently"—next morning when I went into the room, I noticed that my toilet covers were lying on the floor, and I picked them up, and exa<lb/>mined them, and saw that the corner of one of them was very much burnt, both of them were burnt, and the counterpane also—he went out in the morning as usual, before I saw him—in the evening he knocked at my door, and said he was ill—I asked what was the matter, he said he had had a fit; he had a basin three parts full of cold water in his hand, and he was bath<lb/>ing his fece—I asked if he was subject to fits—he said yes, he was—my husband asked if he should get him a doctor—he said he did not know of one—my husband asked if he would allow him to take him to a doctor—he said he thought he should like to go to a doctor—he said he was sub<lb/>ject to these fits, and if I ever found him in one, I was to put his head in a pail of cold water—he said that from nine years of age he had always been ill every Friday—I observed a wildness about his appearance—we thought it was not a fit, we thought he looked very wild—I observed this sort of conduct very much during the time he was with me.</p>

I am a solicitor, and reside at Wellington, in the county of Somerset—that is the place the prisoner comes from—I have known him from a child, and his family well—his father was never confined in a lunatic asylum, but he cut his throat, from which he died; he committed suicide—I administered to his estate and effects as one of his creditors, and in consequence of that, I was one of the parties to the Chancery suit which relates to this unhappy question—Mr. Waugh was my town solicitor, he behaved most kindly to the family, in fact, he was the real means of getting the estates for them—the prisoner must have known that—I have known the prisoner from a child, he was always of a morbid disposition, a sullen temper—the last time I saw him before now, was at Tiverton, Mr. Waugh</p>

               <p>advertised the estates to be sold there, and he came down—I was present on that occasion—his manner and demeanour then was most sullen; he would not say anything—he appeared to be in a sulky disposition and temper altogether—that was about six months ago—I knew an uncle of his, his father's brother, Mr. Robert Westron—I believe he committed suicide, but I only know it from hearsay—no doubt there is a considerable amount of insanity in the family—Mr. Waugh was one of the kindest friends they ever had, he completely took up their cause altogether—they would not have had any one to have done it if it had not been for Mr. Waugh.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the medical profession. Three years ago I was called in to attend the prisoner—he was then living at Park-hill, in Somersetshire, with his brother in law—it was a difficult matter to say what was the matter with him, in as much as, from his extreme peculiarity, I could not get any rational reply to the questions I put to him—he was evi<lb/>dently suffering under considerable mental disturbance at the time—if I asked him a question to get at his ailment, his replies were so perfectly irre<lb/>levant that I could not at all satisfy myself as to the precise nature of his disease—I had no question at all that his mind was affected at that time—the opinion I then formed was that he was evidently suffering from mental aberration—I have not had much to do with the treatment of luna<lb/>tics, not more than falls to the ordinary lot of men in general practice—I have not been attached to any institution at all—I have been in Court to-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard the history of his career for the last two years given in Court to-day; taking that into consideration, with what you observed of him, have you formed any opinion of the state of his mind at the time this act was committed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is only confirmatory of the opinion I had formed, that he was not in a sound state—may I state that, upon returning after visiting him a few times, I communicated to my partner the opinion</p>

               <p>I had formed at the time—I was not at all surprised at the act he committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the evidence you have heard to-day, and the opportunity you had of observing him upon the occasions when you visited him, do you think he knew the nature and quality of the act he was doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I cannot say—I have seen nothing of him since the period I have referred to, two or three years since—assuming everything that has been proved to-day to be well founded in fact, I should not think he was con<lb/>scious of the difference between right and wrong—I should not imagine, from the state in which I saw him two years ago, if he was not improved in his mind, that he could be cognizant of what was right and wrong—if the evidence I have heard to-day be true, I should certainly say his mind was not better—at the time I saw him, I should say he could not understand the difference between right and wrong.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the circumstances from which you concluded that his mind was disturbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I asked him any question as to his state, his replies were as irrelevant as possible—if I asked him how his secretions were, he would answer in some very indifferent way, he would not confine himself to that—I cannot recollect what he did say, it is too long ago, I am only speaking of the general facts of the case—he was living with his brother in law at that time—he was not under restraint—he was in bed—he has not been under restraint since, that I know of, but I was impressed at the time mth the necessity of his being so—I did not tell that to his brother in law—I have several times referred to the fact since, and said, "I am sure your brother is insane, he was insane when I saw him"—I told his brother in law that, when I heard of the unfortunate event that has placed him where he is—I have referred to it before that, but never spoke so strongly—I did not hear what the letters were exactly that have been read—I heard one of the witnesses state that he appeared to be very much excited when he spoke of having been <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by a rogue of a lawyer—that does not produce any effect upon my mind, or alter my opinion in any way—it does not occur to me as furnishing any motive on his part for this act, none whatever—I have known nothing of him since the period I have referred to, nor am I acquainted with his antecedents—I have not seen him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean seriously to say that you think the circumstances you have heard stated, and what occurred when you saw him three years ago, will justify you in saying that in your, opinion he was not aware that he was guilty of any infraction of the law when'he shot Mr. Waugh? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is asking me a question perhaps which I should be hardly expected to</p>

               <p>answer 90 unequivocally as you put it—I am further convinced, from the evidence I have heard, that his mind has not improved since I saw him in Somersetshire—I did at that time consider him in a state not cognizant of tight and wrong—I do not know that he would not know it was wrong to kill a man—I was not surprised at this at all—he evidenced a very dis<lb/>turbed state of mind, such as that I inferred from it that he was incapable of judging right from wrong—I inferred it from the circumstances I have named, his irrelevant answers, and sometimes, in reply to my question, he would put a question to me, but expressed in language of a very inco<lb/>herent character, such as no one could understand—I cannot now recollect the questions he put to me—I am speaking of the impression upon my mind at that time.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I live at No. 16, Eaton-terrace. I have had a considerable amount of experience with lunatics, and in insane cases, for some years past—I have attended Dr. Sutherland's establishment, and been under his instructions, and acted with him for a considerable period—I have seen the prisoner—I had a short interview with him in Newgate yesterday evening, in the presence of the surgeon of the gaol—I had never seen him before—it was only a short interview, I should have preferred a longer one—I was able, from the length of time I was with him, to form a judgment—I formed the opinion, that there was a very great deficiency of mind about him—in arriving at a conclusion as to the sanity or insanity of a person, the state of mind of the father and collateral relations is a most important feature—I have heard the evidence that has been given on the subject of his father, his uncle, and one of his aunts, and I have also heard the evidence that has been given throughout the whole of this case—if all the facts deposed to by the witnesses be true, I think the prisoner was not able to distinguish right from wrong at the time he committed the act in question.</p>

               <p>that the life of the man on his right hung upon a puff of smoke, to be a threat that he intended him some injury by means of fire arms—I have heard that he stated to one of the witnesses that he had been cheated of his property by a rogue of a lawyer, and that in giving his account of it he was in a very excited state—I cannot say that that produces any impression upon my mind—he may have made up his mind long ago to destroy Mr. Waugh—I never saw him until last night—I was with him about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I asked him first after his general health; he made no answer at first; afterwards he said, "Pretty well," or "Pretty good"—I said, "What was your motive for killing Mr. Waugb?"—he said because he had robbed him or plundered him of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he had given him a written promise to pay him upon a certain date a sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the money was not paid to him; that he was very anxious to go abroad, but he could not do so, not having this money; that Mr. Wangh knew a great deal too much about him—he then became quite confused in his manner of speaking; in fact, he spoke unintelligibly about certain parties agreeing with certain other parties to do this, and others to do that—those were his expressions, as near as I can recollect—he walked away from me, and returned once or twice, but I could get no further explanation from him than what I have mentioned, that certain parties wanted to do certain acts, and had combined with others to do them; but no further explanation could I get—he did not name the other parties, he mentioned no names, only answered my questions about Mr. Waugh—I asked him many ques<lb/>tions, to which he appeared to pay no attention, or as if he did not hear them; at any rate, he took no notice of them—I asked him how long he had made up his mind to shoot Mr. Waugh before he committed the murder—he gave me no answer to that—I asked him how he slept—he said, "Pretty well"—I again came back to his general health, and asked him was it good—he mumbled an answer which I could not catch—I think that was the whole of the conversation, as far as I can recollect—from his manner of answering, and his general appearance, I should have certainly considered him a person of unsound mind—his general appearance was suspicious, indi<lb/>cated by the sudden sidelong look of his eye; extreme suspicion—I think I have now described the symptoms I observed.</p>

               <p>judge very much from appearance and demeanour—it is almost impossible to convey by words the appearance and demeanour of a lunatic patient, nothing but experience will teach it you—it is sometimes difficult to fill up a certificate, even where no doubt exists as to the mental state—you can<lb/>not bring forward proof to put down in black and white until you have had many opportunities of examining the patient—if I had had a larger oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing the manner and demeanour of the prisoner yesterday, I have no doubt my opinion would have been strengthened, as he had the appearance of a person of unsound mind—I am sure he did not then under<lb/>stand that he had committed a crime, and it would be presumable that he did not know it at the time he committed the act—the tying the neckcloth on two occasions, and talking in his room to imaginary persons, are indications of insanity—the descriptions given of his manner and restlessness generally are strong indications of insanity—I have found in lunatics a most intense earnestness of purpose, and whatever reasoning is applied to show them that they are wrong has no effect whatever—supposing the prisoner to be a lunatic the fact of Mr. Wangh's behaving extremely kind to him and his family would not alter his impressions—when I saw him yesterday, it was in company with Mr. Gibson, the surgeon of the gaol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You used the term delusion, is it your opinion that the prisoner was labouring under entire defect of reason, or that he had delusions upon particular subjects only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been proved by the witnesses that he had delusions upon particular subjects—no madman if mad upon every subject—he has delusions upon certain subjects, but on others his judgment is untouched—in my interview with the prisoner I judged from his manner of speaking that he did not know it was wrong to kill a person—in persons of unsound mind you can never answer for the moment they may take a homicidal or suicidal tendency—it may come on at any moment without previous warning, where clear unsoundness of mind has been first proved—it has been proved by the witnesses that he had delusions, which show a diseased state of mind, and in such a state of mind a homicidal or suicidal tendency may at any moment arise—he enter<lb/>tains delusions on some points, so it is proved in evidence—in some matters his mind may undoubtedly be sane—whether upon those matters he would be capable of distinguishing right from wrong, would depend a great deal upon whether he was labouring under excitement at the time or not—if an excitement was produced, it would render him incapable of judging for the time being, although the matter might not have relation to his delusions.</p>

I am a porter—last Saturday night week, about a quarter past 12 o'clock, I was standing at the door of my house, talking to my brother in law, Samuel Goldsmith, and the prisoner came up—he passed by me, turned to the right, and gave my brother in law two blows on the face, muttering something, but what I could not understand—he then backed across the road—it is a narrow street—my brother in law crossed the road to where the prisoner was standing, and asked him what he did that for—I cannot say whether the prisoner made any reply—my brother in law said he would go to fetch a policeman—he went, but he could not find one, and he came back—while he was away, the prisoner had crossed the street, and gone up a court—after my brother in law came back, I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and I said, "Take care that he don't draw the knife upon you"—immediately after that he drew a knife, and was in the act of making a blow at my brother in law—I rushed in, and took him by the wrist, and he cut me across my wrist with the knife—I laid hold of him, kicked his feet from under him, and threw him on his back—I was cut a second time while he was lying on the ground, and I was trying to wrest the knife out of his hand—I kept him on the ground till an officer came and took him—there had been no quarrel between me and the prisoner, or between my brother in law and the prisoner, that I know of.</p>

At a little after 12 o'clock, on that Saturday night, I was standing at the door, talking to him—the prisoner came to me from the opposite side of the way, and struck me on the right cheek, I believe once—he had not said anything previous to that—on his striking me, he crossed over to Garden-court—I went after him, and asked what he had done it for—he said something, but what I could not understand—I went for a policeman, but could not find one—when I returned he was in the same place—I said it was no use having the man locked up—the prisoner then drew a knife at me—my brother in law said, "Mind, he has a knife!"—he made a blow at me—my brother in law stepped in, and received it on his left hand—I helped to keep the prisoner till the police<lb/>man came, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Olerkenwell Police Court.

I did not know Brown or Carter before this night—I have seen Brown several times since at a public house—on Tuesday, 6th Nov., I was at the bar of the Sun Tavern, in Gray's Inn-lane—Brown and Carter came in together, and were drinking together—they remained for an hour and a half to two hours—they went up stairs and came down again to go to the concert—it was about a quarter or 20 minutes past 7 o'clock when they left—they were talking, drinking, and quarrelling about some matter which I did not under<lb/>stand—it was not a serious quarrel, they made it up again, and had another glass of grog, and they quarrelled again, and Brown got up, bade him good night, and went across the road—Carter followed him to go home and fetch something which he had of his, a chair on which Brown sat and smoked his pipe of a night—Brown said that he was going home, which is somewhere in Theobald's-road—Carter was very drunk indeed, and Brown was about half drunk—when they went out Brown went up a step of a gentleman's house opposite, and Carter went after him; they both came down and went towards King's-road, twenty or thirty yards further—Carter got before Brown, to push him back and prevent him going home, and Brown knocked him down—Brown had his arm in a sling; he put his arm up and followed him up with his right hand, struck him in the mouth, knocked him into the road, and there he laid—Brown ran away—it was a very violent blow—Carter</p>

               <p>was very drunk; he had laid there insensible, till he was picked up by a policeman, who I sent—Carter did not strike Brown at all—I heard Brown say, "Carter, I bid you good night, I did not think you were this sort of man"—Carter said, "Well, I will follow you home"—Brown said, "Well, if you do, you will find something"—Carter had said something about Eagle-street—he said nothing more than, "This house belongs to me;" or, "The property belongs to me, and I will have it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Carter was brought there on 6th Nov.—I examined him—he had a severe scalp wound behind the right ear—the pericranium was exposed, and the skull was bare—he had also a bruise by his hip, and a blow on the face—he was in a state of almost insensibility, partially from drink and partially from the effects of the blow—the blow on his head must have been the result of very great violence—I do not think it could have been done by his falling from his own weight—there must have been considerable impetus—he remained in the hospital four weeks all but a day, and went out on his own express wish—he was cautioned before he went out, both by Mr. Lloyd and myself—the probability is that if he had taken great care of himself, and kept under a course of medicine, he might have recovered.</p>

I suppose you would like to fight"—I saw no blows, but Jane Filbert pulled the prisoner in—after that they were quarrelling again, but I did not see the prisoner strike him—it was not the prisoner who gave him the wounds; it was myself that <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, when four of his countrymen came and rushed on him—he was underneath the four, and Alice Whitehead and my little sister were in between them; the prisoner was on the bed, and there were four more of his countrymen, in their flannel drawers, came in from the next houses, and Antonio made five—they were all on the prisoner—my little sister was trying to keep his countrymen from him; and if I had not defended him, he would have been killed by the five of them; so I hit him three times across the head with the poker; and Jane Filbert took the poker out of my hand, and then I looked for tike frying pan—Antonio and his companions were not only on the prisoner, but on my little sister, who is turned fourteen years old—one of the Spanish men had one of my chairs in his hand, and one of the servants took it, and took it into another house, or he was going to hit the prisoner with it.</p>

I saw the prisoners in St. Martin's-lane—nothing particular passed between us, only common conversation—the next morning they asked me if I would recommend them to a lithographer—they did not say for what purpose—I recommended them to Mr. Appel—they went with me to Mr. Appel—they went into a room with him, and I waited in another room—when they came out I heard some words—I heard the younger brother say, "He is a clever man; of him we can learn something: he understands it better than myself, and makes also the paper," and I heard something about the Prussian eagle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographer, carrying on business in Gerrard-street, Soho, for about seven years—I am patentee of the process called the Anastatic process, for taking impressions on metal from paper—I have been employed on several occasions as an engraver by the Prussian Embassy—the prisoners came to me on 23rd Nov., in company with the last witness—I was at my work in the front office—the prisoners came to me—the wit<lb/>ness waited out in another room—some general conversation passed between the prisoners and me, and Edmund showed me a Prussian 10 thaler note—he had just before asked what my business was—I said, "A lithographer," but I did not keep a lithographer in the house; I took originals from other works—he said, "That is just what I want"—he said, "I have a great deal of business"—he then showed me the 10 thaler note, and said, "Can you do that?"—I said, "I can, but I won't do it; I dare not do it"—I saw it was Prussian money—he said, "Don't be foolish, this will pay you better than all the other work which you have"—I said, "Well, I will do it, if you can give me the authority"—he said, "Oh, the authority I can give you," and he showed me his passport, and told me he was a merchant—I did not look at the passport, I only read that he came from Belgium, and was a mer<lb/>chant—he said that he would get the authority from the minister—I said, "Very well; I have no time now, I must go on with my work"—he said, "Well, I won't detain you any longer; I will call again"—when he first showed me the note, there was Edmund alone, and after I consented to do it if he brought me the authority, he said he would bring me the autho<lb/>rity, and then he called his brother in, and said, "My brother knows how,</p>

               <p>he has done it before," and Louis Schehl told me he had done it before on stone, and he said there was a lithographer in the City who had done it, but he died the week before—Edmund showed me the note, be took it out of his pocket—I did not keep it, he took it away with him—they asked me what time they should call again—I said, "After I have done work, after 7 o'clock in the evening"—they went away, and after they left I made a communication to my foreman and to the Prussian Embassy—when they first came it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I went to the Embassy between 1 and 2 o'clock—I there saw Mr. Albert—I communicated to him the fact of the prisoners coming to me—in consequence of instructions from the Embassy, I proceeded with the work—about 3 o'clock the same afternoon the Secretary of the Embassy came to my house—the prisoners came to my house in the evening, according to appointment, and a conversation again occurred about the notes—I showed them some specimens of my own work—they both said, "It will do very well"—they then asked if I would do what they wanted, and asked me what time I would commence with the work to do the 10 thaler note—Edmund tendered the note to me—Louis was by—I showed him specimens of notes, cheques, and portions of engrav<lb/>ings—he said it would do very well, and if I would print 1,000 copies of the 10 thaler note, he would pay me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me what time I would commence to do the work—I said, "To-morrow is Saturday; I can't begin then"—I told him it would be on Monday—before they left they gave me a 10 franc piece to begin the work—I would not accept it, and it was left on the table—they said they would bring me the authority, and they went away—they invited me to the corner public house, and I had some pale ale—they both came on Sunday morning—they both spoke about the water mark—they showed me the note again, and said, "If you transfer the note and print them off, we want the paper to have the water mark"—I said, "It is quite a thing out of my line, but no doubt I can do it"—they said, "Well, well, if you will consider about it, and try if you can do it"—we came to an agreement about it—I agreed to do the water mark as well—I did not mention about the authority, but Edmund said that, he would bring it—it was again mentioned that they should want 1,000 copies for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say whether it was then or afterwards, but he said he would give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for fifty copies—I cannot recollect how many copies they said they should want in all of the 10 thaler notes, but it was an enormous number—they made an appointment to come the next day, and they went away—on Monday they came again, they then showed me two 10 thaler notes, and in their presence I transferred the fronts and backs of those notes to a zinc plate—the transfer of the two are made at the same moment—this is what I did (<hi rend="italic">looking at the plate</hi>), and this print (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) was taken off the plate on that occasion—by moving about, the plate has got rubbed, and I cannot see the number of it—they said I should look out for paper which would be similar to that of the genuine note to make the water mark on, and on Monday evening they gave me a sovereign to go on—on Tuesday, the 27th, Mr. Albert, the secretary, called on me with Mr. Mullens, the attorney, and from that time up to the time of the prisoners being taken, I was in communication with Mr. Mullens every day—on that same Tuesday the prisoners came, and in their presence I transferred from the impression I had made the day before—they would have been satisfied with the process, but I was not, because the notes were very much worn—I believe they took away some of what I showed them—what I had left I tore up—they said they would send and have some clean notes sent over</p>

               <p>from Germany—they said they would send over to Germany for clean 50 thaler notes—they wanted to have them produced an well—they said they would bring me two clean 10 thaler notes the next day, and if I could get fifty copies done they would pay me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they came again the next evening, Wednesday, the 28th—during that day I had employed Mr. King, an artist, to trace the water mark, and when the prisoners called they saw Mr. King at work at the water mark—they gave Mr. King some money—they had got two notes, and they said they were the best they could get, but they were very dirty—they said they expected a gentleman over from Germany, and the vessel would arrive the next day, and they would then bring me clean notes—he said, "I have written over to procure from the office a clean 100 thaler note"—they said they should want that transferred and printed—they said they wanted to send the proofs off to Germany—they wrote a letter in my place, one letter, which the boy took himself, they said it was gone over to Triers—they said they expected the person to whom they were writing to come over the next day by the steamer, but he could not come before 3 o'clock, and he would bring them clean notes, and he would bring the money as well, and he would fetch those notes which were done—next day, Thursday, the 29th, they both came in the afternoon, they produced two 10 thaler notes—they were not the same that they had pro<lb/>duced on Wednesday—I told him they must be cleaned first, and I laid those notes in solution—they said I should procure some paper to make the water mark on—they saw King at work on the water mark on that Thurs<lb/>day, and all the week—they asked him first of all whether he thought he could manage it, and, as it was in progress, they said they were very much satisfied with it—they came again on Friday—I had made the notes as clean as I could, and in presence of the prisoners and Mr. King I transferred the front and back of a note on this plate (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is the transfer I made—I believe they gave Mr. King on that occasion two sovereigns—they came again on 1st Dec., and were there the whole day—in the after<lb/>noon they were pressing the water mark from the water mark plate—this is the water mark plate (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I think the water mark plate was complete on Saturday—on Monday, 3rd Dec., the prisoners came and were at my house nearly the whole day again—I cannot remember exactly whether any impression was taken from the second plate in their presence that day—there were proofs taken from the water mark on the Monday, and they said they would do very well, and on that occasion they told me they expected a person by the steamer from Germany, and he could not come before 3 o'clock—on Tuesday, 4th Dec., the prisoners were at my house—they were there pretty nearly from day to day till Monday, the 10th Dec.—on Tuesday, the 4th, the prisoners themselves printed the water marks with their own hands—they took copies on paper—Mr. Slatter was then my foreman—he came in and out—on several other occasions the prisoners brought in other notes, and I made transfers of them—this went on till Monday, 10th Dec.—during that interval they were at my house every day—on Monday, the 10th, they themselves were cutting the paper on which the notes were to be printed, to its proper size—in the middle of that day they went away to dinner, between 1 and 2 o'clock; when they returned, Edmund said to me, in presence of the other prisoner, "Have you got an enemy in your house?"—I said, "I believe not"—he said, "Well, consider about it; I think you have"—I said, "If there is one, it must be my clerk," because I had given him previous notice to leave—he said he thought it was, because he told him that he thought I had told the policeman—I</p>

               <p>told him I had not, which was the fact; I had not—Edmund said he was cleverer than the clerk, for he could know what I was doing—they prepared to take the press and the plates to their home, because the clerk did not know where they lived, no more did I—they asked me whether I would lend them the press, to print at home, so that the clerk should not know—they said they would come after 8 o'clock to fetch the press and plates away—that was the press at which they had been working at my place about the water marks—they came after 8 o'clock, and commenced to take the press away with them—they did not take anything else away to my knowledge—Edmund went for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, he said, to fetch the press and plates away—while Edmund was gone, the other prisoner remained—he was wrapping up the plates—after he was gone I found the water mark plate and the paper was gone—that was after he was fetched away—he had been wrapping up the Anastatic plates—I had not given him permission to take away the water mark plate and the paper.</p>

I took Edmund Schehl into custody in the street, when he came out of Mr. Appel's house—I told him what I wanted him for, but he struggled at the time, and there was great confusion—I held him for some seconds till a second party came up—I searched him, and found on him these nuts, and screws, and this wrench—I afterwards took Louis Schehl at Mr. Appel's house in the first floor—I searched him, and found on him some nuts, and screws, and some of the engravings from the plates, a copy of the notes, and a card of Mr. Appel's—I went to No. 6, Featherstone-buildings—I went into the first floor front room—there was a sideboard, I searched it, and in a drawer in it I found a quantity of water marked paper, corresponding with the plate which was with the paper, and some copies of an original Prussian note, and I found the note itself—I found 102 impres<lb/>sions of the water mark—I found impressions of the front and of the back—I found several letters in the back bed room—I was in private clothes when I apprehended these men—I could not say that the impressions were of this particular note.</p>

On Saturday, 26th Jan., in consequence of information, I went to No. 20, Revell's-row, Southwark, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in company with other officers; some were in uniform, and some in plain clothes—the door was fastened, the officer, Nevill, broke it open—there is only one room on the ground floor, and one up stairs—we went up stairs—the room door was fastened, Nevill forced it open—I entered the room with some other constables—I found John White sitting near a table, near a clear fire, Mary White, and Ellen Baker were likewise close to the fire—the other prisoners were sitting on a bed at the table, Halswell was sitting behind them—they all surrounded the table except Halswell, who sat at the back—at that time I saw the prisoners jump up, and John White had in his left hand a plaster of Paris mould, which he threw on the floor and stamped on it—Mary White took from the table a handful of half crowns and shillings, and threw them on the fire—there was a pipkin on the fire containing metal—Nevill seized John White, and a desperate struggle ensued; all the prisoners, except Halswell, attempting to destroy what was on the table—Thomas Evans seized Mary White, and</p>

               <p>funerals, that was not to come off my fees, it was an extra thing, the parties had to pay it themselves—I paid it and charged it to them—I got double fees for out district funerals, when they were my own funerals, and when I could not be deceived by it—I do not know as Malby ever acted dishonestly with me, if he did with any one else—the fees were always paid to Malby as far as I know—it would be Malby's business to hand over to me the fees that were due to me, and I looked to him for the money—I kept a sort of running account with him, he never used to pay me after the funeral was over—I did not know at that time that the churchwardens were objecting to having so many funerals from the outlying districts—I will swear I never posted one of the handbills that you put into my hand—I posted some on a Sunday, but not of that kind—I went about in a cart posting them—I received orders from the churchwardens to post the bills, from Mr. Eastman—the first bills that were posted were left—no—the bills were left at my house, and I had to go to Mr. Eastman's the next morning to receive direc<lb/>tions where to post them, Mr. Edwards was there at the time—I did not receive instructions from Mr. Eastman to go and poet these bills on a Sun<lb/>day, but when I found that the bills were pulled down on a Saturday night, I thought I had better put them up the next morning, which I did; so I went about on the Sunday morning posting them up again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What reason did he assign for so doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Will you allow me to read his letter, it is in his own handwriting, it is dated 6th Sept., after he came back from Paris—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Tulse-hill, Sept. 6, 1855.

To Mr. J.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> All that the Doctor said was, "I hope you have allowed Mrs. White half a crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was allowed something when a person in the district was buried, when it was a vault funeral—I do not know anything further than that what Dr. Vaughan said on this occasion was, "You have allowed Mrs. White half a crown?" or "I hope you have allowed Mrs. White half a crown?" something like that—I said, "I have, Sir," and he said, "That is right, John"—that was all that I heard him say, at least all that I noticed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The certificate does not mention the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not.</p>

               <p>so says the registrar, and you say you always gave the place when the certifi<lb/>cate did not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gained information from the undertakers in general, or the relatives that come.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been involved in some litigation with the Doctor yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In what way? I do not particularly know what you mean by litigation—he brought an action against me in the County Court—I have been occasionally in a little pecuniary embarrassment—I do not know exactly when it was that I had a distress put in my house, I have the receipt for what I paid, so I can tell you—it was 12th July, 1855—I went to the Doctor and told him the distress I was in—the distress was for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Doctor advanced me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a claim upon the churchwardens for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for salary—it was not arranged that that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be deducted from the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after all this disturbance took place about the fees I brought an action in the County Court against the Doctor for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he brought an action against me for the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—both these causes stood for hearing on the same day—I did not withdraw my action, it did not come on for hearing—I did not withdraw mine and pay the costs, I did not withdraw it, but I understand it was withdrawn—I got a solicitor to take the cases in rotation—I did not get my 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I bad to pay the costs—the Doctor got a judgment in his favour for the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was sworn—I swore that I did not owe it him—I believe the counsel after hearing me cross-examined, said he would have nothing more to do with the case—the Judge said that I had been guilty of perjury, and that he should consider whether he ought not to commit me—he afterwards said that con<lb/>sidering Dr. Vaughan was wealthy enough himself to prosecute me he should not commit me, but that I fully deserved to be indicted for perjury—I did swear that I did not owe the Doctor the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not gone through the rough book with the churchwardens and others in all the cases, I have not done so with any one—I am still sexton—I have not talked this matter over pretty frequently with Plummer—in almost all the cases I received the fees—I used to account to the Doctor every time of the inter<lb/>ment—the number of times a week that was, depended upon what inter<lb/>ments there were—sometimes there might be one, sometimes none, and sometimes two or three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But supposing in any week there was more than one interment, bow often were you in the habit, taking one week with another, of accounting with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes on Wednesday morning, and sometimes I used to go to the Doctor's residence and settle with him—sometimes, before I paid, the entries were made from the certificates—some of the entries are made by Mr. Eastman, and some are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that when Mr. Eastman buried on some occasions, no entry was made until a subsequent period? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the biggest part of them, I believe, are out of the district; it was kept private from Mr. Eastman by the Doctor, the entries from the certificates—Mr. Eastman did not have the certificate sometimes at the time of the funeral, the Doctor had it in his possession sometimes—I believe it is the business of the officiating clergyman to have the certificates—sometimes Mr. Eastman was in the habit of burying without them—this rough book was always open on the table of the vestry—there was another book, a third book, a copy of it, which was kept for the churchwardens—the Doctor in general</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040140"/>
               <p>copied that—the churchwardens had a copy of the rough book, and the rough book itself was at all times open to their inspection in the vestry—Plummer had his clerk's fees to receive from me from time to time—at one time I think we had a running account—it was the Doctor's wish that he should know what Plummer received, then I kept back two or three weeks, or perhaps a little more, but generally I paid him—the Doctor wanted to know what he received, and the fees then stood back—you might certainly tell it by the number of funerals—it was the Doctor's wish at ail events—it was only that time that I kept a running account with Plummer—I think so—that was one occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the only one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last two or three weeks perhaps, or three weeks, it all depended.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the whole time Plummer was there officiating as clerk, had you not a running account with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not the whole time, I think, it all depended—I think a few weeks—at all events he was paid all the fees, excepting the double fees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that he was not paid the double fees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the Doctor's wish that he should not receive the double fees after his father's death—the Doctor told me so—I do not know when it was he told me that—he told me that Plummer was not to receive double fees, only when he had a funeral of his own at the Church, acting as undertaker—when the funeral was not his own, the double fees that Plummer should have received were paid to Mrs. White, the pew opener—Mrs. Harrison's complaint was nothing, except about receiving this certificate of burial—she came to complain to the churchwardens that the burial certifi<lb/>cate was incorrect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear it, or did she complain to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not complain to me at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she complain in your hearing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I heard them talking in the Church about it—she did not complain to me at all—I heard her complain to others—she complained of the certificate, that she could not receive the money she had in the bank from the certificate she received at the vestry—she complained that the identity was disputed at the bank, in consequence of the description being incorrect—she made that complaint in the Church to the churchwardens I think—I do not know whether she produced the certificate—Mr. Eastman officiated at the burial of her husband, to the best of my recollection—I received the fees—Dr. Vaughan was at home at that time I believe—I think he was, I do not think he was gone to Paris at that time; he was at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do with the fees, if she paid double fees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I paid the Doctor the fees; double, single ground fee—I had received double—I paid the Doctor single—I did not pay him the double, because I meant to give it to the woman back again after I heard she was poor and deserv<lb/>ing—I do not recollect when I paid Dr. Vaughan—I paid him before I offered the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back to Mrs. Harrison—I did not pay him the whole, because I kept it back—I did so on all occasions, because it was the Doctor's wish that she should receive the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back, because she was poor—it was by his permission that I should take them in that way—he was aware that the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to be returned to the woman—I know he was aware of it because I told him—I told him that the woman was very poor—I did not know the parties at all, and they came from Clapham—I told him the woman was very poor in the vestry of the Church—I cannot tell you when I told him—it was before the funeral—I told Dr. Vaughan in the vestry</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040141"/>
               <p>that I had received double fees—I cannot recollect when it was—it was before the funeral, after I had received the money—sometimes I receive the money two or three days before the funeral—I do not recollect on that occasion how I might receive the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Come, you may as well tell us the truth, did not you mean to pocket that 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—the book that was kept for the church<lb/>wardens is all in the Doctor's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying that she was poor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not aware that she was, only from the information I gained from the parties that came to order the funeral—it was a party of the name of Lodge—he lives at Clapham—he came to the churchyard—he told me that the woman was poor—he asked me to remit the fees—the fees were taken off for some relative of his in the same way—I kept the fees in my pocket till I gave them up to the Doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I was curate to Dr. Vaughan, at St. Matthew's Brixton. I commenced acting as curate in May, 1853—the Rev. Matthew Vaughan preceded me, a son of the Rev. Dr. Vaughan—the number of funerals at St. Matthew's, Brixton, depended upon the time of year—I was there during the cholera season—then there were a great many—I usually performed the funerals—in June, 1855, I was officiating as curate to Dr. Vaughan—on 11th June, 1855, I find this entry in the rough book: "11th June. Jane Webb, Acre-lane, sixty five years," with my initials and the figure 6—the whole of that entry is in Dr. Vaughan's handwriting, with the exception of my initials—the figure 6 is in Dr. Vaughan's hand<lb/>writing—the initials G. E. are mine—I should imagine that that entry was in the book when I put my initials there—I have in one or two instances put my initials to a blank entry—I had the entry of the funeral before me at the time I put my initials—sometimes I saw the undertaker's certificate—I dare say I have performed a funeral without the undertaker's certificate and the entry in this book by Dr. Vaughan—I do not recollect—I cannot speak clearly as to this entry of 11th June—I do not recollect that just now—I should imagine this entry of Jane Webb was there before I put my initials to it, for this reason, there was a wedding at the Church on that morning, which I think was performed by Dr. Vaughan—I have here the entries of the marriages which took place at that Church in the month of June—this is the marriage register of St Matthew's,</p>

               <p>Brixton—I see there were two weddings performed on that day—Dr. Vaughan officiated at those weddings—he signs as the clergyman on 11th June, 1855—I think the body of the entries with regard to the weddings is in Mr. Plummer's, the clerk's handwriting—the fact of there having been two weddings at the Church that morning does not recall to my recollection anything with regard to the entry of this burial—I have no recollection of the entry—it was so common for me to place my initials to Dr. Vaughan's handwriting, and the cases were so numerous, that I could not recollect them individually—my initials are placed in the same line—I think I have once or twice placed my initials to a blank entry where there was nothing written—I do not recollect whether I did so on this occasion—I have here the register of burials (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—here is an entry on 11th June—it is in Dr. Vaughan's handwriting—it is, "Jane Webb, Acre-lane, 11th June, sixty-five years."</p>

I am not capable of stating what would be the advantage to the party receiving double fees instead of single fees for burials in the course of a year, I have not made myself acquainted with it—my year of office not having been gone through, and the account not having been made up, I am not competent to give you an answer as to the amount of the fees, or how they are distributed—the single fees for a funeral are 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the double fees, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—of the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. single fee, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I presume would go to the incumbent, as desk or surplice fees; 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the churchwardens and the Rector of Lambeth, one half to each; and the residue would be made up by the sexton and clerk's fees, but what they are I do not know—I have made it my duty to understand how far the churchwardens are answerable, and how much of the fees it would be their's to account for; so far I can give you an answer, but as to the sexton I cannot—the relative proportions are the same in double as in single fees.</p>

SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he gave you the receipt, did he say Anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me that if any one should ask me where the funeral came from I was to tell a lie, and say Robert-street—that was when he gave me the receipt—he said it in those words, "You are to tell a lie"—I told him where the body came from—I named Stockwell<lb/>grove.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Repeat the words as you told him, you told him what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him that I had come respecting the funeral of Raven, and he told me it was out of the district, Dr. Vaughan did—I told him it was the wish of the parents—that was all that passed—there was nothing more passed between him and me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just relate what you said to him, as nearly as you can, about Raven? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I first applied to him, he refused to take it, on account of its being out of the district—he knew it was out of the district by looking at the certificate—I do not know what has become of the receipt—it is a general thing when we have a receipt and the money is paid for the bill, to give them up to the parties who employ us—I do not know whether I gave it up to them or not, but I cannot find the receipt any<lb/>where at home, therefore I expect it has been destroyed—I suppose so because, at the expiration of the year, such things as invoices and these receipts of that description we do not take any account of, they are gene<lb/>rally perhaps burnt; I mean invoices that we have with goods, and so on, that have been compared with the bills.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you have been twice asked what conversation passed—you said he looked at the certificate and said it was out of the district; then you said he would know from the certificate that it was out of the district? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do not recollect whether I did say, I do not believe I did say that it was out of the district myself, or where it came from—I do not know that I told him it came from Stockwell<lb/>grove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sexton of Brixton Church. I was so in the year 1854—in the month of Sept. in that year there were a good many deaths from cholera in that district—there were a good many funerals taking place at that time in the churchyard at Brixton—I do not know how many there were in the month of Sept, there were a great number, I cannot say exactly—the late Mr. Thorogood was churchwarden at the time, and he wished for none to be taken out of the district, as the deaths were go numerous—he gave that direction as the deaths were so numerous—in the month of Sept. I remember seeing Mr. Frederick Haydon with regard to the funeral of a person of the name of Raven—Mr. Haydon came to me on the night before the funeral—I do not remember the day of the week, it was the latter end of the week, I do not remember exactly—he came about the interment of Mr. Raven, of Stockwell-grove—I had not known Mr. Raven particularly in his life time—I knew him personally, and knew where he lived—I refused to take the intermept without the Doctor's consent, and 1 went up to the Doctor the next morning and mentioned to the Doctor that Mr. Haydon, the undertaker, had got a man of the name of Raven that wished to be buried at Brixton Church—in a very short time Mr. Haydon came up himself, and the Doctor refused to take it—the Doctor was in his study at his residence at the time Haydon came up—I was in the study at the same time—I was very often at the house—I sometimes assisted there as waiter—I was not waiting there that morning—I acted as waiter when they had dinners there, and this morning I was with the Doctor in his study—at the time Haydon came the Doctor was in his study—I let Haydon in—the house door was closed—I went to open the door, because we saw Mr. Haydon coming up the hill—the conversation took place outside, on the front door steps of the Doctor's residence—the Doctor came to the front door—Mr. Haydon said he wanted the interment to take place at Brixton Church of a man of the name of Raven, in the Kennington district—the Doctor made answer, and said he could not take it at single fees, but he would take it at double fees—then Mr. Haydon paid the Doctor, and the Doctor made answer, and said, "If any one should ask where the funeral came from, or what fees were paid, tell a lie, and say Robert-street"—that was all that passed—I was at the funeral as sexton, Mr. Eastman performed the service.</p>

               <p>Vaughan's together, and rang at the bell, and were let in by the servant—the second time I went before Mr. Elliott, I said that I went up first and let Haydon in—my going first to the Doctor's was correct—when I said that I had gone with Haydon, I did not recollect at the time—I did not say before Mr. Elliott the first time, that I met Haydon by arrangement, and went with him to the Doctor's—I think I did not—I stated that I and Haydon went together, and either rang, or knocked at the door, and the servant let us in—and on the second occasion, I stated that I had gone up first, and that I let Haydon in—I did go up first—I do not recollect who let me in that morning, when I got to the Doctor's—I know the servant Smith, very well—I do not recollect who let me in—I think I stated so at Lambeth—Haydon and I did not go up there together, I am quite sure—I was let in to the Doctor in his study—the study opens into the hall almost close to the street door—it is a small room—any body in that room could hear very well what was taking place in the passage—except in the winter time, the study door is kept open by a weight, the room being small—the Doctor came out of the study and stood at the front door talking to Haydon, in my presence, and never moved from the door until he returned to the library again, not till the whole thing was over, and then he went back to the library as far as I can remember, I think he did not come out again—I did not expect Haydon there that morning—we bad made no arrangement, but from the library window you can see any one coming—I did not expect him to come—I cannot say what I went up to see the Doctor about that morning—it might be about some funerals—I do not recollect particularly what it was—I did not know that Haydon was coming there that morning—we had made no arrangement whatever—I do not recollect at all whether he was coming there, that morning—I do not recollect whether I knew that he was coining—Haydon and I have not talked about this matter fre<lb/>quently since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that before Haydon was examined as a witness, you and he had had no conversation on this subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the police court only, we met coming up from Brixton—we did not come to the police court together, part of the way we did—we did not converse about anything particular on this subject—of course it was a very serious case, that was all that passed—I will swear that there was no conversation about the details.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you whether you did not, yourself, give Dr. Vaughan the name of Robert-street, as the last place of abode of the deceased man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect any thing of it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you, in the presence of Mr. Joseph Vaughan, give the Doctor the place of abode of the deceased, Raven, to be entered in the rough book as of Robert-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir—not to my knowledge, I did not—I can swear I did not—I will swear it—I do swear it—I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law book auctioneer, of Fleet-street, and live at Brixton-hill, in the district of St. Matthew. In 1844 and 1845 I was senior churchwarden of the district Church, churchwarden of the incumbent—I know of no interference on the part of the churchwardens with the funerals or interments that took place; there were three applications to me, sent by the request, I suppose, of the incumbent—I said, "I do not know why this is put to me"—there are more letters, I do not know whether they refer to this point or not—I find in the rough book of Sept, 1854, this entry of the funeral of Raven, "William Raven, Robert-street, 33, 3 G.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The only means of the Doctor knowing it, would be by the sexton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not being present, I cannot say—the certificate is another means, but that would not show that I had buried the party—there was no other curate but me at that time—I did not send for Haydon to give evidence against Dr. Vaughan at the police court—I swear that.</p>

George East<lb/>man ")—the "George Eastman "is in Dr. Vaughan's writing—by the rough book (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) there were, I think, about sixty-two interments in Sep<lb/>tember, 1854—I cannot exactly tell you, from the statement in Dr. Vaughan's writing, how many of those were burials out of the district, because some words are ambiguous—Stockwell might be in Brixton or in Kennington—I do not see an entry in this rough book in Dr. Vaughan's writing, which is beyond all question out of the district.</p>

"Sept. 14th, 1854. Dear Sir,—I am truly sorry that you should have been requested by several of the inhabitants who are located near to Brixton Church to call my attention to the interment of considerable numbers of persons who are not resident in the district. In reply, I beg to say that if, instead of disturbing your mind, being at a distance, they had kindly called upon me, I would instantly have given them proof that they had been misinformed I regret to say that Mr. Thorogood has so frightened Malby that I have serious lean for his life. Dr. Ray ordered him this morning to go home and go to bed instantly. Strange to say, Mr. Thorogood commanded him not to toll the bell, and not to take any cholera cases. This day I refused to take five funerals from the borders of the district, and I wish you had been present to witness the heartrending scene of the applicants in not being allowed to fulfil the wish of the deceased, by being buried with their relations in Brixton churchyard The sixth case I could not refuse: the fact is, if you will refer to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, you will find in seven weeks, Brixton had only twenty-one cases of cholera; and what are these in a population of upwards of 14,000?

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Dr. Vaughan, and have been so nearly three years, as housemaid. I was with him in Sept, 1854, and one day in that month saw Malby, and another man, who I have seen since, and whose name is Haydon—he is the person who was examined against my master—I do not recollect the day of the month, but I had not seen Haydon on any other occasion—it was about the middle of the day—I was in the kitchen, heard a knock at the door, and went to open it—I found Malby at the door, and Haydon standing at the bottom of the steps—Malby said that he wanted to see the Doctor concerning the funeral of Mr. Raven—I went into the study, the Doctor was there—the study door was shut—I opened it, and saw Miss Lydia Vaughan, Miss Decima Vaughan, and Mr. Joseph Vaughan was sitting at his desk—I delivered the message which I had been desired to give, and the Doctor said that he could not be troubled with it, but that he must go to the churchwardens—I went to the door, but did not deliver the message, as the Doctor followed me out too quickly, and told Malby that he would not be troubled with it, he must go to the churchwardens—I did not hear either Malby or Haydon make any reply, they went away—I shut the door and went about my work, and the Doctor returned to his study—when the Doctor told Malby he must go to the churchwardens, I was standing by the door—the Doctor did not go into his study and write any receipt or paper, he did not leave the door—he did not receive any money from Haydon—Haydon did not speak to him—the Doctor did not say to Haydon, "You must tell a lie, and say it was in Robert-street," nor to Malby, or to any one at all.</p>

I believe—it was in the evening—I should say that I went at half past 7 o'clock, but cannot say the exact time—I re<lb/>turned about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I was only there about a quarter of an hour—I distinctly recollect the name of Raven.</p>
