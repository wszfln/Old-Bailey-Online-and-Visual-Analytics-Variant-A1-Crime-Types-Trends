(<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "W. G. Wood, provision merchant and Italian warehouseman, 257, Broad Street, Birmingham.")

                  </hi>. I am the Secretary of the Tea Company, Limited, of 52, Crutched Friars—in July last Leach brought me this card bearing the name of T. Edwards—samples of tea <hi rend="italic">were</hi> shown to him, and a few days afterwards, I think on the 11th, he called and gave us an order which was executed about the 16th, and promptly paid for on the Satur<lb/>day following the delivery—Saturday is the usual pay day in our trade—I afterwards executed another order to T. Edwards which was also paid for—between the 23rd and 27th July, orders were received from Edwards for tea to the amount of 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these orders were executed, and would become payable on 28th July—on that day I went to No. 10, Sparrow; Corner, in consequence of the messenger returning with a communication, and I found that the place was shut up—I supplied the goods, believing Edwards to be dealing in the regular course of trade—I have never been paid for them—I made inquiries, and in consequence of information I went to Birmingham on Sunday, 29th July—I did not see Leach, Stephen-son, or Edwards—I returned to London—in consequence of receiving further information, I again went to Birmingham on the 1st August, and called at Messrs. Stephenson and Son's, of Dale End, on Thursday, the 2nd, with a Birmingham detective, and Sergeant Fluister, a City of London detective—I had some conversation with the prisoner Stepheuson, in the presence of Fluister—I produced a list and asked him if he had any of the goods named in it—Fluister told Stephenson that we had come respect<lb/>ing some goods that had been obtained by fraud—I had previously made out a list of goods that I and others had lost—Stephenson said, in answer to my question, after looking at the list, "I think I have, will you step round?"—we then went round to the front premises—this is the list—I have made pencil marks of Stephenson's explanations as he gave them as we went through the list item by item—the first is ten boxes of scented caper, marked 591—600, which he said he had sold on the Monday or Tuesday—the same remark was made as to the second item of ten boxes—those were marked 25th and 27th—I did not explain to Stephenson what these meant, but they are the dates of delivery at Sparrow Corner—the next item is "Two chests of Assam tea ex Duke of <hi rend="italic">Buccleuch"</hi>—that I have marked "One sold on Tuesday," and "One here"—then "Four chests of tea "Stephenson said he had not received—"Four boxes gunpowder in mats: sold on Wednesday"—" One bale of Cork: here"—"Macpherson and Co. two chests of Assam: sold on Tuesday"—"Thirty boxes caper: sold Tuesday"—"Ten boxes caper: sold Tuesday"—" Four boxes gunpowder: here"—Nine chests of Congou: delivered yesterday and Tuesday"—that means that Stephenson told me they were sold on Tuesday—several items are marked "Here"—one labelled "Thorn and Co." is marked "London, wait"—of twenty-four kegs of mustard seven had been told, and of a number of 14lb. parcels of soluble cocoa, 4 cwt. had been sold—of twenty-eight boxes of pearl</p>

"He looked at it and said "Well, I did not notice that"—after that I asked him if he had any objection to Sergeant Fluister marking it—he said "No"—I asked him how it was paid, he said "Partly by cheque and partly in cash"—I asked him to show me the "heel," meaning the counterfoil of the cheque—he did so—it was for 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked again how was the remainder paid?—he said "In cash"—I remarked "It was a good deal of money to pay in cash," and he explained that having a lot of loose cash in the house he had used it for that purpose—I asked him if the cheque had been paid—he said he did not know, but would send round to his bankers and see—I suggested that he should stop payment of it if not paid—he agreed to do so, and sent his son with a note to the bank—his son returned and said it had not been paid, and that he had stopped the payment—the cheque was drawn on Stephenson's own account—I asked him who consigned the goods to him, and he said "Edwards"—I said "Have you the advices?"—he said "Yes;" and he produced two files of delivery notes, one, I believe, of the Great Western and the other the Midland—as to the advices he said he had heaps of them and he made search for them, both in his counting-house and in the inner office, but he failed to find any—my attention was called to this delivery note which was pro<lb/>duced before the Magistrate, and marked F—there were several of that description—I called Stephenson's attention to the name "Marshall" on it</p>

               <p>and said "These have been consigned from Marshall, not from Edwards'—he looked at it, and said "Well, I never noticed it before"—he made the same remark as to the others that we found in that name—they are dated in June and July—we brought none of them away—two of them have no names, but are marked "M." in a diamond, which I take to be the trade mark of Edwards and Co., of Sparrow Corner, because it was on small pieces of cardboard, which were tacked on to everything that came from there—I went a second time to Stephenson's with Sergeant Fluister in consequence of a telegram Fluister had received from London from Inspector Bailey, of 26, Old Jewry, "Get goods at railway sent back, those at Stephenson's not to be disposed of. Trace such as have been sold and give notice to parties not to part with them." We showed Stephenson the telegram, and Fluister said "Tell us the names and addresses of those to whom you have sold the balance of the goods"—Stephenson said he would not do so—then he was shown the telegram, for which he said he did not care, but we must bring a great deal more of pressure to bear upon him than that before he would give up the names of his customers, and he said "It would frighten a little grocer to death to go and tell him that he had goods which had been obtained by fraud, but I will write to them and tell them not to dispose of them; or I will jump in my trap and drive round-and tell them personally, which will perhaps be the best way"—he also asked me "How much have you lost?"—I said "I represent about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth"—my own loss was about 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one or two other gentle<lb/>men went to Birmingham on the first occasion—I gave them information—Stephenson's is a large wholesale place of business with a very varied stock, including, bacon, hams, boots and shoes, macintoshes, pipes, cigars, saddle-cloths, string, tea, coffee, sugar, rice, and cocoa; in fact, I do not think you could mention anything that was not in the place—I said "I should say you must have a very large experience to be enabled to dispose of them advantageously"—he said "I am the only man in Birmingham that can buy for cash and sell for credit, I have goods from all over the country."</p>

Thorn and Co. had given me the marks and numbers to enable me to identify their goods, and I found those marks and numbers still on—I took the name of Marshall to be the consignor, as I had found out in London that goods were sent in the name of Marshall—the date of the cheque did not excite my suspicion—I told Stephenson, in the first part of our conversation, that goods were traced to his premises. I think—Stephenson volunteered to go through the list with me, and took me round the shop and through the warehouse in order that I might point anything out I could identify.</p>

Edwards's card was brought—Leach was not the man who brought it—he brought samples of tea, and father looked over them—I was not present when the order was given—there was an invoice—the traveller came several times—he did not give his own name—these 12 invoices came with the goods—I did not know of the name of Marshall till my attention was called to it—it is usual to put the carman's name on the delivery note—each invoice has the usual men. on it, such as "The above are duly forwarded by the Midland Railway Company to your address"—the goods were marked off against the invoices upon arrival—I was present on the 30th of July when the account was made up—the pencillings on the invoices were my father's, and the totals brought forward, and there is the receipt for the payment of that invoice to the amount of 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was present when that was paid, not when the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on account—it is dated July 23, that was on a Monday—both are receipted as cash payments; the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is signed "W. S."—the pencilling carries forward eight invoices, and leaves a balance of 416<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I called over our customer's cheques to my father—I called over the six cheques—175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was paid in gold and silver—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a counterfoil of the cheque of the 30th July for 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the traveller went away with the money and the cheques—there was a small allowance made of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods sent which were not ordered—nothing was said about any other goods being at the railway-station—no invoice was sent to my father in respect of the goods which, were stopped at the railway-station—on 2nd August a gentleman came from London at my father's request—I went to the bank and stopped a cheque there—I was present when my father took Mr. Howard through the premises, and the private marks of the original dealers were found on certain tea chests and other things there—they were not separated from the other stock, and my father promised that they should not be disposed of, and they are now as they were when Mr. Howard saw them—I also showed them to Mr. Spendler and Mr. Hudson, and also the invoices—my father was paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, with the duty, for the Assam tea in chest No. 1101, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the 10 boxes of gunpowder, in chest No. 1331—I cannot recollect when my father was summoned to the Mansion House—Mr. Hudson and Mr. Spendler called two or three days after that—my father entered into contract for buildings in the spring of</p>

               <p>1876—the buildings were going on for nearly 15 months—I knew Thomas Peate, a builder, of Lower Pershore Street; he undertook to supply the timber for the building—there was no more timber there than would be required—Peate used to make the stairs, the window frames, and also the wood for the slates—between 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Peate altogether—he had nothing to do with my father's business—I remember a purchase of hops in December, 1875—the prisoner Leach had nothing to do with that—I do not remember seeing Leach at my father's warehouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WADDY</hi>. I do not think this is the photograph of the Leach that had to do with my father's business—I do not recognise it—the hops were bought from a Thomas Leach—I may have seen the prisoner Leach, but not to know him—I do not remember it—I believe I have seen him, I do not remember where or when—I never had any transactions with a Mr. Marshall, or any firm or company of that name—I do not remember it; I might forget it—Edwards supplied us with groceries—my duty was to receive goods into stock and sell them—I did not always know where they came from—I may therefore have had dealings with Marshall and not know it—I do not believe I did—the cheque dated 30th July is signed "A. Marshall"—I do not know who that is—we dealt with several people in Liverpool: T. Davis and Co. of Johnston Street, Messrs. Fowler Brothers of Victoria Street, and James Watson—I do not remember any others—possibly I should have known if there had been A. Marshall of Liverpool—my father would not tell me everything he did—I did not always check the goods with the invoices—my father checked some and our warehouseman some—I do not know W. S. Johnson personally—I believe I have seen him—I know a Thomas Johnson, a butcher in Birmingham—he is not the "W. S. Johnson"—I do not know Mr. Ballans—I do not remember hearing of him or seeing him—I have no means here of telling you for what goods that 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of A. Marshall was paid—"W. S." is Edwards's traveller, the man that called at our place—we seldom ask the travellers their names, we are contented with knowing the firms they represent—I do not know George Edwards—I have been a partner with my father since I was 21—I have been in the business 12 years—I cannot tell you who G. Edwards was, to whom my father paid the cheque on 16th Nov., 1876, or the cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 5th February, 1875—my father ordered goods from Edwards and Co.—I have no press copy of it; it was verbal, and given to the traveller—I do not know the exact quantity of goods that were ordered—about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were sent that were not ordered—I do not know whether Peate was a grocer as well as a builder—I do not remember my father giving Peate a cheque on the building account and another on the groceries—I will not swear he did not, I do not know anything about it—Mr. J. Wood is a butcher, and was on 14th October, 1876—we bought green hams of him—he failed and vanished from Birmingham, but was afterwards con<lb/>victed as a fraudulent bankrupt—my father dealt with him in 1875 and again in 1876—Samuel Johnson is a butcher in Summer Lane—a Mr. W. S. Johnson, with whom we had transactions, commenced business in Liverpool as the Yorkshire Kitchen Range Company—I do not know what became of him, he may be there now for what I know; I believe he is—I do not know of any inquiries for grates at my father's premises alleged to have been obtained from him and</p>

               <p>by him from the Alma Works, at Rotherham—we dealt with him for 12 months—he is the only Johnson we have dealt with—I know Detective Seal—I do nut remember his coming about some grates we had from Johnson—we have some of the grates still, some we have sold by private contract—I know a Mr. John Ward, a horse-dealer—I have seen his writing—he does not write as well as <hi rend="italic">this (looking at a cheque</hi>)—I know W. S. Johnson's writing—I think <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is his (<hi rend="italic">a cheque</hi>)—I do not know that W. S. Johnson was engaged in Edwards's concerns—Samuel Johnson is another person, and is a butcher in Summer Lane—I do not know George Johnson—the two Johnsons in Birmingham are brothers, but no relation to the Johnson who sells grates—I do not know Mr. Edwards—my father never saw him, I believe—I cannot <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you the names of our customers whose cheques my father used—I dare say I could find out—Charles Cocks, of Henley-in Arden, is one, and Mr. Crawley in the Aston Road—my father was in America for two years—he returned about 18 years ago—I do not remember Sergeant Spokes coming to my father in 1873 about some Melton Mowbray pies—I do not remember some men starting a place in Birmingham for the sale of musical instruments, or a piano being traced to my father's—I am not aware that three men, Edward Pole, Thomas Evans, and Albert Holland, obtained 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of oil from Mr. England of Hull—T do not remember Sergt. Black coming about it—I have heard of a Mr. Jenkins, but not of his obtaining a quantity of condensed milk from a firm at Sharlow, near Derby—I do not know that that milk was traced to my father's premises—I do not remember Mr. Jenkins travelled in groceries—I believe my father bought of him, but won't say as to milk one way or the other—I do not remember J. E. Phillip and Co. of Swansea—there is a firm of wine-merchants of that name at Bristol—I know we bought a beer-engine—I don't know who from, or the address of the person—our books are here—they won't Tell me—we do not enter dry goods—the beer-engine was taken to the Old Engine public-house—the house belonged to William Wright—my father had a bill of sale aver the Old Engine—we sell groceries from the invoices—I know a Mr. Knight, a provision-dealer of New Town Row, Birmingham—I do not think he was convicted—I saw him a few weeks ago—we bought goods from him—Geo. D. Robinson, I believe, still carries on business in Birmingham—I believe there was a charge against him for obtaining corks from a Liverpool firm—the corks were not found at my father's premises—we never had them—I did not know Sparrow and Peate—I never saw Messrs. Lea of Manchester—my father saw them—I did not know till this trial that Lea and Peate were the same men—I thought they were respectable trading men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk attached to the Missing Letter Department of the Post-office—on the 23rd October, in consequence of instructions I received, I made up two test letters; one containing 211 penny postage stamps, marked so that I might again identify them, addressed to Mr. James McMichael—I posted them at the S. W. District Office, Buckingham Gate, about 7 o'clock the same evening; and the second letter, containing a first half of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, of which I kept a memorandum of the date and number; and I also identify it by my own private mark on each half—the police officer has that—they were dispatched from the S. W. District Office about 7.40—some short time after that I proceeded to Chelsea, where the first letter would be delivered at about 9 o'clock, and the second one about 9.30</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187711190045"/>
               <p>—I went to the address of the letter containing the stamps, namely, 207, King's Road—it is an heraldic office—the shop being shut up, I stayed in the passage, and a letter-carrier knocked at the door and put two letters through the aperture—the test letter I Dad made up containing the stamps was not there—I then went after the prisoner William James, and saw him deliver the letters in Paulton Square—the other letter containing the first half of the note was addressed to Paulton House—I went to Paulton House and saw the prisoner William James delivering letters there—he passed by Paulton House and turned down Bedford Street into Little Camera Street—he was previously accosted by another man, and they went into Little Camera Street together—he had finished his delivery as far as I knew—I thought, at first, the other man was the prisoner Joseph—they then went into Langton Street—I ascertained afterwards that they went into 31, Little Camera Street, which is where Joseph lives—I afterwards saw "William James and another man go into 33, Langton Street—I would not swear whether it was the same man I saw him with in Camera Street—I was not very close—the next morning I made up another test letter with the remaining half of the £5 Bank of England note, which I also posted at the S.W. District Post-office, Buckingham Gate, the same morning—it would go from there to Chelsea at about 11 o'clock, and would be in the prisoner William James's delivery about 12 o'clock—I went to Paulton Square and watched him delivering his letters—he did not deliver any letter at Paulton House, but passed the door—I next saw him about 1 o'clock, when he went into 33, Langton Street, which is his house, and I saw him come out again between 2 and 3 o'clock—he had on then, a private hat and private coat—lie was in uniform when I saw him go in about 1 o'clock—he was then coming from the direction of Little Camera Street, which would be about five minutes' walk from the limit of his delivery—Butler was with me when I saw him in his private clothes—we saw the prisoner come out and go into a house about a dozen doors off—when he came out of the door Butler crossed over and stopped him inside the gate—I came up and said ""We belong to the Post-office, what have you been in the house for?"—he replied "On business"—I said "Who resides there?"—he said "Mr. Turner"—I knocked at the door and went in and made some inquiries—when I came out, from what Butler told me, I gave the prisoner into custody, and he was taken to the police-station in a cab—I there told him that three letters I had posted were missing—I told him where they were addressed to—he said he knew nothing about them—he was searched and nothing was found on him relating to this charge—I afterwards went with Butler to the prisoner's house, 33, Langton Street—we made a search there, and afterwards went to Joseph Delaney's house, 31, Little Camera Street, and met him coming out of the house—Butler spoke to him—I did not hear what he said—he said "Your name is Joseph Delaney," and he said "Yes"—I walked behind them into the house downstairs into the front kitchen, where Butler put some questions to him, and told him he was a police-officer attached to the Post-office, and that his brother William James was in custody for stealing post-letters and bank notes—he appeared surprised, and Butler said we should have to make a search, and had he anything about him—he said "Yes, two letters and a news<lb/>paper," producing them from his pocket, "which I was about to post when you stopped me"—Butler said "We shall have to make a search"</p>

               <p>—he said "You are quite at liberty"—Butler said "We will commence with you"—" Oh, no, you won't," he said—I saw something in his hand and seized him by the wrist—we fell over the clothes horse, which was broken, and after a severe struggle, his mother and sister coming to his assistance, I succeeded in getting this paper from his hand, which is black from coming in contact with the bars of the grate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—his hand was almost in the fire when I seized it and got the paper from him, which was the identical bank-note which was in the two test letters, but which had been joined together, and in the struggle had been torn again—it is endorsed "Hy. Thompson, 3, Trinity Square, London, S., Octr. 4, 1877"—that endorsement was not on it when I put it in the letters—it was a perfectly new clean note, except my marks, which were not visible—the letters found on him which he was going to post are in the same handwriting as the endorsement on the note, and the two postage stamps on them I identify as two of the stamps in the letter to Mr. McMichael—they both bear my mark—after I secured the note he was allowed to get up, and Butler searched him and found in his pocket a piece of loose paper with 209 postage stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), making, with the two on the letter, 211—they are the same as those enclosed, and bear my private mark—I told him I identified them as mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer attached to the Post-office—on the evening of the 23rd October I was engaged watching the prisoner William with Mr. Stevens—I saw him finish his delivery, and fling his bag across his shoulders and go into Camera Street and meet the prisoner Joseph—I am positive it was Joseph—he did not deliver a letter at Poulton House—I know the addresses of the letters and saw them, viz.: one to Mr. McMichael, Heraldic Office, 207, King's Road, Chelsea, another to Mrs. B. Neville, Paulton House, Paulton Square, Chelsea, and the other to Mrs. Neville also, but not to Paulton House, but Paulton Square—when he met Joseph they went to Little Camera Street—I left them, and after<lb/>wards saw William with another man, not the prisoner—on the 24th I saw William come out of his house, 33, Langton Street, at 2 o'clock—I had been in Paulton Square previously—I told him I was an officer from the General Post-office, and I pointed to Mr. Stevens crossing the road, and I said "This gentleman is also from the General Post-office, and wants to speak to you about some missing letters," and we all went on the steps leading to the house—as soon as Mr. Stevens got in the prisoner sud<lb/>denly jumped off' the stops and tried to get away—I jumped alter him, and caught him him before ho got out of the gate, and he tore his coat in the struggle Mr. Stevens came out and told me to take him to the police-station, which I did, and I then searched him—we went to Joseph's</p>

               <p>house, and I said "A police-officer from the Post-office wants to speak to you"—we went back into the house and I said "Tour brother the letter-carrier is in custody charged with stealing letters; I saw you in his com<lb/>pany last night—there is some property missing which he has stolen, and I have reason to believe you know something about it." He said "I did meet my brother last night, but know nothing about the letters." I said "What have you got about you?" He said "Two letters and a news<lb/>paper which I am going to post." I took those from him and said "Is that all?" He said "Yes." I said "I shall have to make search." He said "Ton are quite welcome to search, where you like." As I was going to search him he thrust his hand into his pocket and went to the fireplace and burnt his fingers by coming in contact with the bars—the ladies came in and a violent struggle ensued—afterwards in his bedroom I was about to search him again, when he became more calm—I took some stamps from his pocket which he said were his own. I counted them, and there were 209.</p>

I found and placed them with other letters on the prisoner William's seat for him to sort—they were not for his delivery that evening, but he should have treated them as mis-sorts, and thrown them out—he left the office about 8.35—they ought not to have been delivered at their different addresses that night by him, but by different postmen—on the morning of the '24th October I locked out for another letter addressed to Mrs. Neville—the bag arrived from the south-west district office at 11.8—there was an unlabelled bundle amongst them—from instructions I received that letter would be in that bundle, and I placed it on his seat to sort, which it was his duty to sort as mis-sorts—he left the office for his delivery at about 11.20.</p>

I live at 23, Great Marlborough Street, and am a clerk to Mr. Alsopp, solicitor—on the 21st September I attended before Mr. Justice Fry, on the hearing of the judgment summons which has been produced, when the affidavit of Mr. Silver was read—the defendant was sworn and admitted that the contents of the affidavit were accurate, but he could not say to a penny as to the amount—I asked him what he had done with the money in hand, about 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he had paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Court of Chancery pursuant to an order in an action by his partner since the date of the judgment—upon that statement being made, Mr. Justice Fry said he could make no order and dismissed the summons—I saw the defendant sworn—I went to the Accountant-General's office in the Court of Chancery on the 16th October, and have searched the books from time to time, from the date of the judgment, and there is no entry of the payment of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him—I served the defendant's clerk at his office with a written notice to produce his books, and I called for them before Mr. Justice Fry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Magistrate—I always give my evidence perfectly correctly when on oath—upon my asking for the books the defendant's solicitor asked for an adjournment for a week—if you take the context of the depositions you will find I said "I swear they did not offer me an adjournment for a week"—I say now they did offer me an adjournment for a week—I called for the books to be produced—they said the books were not there, and he said he would get them from Southampton Buildings, if it were adjourned for a week—I said "He only offered to produce the books if there were an adjournment for a week"—I refused the adjournment—it was not then that he said he could not tax his memory as to dates—I don't think anything was said about dates—the books were to prove the amounts—I swear that—there were no notes taken of the proceedings—I rely on my memory.</p>

                  </hi>. Hive at Yardley, near Birmingham—I attended with the defendant at Judge's chambers on the 21st September on his behalf for Mr. St. Aubyn, solicitor—Mr. Alsopp's clerk tendered Mr. Silver's affidavit—I am not certain whether Mr. Justice Fry read it or not—I read it to myself and referred to the defendant upon it—I remember now Mr. Justice Fry did read it, and then he said "What answer have you to make"—I told him we had no means of paying, and I tendered the defendant for examination—he was then cross-examined, and he was asked if he produced his books, and he said "No, I had no intention of attending the summons until I met Mr. Lawrence, who advised me to attend it myself, otherwise I was not going to do so; my solicitor was going to apply for an adjournment," or "had arranged an adjournment"—Mr. Justice Fry looked at the summons and said "Oh, your office is not far off, you can get the books in ten minutes"—upon that I volun<lb/>teered an adjournment for half an hour to produce the books, but before that conversation took place they proceeded to cross-examine or examine the defendant, and I said, to cut the matter short, "We admit having received the amounts mentioned in the affidavit, but we do not admit the dates specified"—Mr. Justice Fry then said to them "Do you wish the books produced, if so, take an adjournment for half an hour, but mind if you proceed with the case, and ask for an adjournment at the end. I shall refuse it"—they elected to proceed—the very words used were, "We will go on now"—I pointed out to Mr. Justice Fry the fact that certain sums were mentioned in the affidavit as having been received—we admitted these sums, and were perfectly willing to show how they were disposed of, but the dates they said we received them were not correct, and that had arisen in this way; upon the signing of the contract for sale of the public-house a certain deposit was placed in the defendant's hands, and he anti<lb/>cipated his commission, and therefore on certain days, sworn to in the affidavit, there was little or nothing to receive—then they proceeded to examine him as to how he disposed of this money—first of all he said he paid his late partner 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle a Chancery suit, either in the Rolls or the Exchequer, I don't know which—he went on to say he had paid his office rent, and the rent of his private house—he did not say he had paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a Chancery suit to his partner since the date of the judgment—he said he had paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the money which they said he had received to settle a Chancery suit brought against him by his late partner, Fletcher White—Mr. Justice Fry then said "Did you pay the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before or since the date of the judgment?"—the reply was "I am not sure, I believe I paid some before and some since, but if I produce my books I can show you"—he said it was paid in several sums—upon that Mr. Justice Fry posted up on the corner of his blotting paper the sums he had paid, and said "You have not proved to me that this man has means"—at the end they asked for an adjournment—this receipt of the</p>

I am the wife of Henry Darling, of 4, Amersham Villas, New Cross—the prisoner was in our service for about five months—on the 23rd September she went out for a holiday, and in consequence of some matters that had come to my knowledge I went into her bed-room and examined her boxes, in one of which I found 4 yards of coloured lace, which I had given 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, some black lace given me by my brother, two pairs of linen cuffs, a small pair of white kid gloves belonging to my little girl, and several other articles; in another box, locked, I found a pair of ear-rings belonging to my daughter (<hi rend="italic">property produced</hi>)—I identify these articles—I found the keys in the washstand drawer and took them out and unlocked the box—the lace had been on two different dresses at different times—I bought it at a large linen-draper's at Croydon—I found the pieces of the blanket between the prisoner's bed and mattress, rolled up—I have never found the remainder of it—the prisoner returned home in the evening—I understood she had no home, and I did not send her away, it being past 10 o'clock—next morning I asked her how she came to tear up one of my good blankets—she said she had not—I said "Who has done it if you have not?"—she said she did not know—after a time she said she tore it up for house flannels—I then said "There are things that I have found in your boxes, belonging to me, that I have taken out, and after finding these things, and being so deceived in you, I should not think of your remaining in my service any longer; pack up your things and at once go"—she went, and at the expiration of a week she came back for the remainder of her things—several things were then missing, a silver watch amongst other things—Mr. Darling, being at home, spoke to her about the things missing—she said she knew she took the things found in the boxes, but had not taken the watch—I said "We will give you time to bring it back, and if you do not I shall lock you up"—she was very pert about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not think the lace is quite common—it is rather an uncommon pattern—I tried to match it at several shops and could not—can swear to the ear-rings, they belong to my daughter—they may have been mended—they were given her by an old friend—I was at the police-court—when the prisoner's father was called the Magis<lb/>trate asked him to give a description of some ear-rings about which he was going to give evidence, and I believe he did so, before any ear-rings</p>

               <p>were put in his hand—he said she had a pair, and he had mended them—they were afterwards put in his hand—I believe my daughter gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this feather—it was in the prisoner's hat over a feather of her own which she had bought and which she left behind with some of her things—I don't know what good the other part of the blanket would be unless she made a petticoat of it, which I taxed her with—I thought very likely she had—she has done the same thing in other places where she has been—I swear to all the articles positively.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

I am the wife of Alfred Souter, and am the prosecutrix's daughter—these coral ear-rings are mine—I don't live with my mother now, I did when the prisoner was in my mother's service—they were my property then, and I kept them in a box—I went away from home in September, and when I came back I missed them—I know this feather by a dent in the stem—it was kept in a box in my room—I missed that also—I have since searched to find both the ear-rings and feather, but they had disappeared.</p>

I live at Chapel Place, Greenwich, and have worked for Penn's, the engineers, for about 18 years—my daughter, before she went into Mr. Darling's service, had some trinkets—these are the ear<lb/>rings I saw at the police-court—I remember her having them somewhere about 15or 16 months ago—it is 12 months last July since I first noticed them—they lay on my mantel-shelf—I tied them in the branches of a fuchsia, and tried to persuade my wife and daughters that it was a new-fashioned flower, and my girl tied them in her ears with a bit of thread—on another occasion I remember her having some little ring wires, and one of the catches was bad, and when she tried to take them out of her ears she cut her ear and it was bad for some time—this top came off and she asked me to mend it, and I mended it with shellac, and it seemed to come off again, and then the girl tried to mend it herself—there is a bit of shellac on this—I have not the slightest doubt that these are the earnings—when I was called at Greenwich I gave a similar description before they were put into my hand—Mr. Carter asked me did I notice a flower or figure on them, and I told him, to the best of my recollection, there was a flower, and when I came to look at them I found they answered the description I had given.</p>

On 28th October I received information of this robbery, in consequence of which I looked for the prisoner—I found him on the 30th at a place called Moat Farm, about two miles from Canterbury—he was sitting in the kitchen of the farm house—I was in plain clothes—I told him who I was, and that I was there respecting a watch that had been stolen on the Saturday night previous—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said "Were you at Sturry on Saturday last?"—he said "No"—I said "Were you in Can<lb/>terbury that same day?"—he said, "No"—I then said 'Have you a watch about you?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Allow me to look at it"—he took this watch from his pocket, and handed it to me—I then charged with highway robbery with violence and stealing from the per<lb/>son of John Andrews one watch and chain at Broad Oak Hill, Sturry, about 5 o'clock on Saturday, the 27th—he made no reply—this is the watch and chain with the button attached.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Meopham, Kent—on the night of 23rd October I went round my house before going to bed, about 10.15—I particularly noticed the back kitchen window, it was fastened by a common spring catch—I awoke between 5 and 6 next morning—I got up about 7.15—when I got down stairs I found the kitchen window open sufficiently wide to admit a man—it must have been opened with a chisel or some-thing of that kind—there were marks of some instrument—the spring fastening was broken off and thrown under the kitchen-table—I missed two pair of boots, a coat, and a waterproof from the kitchen, and on going into the other rooms I missed two coats from a door, a greatcoat that hung across a chair in the back parlour, and several little work-boxes and writing-desks from the shelves, which I afterwards found in the garden—in another room I found that two or three boxes had been broken open and the contents strewed about the room, and some carried away—amongst other things I missed a Paisley shawl, and a clothes brush—I immediately went for the police, and in consequence of</p>

               <p>information I went from the station at Meopham to Fawcombe by the 10.30 train—I saw the prisoner get into a third-class carriage at Faw<lb/>combe—we went on in the train as far as Swanleigh, and there we tele<lb/>graphed on to Bickley—at Bickley we saw a fly, and we all got into the same carriage with the prisoner, and went on together to Bromley, where the prisoner was taken into custody—he was taken to the station there—I saw him searched, and the first thing he pulled out from his pocket was a very old-fashioned clothes brush—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I identify it as mine—it has been in our possession a number of years, ever since I can remember, and I had a new back put to it—this Paisley shawl was found wrapped round the prisoner's body, between his trousers and waistcoat—it is my wife's—she has had it fifteen or sixteen years—I can swear to it; it is constantly about with her wherever she goes, all day long—it always lies over the head of a couch when she is not well—I see it every day—there was nothing else found on him that I could identify.</p>

I am a signalman on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—I was on duty at the Meopham railway station on the night of 23rd October, when the last down train arrived, at 10.45—the prisoner, in company with another man, arrived by that train—they gave up tickets from the Elephant and Castle and passed out of the station—Mr. Light's house is about 100 yards from the station—I saw the prisoner again just before 12, just opposite Mr. Light's house, as I was closing the station gates—the other man was with him—they were coming from the direction of Nurstead—I asked them if they had mistaken their way—they made no reply—I asked them a second time, and the man not custody said Yes, they had been about three-quarters of a mile—I then asked them where they were bound for—they made no reply, but walked on, apparently half intoxicated, in the direction of Meopham Green—I watched hem up the road about a quarter of a mile, by the Fox and Hounds—next morning, in consequence of what I heard, I communicated. with the prosecutor—I first telegraphed to Fawcombe station, and then rent there with the prosecutor—it is about three miles from Meopham—saw the prisoner on the platform at the Fawcombe station—he entered he back part of the train—I went on in the train as far as Swanleigh and telegraphed from there to Bickley for the assistance of a police-constable, knowing there was one on the bridge there—at Bickley we all got into the same compartment with the prisoner, and at Bromley he was given</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman on board ship—on 10th November, about 10 or 11 p.m., I was at the "Wallace public-house, at the corner of London Bridge, calling for a pot of beer, when the prisoner came in and drew a knife across my throat—I put my hand up to save my throat, and my hand was cut—he ran out of the house, and I was taken to the hos<lb/>pital—we had had a row at a coffer-stall about 9 o'clock—the coffee-man pushed him down, and he got up and blamed me for it, and we went down the steps to fight, but two policemen prevented it, and we went to public-house and had a pint of beer together, and when we came out he aid "I must' have a couple of punches at you"'—I said "I shall have one at you if you give me one;" so he hit me in the eye, and I knocked him down and left him on the ground and went home—he was not insensible, but he would not get up—after this I went to the public-house—two or three "chaps" were with me when I was stabbed—my clothes were saturated with blood—the wound was rather on my chin. Joshua Towns. I keep a coffer-stall at the corner of London Bridge—10th November the prisoner asked me for a pipe of tobacco—I did at know him—he got too close to me—I pushed him and he fell in the mud—he got up directly—Leak had done nothing to him; he was talking me—they went away to fight, and I missed my knife off my stall—this is it—my stall is 20 yards from the Wallace.</p>
