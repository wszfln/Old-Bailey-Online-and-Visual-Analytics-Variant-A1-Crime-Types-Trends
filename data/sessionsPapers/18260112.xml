On the 11th of December, before eleven o'clock at night, I examined the street door - it was bolted; my servants and family had retired to bed before that. I was alarmed between three and four o'clock in the morning, by a ringing and knocking at the street door; I got up, opened my bed-room window, and saw several persons round the door, and heard persons coming up stairs. I went down to the kitchen, and found the kitchen area door open, and two large holes in it, which were apparently made with a centre-bit; they were large enough for a person's arm to be put through: the pieces of wood which were cut out of the holes were within the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Anne's, Soho. On the morning of the 12th of December, about a quarter past three o'clock, I was going down Nassau-street, on the opposite side, and saw a man at this door - I asked what he wanted there; he made no reply, but ran off; directly after that the prisoner ran out of the door, which was open, and down the steps; I am sure he is the man; I did not know him before: I had a good view of his features by the gas-light, and am certain he is the man; I directly called Stop thief! Leach, the watchman, sprang his rattle, and went after him. I went to the house, got a light, and went in at the street door with three or four more men - we went up, and alarmed the family; Mr. Cocker and I went into the kitchen, and found two holes in the area door; there is an arch over the door, which prevents a person being seen from the street. I heard a man was taken, and found the prisoner in the watch-house; I am certain he is the man; he had light thin shoes on; the gas-light was not far from the door, and on the same side. I had a good view of him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of King-street, and part of Nassau-street. I was at the top of Nassau-street; Stevens came by me, and walked down Nassau-street - I followed, and heard him say to a man at the prosecutor's door, "What do you do there?" he ran off; I followed, and then saw two men run down Nassau-street; I was nearly opposite Stevens; he told me to spring the rattle; I pursued - they turned into Gerrard-street, and round the corner into Grafton-street, but before that Cummins, a watchman, got between me and them; they ran faster than me, and thinking they might turn a corner I ran up Hayes-court, into Greek-street, and saw the prisoner come running up to the corner of Greek-street; he was one of the two I had pursued; he ran as fast as he could; I said, "If you don't stop I will knock you down;" he made no reply, but kept running on as fast as he could, and when I got nearer to him he made a kind of dart to avoid me, but I hit him on the head with my stick, and knocked him down; he was secured; I am sure he is the man who ran from Nassau-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get round to Greek-street? A. He ran up Litchfield-street a little way - there is then a turning. I found a crow-bar and lantern on the left hand side of Grafton-street; I saw nobody else passing all the way I pursued. The prisoner had very thin shoes on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does Litchfield-street cross Grafton-street? A. Yes - he got from there into Greek-street; I stopped him at the corner of Church-street and Greek-street.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 12th of December I was in Gerrard-street, coming towards Nassau-street, and heard Stevens saying, "What are you doing there?" I went on, and saw two men run from Nassau-street, and cross towards Gerrard-street - they turned towards me; I crossed to meet them: they ran back as hard as they could; I called Stop them! the rattles sprang; Cummins met them right under the gas-lamp; Leach and Cummins were full thirty yards before me. I lost sight of them, and went to No. 11, Nassau-street, with Stevens, to examine the house; we entered the street door, which was open; two holes were cut in the kitchen door, both the bolts undone, and the bar laid on the floor. I picked up two pieces of wood which had been cut out of the door - I produce them. A centre-bit has been applied in seven places in one hole, and six in the other.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was at my stand, and heard Stevens say, "What do you do there?" I looked over to Nassau-street, and saw a man coming down that street - he turned round to go towards Gerrard-street, and crossed over to the corner of Nassau-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120004"/>Cook said, "Stop these men," and I saw there were two men. I crossed over and met them - I made a blow at the other man, and hit him on the breast, at the corner of Gerrard-street; they both got away; I pursued them along Grafton-street, and by Grafton House I heard something thrown down; I still followed - the other man turned down Litchfield-street, to the right - the prisoner ran on about four doors beyond Litchfield-street, and stopped up against some shutter, to hide himself, as a watchman was coming by. I saw nobody else passing at all. I saw the prisoner's face in Gerrard-street, and am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you first see him to swear to him? A. When I crossed over in Gerrard-street they both passed close against me - it was the other man who I struck. I had a good opportunity of seeing the prisoner - there is a gas-light at the door where they passed me - it shone in their faces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, and in Compton-street I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went through Church-street, and a watchman laid hold of me, but I know nothing about it.</p>

On the 12th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I missed a piece of Norwich crape from the window; I put another piece in the window, in the same place, tied a string to it, and carried the string to the further end of the shop. About six o'clock, seeing the string move, I jumped over the counter, went into the street, and saw the prisoner Prior and and another female - I caught the prisoner by the shoulder, and said she had been taking a piece of Norwich crape from the window - the other woman immediately ran off; Prior turned round, and dropped the piece of Norwich crape; I took her into the shop, and observed that her hand was bleeding; I sent for an officer, and gave her in charge. The crape is worth 3l.; it measures forty yards, and cost me 1s. 9d. a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You missed a piece before that? A. Yes, about four o'clock; a small piece was broken out of the window on Saturday morning - I could not get it mended. I am sure Prior dropped the crape; I caught hold of her shoulder, and it dropped from her.</p>

            . I belong to the Westminster blue coat school. The prisoners live together, in the first floor back room of the same house as me - I live in the kitchen. On the 12th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was coming up stairs, and met them coming down, with another woman, whom I know by sight - they got out of the street door before me, and got down the steps; I opened the door, went down the steps, and saw them all three in Orchard-street; the two women were on the left-hand side of the way, and Wood on the right; I saw Wood cross over to them, and say, "Don't both of you go;" the other woman said, "I will go;" Prior immediately said,"I will go - my hand is smaller, look;" this created my suspicion - they went on. Wood went on before Prior, and turned down Strutton-ground - he took a steel thing out of his pocket, and was going to thrust it into the window - Prior said, "Don't do that, I can do it in half the time" - Wood crossed over to the other side. I saw Prior put her hand into the broken piece of glass, and pull out a piece of silk, as I thought; I went in to tell Mr. Lander- he asked what I wanted, but before I could answer he jumped over the counter, went out to Prior, and I saw no more,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your father? A. A milkman. I was never in the prisoners' room. I know of no quarrel between my father and them.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you follow them? A. I was going to Mr. Lander's, for half a yard of calico. Prior rather unrolled the stuff in pulling it out. I told Mr. Lander all I had seen, and was told to attend the office next day.</p>
               <p>- SIMPSON. I am an officer. I was sent for about a quarter past six o'clock, and took Prior into custody with the crape. On our way to the office, having known her six or eight years, I asked how she came to do it - she said, "I am in liquor, or I would not have done such a thing."</p>

I was not knocked down. I placed my back up against a wall to defend myself; the prisoner struck me in the face with his fist, and instantly seized my hat; I saw him deliver it to some of his companions; he immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120005"/>made his way towards Russell-court; I followed as well as I could, and collared him at the top of Russell-court; he was never out of my sight.

I am quite positive he is the boy who struck me and took my hat - there was a gas-light exactly opposite to where I stood. I am sure he struck me before he pulled my hat off. The boys all appeared to be of one party.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I went to Romford-market on Wednesday, the 30th of November, to buy a pony, but did not buy one. I live in Dighy-street, Globe-row. I was returning home, and overtook the prisoner; I did not know him before: I told him I had been to Romford, to buy a pony; he said he had one, which he would sell me; we walked on to the King's Arms, at Bow - he there shewed me a grey pony; I agreed to meet him next day, at ten o'clock, which I did, and agreed to give him four guineas for it; I paid him 2l., and was to pay him the rest in a few days. Next day I thought it was too cheap; I consulted a friend, and then took it to the King's Arms, till I could find Groves again; I saw him in the street on the day I took it back, and told him I did not like the pony - he asked for what reason - I told him I suspected it might be stolen, for I had had it valued; he assured me it was all right, but wished me to wait till Monday or Tuesday, when he would either give me back the 2l., or satisfy me that it was all right, as he had other business to attend to then; but I gave him in charge of an officer. He asked 6l. for it at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a judge of the age of horses? A. No; my friend considered it worth 9l. or 10l. The King's Arms is a public yard.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was it a pony of good appearance? - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am ostler at the King's Arms, Bow. On Tuesday, the 29th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I think, the prisoner brought a grey pony and a chesnut mare to the King's Arms - he asked if he could stop there that night; I said he could: he said hay would do for the horses; he did not want corn; they were wet and dirty, as it had rained. About seven o'clock next morning I saw him - he said he should take the mare out and shew her to a man, which he did - he took her away; she was very lame in her fore feet - he left the gelding pony with me, and said he should return in a few hours. I saw him again between seven and eight o'clock that evening (the 30th) - Matthews was with him; they looked at the pony; the prisoner said they would meet next morning about it; I went out next day, and when I came home the pony was gone. On the Saturday morning Matthews brought it in, and left it; I could not tell him where Groves lived. In a few hours I saw Matthews and the prisoner at the King's Arms; I asked the prisoner where he bought it; he said, in Kent: I asked if he had no receipt for his money - he said No, but that he had known the person of whom he bought them three or four years - he gave me a name, which I do not recollect. I understood him he was something of a gardener - we took him to the office.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On Tuesday, the 29th of November, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner passing Whitechapel-church, on the road to Bow, leading a chesnut horse and grey pony - they seemed much fatigned. On the Saturday evening Butcher and Matthews brought the prisoner to me - Matthews said he thought he had bought the pony too cheap, and wanted his money back; I detained the prisoner. I have seen the pony - it appeared to me to be the same as I saw him with. On the Saturday evening, when I was at the King's Arms, I asked the prisoner where he got them - he said he bought them of one John Bailey, a gardener, of Westerham, in Kent - that he was servant to General Dorin, at Hill Park; I asked what he gave for them - he said he gave 6l. for the chesnut, and 3l. for the pony - that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120006"/>he had known the man a good while, and had bought them in the market on the Saturday previous, which would be the 26th of November. I asked what took him to that part of the country - he said he had been to see his brother - that he had another brother living at East Grinstead; he said he had seen his brother at East Grinstead, and went to take him some money, and made this purchase on his way back on the Saturday; I asked what detained him from not coming to town before Tuesday - he said he slept with John Bailey two nights, and the other night at Hayes, on the road. I told him I had seen him leading two horses, and he said it was so. I afterwards went to his house, and saw his son - I returned, and told him I had asked his son if he had any horses to sell last week, and the son had said he had none to sell - that I then asked him where he (the prisoner) had slept for four nights, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, and he had said he slept at home every night - the prisoner said, "It is very odd he should say so - he must have made a mistake - I don't know who could have told him so." I then said I should take him to the watch-house, and next morning took him his breakfast, and told him I was going down to Westerham to see this

I went in the morning, and spoke to Loadsman about it, and shewed him where they were put. Collison had a brown frock coat, ankle shoes, a galter on the left leg, and a handkerchief on the right. Howard's-green is about one hundred yards from master's. I knew Collisou before, by seeing him in a shop in Howard's-green, next door but one to the shed. I saw a stout tall man there when I went with Loadsman - it was not either of the prisoners.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, Clerkenwell. On the 17th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went with Nunn to No. 24, City-gardens, and saw eighteen sheep there - they appeared particularly tired; I went to Howard's-green afterwards, and saw a shed with meat hanging in front of it; I saw Collison in that shed about a quarter past nine o'clock that morning; he was dressed in a dark mixture coat, corduroy breeches, ankle shoes, and a handkerchief round his right leg. I got information and watched the premises, and saw Martin there from time to time, but never saw Collison there after the 17th; I never saw the sheep there myself - I saw Martin there on Saturday, the 18th, serving two customers with meat, and on Sunday and Monday, but never saw him there after Monday. I found Collison at Worship-street on Saturday; I had been to the shop early and late but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Martin is a journeyman butcher? A. I considered him the servant there, or I should have taken him.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live next door to the shed where Collison's shop is. I kept a horse and cart at this time. On Sunday Martin asked me to let him have the horse and cart at five o'clock in the morn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120007"/>ing, as he wanted to take some skins into the country to bury - I did not lend it. I used to see both the prisoners in the shed - Collison's wife was often there - the shop is about ten yards from the shed where the sheep were put- I did not see Collison after I was asked for the cart, till he came into a public-house and struck me - he then wore a fustian coat and leather gaiters - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not the skins he corrupted and had? A. I asked him no questions - I thought it improper to lend him the cart at so early an hour - I saw a number of sheep in the shed - whether it was when he asked me for the cart, or a few days before, I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a Smithfield drover, and live in Bunhill-row. On Monday, the 21st of November, about five o'clock. I was at Howard's-green, and met Martin - he said "Will you do a good turn for me, and take these sheep to a green-yard, or otherwise loose them?" I said"Don't you know a green-yard after being all this time in London?" he said No; he went with me to the stable - some of the sheep were outside the door and some in - he said they had come astray of him four or five days ago- he went to the end of the street with me, and I took them to the green-yard in Whitecross-street - there were eighteen, and were marked W in the side, and some in the hips.</p>

This carpet was about eighteen feet inside my warehouse; between twelve and one o'clock in the day time, I saw it safe and went out; I returned in a few minutes, and missed it - I have not found it - there were twenty-four yards - it cost me 2l. 15s. I went almost immediately with an officer to Barnett's, in Catherine-wheel-alley, and then went into the next house, followed the officer up stairs, and saw the three male prisoners in the same room with the woman, who was washing; I accused them of stealing the carpet; no charge was made against the woman. I believe the house is let out in lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. I take it for granted your stock is frequently sold? A. Yes; this only came from the country a few days before, and I cut off forty-eight yards, leaving twenty-four; none had been sold while I was out; the men were all out - I only left a woman there. One of the prisoners was smoking a pipe, another on the bed, pretending to be ill, and the other sitting in a corner.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Imperial Gas-light Company. On Monday, the 19th of December, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw James King come out of Hare's shop, with a roll of carpet in his hand, and when he got six or seven yards from the shop, a person held his hand out, and received it from him; I did not see that person's face; he was dressed in a long dark coat and trousers; I saw nobody else - I did not see Williams - I directed a person who was with me to follow them, and I went to Mr. Hare's, and told a woman in the warehouse; I went to this room in less than ten minutes, and saw James King by the fire side, without his cap; I recognised him, and found a hairy cap in the room which he wore when he took the carpet. I believe William King, from his dress and appearance, to be the man who received the carpet - he was dressed exactly the same. Williams was on the bed pretending to be asleep - after rousing himself, he took hold of a pair of stockings, and said"Mother, wash these stockings, will you?" They were examined before the Lord Mayor the next day - the woman came as a witness and was ordered into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was William King's dress?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120009"/>A. A long dark frock coat, which he put round the carpet to hide it - he wore dark trousers.</p>

            . I was with Butler; he said "That carpet is stolen;" I then saw two persons running away with it; I saw the features of one, which was James King; the other had a long dark coat and dark trousers; they turned into Catherine-wheel-alley; Williams was waiting at the corner of the alley for them - that is about fifty yards from Hare's, but within sight of the house; when they got to the alley they all three ran together; I followed them to the top of the alley; they turned to the left hand, directly I turned they got into a house which I understood to be Barnett's; I waited opposite the door for ten minutes; I did not see them come out, but in a quarter of an hour they were found in a house at the back of Barnett's yard; I found the four prisoners there; I had seen the features of all three as they ran up the court, and am certain of all three.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not a long alley? A. Yes; it leads by some turnings into Petticoat-lane. Mr. Hare's house is on the same side of the way as the alley. Williams could see the house from where he stood, for I stood there myself on purpose to try. There is a communication from Barnett's yard to the house where they were found - there is only a low slight fence between them.</p>

I went with Mr. Hare to Barnett's house, in Catherine-wheel-alley, but could not find the carpet; I went into the yard, and found it easy to get over the paling to the house, where I found the four prisoners - the witnesses recognised them - nobody else was in the room - Smith spoke to all the three male prisoners.</p>

            . I am a porter at Newgate-market. I saw this cart in Newgate-street, and saw the prosecutor deliver the meat to Lee, whom I knew - Morgan was with him. Woodman told him to take it to Hales and Brooks - he went through the market, and turned down Ivy-lane- Morgan followed, and said, "Go a little further, and I will take it of you;" and in Ivy-lane he took the mutton from him; I do not think he heard Woodman say where it was to go, but he must have seen it delivered to Lee - he took the mutton in Ivy-lane; they parted. I ran, and sent an officer after them; Morgan was taken on Tuesday morning, and Lee afterwards. I have seen them walking in Newgate-street together before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been into a public-house with Morgan since this? A. No; I went to one with his wife. I was never accused of any offence; I was once charged with buying the ticket of a watch; I was stopped when I went to take it out of pawn. I was taken up on suspicion of robbery only.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell his wife that her husband would be safe with her in the morning, for you could not swear any thing against him? A. No. I had tea and some beefsteaks with her; I went with a view to find out where the meat was; there were more thieves in the room - she asked me to take the steaks, but I paid for them; I bought them of Mr. Walker, my master - she complained of being in distress for meat, and I got the steaks - it was the day he was committed. I always buy my meat of my master; I have a wife and two children. It was five or six years ago that I was charged with robbery; I was never charged with any other - I was remanded for three days, and then discharged. We only had a pound of steaks between four of us; there was another man, named Baker, and a woman there, and I thought the other man knew where the beef was. I do not think I ever spoke to her before. I am in Mr. Walker's employ now, and have been from my childhood nearly. I went to school with Morgan - I was with his wife ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I did not say any thing about her husband - she asked me to tea. I talked to Baker about the meat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you been making yourself busy with Lee's friends? A. No; I do not know where he lived. I am a meat porter, and work for Mr. Walker when he has work for me. I took Lee in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120010"/>Ivy-lane on Friday; Bill Knap was with me, and helped to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said you were not so sure of Lee's person? A. I did say so, because his face was covered with a handkerchief, up to his nose, and as soon as he took the handkerchief down, I said, "Joe Lee I want you."</p>

On the 4th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the room behind my shop, and heard a rattle against the window, and in about two minutes I saw a shoe moving from a shew-board - I immediately ran out, and caught the prisoner with this shoe in his hand - one half out of the broken window, and the other half in; I had seen it a quarter of an hour before - he had entirely removed it from where it laid before; quite so - he had lifted it up, and got it half out of the window - he was pulling it out when I seized him; he said, "I have done nothing - I have just come from work - you are mistaken." I immediately took him to the watch-house, and found a knife on him, which he must have used to break the window; the glass was not broken at all before- his hand must have been inside the window to get the shoe. I sent for his father, and from what he said I was induced to bring him here. There was another boy with him, who ran out of the yard, with the fellow shoe. I found a rule on him, which he said he had found. I produce the shoe which he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming by, and saw two boys whom I knew - they told me they had broken a window; I said, "I will get away, or I shall be taken with you." The gentleman came and caught hold of me, and said, "I have caught you with a shoe in your hand;" I had not touched the window. I picked that rule up in Old-street. Several people said I was not the boy who had been seen about there. I never touched the shoe - I could find the boy who broke the window.</p>

            . I lodge with Casey. I was in her room about eight o'clock in the evening, and heard the prisoner and her husband quarrelling; I looked out of window, and saw them out in the yard; Mrs. Casey was in bed - I could see from the window into their yard; it is on the first floor; there is a gas-light close to the window: the yard is shut in with a gate, but I could see over the gate. I saw Maurice Fitzgerald in the yard, with the prisoner, her husband, and daughter. The prisoner said,"Maurice Fitzgerald, you have no business in my place - you vagabond - I will let you know you have no business in my place;" she then got hold of him; I saw him between her and her daughter - they had no sooner taken hold of him then he fell, and somebody screamed murder - whether it was her daughter or anybody who came down stairs I do not know; I saw no more. I afterwards saw the body taken away - I was at the window - Cain and two or three more took it away, on a shutter or door. I afterwards saw the prisoner come out and shut the yard door. I saw her daughter washing the yard next morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the two women were holding Fitzgerald where was Cain's husband? A. He was standing at the yard door - they were all in the yard - I do not know how near he was to Fitzgerald; Fitzgerald was not trying to get to the husband, but was standing still in the yard when they laid hold of him.</p>

On the evening of the 26th of December, Maurice Fitzgerald was sitting by the fire side with me, for three quarters of an hour, till between seven and eight o'clock; the prisoner and her husband lodged on the ground floor. I heard a noise below - the prisoner and her husband were quarrelling; I was going down - Fitgerald prevented me, and went down himself to pacify them.

The doctor, who was with me, said it was of no use, the man was dead. I went home, but do not recollect whether I saw the prisoner - I think I heard her voice.

            . I am a patrol. On the 26th of December I was on duty, and heard people quarrelling in Horn's-alley; I went to the outer part of Cain's-yard, and saw the prisoner, her daughter, husband and the deceased - I believe there was another man but am not positive - the prisoner appeared to be trying to get to her husband, who was near the yard gate - she was nearer to the house door - the daughter and Fitzgerald appeared to me to be endeavouring to push the prisoner into the house - she had a slender table knife in her hand, with the blade upwards - she forced herself against Fitzgerald and her daughter, as if she wished to get to her husband, who was about five yards off, standing near the yard door, not doing any thing; there was a cry of "There is the watchman!" and the yard door was directly shut; I think the husband shut it, but am not positive; this prevented my seeing into the yard - the gate is seven or eight feet high - a person at Casey's window can see almost all over the yard, except near the gate - I have ascertained that. After the gate was shut I heard a female voice in the yard exclaim "D-n you, I will stab you;" I cannot swear to the voice, but from hearing the prisoner speak afterwards. I believe it was her voice. I went away thinking it an Irish quarrel, which is very common there, and it did not belong to my beat. In a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, a man was brought by on a shutter, and in a quarter of an hour I went to where the prisoner lived, having got assistance - I found her in bed on the ground floor, with all her clothes on except her shoes; her daughter was in the room, and her husband came in before I left - she was not very tipsy, but certainly had been drinking -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120012"/>I took her to the watch-house - the flag-stones in the yard appeared as if fresh water had been thrown on them - blood and water together remained between the crevices of the stones, near the door of the house; I accompanied Wainwright to the house next day - two or three knives were found - this table knife was on the dresser (producing it); it is similar to the one I saw in her hand, and appeared to have been recently wiped with a wet cloth - it was turning a little rusty - I saw the body before the Coroner - it was the body of the same man as I had seen in the yard.</p>

            . I live in White Horse-court, Turnmill-street. I was in Horn's-alley, next door to the prisoner's house, and heard a quarreling in their yard; I came out directly afterwards, and was passing close to the gate, which was then half open, and saw Fitzgerald standing with his face towards Cain's house door; he was not two minutes there before he turned round, and hallooed out that he was murdered - he spoke twice, but the last expression I could not hear; he turned from the door, took a step or two towards the gate and then fell down. I saw blood coming from him, which made me faint. I waited there till after the body was taken away on a shutter; after that the prisoner and her daughter came out - a woman on the first floor was crying; the prisoner said to her, "D-n your soul, do you think we killed the man?" she made some answer, and the prisoner said, "Well then, what brought him there - that is coming to the point."

The prisoner's daughter was holding her hand on his breast, to stop the blood - he said, "Oh! I am dead." She endeavoured to take him into the house; her mother came from the end of the shed, and told her not to take him there; he was standing up, walking slowly, and the daughter behind, holding him. As he was going in he tumbled on the threshold, and fell on his knees - the daughter held him up, with her hand to his breast. the prisoner went in, and fetched out a light; the daughter called Mrs. Riley, who came down, and hallooed Murder! the prisoner said he had a knife in his hand, and tumbled down; I staid till the body was taken away on a shutter - the prisoner was then at her own door, holding a light.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Dynam, a surgeon. On the 26th of December I was called to see the deceased's body, in Glo'ster-court - there was a large wound on the left breast, about the region of the heart; I examined the body particularly before the Inquest, and opened it - the wound had taken a direction downward, towards the heart; an artery was divided. I have no doubt of the wound being the cause of his death. The knife produced would inflict such a wound.</p>
               <p>MARGARET CAIN. I am the prisoner's daughter. I was in my place - a little boy came down for me, and said there was a row in the yard; I came up, and observed the deceased in the yard, with his back leaning against the pig-sty - that is the first thing I saw. My mother was in the passage. I laid hold of the man, seeing him bleeding, and called out Murder! to Mrs. Riley, who came down, and told me to hold him till she went for a doctor; I said, "Do go, don't be long," and held my hand to his breast. I saw my mother in the passage, with a child in her arms. I do not know whether she had any thing in her hand - her hand was down by her side; several people came into the yard with my hallooing out. I tried to hold the man up - she said, "Don't bring him here," or something of that sort. I held him till he was put on a shutter, and then went back to my place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). On the night in question I got a cow-heel for supper - I took my child and went out for some onions, and it being boxing-day was made to drink two glasses of gin - when I drink I always loose my reason. I declare I do not know how the man came by his death. I fetched my husband from the public-house - he wanted to go back; a dispute arose, but whether this man was there or not I do not know.</p>

I have a stable there, which joins my house - there is no internal communication from the house to the stable; it is built to the wall of my house, and opens into the yard of the house, which yard is enclosed by a wall, and a large pair of folding gates, and a private gate - the folding gates have a bar across, and the small gate is locked at night; nobody can get into the yard without getting over the gates; I go from my house to the stable without going into the street. On Monday morning, the 13th of December, about six o'clock, I heard an alarm - it was dark; I got up, and went to my harness room, which is part of the stable, and found the door open; my servant lets the coaches in at night; I cannot say when it was fastened up. I missed five sets of single horse harness, four bridles, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120013"/>a saddle - they were left in my care, and belonged to different gentlemen - they were worth from 20l. to 25l.</p>

            . I live in Whitecross-street, at Mr. Graves', but have now come from the House of Correction. I had known Waller for about a fortnight or three weeks before this; I saw the female prisoner on Sunday night, the 11th of December, but never before - I never saw Dolphin before Sunday night, the 12th; I was in company with Waller and a person, named James Smith, on Saturday, the 10th, at the Black Horse, public-house, Barbican: I was at breakfast with Waller that morning, in Gray's Inn-road - he told me he was to go to the Black Horse, to meet Smith; I went with him at twelve o'clock; Smith came in - Waller and Smith went out and talked together, but I could not understand what it was about - I did not hear what passed. Waller had asked me some days before if I knew any body who kept any stables; I said I knew a person who kept livery-stables, Mr. Thurston, in Southampton-mews, Somer's-town; he asked me where they kept the harness; I said they kept it in the second door on the left hand side of the yard - he asked if the door was kept locked - I said it was either buttoned or latched.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met Smith at the public-house, what did you do? A. We had a pot of beer. Smith and Waller went out, and when they came back Smith appointed for me and Waller to meet him at six o'clock, at that house - they did not say for what purpose then; I got there at six - neither of them were there; Smith came in a few minutes, and Waller about seven o'clock, Smith said he could not procure a horse and cart that night, but he had agreed for one on Sunday night, and it was put off till then. Smith told us to meet him there at nine o'clock on Sunday night, at the Black Horse - we all met there, and at half-past nine a man came, named Shays; he said he had got the horse and cart, and had left it at the stables; the Black Horse is between three and four miles from Mr. Thurston's. Smith told me to go to the Benbow public-house, in Golden-lane, and ask for Long Harry - I went, and saw Dolphin at the Benbow; I did not know him before; I inquired for Long Harry - Dolphin asked me who wanted him - I said Jem Smith; he said he was not there, and he dare say he could do as well. He went with me - Marr was outside the door, and went with me and Dolphin to the Black Horse; I found Smith and Waller there. Smith, Waller, and Dolphin went aside, and talked together - I did not hear what they said. There was an Irishman in the room, dressed in a blue jacket - he was not one of the party. Smith asked Dolphin if he could get him some large screws, a dark lantern, and a phosphorus-box; Dolphin told Marr to get him some of the largest screws and a phosphorus box - he did not say where from. Waller was present when he sent her for them - she said she could do nothing of the kind, for if Harry found it out he would kill her; Dolphin said they belonged to him, and he had given them to Harry to mind for him; she said she would do nothing of the kind without Harry's orders. We had three or four pots of beer, and staid there till about eleven o'clock, and went from there up Goswell-street, all five of us. Marr and Shays were with us - Dolphin at last, with a good deal of persuasion, got the woman to fetch the dark-lantern and screws - she went for them; we turned down an alley, about thirty yards beyond Sadler's repository, in Goswell-street, and waited down there; the woman went into a house on the left-hand side, and brought out some screws in her apron, and gave them to Dolphin, with a dark lantern and phosphorus box; Dolphin picked out two of the largest screws, and put them into his pocket - we went to the Britannia public-house, in Golden-lane - Marr was with us; we had three or four glasses of porter; Dolphin, Smith, Waller, Marr, Shays, and I were all there; we then went to the stables where the horse and cart were, at the back of St. Luke's church, and waited in the stables till a few minutes after one o'clock; Smith ordered me, Waller, and Dolphin to meet him at the corner of Tottenham-court-road, by the New-road - we were to go there as quick as possible; Smith and Shays overtook us in the cart at Euston-square; they stopped, and Waller got into the cart (Marr had left us in Golden-lane.) I and Dolphin went round the square, down Southampton-mews, and stopped at Thurston's gate; Dolphin went to the small gate, and tried to unlock it with the two screws - he came to me and said he could not open it - they were too small; Smith and Waller came down the mews, Smith said, "Never mind." I and Smith went round a street, and turned down a turning, which brought us by the side of Thurston's house, where there is a wall, and railing at the top, and by getting over there we could get into the yard; Smith got over first, and I after him - Smith opened the gate; Dolphin came in; Waller staid outside - Smith opened the door where the harness was - it was put to, but neither latched nor buttoned. He handed down the harness to me and Dolphin, and told us to put it down by the side of the gate; Smith, Waller, and Dolphin put it into the cart; Waller and Shays rode in the cart: Dolphin, Smith, and I went to the stable in St. Luke's, and found the horse, cart, and harness there - Waller and Shays were there - we got the harness out of the cart, and put it on a bench in the stable; it was then about three o'clock in the morning. Smith began to sort the harness out; Shays went away with the horse and cart, and brought the horse back without the cart, and took the harness off. Several watchmen came to the gate, and sprung their rattles; Smith got over some palings by the side of the stable; I got over after him, and do not know what became of the others. A watchman stopped me, and took me to St. Luke's watch-house - the harness was brought there. After I had been there some time I told the watch-house-keeper where the harness came from,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120014"/>and where Waller lived as well as I could - he lived in a small square on the left-hand side of Gray's Inn-road. I was eighteen years old last October.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of the prisoners asked you about what was on the premises? A. Waller asked me where the harness was - nothing else. I had known Thurston's three or four months - I used to help the ostler there; he was my brother-in-law's nephew. Waller asked me if there was a dog there; I said he had a large dog, but it was uncommonly harmless, and would not hurt anybody - I saw no dog there that night. When we left the Black Horse the Irishman was still there, drinking rum and water with the servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. How long have you been in this reputable business? A. I was never in such a case before. I was never in custody before in my life. I was never taken up on any charge. I was examined before the Magistrate - I did not tell him exactly all of it the first time - I was flurried. There were five or six examinations; there might have been more; there might be nine. I was present at all of them. I told the Magistrate all I knew at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You met some of these persons at the Black Horse? A. Yes, in the tap-room; there was not more than one or two persons there - they spoke low about the harness. - We were on the opposite side of the room to the other persons; it is a largish sized room, bigger than that table. Waller asked me about the stables when I was out with him. Nobody was present at the Black Horse but the Irishman and servant - they did not hear our conversation about the screws; they were talking and larking by themselves.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse, Barbican. - On Saturday evening, the 10th of December, about half-past ten o'clock, I recollect seeing Alderton there - Waller was sitting with him; I was not serving in the tap-room on Sunday evening, as my wife was confined to her bed - I served in the bar. I cannot say who was there that evening, be forehalf-past ten o'clock, when I went into the tap-room - none of the prisoners were there then; there was an Irishman there in a blue jacket, sitting with my servant girl, talking and drinking, and two of my lodgers. I have seen Dolphin and Marr at the house, and had seen Waller there once before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found four persons there? - A. Yes; my room has no boxes - one table goes lengthways, and the other across; there are benches all round the room - it is large enough for persons to talk and not be heard on the other side of the room, if they speak low.</p>
               <p>Q. If five persons at one table spoke loud enough to be heard by each other, must they not be heard across the room? A. I think they must.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If they stood in a cluster together, could they speak without others hearing them? A. I think not; the room is about four yards by five; they could certainly talk so as not to be heard, and strangers might not notice their conversation.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. - On Sunday night, the 11th of December, I was constable of the night, and about four o'clock on Monday morning I heard rattles sprung; I went out of the watch-house, and met the watchmen; I went into a stable, and found several watchmen there, and five sets of harness, a saddle, and five bridles, a dark lantern and a phosphorus box - we took them to the watch-house. I found Alderton at the watch-house, in Benson's custody; he at first said he knew nothing about it - that he was drawn into it, and if he got out of it he would never get into such a thing again. I apprehended one Crook afterwards, on suspicion - he was discharged; I looked him up in a cell adjoining to Alderton. Alderton told me where the harness came from, and directed me where to find Waller, who I apprehended at one o'clock in the day, on Monday, the 12th - I found him in bed, undressed - his boots, which were in the room, were very wet, as if they had been very muddy.

On Sunday night, the 11th of December, at nine o'clock, I saw a cart on Europia-place - it attracted my notice - I never have seen a cart in that place before - I missed it soon after one o'clock in the morning, and between three and four I saw it pass my box again - I do not know who drove it - it turned up there again - there was only one person in it, and one came on behind; one of the men asked me for a light, which I gave him - that was Dolphin - I noticed him - he crossed towards the mud-bank; I afterwards gave a light to a man who had the pony belonging to the cart - the pony was all in a sweat; I did not know that man - he had something up to his face - the harness was found in a place near the mud-bank; I have seen Dolphin about that spot before, in the day time; I assisted in taking the harness to the watch-house - I saw Eliza Cale about the place where the harness was.</p>

            . The harness was found in my stable - I had let this stable to Shays and one Crook - Crook rents it still - I live close to it. The night before this happened, just as I was going to bed, Shays and Crook came and asked me for the key; I handed it out to one of them, as they said they wanted to go to market. About three o'clock in the morning I could not rest, hearing a noise, as if they were moving - I heard a horse and cart come quickly to the stable; I got up, struck a light and went down, but my gate was fast - I could not get to the stable; I saw Waller come out of the gate - he said to the watchman "What noise is this? what is this about? they are my premises?" I had never let them to him, and told the watchman I never saw his face before - the watchman opened the stable, went in and saw the harness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About three o'clock - they made a considerable noise in getting away - I never saw Waller before: he said, "These premises are mine" - it was a dark morning.</p>

The first man who came out of the gateway of the premises was Dolphin - he ran from me and escaped - when he came out I asked if he was the owner of the premises - he said he was - I asked if he had driven a horse in there - he said he had - I asked if it belonged to him - he said he was in partnership with a man in it - I asked him to come back and let us have a sight of the horse - he immediately flew off - I sprung my rattle - he was taken two or three days after - I had a lantern, and right facing him was a gas light: he is the man I am certain.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 27th of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, running; an ass was across the foot-path, which made a stoppage: the prisoner, with another, ran down Artillery-lane; I took him about twenty-five yards down the lane, and, on opening his jacket I found this pocket-book at his left side. I saw Mrs. Stulpner in about two minutes - she was pointed out to me, and claimed it, and stated the contents accurately - I opened it at the Mansion House - he said a person gave it him to carry, but did not say to whom, or where he was to take it; the other got away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the night of the 4th I was in the counting house - Thomas Flinn was cleaning away after the men - I secreted myself in the court, where I had a view of the premises: I waited from a quarter past eight to nine o'clock- it was known that a coat was lost: I saw John Flinn come from Old Fish-street, and look up at the factory window - the coat was thrown out - John picked it up - I got a watchman to assist, and secured him with it, and, in our way back, we met Thomas, going home; I told him to come into the counting-house; he did so; I said to Thomas, "I believe you know this is the carpenter's coat;" he said "Yes;" I gave them both in charge: there was no one in the factory but Thomas when the coat was thrown out. John said his brother told him he had bought the coat - Thomas said nothing; it had not been moved till the night of the 4th.</p>

I had not crossed Gray's-inn-lane - it was by a baker's shop, close at the corner; I pursued, calling Watch! and the watchman came and took her, going into Walton's-court, which is ten or twelve yards within the City bars. I saw my watch found in her left hand. I had not been with her at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the City boundaries? A. I had been to Captain Sansom's - we dined at five o'clock, then drank, and smoked. I dare say I drank a bottle of wine, and had some rum and water after supper. I suppose a bottle of rum was drank - nobody was there but Mr. and Mrs. Sansom. I drank no wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you drank wine? A. I drank some, but I did not say the quantity - I saw but one bottle of wine produced; gentlemen generally take rum, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120017"/>leave the wine to the ladies. Mr. Sansom lives near Stepney-causeway, which, I suppose, is six miles and a half from my house. I am a married man. I was accosted by nobody but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell any body to say it was your own fault entirely, and not the prisoner's? A. I did not - I said nothing of the kind. I had 23s. about me. She had not followed me - she ran out and met me.</p>

I was in the court, and went up the passage; Mr. Graveley said he had been robbed - I took hold of the prisoner, who he was holding; he charged her with robbing him - I found the watch, chain, and seals in her left-hand; she at first denied having it, holding out her right hand. I took her in the City - the baker's shop is out of the City. Mr. Graveley certainly was sober. He told me the maker's name and number.</p>

We used four sorts of letter on Eagle and Young's book; Freeman's Reports had small pica and brevier. While he was in my service I missed the type of three pages of Archibald's work, which had been set up - and I observed that long primer got scarcer than usual.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you the bill-book in which the compositor's work is entered? A. I have - (producing it) - he came into my employ in the beginning of September; I charge you with stealing long primer and brevier not in the cases; a person named Pittock was also employed on this work: Bird, Smith, and Hamilton were compositors, working at the same time as the prisoner. Hamilton was overseer, and generally worked in another room. I have the upper part of two houses; there is a staircase to each house. I have five apprentices - four of whom were employed on Freeman's Reports, at different times - I have taken two of them before the Chamberlain, for misconduct, but never charged them with robbery. The brevier type was cast by Austin - he supplies other printers. A man could take out 20lbs. of type at a time without being seen.</p>
               <p>MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Austin makes for other printers, but he makes the letters singly, not in words? A. No; no other printers were engaged on this work. The prisoner charges in this book for composing signature 4 L., and correcting it; he would have all the type of that sheet before him - it was his duty to distribute it after printing, and put it into the proper cases.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ever shew you specimens of any type? A. Yes, on one occasion; I did not buy it; I think it was small pica. I once bought some pica of him and some leads.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever ask him where he brought this type from? A. He came to me about the middle of the month, stating that one Taver, whom I knew, had informed him I was buying type for a printing-office - that he had bought a quantity under an execution, to go into business as a master printer; but having changed his views he was determined to sell it; I knew him four years ago as a journeyman printer, and did not hesitate about it, having heard that he had been in business; I gave him 1s. per lb. for the brevier, and 7d. for the long primer.</p>

I found the yard door open, and a considerable portion of the brick-work of the wall, by the side of the door, pulled down - there was a small hole there before, to let the fowls through; it had been broken more, to enable him to unfasten the bottom bolt, but the pannel was broken to get to the upper bolt. I found a dark lantern in a shed on the premises; I never saw it there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had not searched the shed to know whether it was there before? A. No. The wall was in a decayed state before; nothing but a fork was found upon the prisoner; he at first pretended to be drunk, but when he got to the watch-house he was quite sober.</p>

On the 12th of December, about ten minutes past one o'clock, Hurrell called me, and said she heard an unusual noise in the house; I went and tried the shutters, which were fast - I went into the back yard; there are two doors to the yard, one of which is never fastened; as soon as I got in there I saw the prisoner come out of the passage of the dwelling-house; I made a spring to lay hold of him - he threw himself into the covered skittle-ground, and got under some forms; I secured him there, sprung my rattle, and took him into the house. I found the pannel of the door broken, and the brick-work pulled down - he could not get through the hole; the pannel had been broken to get at the top bolt. I found a dark lantern in the place where he threw himself down to hide; the pannel was in three pieces and had only been tacked in. I dare say forty bricks were pulled out of the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And yet a man could not get through? A. It was a large hole, but extended upwards, to find the bolt - I think a middling sized boy could not get through. Nothing but a fork was found upon him. - The pannel had been sawed; he said he was drunk, but did not appear so in the least.</p>

            . I am headborough of Clerkenwell. I went to the house and found the pannel broken. I dare say the hole in the wall was three feet by two, sufficient for a man to get through; it was not the pannel of the door that was sawed, but the lining - it had been done to get at the top bolt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The aperture in the wall was three feet by two? A. I did not measure it, but suppose it was nearly three feet high, and eighteen inches or two feet broad.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MEAGLE re-examined. I had seen the aper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120019"/>ture in the wall the day before, but not in the evening - it was not large enough then to admit a man through; I saw this door secure, with both bolts, when I went to bed, and left nobody up but Hurrell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As they brought me along I was used cruelly, and cut over the head and arms. They said as we went to the office, "You are not gone yet - this will do to go to the Old Bailey with."</p>
               <p>ROBERT MEAGLE. I have seen the prisoner at my house once or twice - he was there on the evening in question, and went backward three or four times with his companions.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He had been drinking? A. Not to make himself drunk - he and three others had four pots of beer; I saw him leave the house. There is a thoroughfare through the house in the day time, but not all night; it is not a public thoroughfare. I give the persons in Red Lion-yard leave to go through - they come through the bar, and through my yard - the doors are locked at night.</p>

Bath and Bristol note, and at the same time requested me to shew him some seals for his son, who was at school; he chose two seals, which came to 2l. 4s. - which made 3l. 4s. I wrapped up the goods which he selected, and told him I had not sufficient change, and should be under the necessity of getting it - I asked him to be kind enough to put his name and address upon it, which he did, in my presence - this is the note (looking at it;) he has written "Mr. Martin, No. 1l, Dean-street, Soho." My suspicions were excited, and I went to Groom, the constable, and gave him the note, having first marked it. Groom came with me - we called on Mr. Harrison, who accompanied us to the shop; Groom had returned me the note before I went to Harrison. - When we got to the shop Harrison assumed Mr. Haskins; I put the note across the counter into his hand, and asked him if he could give change - he looked at it, and turning to the prisoner, said, he really thought it was a bad note, and was very sorry for him, if he had taken it in the way of business; the prisoner said he believed it to be a good one, and if we went to his lodging, where he referred, to Dean-street, we should find it all right; Groom, who stood behind him, said he must search his person before he left, which he objected to - he was brought into the parlour, and searched; the Pontefract note, which he had tendered to me, was found on him: I marked that also; this is it (examining it;) he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. If you took a bad half-crown Mr. Haskins would not make you answerable for that? A. He might not. I have never taken bad money; I have been six years in his service; he has no partner, nor any other Christian name; the goods were never delivered to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live at the corner of St. Martin's-court, Leicester-square. On the 3d of December Mr. Foster came to me and brought me a 5l. Bath and Bristol note: I looked at it, gave it to him back, and went with him to St. Martin's-court; I assumed to be master of the shop; the prisoner was outside the door, but was called in by the boy; he walked into the shop; Foster asked me for change; I said "I do not know - will you let me look at it?" he gave it me; I said I had no doubt it was a bad note, and was sorry if the prisoner had taken it in trade, for he certainly had got a bad note, he said he was sorry for it too, but he came by it in a regular way, and could give a proper account of it. I said I was sure it was bad, and he must give an account of it; he said he could. I said he must go before a Magistrate to give an account of it; he said, very well; he would very willingly; I said "You must stop to do so before you can leave us;" he said he could give a proper account of it, and it was unpleasant for a respectable man to be shut up. I handed the note to Groom, who was at the door, and said "Stay with this gentleman while I call somebody, who will give us some further account of the note." I called on a Mr. Cools, who said, in the prisoner's presence, that a friend of his had taken one of the same kind. I do not remember that the prisoner answered; Cools said to Groom, "Are you a constable?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120020"/>you must take this man into custody;" which he did, and searched him in my presence, and found a five guinea Pontefract note in his pocket. He was taken to St. Martin's watch-house. I marked the 5l. Bath and Bristol note(looking at it); this is the note I marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you returned with Foster the prisoner was walking before the door? A. He was outside the door. I understood, but I did not see him - he was not in the shop when I went in - he was called and came in; he said he was perfectly ready to go before the Magistrate and give every information.</p>

            . I am a constable, of St. Martin's-court; I took the prisoner into custody at Mr. Haskins's shop, and found a five guinea Pontefract note on him; I asked who he was - he said he had put his address at the back of the note; I looked at the back, and he pointed to it; I saw"Mr. Martin, 11, Dean-street, Soho," on it - this is it. I asked him if that was correct; he said Yes; I said I must go with him to see whether it was correct. I just took him out to the door, and he said it was no go; I said "Then I must take you to the watch-house;" he said "Very well;" he said "If you go up to Dean-street, it is of no use, for I don't live there." I took him to the watch-house; he asked me if I would go to a public-house, and let him write a note and send a person with it; and said I should have five sovereigns to let him go. Foster marked the Bath and Bristol note which I kept - I marked it also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he had lived in Dean-street, but not now? A. He did not. When I asked his address, he said that was his address on the note, and that it was correct.</p>

On Saturday, the 19th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked me for a small hunting watch and seal, which came to 3l. 5s.; I delivered them to him and he gave me a 5l.

            . (Through B. BARNETT, an interpreter.) I live at No. 42, Berner's-street, Oxford-street, and let ledgings. On a Saturday morning, nearly two months ago, the prisoner came to my house, and asked to see the lodgings; I conducted him to the second floor; he was pleased with them, but as I do not speak much English, very little conversation passed; he said he took them for a gentleman from Bristol - that they were to be got ready by Monday evening, at nine o'clock, and ordered two very large fires in both rooms. I asked him to go down into the parlour to ask for a deposit - we went down - he gave me a 5l. note to get change - I read "Bath and Bristol" on the note, and gave it to Mary Barry, the servant - she went and brought the change back; I gave it all to the prisoner, and he returned me a sovereign; nobody came to the lodging on Monday - I have not seen the prisoner since, till to-day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he with you? A. Ten or fifteen minutes; I did not know him before - I recollect him agian, and cannot be mistaken in him.</p>

On Tuesday, the 8th of November, the prisoner came to my house, and ordered me to engrave a promissory note of the Bath and Bristol bank; he gave me directions what it was to contain, and ordered five hundred impressions; I saw him again on the following Saturday, the 12th - they were not ready - he called again in the evening - they were not quite finished - he took four or five, to shew some friends - he came again on Monday, the 14th - they were all ready then, and I delivered him the 500; I kept the plate, - this is it (looking at it); it was engraved according to his directions; the notes produced (examining them) are impressed from this plate, and are those I delivered to him, except the filling up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you acquainted with his person before? A. No; he asked me if I could engrave a note for a new firm; I had not the least suspicion of him, and did it without further inquiry. I communicated with Sir Benjamin Hobhouse's bank on the day I delivered him the notes.</p>

            , of the Bath bank. I have been there more than seven years, and am acquainted with the banking houses in Bath and Bristol; there are now two other banks at Bath - Clement. Tugwell, and Co. and Tuffnell and Co. - in November last there were two others, Cavenor and Co., and Morgan and Co.; I know some of the Bristol bankers - I never heard of the firm of Hobhouse, Wright, and Hunter, as a Bath and Bristol bank; Sir B. Hobhouse draws on Jones, Lloyd and Co. I do not know of any bank using such notes as these - they are not Sir B. Hobhouse's notes - they are drawn on Barnard, Savery and Co. I know of no Martin Hobhouse and Co. I have made inquiry of the bankers at Bath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What names did you put on your notes? A. Hobhouse, Fillott, Fillott, and Lowther.</p>
               <p>Q. No person, in looking at this note, could take it for one of yours? A. I should think persons might be deceived in it - our notes have no Christian names on them, nor Sir Benjamin's title - they are never signed Hobhouse - I have made no particular inquiry at Bristol. I believe any body may set up a bank if they have a license.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do not Bristol notes commonly pass through your hands? A. They are as common to us as Bath notes.</p>

On Wednesday, the 23d of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop - he saw a coat in my window, and said he should like one like it; I told him I could not let him have that - he said he should like to try it on, and did so; he wanted that one; I said he could not have it; he asked when I could get him one done; I told him by Friday morning. I measured him - he said he would call for it; I asked his address; he said he lived in Caroline-place, which is half a mile from my house; he gave me the name of Martin, and was going out - I said it was usual to have a deposit from strangers; he asked what deposit I required; I said 10s. would be sufficient as I knew Caroline-place to be respectable; he put his hand into his pocket, and drew out 2s., saying he had no more change, but would leave a deposit if I could give him change for a 5l. note; I said I would but I could not give him 4l. 10s.; he said never mind, that will do - he would leave 1l. - he gave me a 5l. Bath and Bristol note. I observed to him that it was a country note; he said Yes, but it was payable in London, and I gave him four sovereigns in change; he went away, and in the afternoon, about five o'clock, I went out, and was passing Mr. Wood's, a neighbour; I went in and asked him to change the note, which he did; I gave him the same note as I received from the prisoner. Mr. Wood wrote on it, in my presence, "Goer, King's road;" this is the note (looking at it); he did not come for the coat; I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. Not to my knowledge; he was in my shop ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, being measured; I swear he is the man; I had no other note in my possession, nor any money transactions with any body that day.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Queen-street. On the 8th of November the prisoner came and ordered me to engrave a promissory note for the Bath and Bristol bank: he gave me the instructions for the plate, and said it was a new firm just commencing, and the 5l. notes would be wanted to be used immediately. This was on Tuesday, the 8th. He came again on the Saturday, between nine and eleven o'clock in the morning - they were not ready - he came again at night, and took four or five; I completed the order on Monday, the 14th of November, and delivered him 500. The note produced was impressed from the plate, except the filling up. No impression from that plate was in existence before that Saturday - it is dated the 11th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you engrave it yourself? A. No; I employed a person to do it, and saw him do part of it.</p>

            . I am a turnkey of Newgate. and have been so seven years. I was here in September 1819. I do not know the prisoner - we have different departments, and at that time I belonged to the cells, and had nothing to do with the prisoners who were not tried. I did not know Abraham Davis at all. Cole is not here to-day. The prisoner here handed in a written paper, as follows:</p>
               <p>The prisoner most humbly represents, that he was taken into custody by a Mr. Hall, and other officers, and conveyed to Bow-street, at which place he first became acquainted with the nature of the charge against him; and it is to be understood that no fresh charge was advanced against him. The prisoner most humbly submits that the former alleged prosecutor was applied to, who denied any knowledge of his person, and after being closely examined by several other persons, turnkeys of Newgate, Clerkenwell,&amp;c. and other officers of the police, they all declared they had no knowledge of your prisoner. - Davis, however, a discarded turnkey of Newgate, well known as being instrumental in obtaining convictions, basely attempted to swear against him; and whose deposition caused him to be committed, after undergoing no less than seven examinations. No witnesses appeared against your prisoner until the last examination, when they were brought forward at the instigation of Davis, having been promised reward, to be paid out of the 20l. he expects to receive from the county.</p>

On the 14th of December, between four and five o'clock, I received information from a lad, and found 13lbs. or 14lbs. of solder concealed in a copper, in front of the shop. I marked it, and watched to see who would come for it; the prisoner left off work at six o'clock; I wanted him to stop till ten, which he objected to; I went to the copper at six, and the solder was gone. I followed the prisoner, and took him eight or nine doors off, and found it concealed in the waist-hand of his trousers - he said he was not the only one.</p>

I employed the prisoner on Saturday, the 24th of December, to work for me, and discharged him at night - I was awoke by my wife soon after three o'clock in the morning, of the 25th; she asked if I had fastened the room door; the prisoner did not lodge there - I had fastened it. My purse was in my trousers pocket, on a chair in the room, by the fire place; a person could not get at it without forcing the room door. I got up, and found the door had been forced open - a little force would do it - my purse was taken out of my pocket; I am sure there were some sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and two crowns. I know I had 4l. 10s. in all. I had ordered the prisoner to go at eleven o'clock, and he said he was not particular, and I said he might stop till twelve. I closed the door at half-past one - whether he concealed himself in the house I do not know. He was found in the house, and my purse taken from him at the watch-house, with four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and two half-crowns in it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. On the 14th of December, about half-past four o'clock, I went to No. 1, Little Welbeck-street, next door to the Edinburgh Castle, public-house - when I arrived I saw a hackney-coach at the door - I went into the house, and saw the prisoner, a woman named Hickey, Mrs. Harrington, and the coachman - the prisoner and Hickey seemed to be intoxicated; I asked the prisoner if her name was not Conroy, which she denied; I said"Why, you were servant to Mrs. Hunter" - she also denied that, and denied having lived at Mr. Crowder's - Hickey also denied it. A trunk stood by the side of them - I asked whose it was - Conroy and Hickey said it was not theirs - I said I should detain them all - Hickey threw down a pocket-book which had a duplicate in it, which does not apply to this property. I took from Conroy's hand some keys, and the duplicate of a piece of silk, pawned for 30s. on the 14th of December. Mr. Crowder and Allison came in and identified Conroy: I immediately took them all to the office, and opened the box in the presence of them all. The first thing I saw was various lengths of silk, containing, in all, twenty-five yards - there was a silk dress, and pelisse, three petticoats, two night gowns, four shifts, four silver tea-spoons, two silver table-spoons, a stuff dress, a cloth pelisse, and a pair of silk stockings, all of which I gave to Mrs. Hunter, at the second examination, about the 18th - they were in my custody till then; from the prisoner's person I took a bombazeen gown, a shawl, a cloth pelisse, and bonnet - she had them on; I delivered them with a pair of boots and shoes, from the trunk, to Miss Bowstead, at the second examination, by order of the Magistrate. I produce six more tea-spoons, a dessert spoon, and a salt-spoon - every thing was in the trunk except what was found on her person.</p>

They took her to the office with the box. She had told me the night before, that she had a parcel of silk in the box, and after my husband went out in the morning she took out a piece of silk, and shewed me - it was exactly of this colour - she asked me to cut enough for an umbrella off it - (my husband is an umbrella maker) - I said I should like to measure it first, which I did, and it measured forty yards; after I cut it I said "In the name of God, Ann, how did you come by all this?" she said "I nabbed it - I have plenty more, and silver spoons too;" I said "How could you do so, you will be hung;" she said "Oh, never fear, she is an old widow, and she won't know where to find me;" I asked where she lived; she said "In Charles-street;" I asked if she kept a silk mercer's shop - she said she was a dress-maker; I asked her name; she said "No matter;" I told her she must leave my place instantly, and then I got so flurried that I do not know what more passed - only I remember her going away from my place.</p>

On the 29th of December I missed several watches and cases - I desired him to go up stairs with me, and look over the goods, and on looking them over I missed several watches and cases. I desired him to put down on a paper the number of the watches and cases that were missing - he did so, and I then told him that I felt rather distrustful at losing my property, and requested him to find where they were, or make them good; he said it was possible they might be in the hands of some of the work people - he then left the premises to look for them - he returned in the afternoon, and said he still suspected they must be in the hands of the work people; I said I should not be satisfied till the property was found, nor would I suffer him to sit down till it was found; he left my employ for that day, and returned about the middle of the next day; I went up stairs with him, and told him he must know where the property lay - he said he did not, and went down stairs towards the work-shop - I followed him down, and told him unless the property was found he should not work for me, and he left me. I went to Hatton-garden, and took out a search-warrant, next morning(Saturday) - I proceeded, with Read and Lloyd, to his apartments, in Charlotte-terrace, New-cut, Lambeth, and saw him there; I questioned him, in the presence of the officers, respecting the property - he then admitted that he had pawned it; Read requested him not to say any thing, except it was voluntary. A piece of paper was then handed to him, and he wrote down the names of different pawnbrokers where the property was, but said he had destroyed the duplicates - we searched him, and found upon him the list which he had written for me the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Has he not since shewn great contrition, and been the means of your discovering more property than you missed? A. I have not seen him since to say whether he is contrite. I had seen all this property at different times - it may have been taken peace-meal.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In your judgment neither of them would fetch more than 40s.? A. They would not fetch me more - we sell them by auction. I would sell such a one for 39s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your husband here? A. No; he is rather embarrassed; we expected an execution in the house, and employed Simpson to move the goods, and bring me back the key - my husband only took a few necessary things for his own use. There was plenty left to satisfy the creditors.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether your husband afterwards assisted in pawning the goods you do not know? A. He was not out of the house before two persons came and told us of it. He was arrested that night - he never told me he had desired the prisoner to pawn them, if he could not find a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the house stripped of every individual article before the execution came? A. That I deny. After we took a few, the King's tax-gatherer moved a few, but there was a good deal left.</p>

I was four hours before I could get a place to put them in; I at last took them to Middlesex-street; the carman said they should not be taken out till I paid him 12s. - a quarrel ensued; he said he would give information where the things were, and thinking them not altogether safe there, I said I would pawn them - the constable who searched me left 2l. in my fob; he said he had 2l. 13s.; I said, "You should have 4l. 13s., and if you have no more you have robbed me."</p>

            . On the 21st of December Mr. Compton called upon me - I went with him to No. 3, Edmond's-place; we found the prisoners up stairs: I found a dead pig in a tub of water, being scalded; I found two more laying in the corner - one alive, and the other dead. The prisoners both said they did not know how they came there; I said it was very strange pigs should come there and they not know how - they then said a man had driven them in, and was to call for them at twelve o'clock. On handcuffing them I found their hands were quite damp - there was a pot of water by them, with blood and water in it, as if they had been washing their hands in it - we found a picklock-key and a hammer, which the pigs had been knocked at the head with - the hammer matched the bruises, and was all over blood, and so was a case-knife; the pigs appeared to have been first stunned, and then had their throats cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What sort of a house is this? A. It has only two rooms. Two girls lived there besides the prisoners. I found the pigs in the lower room; the tub of water was up stairs. I saw nobody escape out of the roof.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did she send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120031"/>any communication to you about the property before you went to her? A. Certainly not; I went to make inquiry of her as well as to offer her linen; I said nothing to induce her to say any thing. I have heard she was connected with a fortune-teller; my spoons and table cloths were returned, with some sheets, which were not mine, but were as good. I am single, and she acted as my housekeeper - she is a widow, and, I believe, has three children.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS MASSEY. I am in partnership with Mr. Wiltshire, but not in this property. I accompanied him to the Compter; he asked her about some spoons, and two table cloths, which she said should be returned. Mr. Teague cautioned him not to have them returned except through the officer.</p>

            . I first knew the prisoner in November - she came to lodge with me at No. 32, Great Sutton-street - we became intimate; she informed me that Mrs. Buchanan had been a particular friend of her's, and the sole support of herself and former husband, for when she could not give her money, she gave her her master's prints and cottons, which she tore into lengths, and pawned at different pawnbrokers, and burnt the tickets to avoid detection; that Buchanan lived with a Mr. W. in the City, but she did not say where. I had often heard her talk of going to Mrs. B. in Newgate-street, by which I knew she meant Buchanan, and one night she sent her daughter to Mrs. Buchanan in the City for a bundle - her daughter returned, and could not find it; she and her mother had words, and she told me what a stupid girl she must be, as there was a board up close by to say where Mr. W. had removed to; next night she went herself, as she told me, and saw Mrs. Buchanan, but she had company, and she was to go the next night. I then went myself to find out Mr. W., to inform him she was coming for a parcel - I at last found Mr. W., who had removed to the Poultry, and Buchanan lived there; I told the clerk the prisoner was to call, and told him what she had told me - that when the officers were walking on the opposite side of the way, she went to Mr. W's., and brought the prints away, wrapped round her body, after eight o'clock at night. I once wanted some shirt frills for my son - she said she had plenty in pawn; about three weeks ago she went to Hatton-garden to swear to the loss of some duplicates, and when she returned, she said she had settled it all comfortably.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever say she had been at the prosecutor's house? A. She said she had been in the warehouse several times - that their stock was immense, and a little could not be missed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not understand from her that the bundles were ready for her when she called? A. No. I never asked her a question, it was all said voluntarily - she told me she knew where to find the things, that they were between the bed and mattress. I gave information as soon as I knew where to find the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your living? A. I have two houses in St. James's walk left me by my father. I kept a butcher's shop till within the last six weeks, and have books with 4 or 500l. of debts on them; I am a widow, and have six children; when I want money I collect a few debts - no single women lodges in the house, except the prisoner's daughter. I occasionally lent the prisoner 1l., and she got communicatlve with me; she represented herself as my sister, but she is not. I had no quarrel with her - I should be afraid to have words with her. I wished her to leave my house - she has abused me, and used very improper language, but if she was abusive at night she was civil next morning - she was not quite sober, and I excused it. I gave her notice to quit several times, she said I must give her regular notice, and I must wait till quarter day to do so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before you gave information had you learnt who Mr. W. meant? A. I did not know till I went on a Thursday night in November, and read it on the board in Newgate-street.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I went to the prisoner's house, and directly the door was open I ran to the bureau and pulled out some duplicates. I said,"Here are plenty of duplicates;" she said there was no property there belonging to Mr. W. Mr. Massey asked her some questions, but I was busy searching, and did not attend to them. I did not tell her Buchanan was in custody till afterward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he came in he asked if I knew Buchanan; and when the duplicates were found, I said, "If there is any of Mr. W's. property there, I will eat my head." What Johnson has said is false. I knew her five years ago, but have not seen her for three years till lately, when an intimacy commenced, and she proposed our taking a house together; quarrels ensued in consequence of men going in and out at all hours - I was informed the house would be indicted. I certainly told her I was going to see Buchanan, and if she had no money she would let me have other things, as she often lent me clothes to pawn.</p>

On the morning of the 20th of December I met the prisoner under the Piazzas of Covent-garden, about half-past twelve o'clock; I had been at a public-house with some friends; I had a purse in my right hand breeches pocket with 3l. 18s. in it, which I had seen safe about six o'clock; when I left the public-house I paid the reckoning with some loose silver; I am certain the purse was in my pocket about two minutes before I met the prisoner, she persuaded me to go with her to her house, which I did. I awoke in the morning and she was gone - I then missed my money from my purse, my watch, which I had laid on the window seat, and my shoes. I came down and found her on the stairs - I told her I had lost my watch and money; she did not deny having taken it, but grinned and laughed at me. I said I was very desirous of having the watch as it was a keep-sake, and she told a child to go and get it; a woman, who was there, said, if I would go with her she would tell me where the money was deposited; that it was in the hands of a publican. I asked the landlady to let me have a pair of shoes, and went with the prisoner to Pearce, who gave her one sovereign and some silver - I then gave charge of her; I had not given her any money.</p>

I had 17s. 6d. in silver in my right hand breeches' pocket, just as I entered the door; there was a half-crown, and the rest in shillings and sixpences. I caught the prisoner's hand as he was drawing the money out of my pocket, and handing it to another person - some of it fell on the ground; as soon as I said "I am robbed, and this is the man," some one struck me on the head, and knocked my hat over my eyes.

I accused the constable of taking money from the prisoner in going to the watch-house; I did not say first that I had lost 7s. and then 9s. - I said 7s. 6d., and then I checked myself and said 17s. 6d. I was perplexed a little - I had a friend with me; I did not hear him say the prisoner was not the man.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at the corner of Russell-court, Drury-lane - I have been a constable four months; the prisoner was given into my charge; the prosecutor said he had robbed him at the entrance of Drury-lane Theatre. I think he said of 7s. or 10s. - and he insisted upon my taking him to the watch-house or to Bow-street - he was very tipsy, and prevaricated very much in his story - and his friend said he did not think the prisoner was the man; I took him to Bow-street - there were several officers there, some of whom said I should go out and settle it, for if I took him before the Magistrate, he would reprimand me for bringing a drunken man there - I then took him to St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a master-baker? A. Yes. The prosecutor had a person with him, who was more sober than he was, and his friend said he did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120034"/>think the prisoner was the man; he said he had lost 7s. and 10s. - I do not think he mentioned 17s. at all. I took him first to a public-house, to settle it; and then we set off to go the watch-house, and met the keeper. The prisoner and I went in there, the prosecutor followed us, but the watch-house-keeper saw that he and his friend were drunk, and he pushed them out again. The prisoner went on very quietly with me, and declared he knew nothing about the robbery. As we were going along Henrietta-street the prosecutor and his friend came up, and said, "It is all over - let go of the prisoner;" I said I would not - I had got the man in custody; he said, "You are doing wrong - it is a bubble altogether," and I considered he alluded to my being connected with the prisoner - we then turned back, and went to St. Paul's watch-house, Covent-garden, and afterwards to Bow-street; the prosecutor stated there that I was going along with the prisoner, and he thought I had got some of the money. I offered to be searched, but Sir

             would not allow it. The prisoner was very sober, and wished to be searched, and 14s. 6d. was found upon him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What distance is your house from the Theatre? A. About fifty yards - I have lived there about nine months. Though the prosecutor was drunk, and prevaricated about the amount of the money, he did not prevaricate about the prisoner being the man. It was the prosecutor who said it was of no use going on. It was the officer at Bow-street who said it was no use taking a drunken a man in, and I had better go and settle it. The prosecutor refused to come into that measure; we did go the same night before Sir Richard Birnie - he was not angry, but took the prosecutor's testimony, and committed the prisoner - it appeared to me very extraordinary, and it does so now. Sir Richard Birnie told him two or three times to hold his tongue, for a drunken fool. Neither I nor any of the officers told the Magistrate that we had proposed he should not be troubled with the case. I thought the prisoner was as innocent as I was, but I thought it my duty to keep him, as a constable. There were so many officers, I could not tell the names of those who gave me this advice.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNBULL re-examined. Q. Had you been at any public-house that day? A. No. I am a single man, and had been at home with my friends. I had not been drinking. I went to the Theatre to keep out of the way of drinking. Sir Richard Birnie accused me of being drunk, but I told him I was not, and he afterwards took my deposition. I cannot remember whether I signed it, but it has my signature to it, and I was not there afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were so sober that you cannot remember whether you signed the deposition or not? A. No; but I was not there afterwards. I had drank nothing but water all day - my friend was close behind me at the entrance of the Theatre - he did not tell me he thought I was wrong about the prisoner. There was a woman in Mr. Bowler's shop, but I did not notice her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Drury-lane, the prosecutor and another man came up, and said,"You have picked my pocket;" I said, "What do you mean?" and his friend said, "Are you an Englishman?" I said, "Yes" - then he said, "You will not mind going before a Magistrate" - I said, "No." We then went into the baker's-shop, and I was given in charge.</p>

            . I am married, and lodge at Mr. Bowler's. On the evening of the 26th of December I met the prisoner and the prosecutor coming into the shop - the prosecutor was drunk in my opinion - any one looking at him must have seen he was drunk; he called the person who was with him his brother; Mr. Bowler said, "What do you want? - do you want to give charge of this man?" the prosecutor said, "I have been robbed of 7s. or 10s.," and his friend leaned over the counter, and said to Mr. Bowler,"For myself, I don't think he is the man, but he pointed him out to me, and I held him;" the prisoner did not make the least appearance of wanting to escape. Mr. Bowler asked him if he had any objection to go before the Magistrate - he said No; he appeared perfectly sober, and so did the prosecutor's brother. Mr. Bowler is single, and I minded his shop for him while he went - I have lived there about nine months.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM TURNBULL. Q. Was there any money in the prisoner's hand after you heard some drop? - A. I cannot say that, but after we got out he asked me to let go of his hand, which I did, and he put it towards his pocket; I do not know whether he put any thing into his pocket.</p>
               <p>JURY to EDWARD BOWLER. Q. Where was the money taken from? A. I think some was taken from each of his pockets.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. - I met the prisoner and another man in Stacey-street, St. Giles's, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st of December, about half a mile from Meux's brewhouse; the prisoner had this cock underneath his jacket; I followed him to the shop of a plumber, named Conniss, in Long-acre - while he was at the door I took him by the collar, and knocked at the door; Conniss came down - I asked if he knew the prisoner - he said he had seen him. but he was not in his employ. I then asked if he knew this cock - he said No. The prisoner then said he got it from a house at the west end of the town. I took him into custody.</p>

About the 7th of September the prisoner came to my house with a paper, which he put into my hand, and desired me to read; I found it to be a sort of agreement drawn up, without a seal to it. I asked him what he meant, and he said he was about to commence a very extensive job for the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to build two first rate houses, and some store-houses, and as I was in the building line he wished me to undertake it. I took him into the parlour and questioned him about it; he afterwards went away, saying he would call again, which he did on the following Friday; he again asked me to undertake the job, and I thought there might be some truth in it. I gave him some bread and cheese, and gin and water, and he asked if I would allow him to pay his men at my house; I said Yes; he said he had a gang of excavators at work at Battle-bridge; he came on the Saturday evening - he took out a book and began writing in it; he asked me to give him 2l. in change, which I laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120036"/>down on the table, and he said he would give me a note for it in a minute, but when I turned round he was gone. I never intended to part with my change till I had got the note.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did it state on the ticket that they should have been delivered on the 17th? A. Yes; and the prisoner said he had delivered them on the spot, but there being no person there to take the ticket he was forced to take it away; but I knew they had not come; I had only left the yard at twelve o'clock, to take my dinner at the Woolpack, which is just opposite, and I could see the yard all the time; there was a bricklayer and a labourer at work there; nine or ten loads of bricks were delivered that day, but I am sure the prisoner brought none; when the bricks were delivered the carter delivered the tickets, which I gave my master the same evening - I was there from three o'clock till six.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner came about half-past three o'clock on the 26th of November, and said he came from my husband, who wanted his black coat and umbrella, as he was going to the Archbishop of Canterbury's with three men, whose names he mentioned; I rather doubted it, but as I knew they were in the habit of going to the Archbishop's, I delivered them to him. I did not know him but he appeared to know me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long was he in your company? A. About five minutes. I can swear positively to his person.</p>

I stumbled against the parcel and fell - I got up and took it up, and again ran after the prisoner. In about two minutes I heard the watchman say "It is all right - we have got him."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Where had you been? A. Into Thames-street; I had been drinking - I did not say "That is not the man" - I said I could not swear to him as I had not seen his face.</p>

            . I was on duty, and heard the rattle - I saw Magrath run up Middle-row - I went the other way, and met the prisoner, with Magrath at his heels - he was running fast, and no person was before him - he said why did I stop him - he was not the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you seize another man? A. No; two Irishmen came up and said "That is not the man, it is this man;" I took the man they pointed out, but he was set at liberty at the watch-house; there might be half a dozen people.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 5th of January, about eleven o'clock at night, he came into the tap-room, and asked for a Welch-rarebit - I said it was too late; he sat down in the tap-room for nearly half an hour; when I called him to go to bed, he said, "Very well." I then went into the parlour behind the bar to finish my supper. I and my wife both fell asleep there - she awoke me - it did not then want more than five minutes to one o'clock, and I saw the prisoner standing near one of the doors which was open - he asked me for his candle; I said it was on the table, and he took it and went to bed; I then looked at the two tills in the bar, one of which had 10 or 11s. in it, and the other more; I had seen the money all right about five minutes before I told the prisoner to go to bed; I missed about one pound from one till, and all except one sixpence from the other; the Hollands bottle had been taken from its place and put on another shelf, and I missed some other bottles. I went for a constable, and we went into the prisoner's room, found some money in his pockets, and a bad sixpence in his waistcoat pocket; we found a bottle in which I had kept gin, but it was then full of gin and hollands mixed together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was any of the money marked? A. No. It was in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; I had not counted the money, and cannot speak positively to the amount, but I think there was about 30s. in one of the tills at first, and about 1l. was gone; when I went to the prisoner's room, he had been up stairs about an hour and a half - I knocked, but got no answer; I then got in by violence - he was undressed and in bed; I found 31s. or 32s. in his pockets, in sixpences, shillings, and half-crowns; there had been a counterfeit sixpence in one of the tills, and there was one found in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket; he had thrown a bottle of vinegar into the street, which stood in the bar.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went into the prisoner's room; I found him in bed, and this bottle with the liquor in it; I found 11s. and a bad 6d. in one of his pockets, and 21s. 6d. in another, nine penny pieces, a half-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120039"/>penny, and a farthing. I asked how much money he ought to have, and he said 24s. or 25s; this is a part of the vinegar bottle that was thrown in the street; he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming home I purchased a bottle of whiskey; I fell asleep on the table, and when I awoke I went to the water closet on the second floor - I then recollected that I had not taken the key of my bed-room; I went down again, and Mr. Moore started, and asked what I wanted, I said, "The key of my room;" he said, "It is on the candlestick." I took it and went up to bed, and soon after four o'clock I was awoke by the officer - he asked me what I had in my pockets - I told him as nearly as I could, that I had received 1l. 15s. the day before, and paid Mr. Moore 4s. or 5s. for the week's rent; the whole of the bar is surrounded with glass, and it is morally impossible that a person could go into the bar and pour liquor from one bottle into another, and then come to each till and take the contents of them without Mr. Moore's awaking.</p>
               <p>COURT to MOORE. Q. Were there two bottles, one with gin and one with Hollands? A. Yes; the gin bottle was taken, and the Hollands bottle was left, but nearly emptied; when he was asked about the money taken from the till, he said he had taken change of a sovereign at No. 305, Oxford-street, and had received 15s. for some lessons.</p>

I then took his clothes, and asked how much money he ought to have - he said he had received a sovereign and 15s. for some lessons; he thought there ought to be 24s. or 25s. remaining.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. I saw the prisoner at an iron shop in Gee's-court, kept by a man of the name of barber, with some old metal and this new cock in his hand; I saw Barber examine the cock and put it aside - the prisoner than came out with it, and I asked him where he got it; he said it was his own, and he was a master ironmonger, living in Bird-street. I said I was not satisfied, and would go with him; as we went along he said he did not keep a shop; I then asked where he worked, he said, no where on this side of the water, and his name was Brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This is my first offence, and I hope you will consider my family. I am innocent of the crime of taking the cock - it was put into my parcel by some person in the manufactory.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Gardner to the prisoner's house, in Devizes-street - I found some timber there, and one particular piece, which they call pine. I asked if he had any more of his master's property in the house - he clasped his hands, and said, "I have - I have." I then went up stairs, and found about fifty pieces of timber - he said afterwards that it was his poor family who would suffer - he should be transported.</p>

On the afternoon of the 6th of January I found a piece of metal in a workshop, where it could not be used; I marked it, and left it in its place. I then kept watch, and at half-past five o'clock I placed Mead to watch; I then saw Rogers go into the shop where the metal was; on his return I followed him out - Mead called to me, and said, "That is he - in company with a man in a white coat;" Rogers had just passed the metal from himself to Murray - I secured them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What do you call this? A. It is composition metal. Murray had left us about a week; Rogers had been in the employ about twelve months - it is worth about 18s. I swear to it by the private mark which I made upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see this piece of metal in the early part of the day? A. Yes, under some sweepings - I put the mark upon it, and found the same piece between the two prisoners afterwards.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MEAD. I am in the employ of Messrs. Cox and Young. Worsfold ordered me to watch outside the gate; Rogers came out about half-past five o'clock, with this piece of metal in his hand; he went on a few paces, and gave it to Murray - I kept sight of him till Worsfold came up.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ADAMS. I am an officer, and received this metal.</p>

On the night of the 30th of December the prisoner came into my room, where the work was, and asked for work - I said I could not give him any - he then went towards the prosecutor's loom - he staid about five minutes, and then went away; Mandrell came in the morning, and complained of having lost his trevat; the prisoner came again in the evening, and was taken - he said before the Magistrate that he took it and pawned it, and tore the duplicate into pieces. He was at that time, I believe, without a home, and in great distress.</p>

            . I live in Golden-lane; I am errand boy to Mr. Phillips. I was in his shop about nine o'clock on the night of the 4th of January - the prisoner came in to bring some work home - he laid himself up against some shoes, and asked where the man was; I said in the cellar; a lady then came to be measured for a pair of boots - I called the man to measure her - there was no one else in the shop but the prisoner; when the lady left the man went into the cellar; the prisoner put out the gas, and went to the other side of the counter - he then went to go away, and I saw the boots in his basket; I said, "What have you got in your basket?" I ran and took hold of him, but could not hold him - he dragged me up an alley, where there was an officer - he then threw the boots down, and said "What do you want, I have got nothing." I told the officer to hold him, and I got the boots from the kennel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the shop he asked me which gas gave the best light; he turned off one, and told me to turn on the other - I turned it the wrong way; the man then came out of the cellar and put down my money in the book - when I was going out the witness came after me, and said, "What have you got in your basket?" I said, "Nothing but my mother's shop-book;" he then said, I should drag him as far as I could - and I took him up an alley; he then called for an officer, and said I had taken a pair of boots.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I met the prisoner on the night of the 16th of December, in Whitechapel-road, about seven o'clock, with a bag under his arm - I asked what he had got, and he said plate-glass, which he had brought from No. 11, Munyard-street, Hoxton; he afterwards said he was going to take it there, and had bought it of a man at his own door. I took him to the office, and then went to Munyard-street, where he said he lodged. I found a great number of articles there, some behind the bed, and some in other places, which I have brought here.</p>

Yes; but I never sell it in this state; I know this because it has my initials on it, which are taken off when it is worked - they are put on when it is selected at the glass house; I know this veneer to be mine, and this looking-glass; I have very few workmen.</p>

About a quarter past six o'clock on the evening of the 2d of January, a lady said some meat was stolen - I ran as far as St. John-street, and saw the prisoner with two other boys - I caught bold of him, and a gentleman assisted me- the meat fell from him - I had seen it safe about three minutes before it was missed - he must have crept under the stall board.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George, Hanover-square. I was at Park-street Chapel; the prosecutor's wife came, and said she wanted me to take a thief - I went with her up Oxford-street - she said she did not know the person, but she knew the coat; I told her to give me a signal, which she did, and I took the prisoner; I was immediately surrounded by a number of persons who sell Sunday newspapers, who insisted that I should let him go. I had not then made any charge against him, but I said, "If you resist my taking him, I will take you;" they then dispersed - I then asked the prisoner whose coat it was - he said, "Never you mind, it is mine." I said,"Have you taken it by mistake;" he said, "Never you mind;" but when we got to the watch-house he acknowledged it was not his - he was a little in liquor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am one of the shopmen. I was called by Mrs. Hucklestone, to go to the prisoner - I went and accused her of having a piece of lace; she was sitting by the side of the counter; she muttered something, and said"Dear me!" and took the lace out of her pocket immediately. I told her I should send for an officer - she then pulled another piece out of the same pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Were there other persons in the shop? A. Yes, a great many; the counter is generally covered with goods when we are busy. There are twelve yards of lace in one piece, and twenty-seven in the other - thirty-nine in all - it is worth 30s. I have known the prisoner some time - she is respectable; she took them from under her clothes - it is possible they might have been drawn under her dress by her handkerchief - it had been in a box behind the counter.</p>

            . I serve in the shop. The prisoner asked for some black sarsenet to match a pattern, and I went to our other shop, next door, to get some; I was gone three or four minutes; she bought three yards, and then asked for some calico of which she also bought six yards; she then asked me to shew her some lace; I shewed her the box in which these two pieces were; I sold her a yard and a half, or two yards of another piece of lace - she did not pay me till after she had been accused of this; I then saw her take one piece from her pocket, or from under her clothes, and on being threatened to be given in charge to an officer, she took out the other. I had not left her before I sold her the lace. There was a little girl standing by who took up a piece of lace, and I desired her to put it down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been shewing her this lace? A. Yes; she came in alone - the child who look up the lace was not with her. When she was accused of it she said "Dear me, it must have come in with my pocket handkerchief." She has been there several times before, and we always thought her respectable.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the child who handled the lace, on the same side as the pocket from which the prisoner took the lace? A. She was behind her. I had not parted with the sarsenet or the calico - the lace was round the cards, as it it now.</p>
               <p>Thirteen witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ask him where he had got it? A. Yes, and he said he would let me know in another place; he said afterwards he had it given to him by another man.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is in Piccadilly. On the night of the 9th of December, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner come together out of the Yorkshire Grey - the prosecutor was very drunk, and said to me "Watchman, I put myself under your protection;" I was taking him to the watch-house, and had got as far as the Dane's house when Jones came up to me, and said "Mr. Woods is a particular friend of mine, and I will see him home;" he then took him from me. Mr. Woods had his seals then - they went away, arm in arm - the prisoner followed them but did not say a word to me - I saw nothing more till about half-past twelve o'clock, when the prisoner passed me - Mr. Jones was then ringing at the door of the Yorkshire Grey, and said to me "Stop that man, he has robbed my friend of his seals;" I sung out to him to stop, and went up to him and said "I have got charge of you;" he put his hand to his pockets, and said "I have no seals - I have nothing belonging to any one but myself;" Mr. Jones told me to take him to the Yorkshire Grey; I said I must take him to the watch-house - I saw the constable search him - there was nothing found on him but some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120046"/>silver. I went to the place where I had taken him, and found two seals there, which I took to the watch-house - I went again with Mr. Jones, and found one piece of the ring and the key; next morning I found the other piece of the ring near the door of Mr. Woods' house, in Dorset-street, Mary-le-bone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Does the piece of ring correspond with the other part of it? A. I have not compared it - I only know that Jones lodged at the Yorkshire Grey, and he was there when he told me to stop the prisoner. The prisoner made no effort to get away - I called him twice and he stopped.</p>

            , and lodged at the Yorkshire Grey, about a month or five weeks before the 9th of December. I have known Woods four or five years; I came home that night about eleven o'clock, and found him holding by the door of the bar; I walked by him into the parlour, as the landlord wished me not to speak to him. I saw the prisoner there with him - the landlord and his wife afterwards said Woods was gone to the watch-house; I went and took him from the watchman and the prisoner, near St. James's-church; when we got on to Old Bond-street the prisoner came up to us again, and I said "I don't wish you to go with us - I would rather you would go along;" he said "I am a friend of his, and will go with him;" we went down Bond-street, and then went on to his lodging in Dorset-street; I took the key from him, and opened the door, and whether the prisoner tripped him up or not, I do not know, but when I turned round he was lying all along, and the prisoner upon him. I took him into his room, and took off his clothes, and said "Where are your seals?" he said he did not know; I came back again and found the prisoner walking in Bond-street, about four doors from Piccadilly; I told him my friend had lost his seals, and I suspected he had them; we then went on to the Yorkshire Grey, and I asked him in, but he would not go - the watchman came up, and I said I suspected he had robbed my friend of his seals - he took him to the watch-house - I afterwards saw the seals found on the very spot where I charged the watchman with him - the small part of the ring was found near Woods' door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time of this robbery were you out of place? A. Yes; I had been on the spot where the seals and key were found; I never wanted any money to get rid of the prosecution - nor ever asked for it - I was offered money, but I said I was upon my oath, and could not go from it - this is the person (pointing to Fletcher) who offered me money - he is a friend of the prisoner, and I believe he called him master. I never in my life, upon my oath, said to this man, or to any other person, that if he would give me 10l. I would be out of the way as soon as I got the money. The prisoner did not appear at all in liquor.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 9th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, and had a glass of gin and water - he was very drunk - he gave me a dollar to change, which I did, and took the change to him - he would not take it - he said he had not given me any thing, and I kept it - he went away in a few minutes afterwards.</p>

            . I am a washer-woman. On the night of the 9th of December, I was coming past a public-house, near St. James's Church, a little after eleven o'clock, where I saw the prisoner - some person had pushed him, and his hat fell off; I know him again - he tried to pick up his hat and fell down - I turned myself round and saw a man, very similar to Mr. Woods, with a tall woman, who appeared to be a woman of the town, a little further on, towards the Church - they appeared very drunk - the man had pushed the woman down, and she lay on her back - the prisoner staggered towards them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 40, Great St. Andrew's-street. I was coming from washing - I did not do any thing to the prisoner - I did not go before the Magistrates, but on the Saturday week I went to my work at Mrs. Whitcomb's, No. 2, Brewer's-green, Westminster, and I related the circumstance to her. Had the woman not appeared to me to be a woman of the town I should have assisted her, but seeing the prisoner stagger towards them, I thought they were all drunk together. I saw something white, white appeared to be linen, fall from the woman's hand; she fell down; I did not go close to them, nor call the watchman - I saw the other person help her up and stagger on with her; I did not find out Mr. Joplin's, but the person to whom I related the circumstance made inquiries, and told what I had said.</p>
               <p>- FLETCHER. I am a builder. I now lodge at No. 27, Tottenham-place, St. Pancras. I have generally been a superintendant of workmen; I never, upon my oath, made any offer of money of Jones to keep out of the way- I never saw him but once.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him? A. Last Monday evening, at the Yorkshire Grey, when I went there with the prisoner's father, at his desire. I had not known the prisoner before, but I had seen an account in the Paper of the prisoner being in custody, and, as I know his wife, I called there, where I saw his wife, his sisters, and his father - his father told me that Jones lodged at the Yorkshire Grey, and he wished me to go with him to see the prosecutor, and the witnesses; he said he should like to know the particulars of the case, and he wished to know if they could not settle it without going to trial. I stated an objection, as it was a delicate subject; they talked about settling it, but I do not know that they mentioned trial; I did not know what was to be settled; I did not give it a thought; I went to shew the father the Yorkshire Grey; I knew the landlord very well; I saw Jones there, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120047"/>asked him what it was all about, and if they could not settle the difference among ourselves; he stepped out at the door with me in a great passion, and said he would not settle it, but he said afterwards that, if he was remunerated for his expenses and loss of time, he would certainly settle it - there was no one there when he said so - it was about eight o'clock when I went to the house, and I got home about ten. I will swear I did not offer him any meney to make it up - no money was mentioned - I had no right to make any bargain with him.</p>

             I am a carpenter and joiner. I live in Durham - I am a freeman and freeholder of that city. I believe the prisoner is my son. I have seen Mr. Fletcher since I have been in London; I first saw him on Monday evening, while I was sitting at my daughter's house; I had not then applied to any solicitor. I said to Fletcher that I wished to see Jones, and we went to the Yorkshire Grey; Jones came in in about ten minutes; I wanted to know what he had to charge against my son - when Jones came in Fletcher said "There is Jones" - I said"Is that the person who has sworn my son's life away;" Jones and Fletcher then went out, and I followed them - Jones said "If you will give me my expenses, and 1l. that I have paid, and pay my loss of time, I will go off to-morrow morning, and you shall hear no more of me." I never desired Fletcher to offer him money - I only went to get right information, to know what it was about, that I might provide for my son. I was at some distance when Jones said what he did, but I heard Flethcer reply "You shall not have a farthing, nor shall you get any thing by swearing the man's life away." He then said to Jones "This is the young man's father;" Jones then came to me and said"Are you his father?" I said "I believe I am, and what is the meaning of your swearing a man's life away in the manner you have?" he said "I have no ill-will against the young man - I know very little about it - if you will go in I will treat you with a glass;" I said "You shall not treat me - I will toss you up;" we went in and called for a glass a piece, and I paid for them - Fletcher had a glass with us; he then said to Jones "Where is your friend Woods?" Jones said "He is at such a house, and we shall find him, and if you will pay me I will have nothing to do with it, and I dare say Woods will do so too." Jones then led us into a house to see a man whom I thought was an attorney - he had but one hand; I said "What is all this about - have you to do with it?" he said "Yes, I have a thing which I have made up;" I said "Let me see what it is;" the attorney then sent us down to another public-house, and while we were there Woods and him came in; - Woods said he would take the same money as Jones, if he could have the seals and ring - Fletcher said he would not give him a penny. I have not seen Jones since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Fletcher look in upon you accidentally? A. Yes; I went to know what was the charge against my son; I had not been anxious to go to Bow-street - there was no attorney employed by me - I did not go for the purpose of settling it - I told Fetcher I believed this was a fabricated story against my son - I did not know that Jones and Woods had been sworn; I had heard that no man can be committed except upon oath; it was from respect to Fletcher that I went and drank with those men, who I believed were guilty of perjury.</p>
               <p>COURT to JONES. Q. Did you ever say that if your expenses were paid, and 1l. given to you, you would be out of the way? A. No - it is utterly false.</p>
               <p>COURT to WOODS. Q. It has been stated that you acquiesced in that proposition? A. No. I did not - I have had offers made me by the prisoner's friends.</p>

            . I am one of the foot patrol. I met the prisoner near the watch-house on this night, with a small bundle rolled up in this cloak; a man was with him, who ran away - he said it was a bundle of dirty linen, which he was going to take to his mother, who was a laundress, and he had got it from the Golden Cross, St. John-street, Smithfield - that his mother had left it there being a little in liquor. I asked where his mother lived; he could not tell - I took him into custody, and found a ticket in the bundle, dated the 10th of January.</p>

            . I was with Jennings - what he has stated is correct. I picked up the cloak, which fell from the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was examined the officer said the bundle was wrapped up in the cloak, and it was on the ground. I was standing on the curb stone - a young man, very genteely dressed, came and asked me to carry the bundle as far as Vine-street, for 6d., and if any question should be asked, he told me what to say; he went on before, and said he would make the bundle the lighter, and he put the great coat on - when he saw me taken he ran away.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I met the prisoner about half-past eleven o'clock at night on the 28th of November, at the corner of Wilderness-row, with two parcels; I asked what this large one contained - he said two skins, which he was going to send to his brother, in Norfolk; I asked if he had any letter to shew where he got them - he said he received them from Mr. Barnes, a tailor, in Heath-street, Stepney. We then took him to a public-house in Goswell-road, and asked if he had a letter from his brother - he said he had one, but destroyed it - that he lived at Mr. Astow's, a wine-merchant, opposite - my brother officer went over there, and that gentleman pledged himself to be answerable for his appearance next morning; I went there the next day, and saw the prisoner again - he said, "I told you an untruth last night - I found it at the back of my master's house last night" - this is the paper, in which there was but one skin; the paper was quite clean, though the night had been very wet and muddy. I afterwards showed this skin to Mr. Waite.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He told you where he lived, and you found him there the next morning? A. Yes. The place where he said he found the skin is a very dirty place at all times.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WAITE. I have no doubt at all of this skin being mine - I have made no mark upon it, but there is a particular chalk mark upon it; I bought it of Mr. Wyard, in Coleman-street - I had not missed it. The prisoner's brother was my porter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many such skins have you bought? A. Some hundreds, and other people have had the same. I do not know that I had noticed the chalk mark on it before. I had sold part of them, and cannot swear I had not sold this.</p>

On the 23d of December I was at work in Pope-street, Hackney-road, and found these tools hidden under the floor of the next house - I was at the Olive Branch, public-house, the same night, and saw the prisoner - I asked him if these tools were his, or if he had put them there; he said he had put a plane and saw under the floor; I said, I had given them to Mr. Wheeler.</p>

            . I was working in Pope-street, Hackney-road. I went there on the 23d of December, and saw the prisoner, who was very dilatory about the premises - I asked if he was going to work - he said he was; I then went away, and in the evening I saw him again at the Olive Branch. Grant told me he had a saw and a trying-plane; when he went away I sent Grant to get them, and I took them away - the next morning the prisoner came, and said he wanted to go to work. I asked how he came by the tools he had yesterday - he said they were his own, and his father had given them to him two years ago; I then asked the prisoner where he had lodged - he said,"In John-street;" I went there, and found he had only slept there one night.</p>

I saw the man stopped, and the shirt was in his breast; when the patrol struck him with his stick, he threw it from him; I saw a young woman pick it up, and give it to the patrol. I saw it afterwards, when he produced it at Lambeth-street Office, and knew it to be mine; the prisoner heard me say so, and it was taken down in writing - he seemed to deny it; no-other person is here.</p>

            . I live in the Old Bailey, and am a printer. On Wednesday week a man, who was quite a stranger, brought some types to my house, to sell for old metal - he did not ask a price, but brought a paper for me to fill up, with the prices of old metal, which I did; in about three hours he brought the metal, which appeared nearly new; I referred to Bridgeman and Barret, two of my men, who knew the type; the man said he brought it from a Mr. Dean, and I said I must see him - next day the prisoner came, about noon - he said his name was Dean, and asked if some old metal had not been left - I said it had; he asked why it had not been returned, or paid for; I said it had come under suspicious circumstances, and I had sent for a printer - I kept him till Mr. Dove arrived; the prisoner said he could clearly account for it, but when Mr. Dove claimed it he said he hoped Mr. Dove would be merciful to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say "I think you are acting very harsbly with me - take a little time to think of it?" A. I believe you did; but when you got up to go away you said you hoped he would be merciful to you. When a type is incomplete it is considered an old metal, but it is not usual to throw out metal so perfect as this; a great part of it could be used.</p>
               <p>Q. There was part of a page standing with the type when it came to you, in pie? A. Yes, and a part in papers - it is not exactly in the same state now as when it came; it has been thrown out of the trunk into the box - I seperated a part of it, but it is now mixed; there were two or three sorts of small pica, pica, brevier, and several others. There was part of a perfect page of an Italian Grammar, which was recognized by Mr. Dove - this is the type that was brought to me; it is worth 24s. as old metal, but 3l. or 4l. as type.</p>

Mr. Dove remained there about twenty minutes, and searched every room and cupboard that he thought proper; he looked at your receipts to see if there were any documents of his property, but he did not find any - we had no search-warrant - I do not remember that you wished Mr. Dove to go home with you, or said you would give him every information in your power - you wished him not to be harsh with you.</p>

            . I am a printer at Mr. Taylor's, and was apprentice at Mr. Dove's. I saw this type, and knew it to be his - there was some part of it in lines, in the Italian language, in small pages, I think in duodecimo.</p>

This type is mine - part of it is old, but not so old as to be thrown away, for years to come - I stated the value at 6l., but it is worth more to me; part of it is in the lines of "Tottis" Italian Grammar."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you got the bill-book used in your house? A. No. I heard of the fire at Mr. Gosnell's - I took the prisoner and several of his hands from there - he was employed upon the Rev. Daniel Wilson's letters, which were began at Mr. Gosnell's, and printed after the fire at my house; it was printed in pica, small pica, and long primer. The prisoner worked on the left-hand in the long room, which is not seperated. I went to him in Giltspur-street on the morning after he was in custody - he had said, the night before, that it was my property, and he would make some communication, but he did not. I did not say I had two more in my employ whom I had strongly suspected, but I requested the prisoner to give up his accomplices. I might have told him that I suspected he had accomplices, because I did suspect it. I did not say to his wife, "I don't believe your husband stole the property, but I believe he received it from some one;" I said I thought from the extent of the robbery he had accomplices; I was told the other evening that his wife had nothing to eat, and I called and gave her 5s.; I said if it could be proved that she had nothing to do with this, I would do what I could for her - her landlady was there, and said she was niece to a certain gentleman, and I wrote to him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How much of it was considered as Tottis' Grammer? A. Part of a page, and several lines - no other printer has printed that work for the last ten years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner entered into a long Defence, contending that there was no proof of his having committed the robbery, and stated that he had purchased it, and accusing the prosecutor of vindictive motives, as he had the prosecutor in the former case, page 87.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. DOVE. Q. Did you call at my apartment, and see my wife? A. Yes - you asked me to call and administer all the comfort I could to your disconsolate partner; when I called at Giltspur-street, before I entered your name on the book; I called from the motive of charity and benevolence; your wife shewed me a letter from a baronet, and I wrote to him to tell him the situation she was in, and to beg him to extend his kindness to her, as I found he had relieved her before; I wrote to another gentleman, and said if he was really her uncle, this would be a good time to extend his kindness to her, and I offered to join with him - I received an answer, in which he denies being related to her.</p>

            . I recollect on Christmas-eve a quantity of small pica, about 80lbs., being brought to my premises for sale - it was in order; I examined it before the prisoner, and afterwards more leisurely; I recollect there were three or four different founts in it, in paper - I should not have known "Tottis" Grammar," but I should have known it was in Italian.

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Has the type which the prisoner brought to you been since claimed by Mr. Dove? A. Yes - that part which was in paper could be sworn to - I bought it as useful type, not as old metal.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS BARRETT. Q. When did you leave Mr. Dove? A. In September last; he was printing "Tottis' Grammar," but I do not recollect when; the prisoner could have got from the place he worked in to the other part of the premises; the types that were not in use were locked up - the others were about the premises.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. In what part of the house was "Tottis" Grammar" done? A. In different parts of the house; I think it was done when you came to the house, but the pages remained about.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is it not common for the overseer to put away the type when a work is finished, and keep it under lock and key? A. Yes, but he might be otherwise employed.</p>

I went back, and found this lead rolled up in the gutter, where I had first seen him; he had a hat on when I saw him, but I can swear it was the prisoner - he left his hat in the sepair of stairs room.</p>

I saw the prisoner in his own room; I sat down, and he asked me how much I wanted - I told him three score; he said his wife was gone to see his mother; he put on his hat, then put his hand to his pocket and said he had not got enough, and I gave him two half-crowns and 3s.; he then left me in the room with the child, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; he then put down this paper parcel on the table and said, "Put that in your pocket - it is all right;" I gave him the rest of the money in shillings, and took the parcel; Patterson was outside at this time, and saw me go in; if he staid where I left him he could see the prisoner go out; when I came out I saw Patterson there; I took the paper to Limbrick without opening it, about ten o'clock, at his own house, Church-row, Pancras - it contained three score of bad shillings, which I mark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120056"/>ed and gave to him - I appointed to see the prisoner again and he was taken up. I have been in trouble myself on a charge of felony, and was sent for three months to the House of Correction; it was for stealing a piece of pork. but it was not true, and there is not a man in the part of the metropolis where I live, that can have a better character than I can.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You give yourself a good character? A. Yes; I have got my living by hard work; I was a watchman but was dismissed at my own request - I swear that; it may be ten or twelve months ago - I was a watchman in June last, and was dismissed through a false attestation - somebody said something about me; I had been a watchman three years and eight months before that, and had once been dismissed at my own request; I was not on duty when I was charged with taking the pork - I had left home to go to market with my wife. Mr. Careless, the butcher, in Clare-market, was the person from whom I was said to have stolen it. I had a little dealing with Sam for things. I call it honest dealing. I told the gentleman at the office that I had always lived by honest means; before I was discharged from being a watchman I was taken up for ill-treating my wife and leaving her to the parish - it was about three years ago - I was discharged for that. When I went to the prisoner's room, on the 19th of December, I saw nobody but him and three children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. You have been asked if you had not dealings with Sam - was it not for the purpose of giving information to the officer. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you state at the office that Patterson was outside the door? A. I believe I did, but I will not swear that - I cannot say whether I said I found him when I came out. I have not been examined since. I have talked the matter over with Limbrick, Edwards, and Lee, but I have not seen them more than twice to my knowledge. I attended with them before the Grand Jury - Patterson was there to state all he knew; I answered all the questions that were put - Patterson was introduced to me by Limbrick.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. Connell was employed by me, as he has stated. He came to me on the 19th of December, about five o'clock, at the Bell public-house; I searched him, and gave him two half-crowns and eleven shillings; he came to me the same evening, about ten o'clock, at my own house, and gave me this paper, containing three score of bad shillings, which he marked, and gave to me in the presence of Patterson. The prisoner was apprehended on the 22d of December by Edwards and Lee, in my presence - he made a call and somebody answered him out of a window; I went up to the room which the voice came from, where I saw Connell and the prisoner's wife; I brought them down, and put them into a coach - they were taken to the office. I asked the prisoner how long he had known Connell - he said"About five or six weeks" - I do not remember his saying any thing more. Edwards searched the prisoner and I searched Connell, and took from him two half-crowns and four shillings marked, and four shillings not marked. The marked money was what I had furnished him with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On the 19th of December, you say, you saw Connell and Patterson, about five o'clock in the evening? A. Yes, and again about ten o'clock. I had not seen them in the interval, and do not know where they had been. I have seen Connell three or four times since we went before the Grand Jury, but did not talk about this to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Connell on the 22d of December - I had not seen him before; he was searched, and two half-crowns and some shillings were given him. I assisted in apprehending the prisoner in Goulston-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the house in Goulston-street? A. No; Limbrick went in but I did not. I have seen Connell since at Hick's Hall, and here two or three times, but I have had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing when he was taken? A. I believe he asked in the coach what he was taken for, and, I believe, Limbrick said for selling shams; he asked what Connell was there for, but I believe no answer was made to him; he was asked if he knew Connell, and said he had known him for five or six weeks, and had drank a pot of beer with him, or something of that kind.</p>

            . I live in Bill's-buildings, Somer's-town, and am a shoemaker. I saw Connell with Limbrick on the 18th of December, and again on the 19th, at the Bell, Battle-bridge, about half-past five o'clock - Connell was then searched, and two half-crowns and eleven shillings given to him - he went away alone, and I followed him about four or five yards off - he went into No. 17, Goulston-street, and when he had been there a short time I saw the prisoner come out - he went a short distance and returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and went into the house again; I saw Connell come out and go to Limbrick's house; I followed him about five or six yards off - I saw him searched at Limbrick's - three papers of money were taken from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You followed him there and back? A. Yes; it was not possible for him to have received this money from any other person in the street without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But you do not know who he received it from in the house? A. No; I can not tell what I am to have for this job - I expect what they please to give me. I am an apprentice to Mr. Clulow - he knows of my having taken to this new line. I became acquainted with Limbrick since I have been with Mr. Clulow, about eight or nine months since, when I went up to Hatton Garden, about two women who stole shoes from our place. I was never charged myself; it was at Mr. Limbrick's house that I saw him; it took me about three quarters of an hour to go from the Bell, at Battle-bridge, to Whitechapel, on the 19th of December, and about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120057"/>hours to go out the straight road - I was four or five hours gone altogether - I believe it was about ten o'clock when I got back; we did not go any where else - there was no light in Goulston-street. I saw the prisoner come past me - I had seen him on the day before.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. What time did you follow Connell to Goulston-street? A. About six o'clock. I do not know what distance it is; we went down Sun-street, Bishopsgate; when Connell came out I went to Mr. Limbrick's house, St. Pancras, which is further than the Bell.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Clement Danes. I have known Connell six or seven months. I apprehended him in June last; he was at that time a supernumerary watchman - I think his beat was in Clare-street - it was Mr. Careless, of Clare-street, who prosecuted him for taking the meat. I would not believe him on his oath - he was discharged from being a watchman, on account of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. What have you known of him to make you use so bold an assertion? A. I have heard a bad account of him. I did not tell the gentlemen of our parish, what sort of a character they had for a watchman.</p>

On the evening of the 12th of January, I saw the prisoner on Tower-hill, about seven o'clock, carrying a basket under his arm; I asked what he was carrying - he said, "A few bits of wood" - I said I doubted he had something more; he then said, a little lead, from where he worked for his own use, which he was going to take to his sister's, in Goodman's-yard; he said he worked for Mr. Davis, in Joiner-street. I asked him if his master knew it - he said yes, he had paid him for 4lbs. on the Saturday night, when he took his wages; I said I thought there was more; he said he thought it was no harm to take a little more (as he worked amongst it,) than the neat weight; there was just 9lbs.</p>

I was passing this window, and saw some bits of beef, which I thought would be better to buy for my children than tea, and next day I went in the shop and asked if she had any bits of beef - she said Yes; she then saw the mutton, and then said, "You have got meat enough, what do you want with more." I told her what I have told you now - she said, "This is our meat," and her daughter said, "Yes, it is."</p>

My first wife used me so ill - she ran away from me - I met her one day, and she said she would have no more to do with me; so with that I was away from her a while, and happened to take up with this other young woman, thinking the other would not live with me. I was taken up soon afterwards, and my first wife said she would live with me again, and we went home - she then treated me ill, and took me up - then we made it up again, but she broke out, and got tipsy; she came home, and ran away with my things about a month before Christmas.</p>

On Monday last, the 9th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going down Whitechapel, and met the prisoner Peachey - I asked her the way to Houndsditch; I was as sober and sensible as I am now - she said, "You are not in Houndsditch, but in Whitechapel." She persuaded me to go along with her, and I went to a house in <placeName id="t18260112-166-crimeloc933">Wentworth-street</placeName>

Peachey then asked me if I would go with her - I told her no - she then called in Chester, and asked if I would go with her, which I refused. Chester then went to the door, and Peachey blew the candle out; she caught me in her arms, and pulled me over towards the bed; I resisted, and she jumped away from me in a moment; I turned round, and my two parcels were gone- one containing six yards of silk, and the other six table-covers; I called out Murder! I came down the court, and there were some persons in the street, who seemed to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120061"/>laugh and make fun. The parcels were on the floor when Chester left the room, and when Peachey left they were gone. I went next day to a public-house next door to where this happened, and said I would give 2l. 10s. if any body would fetch me my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you quite sure you are sober now? A. Yes - I have had three drams this morning. I was sober when I went to the house, but the girl over-persuaded me. I might be in the room ten minutes. I am married. I did not see Peachey again till after she was in custody.</p>

The prisoner has been upwards of two years in our employ; we purchase goods of manufacturers: there is a book kept for the purpose of entering goods bought for ready money. The shopman's duty is to enter the master's name, and each article purchased, and take the book to the cashier, at the desk, and receive the money for them, to pay the person who sold the goods, and to put the invoice on a file kept for that purpose. In consequence of some circumstances I sent for the prisoner on the 3d of January; I had the book, in which those entries are made; I directed his attention to this item, "22d of November, T. Jones, goods, as per bill, 10l. 4s.;" but here is no entry of the particular goods. I made him no threat or promise, but asked him what the goods were; he said they were wire ribbons; I asked him for the invoice - he said it was upon the file; I sent for the file, which was brought by the clerk - I desired him to look it over himself, which he did, but could not find the invoice; I then desired the clerk to look - he could not find it; the prisoner then said that sometimes he put the bills in his pocket, and he had burned one bill which he found in his pocket, thinking it was of no use; I asked where T. Jones lived - he said in Montague-street - I called one of the shopmen, to send to Jones, but before he left the house I said, "Penn, do you mean to say that you have not taken this money, and applied it to your own purposes?" he hesitated, and afterwards said he had - when he purchased goods he should put them away in the stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Could you at all have ascertained how the money had been appropriated if this young man had not told you? A. No - I had not promised him any favour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not deny all recollection of this when you was first questioned? A.

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. I know the lumber room - I had seen the trunks all safe on the 29th of December, when I went to take a shirt out; the articles stolen were all in one trunk. I did not hear any noise in the night - the house was fastened by Stephen. It was not I who alarmed my mistress.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN DOCKERTY. I live with Mrs. Laver. I sleep in the kitchen - this lumber room is on the first floor. I fastened up the front door of the house about eight o'clock - I was the last who went to bed, and know the house was all fastened; I locked the coach-house door, and one door of the stable, but the stable door next the yard was not locked - there was a ladder stood by the side of the wall, and a door leads from the stable to this lumber room; there was no part of the house broken, and we do not know how they came in. I lost a pair of braces, a handkerchief, a coat, a waistcoat, a pair of small clothes, and eight farthings. I have seen the prisoner Shaw before, but have not spoken to him - I had seen him that week, standing before my mistress's house, but cannot say on what day. I have seen my braces and handkerchief since.</p>

I was passing the house on the morning of the 1st of January, about half-past three o'clock; I saw the coach-house door open - I went in and knocked, and asked who was there - there was no answer. I then went to the door of the house - Stephen, the servant came to me; I asked him if he had shut the coach-house door over night - he said Yes, and bolted it too. I told him to get a light, which he did; we went to the stable, and found a chest, which he said had come from the lumber room - we went up the step ladder, and found his box empty; we then went out, and found the back door leading to the stable open - we went into the wash-house, and found some hampers, which had empty bottles and straw in them, moved. I went out, and sprang my rattle, and two Bow-street officers came to my assistance; we went into the premises again, and then to Shaw's house, which is about two hundred yards off - we got there about four o'clock - we stood under the window about two minutes, saw a light in the up stairs room, and heard a whispering - we called to them to open the door, and soon afterwards broke it open- the two officers went up stairs; I stopped below for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, when the two prisoners were brought down, handcuffed, with this bundle of things - I have known Pratt above twenty years, but I did not know which house he lived at.</p>

We found a quantity of linen strewed on the floor - we sent for Mrs. Layer's servant, who identified it. We then went down, and found some more linen in the lower room.

            . I am an officer. In consequence of what Price told me, I went in at one end of the street, and my partner at the other; I met them coming down with Henley in custody; we then saw another man, whom I took into custody, but I let him go when we saw Wright come out of the window; I took Wright, and found on him a dark lantern, a phosphorus box, and two knives; the silk was found in the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when Wright came out of the window? A. On the opposite side of the way.</p>

I had half a pint of beer there and was coming away - the landlord said it was a quarter past ten o'clock; I then went out and proceeded straight across the road into the foot-path; I had wheeled my barrow about 200 yards on the foot-path, and saw no one on the road till a person came behind and pushed me down; he stepped out of the road and held me down with one hand, drawing my watch out with the other. I had no help in me, and my falling turned my barrow a little aside; as soon as I got up I saw the person running at a good distance; the moon shone; I went back directly to the Eight Bells; I could not tell exactly who it was, but I described his height, and said he had a brown coat on; some person in the tap-room said they thought they knew who it was; we went to see if we could find any footsteps; I had left my barrow there, and we saw two foot-steps just before one another, close to where I had been held down - it was soft ground, and the mark of the two feet were very distinct, and the impression of the tips and nails of the shoes. I went home and went to bed, and was called up again. The prisoner is the same sized man, and had the same coloured coat on - I believed he was the man, and I believe so now. When he took my watch he ran towards his own house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was before him the same night, and he said he did not think it was me, and he could not swear to me. Witness. No; I said I would not swear to him, but I thought he was the man.</p>

            . I was watchman. I was sent for to the Eight Bells; I said I had seen the prisoner come from the lower part of the town to his own house - it was past ten o'clock, but not half-past; he would have to pass the Eight Bells in his way home from where I saw him; the landlord, and some other persons there, suspected him, and I went to his father's house, in about three hours, and found him in bed - I found a pair of shoes, which he acknowledged were his, and he was going to put them on - they were old shoes, and had been lately mended - they had heel tips and nails in them. I got a light and fitted the shoes to the marks - they fitted exactly in nails and tips, and size. I do believe that the impressions there made had been made by these shoes - the barrow had been taken away before I got there.</p>

            . I am a beadle, and have nine duplicates which were handed to me by the prosecutor - one relates to the table cloth. I have made application to her husband, who is a very respectable man, and he will have nothing to do with it; I asked the prisoner how she came to pawn these things, she said she did it on account of her husband being bad in bed. I took the prosecutrix to the pawnbroker's, and she swore to all the things.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH STOKES. On the 14th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was going from Fenchurch-street to Whitechapel - I had some grocery in one hand, and a small basket, in which was a purse, containing three sovereigns and some silver - there was a stoppage of carriages at the corner of the <placeName id="t18260112-179-crimeloc1002">Minories</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18260112-179-crimeloc1002" type="placeName" value="Minories"/>

            . I was at the place when there was a stoppage - the prosecutrix had a basket in her hand, and a paper parcel. I saw the prisoner's hand in her basket; I took hold of his coat before he took it out - I did not see him take the purse out - I did not see any other boy.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutrix stopping to get across; she had got a small basket, with two covers to it; she had got hold of the lad's hand so tight that he could not get it out - she had a parcel, which slipped, and she took her hand to save it; she then kept his hand down again. I saw a little boy stoop, and then run away; I did not see any thing go out of the basket to the ground, nor the boy's hand go down from the basket - his hand was held down quite tight - I did not see any thing in it.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH STOKES re-examined. Q. Did you see the other boy run away? A. Yes. I looked into my basket as soon as I got over to the watch-house; I took hold of the prisoner's hand while it was in my basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were some carriages passing, and I could not get by; as I was passing this lady she took hold of my hand, and said it was in her basket, but I had not had it there, nor had I seen the purse.</p>
