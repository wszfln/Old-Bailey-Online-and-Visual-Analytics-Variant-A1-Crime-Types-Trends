                  </hi>. I am a silversmith and jeweller, carrying on business in Bishopsgate-street Within—I am the chairman of the British Mutual Investment Loan and Discount Company, the offices of which are at 17 and 18, New Bridge street Blackfriars—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a proposal by the prisoner for a loan of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think I saw the prisoner upon that proposal; it was received at the office, I think, about the 23d April—if I may be allowed to refer to a paper containing some of the particulars from our books, I can tell (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>); yes, the 23d April was the time of the application—here is a letter dated 27th April, 1863—that letter formed part of the proposal; it could not have come with the proposal, because this is dated the 27th, and the proposal was made on the 23d—the proposal was eventually accepted by the Board—I am not sure when that was; it was within a short time afterwards—upon that, a cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was signed; but it was not paid over until after the securities had been approved by the office—that was after the declaration now produced had been made by the prisoner—I think the cheque was paid over about 20th May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—I did not know the prisoner before April last; he introduced himself to me as a gentleman belonging to the Dragoons,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186312140004"/>
               <p>or lately belonging to the Dragoons, and he also stated that he knew some members of my family in India—he mentioned the names of several persons whom I knew—he stated that he was desirous of getting rid of some liabilities that he was under, and that he should like to raise a sum of money upon some reversionary property for that purpose.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">objected to the reception of anything which took place between the defendant and the witness, who was then acting as his solicitor, as any such matter would be privileged.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Verbally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Verbally—I wrote these portions of the proposal which are in my writing, at my own office, all at the same time—I think I had had one or two interviews with the prisoner before that, and it was during those interviews I made inquiries of him—his handwriting does not appear at all upon this; this was written while he was with me—I took down the nature of the security from the statement he made while there; it was written while he was in the room—(<hi rend="italic">The proposal was for a loan of 300 l., and the security proffered was a fourth share of the sum of 3,000 l. in the Three-and-a-Half per Cents., to which the defendant stated he was entitled at the death of his mother, under the will of his uncle, Mr. Parnham, late of Croydon</hi>)—This letter, dated 27th April, is signed by me—I was acquainted with its contents before it went—I have no doubt I wrote that letter from communi<lb/>cations with the defendant—some of these letters are private letters—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this letter being read, as it was not the document in respect of which it was alleged that the defendant made the false declaration; but was the result of a communication by the defendant to the witness as his solicitor. The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that it was admissible upon the ground already stated.)—Letter read</hi>: "To Cobbold and Patteson, 17 and 18, New Bridge-street; 27th April, 1863; 2, Adelphi-terrace. Gentlemen,—I send you the office copy Will. My client is most anxious to avoid a notice being given to his uncle, the surviving trustee of the fund, because it might affect his future prospects; he proposes instead to make a statutory declaration that he has never assigned or encumbered it in any way affecting the same, and I feel certain this will be as operative as any notice; and from what I know of his character, every reliance may be placed upon his honour and integrity. I will get the other information required, and also the certificate of age of his mother. I forgot to mention that the policy of insurance for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is also to form part of the proposed security")—The money was brought to me from the office by some gentleman—I paid it over to the</p>

               <p>prisoner, deducting some charges for my costs—that was after the declaration had been made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that you did not know the prisoner until April, and you seem to have known nothing of him but what he himself told you, and yet you wrote to the office stating that from what you knew of him they might perfectly rely upon his honour and integrity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had made inquiries in the mean time, and found he was a gentleman who had been in India; that he was known to some of my sons, also in the army, and from their statement, and from inquiry I had made of his brother officers, I found he was a man of good repute; therefore I had a right to presume he was an honourable man—I had seen persons who spoke very highly of him, and they pointed out to me some despatch that had been sent during the Indian Campaign recommending him to the notice of the Government for his dis<lb/>tinguished services out there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you bay he had served in India with your own son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had—I did not hear that son speak of him; but I have another son who was in the army, and he knew him, and spoke very highly of him, and he was with him at Aldershot at the time he was there with his regiment—I think all those things justified me in looking upon him as a man of respectability—I know he had four or five medals—I learnt from him that he was also entitled to other property—that was a remote con<lb/>tingency, and that was the reason I selected this one in preference to the other—I can't say the amount of the other property, because I did not go into it or trouble myself to ascertain what the value of it was—I heard that, irrespective of these two properties, he was entitled under another will to a considerable property, but I did not know it for a fact—I ascertained from him that he was entitled to a considerable portion of prize-money which had not been paid over to him, and I believe that was so—from the circumstances that had been stated to me, I formed the highest opinion of him, both as a man of honour and a brave officer, and I consider I was justified in stating what I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a painter of 7, Swan-street, Dover-road, Borough—I was present at the parish-church of St. Margaret's, Ipswich, on 10th March, 1842, when my sister, Ellen Pearman, was married to the prisoner—I gave her away and signed the book as a witness—they lived together as man and wife for sixteen years—they separated six or seven years ago—I continued to see my sister more or less from time to time—I was present at St. Stephen's, Westminster, when the prisoner was married to Jane Symons, on 6th March, 1859—I gave that bride away also—I knew that my sister was alive at the time—I signed the book as a witness to that marriage—Jane Symons knew at the time that the former wife was alive—the prisoner had at various times spoken to her about it in my presence—he has said that he was married before, and that his wife was living—he had been living with Symons for about a twelvemonth previous to the marriage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you are the only person who complains, the second wife does not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't complain at all—I prosecuted through ignorance; had I been aware of what was going to take place I should not have prosecuted at all—I am sure the prisoner knew that his first wife was alive—it was about the year 1855 that he and his first wife separated—they came to my place soon after they had separated—I have never seen them together since—I saw my sister after the second marriage at intervening times—I did not tell her about it—I don't know why—I did not think it worth while—there were four children by the first marriage, two boys and two girls I never persuaded Symons to marry the prisoner; I am quite sure of that; I persuaded them both against it—I don't know why he parted from his first wife—there was a written paper of separation—I don't know where it is—at the time I gave the second wife away, I was not aware that I was doing either right or wrong; I did not give it a consideration—the first time I told my sister about the prisoner's being married to Symons was when he was taken to the police-court—I did not tell her—she heard of it from another party—I gave the prisoner into custody; perhaps it might have been from ignorance on my part—I had not had any quarrel with him.</p>

               <p>Brighton-terrace, but my husband persuaded me to sell the home, and I have done so—I have lived with him since our marriage, in March, 1859—I took care of his children—I thought his wife had just left him with three children, and he said if I would protect those children he would protect me as long as he lived, and I have done so—I have the youngest child with me—twelve-months passed away, and James Harding and his wife, my husband's sister, persuaded us to be married, and we were—I knew his first wife was alive, but she had left him, and the solicitor has a document that was brought to me—the prisoner has been a good husband to me, and a good father to the children.</p>

I am fourteen years of age, and am the daughter of of the prosecutrix and the prisoner—I remember the evening my mother came home when this quarrel took place—my father came home at 8 o'clock on Saturday night, and stopped in a little while, but went out again—he came in at 11 o'clock, and put a chair against the door, and said my mother should not come in, and he put a knife on the table—when my mother knocked at the door, he told me to open the door, and when she came in, he punched her—she tried to halloa out," Murder!" but my father would not let her, and he stuck her with the knife, held her up against the wall and stuck her with the knife, and then he punched her again after he stuck her with the knife, and she ran down stairs—I went for the police—my father put the knife on the table when he came home the second time; he took it out of the cupboard—he did not use it for any purpose; he took it out of the cupboard and placed it on the table—he said he would stick it into my mother when she came in—he said that to me—they had a few words together first when she came in.</p>

I am surgeon at the University College Hospital—on 29th November, about 1 o'clock in the morning, the prosecutrix was brought into the hospital—she had a cut on the right side of the head, about an inch and a half in length, extending down to the bone—I think such a wound could not have been inflicted by falling on a knife; I think it was such a wound that it would have taken a hand to have thrust the knife—it was a cross cut—it was such a wound as would be inflicted by a knife—I should think the woman had had something to drink, but she was faint from loss of blood.</p>

               <p>Wellclose-square, Whitechapel, about 10 o'clock I saw the deceased, Thomas Bunn, there with his wife—I was near the end of the hall, and he was next to me—I arrived when he was in the act of leaving the hall, and the waiter was offering him some refreshment; he would have to pass by the front of the stage to go out—the prisoner was then on the stage singing a sentimental song; he had been singing a comic song previously; it was the second en<lb/>core, I think—when the deceased arrived at the corner of the stage he up<lb/>lifted his hand and said to the prisoner, "Shut up"—he then moved on till he arrived in the centre of the stage, facing the prisoner, and again said, "Shut up, we have had enough of that"—the prisoner had an old felt hat in his hand, with which he had been singing, and he threw it; it struck the deceased at the side of the head—thereupon the deceased turned round and made an observation; I did not hear it, on account of the confusion from the singer throwing his hat; a number of people rose at the time—the observa<lb/>tion was directed to the prisoner—upon that the prisoner jumped from the stage and struck the deceased twice about the neck and shoulders—I could not exactly tell which, I could not see the exact position.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 48, Manser-street, Whitechapel—on the night of 25th November, shortly after 11 at night, I was called to see the deceased at his own room in St. Mark's-street—he was then dead—I should suppose he had been dead about half an hour—I made a slight examination at that time—there were no external marks of violence on him, with the exception of a little puffiness at the back of the head—I did not observe any bruise—it was such a puffiness as might have arisen from a blow—on the Friday morning I made a post-mortem examination—on removing the scalp, there was a large patch of extravasated blood at the back of the head on the right side, behind the left ear, and a similar one on the left side, also at the back of the head; on opening into, the skull, a large quantity of blood escaped—the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the brain; that was the result of violence, either a blow or blows, or a fall or falls, at the back part of the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Probably you have not had reference to the size of the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was rather over the ordinary size; he was what is called a North Sea pilot, I am told—death could not have been the result of apoplexy in this individual instance—the internal appearances corresponded with the external—assuming that I had heard nothing of these facts, and that he had received violent blows a few hours previously, so as to cause blood to ooze from his ears, the post-mortem appearances would not have been entirely consistent with that state of things, but nearly so—I made the post-mortem examination some time after death, and hemorrhage must have been taking place during all that time—had I found this extravasation of blood, and no blows received at a later period than three or four hours pre<lb/>viously, I must have ascribed it to that—I find but little variation in the appearances from death by extravasation; there may be some—in this case there was blood around the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata</hi>, the commencement of the spinal column—immediately on the suspension of that, life would cease, because that is perhaps the most vital part of the human frame—if effusion commenced between 6 and 7 o'clock, it would depend upon where it com<lb/>menced, whether it produced increased pressure on the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata—</hi> it would do so if the effusion was on the base of the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi>—imme<lb/>diately there is the slightest pressure on the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata</hi> insensibility would ensue, and death almost directly after—there was nothing in my examination to indicate that the pressure of blood on the spine might not</p>

               <p>have commenced some hours after the blow which produced it, and gradually gone on to the moment of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking merely at the appearances on the post-mortem examination, you attribute the death to the blood flowing into the skull, and on to the spinal cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that might be a slight oozing origin<lb/>ally, continuing for some time—the moment it came on to the spinal cord, it would produce insensibility—I believe there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the blood oozed gradually or came suddenly—there was nothing to indicate whether the blood had been coring into the skull for some time before it reached the spinal cord, and there was nothing to indicate that it came there suddenly—as far as that goes, it might be possible that the violence which produced the extravasation was some time before the death, that is presuming I am to know nothing about the evidence.</p>

               <p>MONTAGUE SANDERS. I live in Stratford—I was near Mr. Brown's on the evening of 10th December, and saw the prisoner and two or three more boys looking in at the window—they all walked off, and I saw a box in one of their hands—I told Mr. Brown; he came out, and we ran after them—I heard the box drop—the prisoner was then running across the road—I ran after him, and saw a man atop him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a machinist, and live at Enfield lock—on 2d No<lb/>vember, I was at the Green Man beer shop about 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and three others sitting on the left-hand side of the taproom door I heard something drop under where the prisoner sat—Cooper, a policeman, called for a light, and examined the prisoner's seat, under which he picked up this pistol and gimlet—he was then charged with committing a burglary, at the Rev. Mr. Blake's, with three others—they all said they knew nothing about it—a rush was made to the door, and the prisoner and two others escaped—one was taken in custody—it was just before the rush that I heard these things drop.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you say that I rushed to the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; with a quart pot in your hand—you did not keep your seat when the others rushed to the door—you were the second man that rushed to the door, the tall man was the first—I stood close by the constable—there was a table on each side, and I stood between them—one table was behind me—I had my face towards you—you were sitting on the corner of the table behind the door—I saw the constable pick up the pistol; I stood close by him—I saw it in his hand the moment he picked it up—I saw him stoop down and bring it up in his hand from just under where you sat—there was about four feet between the two tables—the room is perhaps ten feet wide—there is a form right round it—the tables are not three feet wide—one may be two feet six, and the other less—the policeman did not crawl under the table, he reached between the table and the form.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer living near Chingford—I was at the Green Man on 2d November about 7 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and three others sitting there—Cooper and Kirby, the constables, came in, and said they should apprehend them for a burglary at the Rev. Mr. Blake's—Kirby spoke to a tall man named Butcher, and the prisoner got up and wanted to go out—Cooper said, "No, you shall not go out of here, give me the stick"—he said, "No; if you can take it from me you may"—I then heard some<lb/>thing drop down against the prisoner's feet, and saw Cooper pick it up—he said, "Look out, here is a pistol"—he also picked up a candle—the prisoner was standing on the left side of the door.</p>

On 2d December, about five minutes to 9, I went to the Green Man at Chingford—I saw Ashton—I went into the taproom—I saw the prisoner in company with three others—I heard Kirby tell them he should apprehend the four of them for a burglary at the Rev. Mr. Blake's—they said they knew nothing about it—he said, "I shall take you"—in a minute or two I heard something drop—I looked on the ground and picked up a candle wrapped up in paper—I asked for a candle, which was given to me, looked under the seat, picked up a pistol, and a gimlet between the prisoner's legs—they made a rush to the door, and the prisoner and two others escaped—one was apprehended—I picked up a dark lantern and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> None of the people could identify me. I was there two weeks before, and they said nothing. The policeman was not there when I was taken, but he came on 21st and gave evidence that was quite contrary to what they gave on 8th. They contradicted one another in everything they said. I never had the pistol in my possession—none of the witnesses say that they saw it in my possession, or saw me drop it. A candle on a table is not like gas which illuminates a room all over.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 122). On Wednesday, 18th November, about 7 o'clock, I was on duty in South street, Greenwich, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner Seymour wheelings barrow—I followed him—he drew it round to the second marine store-dealer's shop—I went up to him, and asked where he had brought that from, pointing to the lead—he said a man had given it to him to wheel, I think he said from Greenwich Church—I asked him who the man was—he said he was a strange man; he had never seen him before—I said, "Is there any name on the barrow?"—he said, "Look"—I took him into custody, and I asked the marine store-dealer to place on the barrow again the piece of lead which had just been removed, which was done—on the way to the station, Seymour made a rush, and got away about ten yards—as I pursued him he took hold of a little boy, and threw him against me—I ran round the boy, and he fell—I then pursued the prisoner, and overtook him—I asked him at the station if he had any account to give of the lead—and he said, "None whatever"—I apprehended Standing on the night of 20th at his own house—I told him I had come to take him in charge for being concerned with another man in custody for having a quantity of lead—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "But you hired the truck of a man of the name of Swan the same evening"—he said, "Yes, I did, and if the truck had been lost I must have paid for it"—he also said, "You saw me the same night against the marine store-dealer's shop, and I spoke to you"—I said, "Yes, I saw you pass by when I was speaking to Seymour"—I then took him to the station, and he was charged with being concerned with Seymour, who was then in custody—I am quite sure that he is the man—I know them both—I have known Standing very well for years—I did see him pass by as I was speaking to Seymour, at 7 o'clock, when Seymour was setting on the string of the barrow by the marine store-dealer's shop—I did not see standing in possession of the barrow—I have seen the lead, and weighed it—the weight is one hundredweight and a quarter—I have compared it with the place where it is supposed to have come from, and it fits in length and width and every respect—to the best of my knowledge it is the piece that came off there—there was also on the lead, when I took it off the barrow, some fine coals which were wet at that time, but which have since dried and fallen off.</p>

On 3d December, about 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoners at Bushy-green—Newing left Clark, and went down a little lane at the corner of the heath; he returned to Clark, and they entered into conversation, separated again, and Newing went in one direction and Clark in the other—Newing went and lounged on the palings where two sacks were hanging, and in about a minute and a half he took one sack off—Clark was then standing by an elm-tree about twenty yards off, apparently watching him—Newing held the sack up and gave it to Clark, who held it until I took him—I took him to the station, left him there, and pursued, Newing about half a mile, took him to the station, and charged them both with stealing the sack—they denied all knowledge of each other—the prosecutor's name is on the sack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Newing's Defence.</hi> I met Clark in Lewisham. We saw the sack lying in the roadway; I picked it up, and said, "Here is a sack! I expect it belongs to some waggon, as the wind is very high; I do not want it." He said, "Give it to me." I did so, and left him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clark's Defence.</hi> This man picked up the sack and gave it to me; he said he thought it had blown off a cart I said, "We shall find an owner for it," and the policeman took us. I have three good characters from places where I have worked. I told the policeman to go after them, but he would not; if they had been bad characters, I dare say he would have gone.</p>
