In January, 1839, I took the defendant Munn into my employment—I had been in a very delicate state of health for some years previous to that—I agreed with Munn, that if he came to manage my business, I would give him for his services equal to one-third of the net profits for the first two years, and after that equal to the halfhe came into my employ on those terms—Rouse was also in my employ, as carman, for three or four years, at least a considerable time before Munn came into my employment—he left me in May, 1841, after Munn left, and went to live with Munn—Barton was also my servant—lie was a carman, and made himself generally useful in the corn business—he is Munn's wife's brother—after I had taken Munn into my employ I left the whole of the shop business to him—I left No. 96, Connaught<lb/>terrace for him to live in—prior to his coming into my employ he bor<lb/>rowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—he managed my books, and had possession of them—I attended the markets principally, on the Corn Exchange and the Hay<lb/>market, and paid bills, and so on—I always paid, at least generally paid—in 1840 I entered into a treaty to dispose of my business in Connaught<lb/>terrace, but did not meet with a purchaser—a proposal was made to me by Munn about the premises No. 11, Stanhope-terrace—he had seen those premises, and was very desirous, if possible, of having them, and after some consultation, I agreed, if it was possible, to purchase them for him, and he should go into business for himself, and I would assist him after some negociation with Mr. Webb, the mortgagee in possession, it was ultimately agreed that I should give him 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for these premises, and when the deed was executed, and possession given to me, I immediately gave possession to Munn, the same day, the 21st of April, 1841—I said, in conversation with Munn, "Mind, if I purchase these premises for yon, and you go into business for yourself, I will have nothing to do with it; what rent can you afford?"—he said, "Will you fit up the shop for me, Sir?"—I said, "No, if you have possession, take a lease for it"—he said "Well, if you will purchase the place for me, and grant me a lease, I will give you 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for it"—I said, "Very well, Munn, I won't stand for a hundred or two, if it is possible to get the premises for you"—I should say Stanhope-terrace is half a mile from Connaught-terrace—there was no other corn-dealer in the neighbourhood but myself—there was a good opportunity for establishing another business there—nothing had come near it—there are a great many wealthy houses in the neighbour<lb/>hood—after Munn had commenced the alterations, he said one evening, "I shall not be able to do much business the first quarter, Sir, will you be satisfied with the ground-rent?" and I said the first quarter he should have it for the ground-rent, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., after which it was to be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, according to our agreement—he said, "Very well"—he went into posses<lb/>sion, made the alterations, and set up in business—he never came to ac<lb/>count with me about the business he managed at No. 96, Connaught<lb/>terrace—I frequently pressed him for an account after he left me, a dozen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040007"/>
               <p>times, or more—I requested him to come even as late as the 17th of last November—I met him, and said, "Munn, I have been expecting you to come and settle your accounts"—he said, "I have been so busy I have had no time"—I have sent messages by his own daughter to him—I borrowed 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Fraser, my attorney, to complete the purchase for Munn—I told Mr. Fraser to apply for the rent the November following, and after<lb/>wards, finding no rent was paid, I directed an action to be brought, which came on for trial on the 15th of January, this year—on the 14th, the day before that trial, I heard of proceedings in the Court of Chancery, and was served with a subpoena in the Chancery proceedings—I heard that they were going to move for an injunction to stay me from proceeding at law—in the course of January, I believe, I got an order for the production of this agreement—I attended, and saw it produced—the first time I saw it was on the 25th of January, 1842, in the hands of a Mr. Warren, Munn's attorney, at No. 161, London-road—I afterwards saw the affidavits in Chancery, in which Rouse stated he was present when I signed this agree<lb/>ment, and Barton also—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the agreement</hi>)—this "James Timewell" is not my handwriting—I never signed this, nor any other written agree<lb/>ment, for Munn, in my life, under any circumstances whatever, during the time he was in my employ, or since he has left it—the only thing I signed for him was a bill of exchange for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Which I lent him—it is false that Rouse put his name to that after I signed it—I know nothing of this agreement at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it false that you read it aloud in the presence of Rouse and Barton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never read it in my life—I believe the body of the instrument to be in Munn's handwriting—I was never in partner<lb/>ship with Munn—Barton states in his affidavit that he saw the paper through the desk—my desk is of that description that it would not be pos<lb/>sible for him to see through it—this is my handwriting to the assignment of the lease.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you write your name in this manner, "James Timewell?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not always—I do not generally do so, I generally write it with the top of the T over—I always write "James Timewell"—there is no misunder-standing at all about that—I always sign my name "James Timewell—I sign my two names in full.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a matter of precaution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always?—there has never been any balance struck between myself and Munn—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> all time by that—I never went through any account with him with the object of striking a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, take that paper into your hand, and be careful what you are about; on your oath, is not every word of that in your handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not, not all of it—these are my figures—I mean to swear it is not my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">This paper was called a settlement of account between the prosecutor and Munn, dated the 31st of December</hi>, 1841, <hi rend="italic">by which it ap<lb/>peared that</hi> 274<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was owing to Munn</hi>)—these figures are not my handwriting—the upper part is, but not the lower part—I drew this out to give me some idea what the business had been doing, but then it was from Munn's representations that I took this—it was taken from the books, so far as he gave me the accounts—I left him the books to keep—I demanded an account from him, and he gave me that—there was no ob<lb/>jection to my checking him by the books, if I chose—it would appear by this statement that 274<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was due to Munn in December, 1841, supposing the account he gave me was correct and according to the books—there was no difficulty in my seeing the books—I did not ask to see them—they were always accessible to me—I looked at the ledger, but did not cheek the account, or go into it; I relied fully on Munn's honesty—these figures are not mine—I never saw them before—the top figures are mine—I be<lb/>lieve this paper(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one marked</hi> A) I do not believe this is my handwriting, nor do I believe this to be mine (B), nor this (C)—I do not believe this is my writing (D), nor this (E)—Munn was always allowed to sign my name to bills—these were not written by me—I believe this is not my handwriting (F)—(<hi rend="italic">These papers were all folded, so that only the signatures were visible.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I will open this, and let you see it (E); look at that, the sig<lb/>nature which you swore you did not believe to be yours; perhaps look<lb/>ing at the letter will remind you whether it is or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, I know what it is; it is my handwriting, but it has nothing to do with the busi<lb/>ness—I did believe it was not my handwriting—I cannot say on my path that it is—I do not know that it is—I cannot swear to it, it is so unlike my usual handwriting—I do not believe the signature to be mine—I wrote the rest of the letter—I know a person named Peacock—this (C) I believe is my handwriting—I think it is—I do not believe this (A) to be my handwriting—I know a person named Baker—I have seen him here—I always write my name in full on a cheque—I do not believe this (B)is my handwriting—I believe this is (D)—there is only "J. Timewell" to these, but I meant that I write my name at full length on my cheques—I do not believe this (F) to be my handwriting—I used to sign my name at full length to a variety of documents, as well as my cheques—this is my hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper not marked</hi>)—this 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I intended as an in<lb/>vestment—I was to allow Mr. Fraser five per cent, for his 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never applied to Munn for the loan of any money—that I swear—I applied to him for money for goods—I never asked him for the loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would get the acceptance of a friend of his, named Clark, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was for goods—he had had between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Worth of goods before—there was no balance between us—it was for a different transaction that I got Clark's acceptance for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I applied to Munn for money, and he would not give me his acceptance or money—I did not ask him for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked for no sum—that I swear—I asked for money—he owed me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040009"/>
               <p>between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wanted to make up some money—he said he had none—I wanted him to let me draw on him for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said no, he would give me no acceptance, but he would get his uncle to do it—Munn was to keep the premises at Stanhope-terrace in repair—they are extensive premises—be has repaired them—I cannot positively say to what amount, perhaps to about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am not accurate—he was to have a lease of the premises for the whole unexpired term.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it you did not get your attorney, Mr. Fraser, to draw up your lease before you put Munn in possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had instructions to make the lease prior—when I borrowed the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said, "Mann is to have these premises at a certain rent, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year"—there was nothing to prevent his drawing up the agreement at the time—I ought to have had it done before I put him in possession of the property, but I had confidence in him—the first action I brought was for half a year's rent—we demanded the half year's rent, the full amount—I do not know the exact amount I got I was paid the first quarter—I got 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., instead of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe Munn is in possession of the premises in Stanhope-terrace at present—I have not the slightest doubt of it; I know he is, unless he has left—I have not seen the premises for these three or four months—I have no suspicion that be has left—I am carrying on the business in Connaught-terrace—I do not know whether he has got a good deal of custom from me—he got a good many of my old customers—I have not got them back—very likely he has got them now; I cannot say; I have not seen his accounts—I am not very cross about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It would not be at all convenient to get him out of the way, would it, by an indictment for perjury or forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it would—that is my answer—I believe he is married—he is represented so—he has four or five children I believe—they are not all young; some of them are—Munn laid out a good deal of money on the premises in Stanhope-terrace the first year—we did not get together at the end of the first year to see how matters stood—we did not at any time get together, at Stanhope-terrace, to see how the accounts stood, nor in Connaught-terrace—we never settled—there were no accounts made up between us—Munn did not show me that out of the money be bad laid out on the Stanhope-terrace premises there was but 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—there was no balancing between us whatever—there was no statement of accounts between us, at Connaught-terrace, by which it appeared that 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was the balance to be divided, nor did I agree that it was so small that I would not divide it—I never recollect it—I believe it never took place—I will swear positively it never did—that I am quite sure of—Munn never told me how much he had laid out on the premises in Stanhope-terrace, that I recollect—I made the guess of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the contract for the alterations—I do not know what he did besides the fit<lb/>tings up and the shop-front that was put in—I am not aware what he did Beyond the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did that—there might be some other repairs, I can<lb/>not tell; I did not see it after it was completed; I only saw it in progress—the shop-front is included in the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had the house papered—I do not recollect whether there was any painting—I suppose there was—there must have been painting, of course—I did not see it—I saw the shop-front painted—I believe it is a handsome shop-front.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Likely to attract old customers going by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is a good frontage—I have never calculated-how much interest I was to get for my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040010"/>
               <p>money by this bargain—I only advanced 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself, but I have the in<lb/>terest of the other to pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For your 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It comes to 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year; is not that a tolerably good bargain to get out of Munn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether any one has got such a bargain before—I never did—I think it is rather a good one—I cannot tell how much per-cent. it is—I think thirty per cent, a very good bargain—I have got fifteen per cent, in business, not in investment—I never knew any one that did—it was Munn's own offer—he offered me 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I do not know that for twenty per cent, he could have got ten times that sum—I had not bought the premises before Mann made me this offer—Munn knew I was giving 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—he agreed to give me 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and do all the repairs—I am quite sure he did not offer me more—there was*no one present at the conversation between me and Munn—he knew of my borrowing the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at five per cent.—when Munn came into my employ in Connaught-terrace, he brought a van, a pony and chaise, a new spring-cart, and his own furniture, and he bought between 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Worth of me, which he paid me for some time after<lb/>wards—the pony-chaise and van were used in the business—the cart Was not, to my knowledge—he brought nothing else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ERLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it Munn's own proposal to get these premises for the purpose of setting up in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—it was always our in<lb/>tention that the Stan hope-terrace shop should be made a place for carrying on this business for him—there was no one in the same business in the neighbourhood but himself—I had no desire to prevent any rival from coming into the neighbourhood, or to prevent him from setting up in business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the meaning of your answer when you said it would be convenient to get him out of the way by an indictment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A man that is capable of committing forgery on me, and paying no rent without an action, I think the sooner I get rid of such a tenant the better; that was what I meant—I had given every facility to set him up in business—the premises are worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year; I could get that anywhere—they reckon the frontage at two guineas a foot—that is the fair value of the premier—there is about fifty feet of frontage, but I cannot say exactly—I was ap<lb/>plied to by a Mr. Baker about my business—he wished me to give him a bond against Munn setting up in business—I refused to be bound down in that way, and that was the reason Baker went off—my verbal agreement with Munn was, that he should pay me the rent and keep the premises in repair, and the lease was to have the usual covenants—I am not aware whether the pony-chaise and cart were used by Munn in his business before he came to me—he was foreman to Mr. Ruffy before he came to me—part of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent him went in payment for this furniture—he paid me about six or eight months before he left me—he did not pay me for the furniture before he had the loan—he first had the furniture, and then paid back the loan.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did Mr. Munn find you to give evidence here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Di<lb/>rectly after, or very shortly after, Mr. Timewell and he disagreed; perhaps four months ago—I did not attend the trial at the Exchequer—Mr. Munn first spoke to me about coming to give evidence—I cannot positively say how long ago, perhaps three months, or it might be more; I did not bear it in mind particularly—I have no recollection of his asking me if I recol<lb/>lected the time when his name was put first on the estimate—he did not ask me what I was going to say—I never gave any account of ft at all to anybody.</p>

Is the full value of the premises—I do not value it by foot frontage—it is not worth two guineas a foot with the buildings now on it—it is impossible to say the value per foot—it is a fancy price—if that ground was unoccupied, perhaps now, in consequence of Park-square being finished, and the immense building going forward, some individual dis<lb/>posed to speculate, would give a guinea a foot more now than he would seven years back—I have looked at the premises what they are worth now—I estimated the value of the stack of buildings on the premises, and I value it at 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—I was called in to put a value on the pre<lb/>mises—I did not take the square of ground—I did not value the stack of buildings on the ground—in my opinion it never cost 2300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should be glad if anybody would give me 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to erect more buildings than are on the ground—I did not measure it—I went into every stable, and coach-house, and every room, and even into the coal pit, and I have it all down here—if a neighbourhood is improving, premises would be worth more as a speculation.</p>

On the morning of the 26th of June she came and took the key of my drawing-room off the bed-room table—I afterwards went to my bed-room window, and saw Howe walking up and down, opposite my house, on the other side of the way—she appeared to be watching my house—I continued at the window till I saw her come over, and come in at the street-door—I went down, and saw the drawing-room door open—I immediately wont into the kitchen, and saw the pri<lb/>soners—Howe was a stranger—I asked what she was doing in my house—Robinson said she had come to see her—I said it was very strange to come at that time in the morning—it was about a quarter past seven o'clock—she had a basket with a bottle of port-wine, two bundles of wood, and a cut of brown holland, in it—I saw the top of the bottle stick<lb/>ing out of the basket, and seeing the wax, I knew it corresponded with the seals of my wine—I matched the cut of brown holland, and it corre<lb/>sponds with a piece I had then in the drawing-room—I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday, the 19th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the afternoon, I took Daley into custody at No. 5 1/2, Flower and Dean-street—I took him to Spitalfields station, then returned to his lodging, and felt the weight of his box, which appeared to be heavy, returned to the station, and asked him for the key—he said he had not got it, somebody in the house must have it—when I left the box in the room, T left Crawley there—when I returned he was gone away with another constable, and I found the box open then—I found in it these pieces of copper, a piece of lead, and a piece of solder—I showed them to the prisoner afterwards—he said he had had them in his box for years—I asked him if he knew how much money he had got in the box—he said two 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces and two half-crowns, which I found in it.</p>

Bank-notes, No. 54,369, and No. 64,370, both dated 3rd of Feb., 1841; one of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 95,758, dated 5th of Feb., 1841; another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 95,759, dated 5th of Feb., 1841; the rest was in other notes—there were in all thirty of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., seventy of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and eleven of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold.</p>

In a year—I should think if he received 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be a large sum—he may have received that sum in a year—I have been there forty years—the Marquis had a pass-book in which entries were made from time to time of the cheques paid—he always "drew his own cheques—they were like this; except when in health, he wrote better perhaps.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Capron and Co. We were solicitors to the late Lord Hertford, and are now solicitors to his executors—his Christian names were Francis Charles—I went occasionally to Lord Hertford's house, and saw him during the last few weeks of his life—he was very unwell during the latter part of his life—I used to see him when I went in what was called the library, the front-room—he died on the 1st of March—I cannot recol<lb/>lest what day he was buried—it was about a fortnight after—the execu<lb/>tors proceeded to investigate his affairs in a room in our office—on the 4th of April, about eleven o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to my office—some of the executors, two of them certainly, were in a room which they have at our office—I believe Suisse came of his own accord—Mr. Croker and Mr. Hopkins on were the two executors there—when Suisse arrived he saw me—he said he came to ask permission of the executors to go to Paris—I went into the adjoining room where the executors were, and communicated to them what he wanted—they desired me to tell him to return in half-an-lour—I did so—he said he would go for his passport, and come back in that time—he went away from my office, and returned in about half-an-hour—in the meantime I communicated with the execu<lb/>tors, and received certain instructions from them—on his return, in conse<lb/>quence of what had passed between me and the executors, I called his attention to the sum of 9200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had received on Lord Hertford's cheques, between the 1st and 9th of February—I asked how that sum had been applied—he stated that he credited in his book what he wanted for the current expenses, and gave the rest into my Lord's hands—I have the book here—I further questioned him on the subject of this 9200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I expressed some surprise, and he then stated that the accounts which he had sent to Mr. Capron would explain how the greater part had been applied, and that Charlemagne, the cook, had received about 20002. more—I asked him how he got the money for payment of the bills—he said he went to my Lord for it, and he gave him sufficient to pay the bills—I do not recollect that he mentioned any way in which he had ap<lb/>plied any of the other money—he then renewed his application to go to Paris—I told him the executors could not permit him to go till the ac<lb/>counts were settled—he complained of the hardship of being detained, and said that his health had suffered from it already, being confined in so small a room—he was living at the time at Dorchester House—he stated then that he wished the executors would name a day when he might be permitted to go—I left him, went into the room, and detailed to the executors what had taken place—having received their instructions, I returned to him, and told him the executors could only repeat their request that he would remain till the accounts were settled—he appeared very angry, and said he had been twice nearly dead in Lord Hertford's service, and his expression was, no would not kill himself a third time for these gentlemen—he talked. of putting a pistol to his head rather than doing so—he said, that in spite of</p>

I had a piece of paper on which was an extract from the bankers' account-book—I had that piece of paper in Court this morning—I gave it to have a copy made of it—it contained the account of the cheques—he said at first that he had credited in his book what he wanted for the current expenses, and that he gave the rest into my Lord's hands—I went into the executors' room for the disbursement book, and brought it down, and then renewed the conversation—I did not point out to him that the sum which he said he had paid out of the 9,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was only 2,235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in<lb/>deed, I did not open the book till he was gone.</p>

Here is the plan which I had formed; to send by Brussels, two fine horses, with their coachman and their harness. I intend buying from you one of those Brussels carriages, the same as that in which I have seen you drive so often with all your family, a kind of covered <hi rend="italic">char-a-banc;</hi> at to my plate, far from selling it here; I am having a service made here, for which I expect to pay the duty, but I shall draw back here the duty on re<lb/>exportation, which will cover that which I shall have to pay abroad. As to the stamp, I had no idea of it as new plate, and I am ignorant whether by Calais, it would be the same thing. My first idea is that from Calais to Nancy, the distance is double that from Brussels to Nancy; if neverthe<lb/>less, the same formalities do not exist by the way of France, I will send plate by Calais; in any case, that will not prevent my passing through Brussels; that is to say, from Calais I shall go to you; that cannot is any case be before the month of June next, I shall not be ready before that time. I reckon on your kindness until then. If you can give me other information, have that kindness. Pray present my respectful duty to Madame, and dispose of him who will be all his life, with high considera<lb/>tion, your sincere and very devoted friend, <hi rend="smallCaps">SUISSE</hi>. A million of thanks to M. Felice, for the good opinion he has of me, and of the preference he gives me. I am sincerely grateful for it, but at my age, and with suffi<lb/>cient for me and mine, one must be more than mad to go into business and spoil so fine an independence. The heart and friendship of, M. Felice, entirely devoted servant for life, <hi rend="smallCaps">SUISSE</hi>." To N. Proft, Hotel Belle Vue, Brussels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary. I was in the habit of attending the late Marquis of Hertford professionally for a con<lb/>siderable time—in January last he was very ill with <hi rend="italic">bronchitis,</hi> from which he in a great measure recovered, but he was taken ill again about the middle of February, with the same attack, chronic <hi rend="italic">bronchitis,</hi> from which last attack he never recovered, till he died—as far as I could judge he was in a sane state—he was in a half paralytic state—he had a difficulty in speaking, but, as far as comprehension went, I never found any difficulty in making him understand me, nor had I any difficulty in understanding him—paralysis did not constitute a portion of the attack—the paralysis had existed for some time prior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THESSIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you attended the Mar<lb/>quis, did you generally find the prisoner with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes, and sometimes not—the Marquis's last illness began on February the 16th or 18th—I did not learn from him that he had gone with a party to Richmond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, from having been his lordship's medical attendant, that he had the most perfect confidence in the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In as many words from himself I do not, but as far as the evidence of my senses went,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040066"/>
               <p>that is, seeing one person about another, I should undoubtedly say that he certainly had—he appeared to have, undoubtedly—the prisoner was himself taken ill on the 16th of February—I was attending him—he was not able to attend on the Marquis in his last illness—he was confined to his room, and a great part of the time to his bed—he had an attack of erysipelas of the upper part of the chest, throat, and part of the head, which termi<lb/>nated in the formation of two large abscesses in the neck—attendance on the Marquis would undoubtedly be extremely irksome to a person—that state of semi-paralysis, as I may term it, existed for some considerable period—the time I cannot exactly say, but I should think a year or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That which would have made the attendance irksome and disagreeable, had lasted a year or two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was after his lord<lb/>ship's return to town from Dover, whenever that took place, but I can form no minute of the date.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THESIOER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he require constant shifting and changing about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Entirely, and frequently during the night; that is to say, if he was to be kept as a gentleman ought to have been; he would require constant attendance of course.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you knew very little of the habits of life of the Marquis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never chose to know them—I never made any inquiry about them—curiosity in medical men is the worst thing they can indulge in—the pri<lb/>soner was in the habit of paying my accounts, and occasionally in the habit of giving me fees from the Marquis; sometimes the Marquis gave them to me himself, and sometimes Suisse gave the money to the Mar<lb/>quis, and the Marquis gave it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you the opportunity of observing where the prisoner got the money, when he got it for Lord Hertford, to give to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot say that I did; generally speaking, as far as my recollection serves me, I think he went and took it from some place, and gave it some<lb/>times to the Marquis, and sometimes he gave it to me himself—generally speaking, when the prisoner has been with me, it has been in the Mar<lb/>quis's bed-room, but occasionally the Marquis has given him a sort of nod, and he has given me the money afterwards; that happened very rarely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know who attended as the immediate personal servant of the Marquis during Suisse's illness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a man named Robert Foote, who is now very ill; he was his principal attendant, except during the last two or three days of the Marquis's life, when there was a female of the name of Mademoiselle Henriette, Foote attended personally on the Marquis, as well as the prisoner, when he was in good health, apparently under the direction of the prisoner; he was apparently the head servant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I think Mr. Croker arrived on the Sunday, I will not be positive; the Marquis died on the Ist of March, I think it was on Tuesday—I think Mr. Croker arrived the Sunday before—he was sent for—he did not stay there till his death, he went to Kensington for one night, I think, but I think the second night he was in the house—I will not speak positively—I considered the Mir<lb/>quis in danger before the Sunday Mr. Croker was sent for—he was in danger from the beginning of his last relapse—there was more or less hazard about his illness during the whole time it was on Saturday the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know a person who has been called Mademoiselle Henrietta? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I not know her—I saw her when I went to Lord Hertford on his last illness—as I was going out of the house she spoke to me as she was coming in—I think I never saw her but twice—I know a Miss Bourrielle, I saw her frequently with Lord Hertford—I dined with Lord Hertford more than once, where she also dined. I presume the is a French, woman from her speaking French—I know nothing at all about her—I never heard who she was—I looked upon her—indeed I really was not at all sorry that she attended Lord Hertford—I did everything in my power, when Lord Hertford went abroad, to induce him to take a medical man—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know who Miss Bourrielle is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I tell you that she is a person who attended Lord Hertford, and to say the truth, in my own opinion, much more as a nurse than any thing else—his lordship's state of health was so very bad—I believe she did not live at Dorchester-house—I do not know where she lived—I do not know that she came in the evening and went away in the morning—I know nothing about it, but I have seen her at dinner, and when Lord Hertford was travelling abroad, I have heard of that name—she was in the house when he and I dined in one room, I believe that she dined in another—I have dined with her more than three times at Dorchester-house—but when his lordship was travel<lb/>ling abroad before, I dined with him at several places—at Fontainbleau, for instance, and often in Paris, and she dined. in the house, but not with Lord Hertford and me on those occasions—I have dined with her several times at Dorchester-house—I never knew where she lived—yes, by the way, I think I did, and if you will allow me, I will tell you the reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Never mind your reason, where did she live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Clarges-street—I never visited her there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the kindness to tell me how you know she lived in Clarges-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When Lord Hertford was going away on the last occasion, he asked me to accompany him in his carriage to Westminster-bridge, or at far as I could go—he had an impression on his mind that he was not likely to see me again—I accordingly got into the carriage to go with him—to my surprise, the carriage stopped in Clarges-street—I said, "What is this for, how is this?"—he said, "It is only to take up Felicite Bour<lb/>rielle"—I said, "Excuse me, then, I cannot be in the carriage with Fe<lb/>licite Bourrielle," and I got out at the door in Clarges-ajreet, and left them—this was on the 12th or 13th of June last year, when he was going out of town last—I cannot say how often I had dined with Felicite Bourrielle before that—I had frequently dined at Lord Hertford's—he once invited me to dine with him, and to meet the Ladies—, and I was very much surprised when I came there, instead of those ladies, to see another—I do not think I dined with her after I refused to ride in the carriage with her—I will not be sure—I cannot say—I do not rightly recollect whether I dined with her since his lordship's return this last time—I rather think not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you give orders to have Suisse apprehended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> should think I did not give the orders alone—the executors, of whom I am one, gave orders, I presume the same day on which he was appre<lb/>hended—I did not see him after he was apprehended—I cannot recollect what time in the day, hut it was in the afternoon—I cannot say at what time—there was a meeting at Lord Lowther's house—it was not during the time he was conferring with Mr. Brabant—it was what he said to Mr. Brabant, that excited our suspicions—he was apprehended the same day as the conversation with Mr. Brabant—I think on the 4th of April, but I really am not sure—I was not present at Mr. Brabant's interview with the prisoner, though I knew of it—I recollect Mr. Brabant's consulting me, but I do not know whether it was the same day the prisoner was ap<lb/>prehended—it was after I had been consulted—I have known Suisse for twenty years in the Marquis's service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he not the entire confidence of the Marquis during the greater part of that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really do not know what you mean by entire confidence—I should say not—Lord Hertford was a very reserved man, exceedingly silent and reserved—the prisoner was confidential for all pur<lb/>poses for which a servant can be confidential, I have not the slightest doubt, and appeared to me a faithful and attentive servant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he was receiving and paying very large sums from time to time for the Marquis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lord Hertford had a fit of illness—it is a question which I cannot answer yes or no to—I should say he was not, decidedly, during the greater part of the time, nor for the last ten years—for the last few months, I should say yes, but not for the last few yean—I have not looked into beyond the last few months of the Marquis's accounts at the bankers'—indeed I have not looked at the bankers' books at all—I have seen the last bankers' book immediately before Lord Hertford's death—the bankers' book begins on the 1st of January, and Lord Hertford died on the 1st of March, and during that time I saw that the prisoner had paid large sums of money—I did not look into other books—I began on that date—I do not think I was present at any time when the prisoner was told of his having a legacy of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the Marquis's will, or of his having a very large legacy under his late master's will and codicil—I do not think I was present at any conversation with anybody and him about the legacy—I do not remember it—I do not think that I ever saw Suisse. after the will was opened.</p>

On the 24th of June, I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, and shut the house up—I was the last up—I came down at a quarter before six o'clock the next morning—the kitchen shutter was then broken, and an entrance had been made—I missed these towels and other things produced—they are my master's—I can swear to them, and these other things are mine.</p>

About five o'clock in the morning of the 25th of June, I met the prisoner in Edgeware-road with the bundle—I asked him whose it was—he said it was his—I took him into custody, and on the way to the station he escaped—I pursued—I did not lose sight of him—the bundle contained these things—he said a man gave them to him in the fields.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the Twopenny Post-office. On Tuesday morning 21st of June, I was on duty in the letter-carrier's office, about half-past eight or twenty minutes before nine o'clock—I was engaged in sorting letters, and in the course of my sorting, the letter now produced, came into my hand, addressed to Mr. Uranus—it was sorted to me by Merritt, who said it contained cash—in consequence of what Merritt told me, I gave the letter to Gauntlett, my assistant, and told him it was a cash-letter—the prisoner was sitting by me, on my right, and Gauntlett was sitting opposite me—the prisoner was sorting on my right hand-side, as near as the seats could stand—soon after Gauntlett called me aside, and laid, "I have lost the money-letter"—in consequence of that all the let<lb/>ter-carriers of our division were ordered into the inspector's room—there were thirteen or fourteen of them, and the prisoner was one—to go into the inspector's room, you have to pass through the supernumeraries-room—there is a partition between the supernumeraries'-room and the in<lb/>spector's room, and on entering the inspector's room, there are two steps—I went up them, and when I got on the top step my face was turned to<lb/>wards the supernumeraries' room, and I observed the prisoner on my right side—he was on the floor below me, and close by a table on which there stood a box, about seven inches from a partition—I observed the prisoner take this letter from some letters which he had in his left hand—he pushed it along the table, and hid it behind the box—I got down from the steps, and said, "There is the letter, I saw Hunt put it there"—I looked behind the box, and found this letter—it is the one I had before given to Gauntlett—the prisoner was too confused to say anything.</p>

On the 21st of June, I was on duty at the office—Mr. Hewitt was there, and the prisoner—I remember Mr. Hewitt giving me a letter containing cash, addressed to Mr. Uranius, No. #, Crane-court, Fleet-street"—I put it on one side</p>

               <p>of me—it remained there about twenty minutes—I then left to get some letters from another office—I gave some of them to Hewitt, some to another man, and the remainder to the prisoner; and I believe this letter was in the packet of letters which I gave to the prisoner, for when I received it, I put it down on the desk with another letter, and when I brought the packet of letters from the other office, I laid them down on these two letters, I then gave two parcels to two other persons, and the last parcel I gate to the prisoner—if he had received this letter with the parcel which I gave him, he ought to have sorted this into the Farringdon-walk letter boxes—there are six of them, and one of them is for the division which I deliver, and be ought to have put it into that box—I took the letters out of that box in about a minute after I had given the parcel of letters to the prisoner, and this letter was not there, but the other letter that I had pot down with this one was—I then asked Mr. Hewitt if he had this letter, as I had lost it—I went round the division to see if it had made its way into any of the other Farringdon boxes—I could not find it, and I made a report to Mr. Payne that I had lost it—he ordered all the letter-carriers into the inspector's room—that order was given loud enough for all to hear—they all went but the prisoner, he remained behind, he did not go imme<lb/>diately—I said to him, "Come, you must come with your letters as well as the rest; you know you must come"—he then took up his letters, and came from the division where he had been sitting towards the inspector's room—he followed me—Hewitt was half a dozen paces before—I went on, and passed Hewitt just as he got to the door, and I had not been in a second before Hewitt cried out, "There is Hunt putting a letter behind that box"—I turned as soon as I could, and saw Hewitt get down the steps, and take away a letter from the box—it was handed to Mr. Payne, the inspector, and he handed it to the President—he asked me if that was the letter I bad lost—I told him it was—at the time Mr. Hewitt took the letter, I saw the prisoner—he appeared very much confused for the moment, and after a short pause, he said, "I did not put it there"—Hewitt and I have been on the same beat very near four yean—the pri<lb/>soner's beat joins ours—I do not recollect that he, and Hewitt, and I have been in company except as letter-carriers—I have requested the prisoner to deliver my letters on one or two occasions, when be has been pawing a house which I have got a letter for—I have not heard Hewitt ask him to do so, but I have asked him in the presence of Hewitt—I think he has refined to take a letter for me—perhaps he has not had a letter near the house, and he has said, "I can't take it for you this time"—I have never heard him refuse Hewitt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am quite innocent; I was walking along, and saw the prosecutor surrounded by several persons; he came to me, and began pulling me about with his hands; I laid hold of him, and we struggled, and fell down; at that moment the officer came up.</p>

On the 27th of June, the glass-cutters had their annual dinner at Chalk-farm—I did not go to the dinner, but went up about a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening by myself—I there joined my husband and his family—I had a shawl—we went into the ball-room about nine—the shawls were put on a window-seat, and tome hats and bonnets put upon them—about a quarter-past one the next morning, I went to put my shawl on, and it was gone—I then missed the prisoner, who had been in the room—I went out, and followed her down stairs—she was talking to two young lads, and said she must go home—she had a bundle under her arm—I said, "Excuse me, I think you have my shawl"—she denied having it—I lifted up her shawl, and took mine from under her arm—the policeman took my sister's shawl and a parasol from her at the station—they had been lying with my shawl—the prisoner had been in our party in the room in the evening.</p>

On the 27th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the area—I saw the prisoner at the pantry cupboard with this coffee-pot and three spoons in his hand, which I had seen safe that morning—I asked who he was, and what he was doing there—he said he was doing nothing—I shut the door, and by that means he was kept in—he put the coffee-pot down on the floor, and laid the spoons on the table, and begged of me to let him pan—he tried to get out—he got away from me after a struggle—his coat was torn—I followed, and he was taken—he is the person.</p>

On the 2nd of June, in consequence of missing something, I told her I had lost something, and must search her drawers—I searched them, and found some towels wrapped up in a sleeve of her own night-gown—found two pillow cases, one had the mark picked out, but the stain of the letter still showed the mark—it was the property of the Penitentiary—found an apron and a towel, the towels belong to me, and the apron the Penitentiary—I have a letter I have received from her since she has been in custody—I know it is her handwriting.</p>

On the 9th of June I went up to my own bed-room, on the first-floor, about four o'clock in the afternoon—on the same landing, and opposite to my bed-room, is a room to which company resort—I remained in my bed-room till a few minutes after nine—I had two children with me—I put them to bed at half-past eight—I made the bed at that time, and there was no pipe upon it—I had the articles stated in a drawer in that room—I left them safe, and the drawer shut—I shut the room-door after me—I went down, and when I had been down about ten minutes I saw the prisoner in front of the bar—I looked at the clock when I went down, and it was five minutes past nine—when I saw the prisoner he was going towards the staircase, and he had a pipe in hit hand, twisting it about—I told him there was no one up stairs—that was the fact, as they had all come down when I did—the prisoner stood with his right hand on the staircase—I did not see him again for about three-quarters of an hour, when he came from the back-door to the parlour-door, which was in a direction from the stairs—he said, "Good night; I shall not stop now;. I am going home to go to bed"—he went out at the front-door—in about ten minutes I went up stairs to get change—I found the door was shut, but the drawer was wide open—I missed from it the work-box which had contained the articles, and a China-crape shawl—I went afterwards, in consequence of something that was said to me, to the stable, and in one of the stalls I found the partition of the work-box, and the tray of it was all broken—I went to the privy, and saw the work-box down the well—it was brought up afterwards—I had seen it safe in my room in the afternoon, and I did not leave the room at all till I went down stairs at past nine—the value of all the articles lost was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found my husband in the par<lb/>lour when I went down at past nine, and he remained there till I went up—I gave information to the police the same night—we have only been in the house nine weeks—I first saw the prisoner about a fortnight after we got there, and he has been in the habit of coming two or three times a-week, or it might be oftener—the next morning my little boy brought me a tobacco-pipe—next morning the prisoner came to the bar, and said he had heard that I had accused him of robbery—I said we had—he said he should wish it cleared up—I said that was my intention—I went to the door, and saw a policeman, and gave him in charge—I asked why he had said the night before that he was going home—he said he had met a female, and went down Whitechapel-road with her, as far as the Red Lion; that he neither knew who she was, nor where she lived.</p>

I came in that night about a quarter after nine o'clock—I had occasion soon after that to go to the stable in the yard—it was dark—I heard something of a hustling in the stable—I hallooed out, "Who is here?" and the prisoner answered—(I knew it was him by his voice)—he begged my pardon, he said he did not know where the water-closet was, and he was doing his occasion there—I said it was granted—I then commenced shutting up outside—I removed a table, and two horse-troughs, and a tub, round to the back part of the house, and placed them against the stable door—no one could get out that way after I had put those things there—I then came round to the front of the house, and went in—I did not see the prisoner there—I then went to the stable, and went in, and called out, "Are you coming out?"—I got no answer—I then went to the bar, and got a light, and looked round the stable—I could not find him—I then went to the water-closet door, and that was fast—I went in before the bar again, and sat about ten minutes—I then went out again, and knocked at the water-closet door—I said, "Halloo, are you gone to sleep?"—the pri<lb/>soner answered, yes, he had, and he came out, and said he was going home—he went through the house, and said, "Good night"—in about ten minutes after he was gone, I heard of the loss, and I then told Mrs. Howard what I had observed—I went with her into the stable and the privy, and found a box down the privy—no one went from the house to the yard be<lb/>tween the time when the prisoner went away and my finding the box down the privy, and no one could have got out of the door while the troughs were against it—I had known the prisoner about a week before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to attend the prosecutrix—I found an incised wound about the middle of the back, in a line with the spine—it was about an inch and a half in length, and a quarter of an inch deep—it is quite well now—it appeared to be given by a sharp blow with rather a blunt knife—the spine was inflamed—the spine prevented the wound being deeper—it could not have been given by the poker—there were some marks of bruises besides, but rather slight—I do not know whether the inflammation proceeded from the blows with the poker.</p>

On Tues<lb/>day evening, the 5th of July, about twelve o'clock, I was going along the Borough, and in Blackman-street was accosted by the prisoner—she came and caught hold of my arm, and asked me to give her some money—I took my purse out, gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and put my purse back into my left-hand pocket—I then walked on with her—she kept clinging hold of my arm for some distance—about two minutes after I put my hand again into my pocket, (I do not know what impulse of the moment induced me to do so,) and found my purse was gone—I walked on some twenty or thirty yards further, and met a policeman—I did not make any complaint till I saw him; I then gave her into custody—I saw my purse afterwards—it was picked up about a yard from where I charged her.</p>

               <p>Olave's, Southwark—Hickey was an inmate there, and employed as a nurse—in consequence of information, I went to Leary's house in Fair-street, with Mr. Rosier, on Saturday week last—there I found three sheets, a shift, and a pair of stockings, the property of the Union—the marks were cut out of the sheets, the shifts and stockings were marked—Hickey was appre<lb/>hended in the workhouse—the prisoners are sisters—Leary said the sheets which Mr. Rosier refused to take were given to her by her sister when they were together in my room at the time, and Leary said to her sister, "You gave them to me"—Hickey said, "I know I did"—Hickey being a nurse, would have access to these articles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live in Union-street, Borough. On Tuesday night, the 21st of June, I was proceeding home from Tooley-street, between twelve and one o'clock—Brown and two other females stopped me, and in about a minute Brown put her hand into my pocket, and took out 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I seized hold of her hand, and in a minute or two afterwards M'Kew and another young man came up—they en<lb/>tered into conversation with the females, and made me let go of Brown—they began shuffling about, and got me into the road, and M'Kew said, "Take no notice of it, I will make all right"—I said, "You had better keep your distance from me; I don't want any conversation with you, or else you will no doubt share the fate of the person who has robbed me"—I could see no policeman—M'Kew went back to the women again, and told them to go with him, and they proceeded on down under the arches—I was following, and M'Kew saw me following, he struck me, and threw me down, and ran his fist in my face—he dared me to make resist<lb/>ance till the others got away—he then laughed at me—I said I would follow him if the rest had got away—he was making his way to go to St. Thomas-street, and I was calling out, "Stop thief"—Mr. Grinsell's pri<lb/>vate watchman stopped him, and gave him in charge—I went to the sta<lb/>tion with him, then came back, and searched about Tooley-street to see if I could find any of the others—I could not, and about three o'clock the policeman persuaded me to go home—as I was going, I saw Brown and two other women with her—I went to look at her—she saw I took notice of her, and turned round—the other women said, "Is that him?"—Brown said, "Yes," and she proceeded down some back streets to getaway, but I saw a policeman, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Matthew Flint—we carry on business as mercers, at No. 63, Blackfriars-road, in the parish of Christ-church—it is our dwelling-house—we have no back-entrance, but our premises reach to the back of the premises which face Collingwood-street—Mr. Davies's premises are in Collingwood-street, and our premises abut on Mr. Davies's—on the night of the 13th of June I left my pre<lb/>mises all secure by locking the door and taking the key to my bed-room—next morning, about half-past six, I received some information from my maid-servant—I went down stairs very quickly—there is a door which leads from the house-part of my premises to the shop—I had seen that door secure before I went to bed, fastened by a lock, and in the morning I found that door was broken open—the box of the lock appeared to have been forced—very many things in the shop were in confusion, and I missed silks, ribbons, handkerchiefs, and dresses, and a number of other things—the value of all the property missing was from 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a door by which we can go from the back part of our house into the yard—I found that door open—it had been opened from the inside—there is a window looking into the back yard—that had been up at night, and was down in the morning—there is no fastening to it—I know it was pushed full up the night before, when I locked the back door—on going into the yard I found a rope ladder, which was attached at top to my neighbour's rafters, and at the bottom attached to my dust-bin by some gimlets, and at the foot of that ladder there was a quantity of papers,</p>

               <p>which had covered my silks and goods the night before—there were two pieces of wood to the ladder to keep the ropes apart—a person could go by that to Mr. Davies's, across a roof, and get into his yard, and then through a door into Collingwood-street, without going through any house.</p>

On Tuesday morn<lb/>ing, the 14th of June, I went to the prosecutor's premises, and saw the rope-ladder in the yard—this is it—I should think it is fourteen or fifteen feet long—it was placed up against Mr. Davies's premises, which adjoin Mr. Naylor's yard, and from Mr. Davies's yard you could get to Colling<lb/>wood-street—I received information, and went into the New Cut—I saw Brown and Mason, and another person in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Cole was driving it—I assisted another officer to take them to the Tower-street station—the other man has since been discharged—on the following morning, (Wed<lb/>nesday,) in consequence of information, I went with Cuddy to No. 19, Wellington-place—Cuddy there took possession of a number of pieces of wood which were in a cupboard down stairs, and some clothes from a drawer—a woman who called herself Mrs. Brown, was there—I did not know her personally—I afterwards saw her at the examination as Mrs. Brown—Brown knew her—she came to the office while he was in cos<lb/>tody—three of the witnesses were asked if they knew her—I do not know that she spoke to Brown—Brown claimed the clothes that were found in the drawer, as his, at one of the examinations.</p>
