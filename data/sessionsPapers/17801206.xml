            , Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Hillingdon, near Uxbridge. I was coming in a post chaise from my house to London, on Tuesday the 14th of November, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; I had a servant behind the chaise. Between the two and three mile-stones at <placeName id="t17801206-2-crimeloc8">Shepherd's-Bush</placeName>

                        targets="t17801206-2-off5 t17801206-2-crimeloc8"/>, the prisoner came up on horseback, stopped the chaise, presented a pistol, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Was he alone? - I believe so. The words he made use of were, come sir, your money, presently. I immediately put my hand into my pocket. Before I could let the glass down, the door of the chaise was opened. The prisoner took my money from me, and the door was shut again.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing else to you? - No. When the door was shut again, I came on.</p>
               <p>Did he take the money out of your hand or your pocket? - He took my purse with two guineas in it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>When the door was opened did he put the pistol into the chaise? - I did not see the pistol then, but I saw it presented to me when he demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Did you see any person on the road during the time the robbery was committing? - I did not see any immediately, but I alarmed every person I met with on the road. I saw people in a minute or two after the robbery, both on foot and horseback.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay with you? - A very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Did he meet or overtake the chaise? - He met it, and called to the postillion to stop, then he turned about and came up to the chaise door.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In such a great coat as I have on [a lightish colour].</p>
               <p>Had he any disguise over his face? - None. I am very clear as to his person.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations of the colour of his horse? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was he long enough with you and did you take so much notice of his person as to be able positively to swear to the man? - I have no doubt in the world about his being the man. I was robbed on the Tuesday; I saw him in custody on the next Thursday, and I was then as I am now, very clear that he was the man who robbed me.</p>

             (a negro) sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Lane, I have lived with him thirty-two years last November. I was behind his carriage when my master was robbed.</p>
               <p>Where did it happen, and about what time? - As near as I can possibly guess, it was pretty near two o'clock; it was at Shepherd's-Bush the man came up.</p>
               <p>Who came up? - That very man, the prisoner at the bar, came up upon a bay mare: he bid the post chaise boy stop; the boy would not stop. At last the prisoner waved his pistol over his head, and made him stop. Then he came up to the chaise door and was going to break the window. I said honest man, don't commit a rash action, my master will give you his money. Then the prisoner put his pistol into his left hand, and opened the door of the carriage with his right hand; and I saw my master give him his purse.</p>
               <p>Could you see that when you was behind the carriage? - Yes, I leaned forward and saw it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing to your master? - Yes, he said, Your money, your money, your money! When my master gave the prisoner his purse, he laid it across his thigh, and looked at it, he said, here is no money. My master said there is money. My master offered him his watch. My master told him it was a pinchbeck watch. The prisoner would not take it; he then turned round to me, I had a French-horn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060004"/> under my coat, I suppose the prisoner thought it was fire-arms, for he presented his pistol towards me, for I suppose the space of three minutes, as he went off from me; he went off in a footpace for two or three hundred yards, then I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Did he keep his eye upon you all the time? - He looked every way, but chiefly upon me, because he was afraid, as I imagined, that I had fire-arms.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a light coloured loose great coat, such as my master has now on.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing on his face? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him enough to be able to swear to him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - Positively sure. When my master came to town he sent me with a letter to Sir John Fielding's office. I saw Mr. Bond at the office, he read the letter, he said, your bird is in the net; he bid me go to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street. I begged he would send somebody with me; he sent three men with me. As we were going to the Rotation-office, one of them bid me go into the office and if I saw the person who had robbed my master, to come to him and tell him of it, but not to say any thing there. I went into the office; I saw the prisoner directly, I did not say a word to any body, but came out and told the person who waited for me that the man was there who had robbed my master.</p>
               <p>How long was this after the robbery? - This was before four o'clock on the same day.</p>
               <p>Are you certain the prisoner is the man? - Upon my oath he is. I am very sorry to say it; life is sweet, I wish I could save him, but I must speak the truth.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. How was I dressed? - In a flapped hat, and in a surtout coat which hung down to your heels.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had I this coat and waistcoat on? - I cannot swear to the under clothes, the great coat covered them; but, my Lord, I swear positively to his face.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Lane. Whether you recollect the circumstance of the man's laying the purse across his thigh, and saying there was no money? - When he took the purse he said here is nothing in it, I said, it is all the money I have. I said, I have an old metal watch, you may have it if you please. He made no reply to that, but the chaise door was shut.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 14th of November, as I was riding from London to Gunnersbury, I met a gentleman's chaise with a black servant behind it, between the Gravel-pits and Shepherd's-Bush, the servant waved his hand to me and said, a highwayman. I passed on, going very fast to Shepherd's-Bush. Then I saw a chaise turn out of the Action road for Hammersmith, and I observed a man riding across the green, which gentlemen frequently do, instead of going round, he gallopped pretty fast across the green, and jumped over the ditch upon the causeway about ten yards before a chaise, then he turned short and stopped that chaise. This was within two or three minutes after the black servant had called out to me; he was on the opposite side of the chaise from me when he stopped it; he did not stay with the chaise more than two minutes; after he left that chaise, he walked his horse on into the Action road, I thought to meet me; began to gallop. When he saw me put n horse into a gallop, he turned about again and leaped over the ditch upon the green as if he was going to the Gravelpits again; then he rode back again to the causeway and followed the chaise towards Hammersmith. I had a very good horse. Just at that instant came up Mr. Hurd, who lives in Oxford-road; I said, that man has robbed a chaise, we will pursue him. He said he would. I rode as fast as I could; I passed the chaise which I had seen him stop. I asked the servant as I rode by, had not that man robbed the chaise? He said yes. I pursued the man as fast as I could; I rode down Brook-green, at the back side of Hammersmith. I saw him at the bottom. He turned away for Hammersmith, and I after him as hard as I could.</p>
               <p>Did he see that you was pursuing him? - He certainly did. I met several gentlemen in the road; I said,</p>
               <p>"that man is a highwayman, will you help me to pursue him"? but I got no assistance. I pursued him through Hammersmith. Instead of going the great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060005"/> road through Hammersmith, he took the left hand towards the water-side. He rode down to the water; he could go no farther there; I followed him down to the water-side; I had no assistance; the place was very narrow; he turned about upon me, supposing he had fire-arms, I turned my horse about and rode back; he came after me. I thought to keep before him till he got into the broad-way at Hammersmith, as I expected I should get assistance there. There is a very narrow lane near the water-side, he went up that lane; I turned about and went after him again up the lane; I followed him pretty close. Before he got through that lane into the great road, some people stopped him, and took him off his horse. They found upon him a pistol, a powder horn, and some balls. They did not search him any further at that time.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a light surtout coat; and he rode a bay mare, about fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>How long do you imagine it was after you passed the chaise with the black behind it before you took the man? - From the time I met that chaise, I do not think it could be more than twenty-five minutes. I saw him in less than two minutes after I passed the prosecutor's chaise. I believe I pursued him for about three miles, and I never lost fight of him but when he turned a sharp corner, and then in half a minute's time I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man you pursued and took? - He is.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether I presented any pistol to the gentleman? - I did not see him draw his pistol at all. I saw it afterwards taken out of his great coat pocket.</p>

               <p>I keep the Queen's-Arms, at Hammersmith. On the 14th of November I saw the prisoner pursued by my door, by Mr. Powell, between the hours of one and two; I was at my door as the highwayman came by me; I thought he rode in a furious manner over the stones. Mr. Powell came up directly upon the back of the prisoner. Mr. Powell said,</p>
               <p>"that is a highwayman; I have just seen him rob two gentlemen in a chaise." I said, you are well mounted, sir, you may overtake him. I saw the man take towards the water; I thought he would make a double and come round Angel-lane. I went to Angel-lane, there I met the prisoner, as he was coming from the water. The lane is very narrow. When he came near me, I

             a little out as if to let him pass; then I snatched his bridle and stopped his horse.</p>
               <p>How soon was this after you first saw him pass by. I suppose not ten minutes. Mr. Powell came up almost the instant I had stopped him. There came two other men up immediately to my assistance. When I seised his bridle he made an attempt at his great coat pocket; I catched at his pocket and felt a pistol in it; I took this pistol out of his pocket (producing a small screw-barrel pistol). I searched him further, and found a little bag with balls and a powder-horn upon him (they were likewise produced in court). We took him to Justice Miller's; Mr. Miller was ill; he directed us to take the prisoner to the Rotation-office, in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>What sort of horse was he mounted on? - A bay mare with a switch tail, about fourteen hands high, almost blind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How was I dressed? - In a flapped round hat, a light coloured great coat, and a light coloured riding dress or jacket. As we were going along, he asked to put his gloves in his pocket, as he was in a great sweat. The beadle of the parish had hold of him on one side, I had hold of his collar. I bid the beadle let his hands go; the prisoner put his gloves into his pocket, and I observed he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket; he brought his hand out of his pocket clinched; I said, what have you got there? I took hold of his hand, and upon opening it, I found this purse with two guineas in it (producing it).</p>
               <p>To Mr. Lane. Do you recollect what sort of pistol was presented to you? - This seems to be the same sort of pistol. This is the purse the prisoner robbed me of; it is a very remarkable one, it was a present from a lady; there are two guineas in it, the same I believe that were in it when I was robbed.</p>

I went there as quick as I could; Mr. Day and Mr. Brooks overtook me. When we had got about half way down the lane. We met the prisoner coming on horseback; as he was passing by, Mr. Day catched hold of the prisoner's horse, and pulled him round; I catched hold of his arm on the other side, and pulled his cuff off.

               <p>I keep a hardware shop in the Strand. About seven months ago the prisoner came to me and said, I have some pocket pieces to sell. I said, let me see them, are you sure they are your own property? He said yes, my grandmother left them to me, I have a sore eye, and so may as well sell them. I bought two ounces of him; I gave him twelve shillings. After that I had a hand-bill given me, that Lord Aylesbury had lost two thousand pound's worth. I went to Lord Aylesbury's and showed them to his Lordship; he said he believed they were some he had lost, and desired me if the person came again, to stop him. On the 1st of September the prisoner came to me again and brought these twenty-three pocket pieces. I said they are very curious pocket pieces, are you sure they are your own property? He said yes; I said, I was afraid he had stolen them, as I had received a hand-bill that a great lord had lost two thousand pounds worth, and I must take him into custody. I took him to Bow-street, and searched him, and found this silver box, and seven more pocket-pieces in his pocket. They have been in my possession ever since. (The silver box was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Cocks. This is my box, but I cannot swear to the pocket-pieces. I had some of the same kind.</p>
               <p>Moses. The justice said I must go to Lord Aylesbury. I went; his Lordship was in Ireland. The prisoner was put into the round-house. The next day he voluntarily confessed he lived with Mr. Cocks, the banker, at Charing-cross, and that he had taken them from him.</p>

               <p>In consequence of this information Mr. Cocks was sent to, and came to the office.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said that both he and the Justice's Clerk told him it would be better for him to tell the truth, and then he made the confession.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence; but called

            . On Friday evening, I believe the 17th of November, I perceived some tea in a paper bag, concealed in the staircase in the back yard, leading to some warehouses. On Saturday evening about eight o'clock, I again saw it there; between ten and eleven o'clock I went there again and it was gone. At eleven o'clock we paid our men their wages; after we had paid them we shut the doors, and had them searched. The same package and the same tea, to the best of my belief, was found on the prisoner, and some raisins. I cannot swear to them; there was about two ounces and a half of tea, which is of the value of one shilling. We got a constable and searched his lodging and found some coffee, and some books of small value, and a penknife; the penknife and one of the books were mine; the other book was my brother's.</p>
               <p>Were they your own separate property, and the other your brother's separate property, and did not belong to the partnership - They were our separate property.</p>
               <p>How long has the prisoner lived with you? - Upwards of five years I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You had a good character with him? - A very good character.</p>
               <p>You do not swear to the tea? - It is not possible.</p>
               <p>What is the book? - A printed book of accounts of the clerks.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner was not put on his defence.)</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, between twelve and one o'clock, as I was coming from the cornmarket, I saw a crowd standing opposite the Mansion-house; when I had got through the crowd, I had the curiosity to stop a little to see what was the occasion of it. Mrs. Steward was standing against the second door from the end of a court almost facing the Mansion-house, there was no person near her but two little boys, one I understand is her son. She was out of the crowd within about a door of Mildred-street; I observed the prisoner go and look round the people's pockets as they were standing. Where Mrs. Steward was, the people were standing upon the kirb-stone, and the prisoner was standing behind them, with another little woman; I saw her come up to the prosecutrix and the other woman with her; she came close to her, and I could see her working into the pocket, the other woman stood up to her to support her, and if an hackney-coach had not come by, I should have taken her with her hand in the prosecutor's pocket, but the coach went by and she got off. As soon as opportunity would permit, I came over to the prosecutrix, and said, feel if your pocket is not picked.</p>
               <p>You was on the opposite side of the way? - Exactly; there was no person to obstruct my fight; I did not see any thing taken, but it was very clear to me what she was doing.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough to be sure whether she put her hand into the prosecutrix's pocket or not? - I am certain she had her hand in her pocket; I saw her put it under her apron; I could not see it in her pocket. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060008"/> went over and asked the prosecutrix if her pocket was picked? She was frightened and did not know how to answer me; I thought she would have dropped; she recovered herself, and felt in her pocket, and said, she had lost her money. I described the prisoner, and the prosecutrix's boy went after her up Cheapside, and brought her back.</p>
               <p>Did you know the woman again? - Yes, I have known her by sight many years.</p>
               <p>Was she examined? - I believe she was, but I believe there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you attack me at the time? - The coach came by and she was off in a moment.</p>
               <p>To Steward. Did you ever recover the money or find it again? - No.</p>
               <p>Was your pocket cut off or the money picked out of it? - The money was picked out, it was loose in my pocket.</p>

We had information he had frequent meetings with a person on Westminster-bridge, who received tin of him, that led us to watch him. I saw him take an ingot of tin out of the yard, about a quarter after four o'clock in the morning. I sat up to watch him. That was I think on the 24th of October. We have two shops, one at Lambeth; the cart is kept there; he goes to fetch the cart. He was ordered to get up at this time of the morning.</p>
               <p>How did he get the ingot? - It lay open in the warehouse; I saw him come out of the warehouse with it under his arm and put a bag over it. I could have stopped him then, but I wanted to detect the receiver. I was up in the lost above, where he could not see me. There was another piece found in his pocket afterwards.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this piece of tin? - It is about twenty pounds weight, it is worth eight pence a pound.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Kinman. On the 9th of November I was ordered to follow the prisoner; I had followed him on the 23d of October, and the 24th. On the 24th of October he had a piece of tin which my master saw him take. On the Tuesday after the 24th of October my master saw him take a piece out of the yard.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of October your master ordered you to follow the prisoner? - Yes, on the 23d he ordered me to follow him the next morning when he went out, which I did. I observed he had something under his arm with a bag over it; I followed him into Fleet-street, down the ditch side; he seemed to be apprehensive there was some person after him; he stopped; I was obliged to stop likewise. When he came nearer to the tollhouse at Black-friars-bridge, he made a full stop, seeming determined to see if any person was after him. I crossed to the other side of the bridge, and I suppose he threw this piece over, it was found by a waterman's boy at low water mark, on the 9th of November. I followed him again; he went towards Temple-bar. I observed he had something heavy in his pocket. He stopped at Temple-bar, so that I could not avoid coming close to him. He fell into discourse with me, and immediately turned about and said, I have lost my glove, and went back; I followed him back, imagining he meant to discharge the piece he had got. I said he had got something he should not have. He said he had not. I said I must search him; I did, and found this ingot upon him (producing it).</p>

               <p>Any person who deals with Forbes may have the same sort? - They may.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He had got a piece of metal for a friend to make a pair of buckles.</p>

I have three cellars, we searched and found the prisoner in the coal cellar, he lay piled up together like a dog. We asked him if he had any accomplices? He said he would be buggered if he impeached any body. We took him to New Prison, and the next morning to the justice, and there he said, if I had let him alone two hours longer he would have done me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any part of the house that was broke open? - He said he got in by wrenching up the slap of the cellar window; there was no mark of violence to be seen on the outside, the slap was shut down again; there is a slap and two folding doors with a bar across, the dog of the slap was out of order, and I found it bent; I did not know before that it was very easy to get it up; when they had got into the cellar they wrenched down a board to get into the shop; the cellar where they got in was under the place where I live.</p>

I had been at church; I came home about six in the evening; then I went over to a neighbour's house to drink tea; I double locked my door. I had not been out above ten minutes before the gentlewoman's child said my bell rang. I said, how can you think my bell rings when I have double-locked my door. Soon after the bell rang again. I went over and found my door wide open; a man rushed out of my house, and passed me. I went up stairs and saw the prisoner Caddie on the top of the stairs coming down; I laid fast hold of his arm, and asked him what he wanted? He told me he wanted one Mr. Newbond. I told him I was a widow, and no person lived here but myself. He said a person wanted him at Cow-cross. I let him go, but Mr. Argyle brought him up stairs directly after, and sent for a constable; and I saw five picklock keys, a crow, and a bag taken from him.</p>
               <p>Had you any light when you held this conversation with him? - Yes, I had a candle in my hand, and there was a light in my room.</p>

               <p>You did not actually lose any thing I suppose? - No.</p>
               <p>When you recovered from your fright did you examine the door? - It was very well when I left it, and I have not observed any mark of violence upon it since. I suppose it was got open with the picklock keys.</p>
               <p>Had you so much conversation with the prisoner as to have no doubt that he is the man? - No. I was with him about ten minutes in the room, and had some conversation with him, while my daughter and Mr. Argyle went up stairs. He asked me to search my place to see if I had lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Did he make any attempt to escape while he was left alone with you? - No.</p>
               <p>At this time of night was it dark? - Yes, it was about a quarter after six o'clock.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 5th of November, Mrs. Newstead called at our house between five and six o'clock; we asked her to drink tea with us. She said she would go home first and light her lamp and double-lock her door, for her husband had advised her, when she went out, to light the lamp and double-lock the door. She went and came back. We were at tea. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, my girl said, your bell rings, somebody is going into your house. She said, how can that be, I have the key here? We all listened and heard the bell ring again. She took a candle and opened our door; she said, my door is wide open, I am robbed. Just as I got into the court I saw a shout man, about five feet ten inches, come out of the house; I did not go after him, but went to the house. Just as she came to the stairs she met the prisoner coming down stairs. She laid hold of his arm, and said, how came you in my house? you have robbed me. He said he wanted a Mr. Newbond. I said there was no such person lived there. He said he was sure there was. She was frightened, and let him go; and he went out and sidled by the side of the houses. I seised him by the collar, brought him back, and took him up stairs. I sent for a constable; there was not one to be found. I afterwards went and brought one. I desired the prisoner might be searched; he pulled out a brown bag, with five picklock keys; the constable searched him further, and pulled out an iron crow.</p>

I said I was not near the house. He said he must take me into the house. I went up stairs with him, and pulled these things out of my pocket. I did not know what was in the bag. The woman said, my dear sir, if I have not lost any thing I will not hurt an hair of your head. I was taken to jail, and the next day before the justice; then she swore her door was open, that I was in the house, and she had been robbed. Now she swears she has lost nothing.</p>

               <p>Did you make any observations upon the horses? - I did; I think the prisoner rode a good looking bay horse, white in his face, rather a low horse; the next morning I came to Sir John Fielding's office; there I described the men and the circumstances attending the robbery; in about a fortnight after I received a letter from Mr. Bond, in consequence of which I came up to town; I saw the prisoner who was in custody; I said I believed him to be the man; I was shewn another man first, but I knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>What was the ground of your suspicion? - His person and his voice.</p>
               <p>How long time was the robbery in committing? - I believe between five and ten minutes, they were pretty quick; they swore at me and bid me make haste.</p>
               <p>Was there much conversation passed? - yes; I said "there is my money, but my watch</p>

               <p>Then the conversation was not so much with this man as the other? - The conversation was first with this man, with the other after; I never saw the other man's face; he kept his head at the side of the phaeton; the head of the carriage was up.</p>
               <p>What was the conversation you had with the prisoner? - To give me time and I would give my money; they said come, come, make haste, don't prate; they talked in that stile; I have advertised my watch, but have never heard any thing of it since.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Johnson; I was in the phaeton with him going to his house in Hertfordshire; the prisoner robbed me.</p>
               <p>Are you certain he is the man? - I am positive; I saw him reach his hand over me and rob my master; the prisoner came to my side, the near side, and presented a pistol.</p>
               <p>How long was the robbery in being committed? - Between five and ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did not an attack of that kind put you into confusion? - No; I was not so frightened at that time as I was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you possess yourself so much as to be certain to the person of the prisoner when you only saw him for so small a space of time? - I had seen him on horseback in company with another at Kilburn-wells; we staid at Kilburn-wells between a quarter and half an hour; I got out of the carriage and went into the house; the prisoner was on horseback with another in company; they stood under the trees on account of the weather, as I thought, and I took particular notice of them: I was in a front room which looked towards those trees.</p>
               <p>How came you to make particular observations of these people? - It rained prodigious hard, and I wondered they did not come into the house.</p>
               <p>What was the colour of their horses? - Both of them were bay horses.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any person besides the prisoner come up to the phaeton? - I only saw the prisoner, the other I did not see; the prisoner d - 'd me and told me not to hesitate, but deliver my money immediately. The purse belonged to a friend of mine; I begged of him not to take the purse; he d - 'd me and said don't ask; don't hesitate.</p>
               <p>Did he hold any conversation with Mr. Johnson? - He desired him not to hesitate.</p>
               <p>Are you very positive to the person of the prisoner? - I am; I saw both the pistol; the prisoner held his to my breast; the other pistol was held to my master's neck; I desired the prisoner to withdraw his pistol but he would not; he demanded my watch; I told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060015"/> was but a servant and had not got a watch; he felt about me but I had not one.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing further to relate respecting the robbing of your master? - They demanded my master's watch; my master desiring to save his watch, said "he had not got one." The prisoner repied I know you have a watch. My master had pulled his watch out at Kilburn-Wells. They insisted upon having it.</p>

I went out in my boots and left my shoes and buckles in the coachhouse. Towards the evening I went to look for them, and missed them. I used to employ the prisoner occasionally to help me; he not coming that evening, I had a suspicion of him. I went to look for him two days, but could not find him. On the next Tuesday I got a constable and took him, and had him to the round-house. He confessed he had taken my shoes and buckles, and said he had lost one of the buckles, and sold the other.</p>

I went up stairs about a quarter of an hour after and missed my things. We had lodgers in the house, so I thought she had gone up to some of the lodgers. Upon missing them I went to the first pawnbroker's, which was Mr. Mills, in Short's-gardens, there I found the hat. The prisoner was taken up at the Sun, the corner of Brownlow-street, the next morning. She was taken before the justice and there she owned she had taken the things.</p>

               <p>Were any promises or threatenings made use of to induce her to own it? - No. She took us to Little St. Andrew's-street, and Lumber-court, where we found all the rest of the things.</p>

Thirteen pair of stockings, eleven of which were thread, not mentioned in the indictment, and two frocks, two aprons, two shifts, two caps, and four handkerchiefs were lost on the last day of October. I had taken the prisoner into my apartment to lodge with me for a few days. The last day of October she left me, and stole the several things mentioned in the indictment. She was taken up on the 2d of November, and upon her legs a pair of my stockings were found; a handkerchief was found upon her, and a child's cap. She was carried before a justice; there she voluntarily acknowledged that she had sold the other particulars mentioned in the indictment, to a Jew.</p>

I went into the yard, and I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's yard; he turned his back towards me, but as he was running away, the linen being wet, one of the shirts tumbled between his legs, which made him stumble, and was near throwing him down; I turned round full upon him; I then saw he had a bundle of linen. I seised him. He ran near the pales, where there was an accomplice ready to have received this linen. I held him till I had the assistance of Mr. Allam. Afterward a constable was sent for.</p>

               <p>I am a weaver; I was in the tap-room at the Flower-pot, at the corner of Church-street, Bethnal-green, when Mr. Pullow brought the prisoners in with these goods; I have had the custody of these goods ever since; that was at about half past four; they had the things in their aprons when they were brought into the house.</p>

             went up the steps and entered the house. The other stood near the door at the end of the court in waiting; I advanced a few steps from the front of the court that the person in waiting should not observe me; they returned in five or six minutes with some thing upon them; they had no sooner quitted the court but they ran a few yards and then walked a good pace; I followed them down several streets till they came to Church-street; there I stopped them and demanded what property they had upon them, and how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060023"/> they came by it; one of them with insolence said the property was not mine; I went into the Flower-pot and desired of the people to assist me; I took them into a back room, and these things were produced. I left the prisoners and went to the prosecutor's house; and asked if they had lost any thing; they had not missed the clothes at that time; the prosecutrix went up stairs and immediately missed them.</p>

             asked me for a glass of wine? I bid him</p>
               <p>"go home and mind his master's</p>
               <p>"business." He immediately took me by the throat and dragged me up Palsgrave-place. I struggled as long as I could; he left my throat one time and then attacked me again.</p>
               <p>For how long time did he leave your throat? - I cannot say. Then he dragged me up towards Twining's tea warehouse, keeping his right hand to my throat; he bent me down and behaved very indecently with his other hand. Then he took his left hand from my petticoats; he kneeled his knee upon my back and bent me down to the ground; and then turned my pocket inside out.</p>
               <p>What did he rob you of? - About eight or nine shillings and a pocket piece, but that was of very little value; then he ran down Palsgrave-place and turned to his right hand.</p>
               <p>While he was dragging you up the court and using you in this manner you have described, did you cry out? - It was impossible to cry out; I did as well as I could but I was almost choaked.</p>
               <p>Did you see any person in the court? - In my flurry I cannot say that I observed any person; but there was a person passing at the time who is now in court.</p>
               <p>Did you observe enough of the person to be able to swear that Cook was the man who used you so? - I can most positively swear to him and the other too.</p>

             do? - He attended all the time I was robbed behind Cook; he said something, I think the expression was</p>
               <p>"there is your bit." That was before Cook robbed me.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing his face? - I saw them both when I had not an opportunity of speaking.</p>
               <p>You are positive he was one of the men? - I am, most certainly.</p>
               <p>Was there any light in the court you could distinguish them by? - There were lamps.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen either of them before? - Never to my knowledge. Thomas came up the court after I was robbed, as I thought, to look at me; when he came up I told the hair-dresser he was one of those who had attacked me; that was about five minutes after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was you still standing in the court? - The hair-dresser had just taken me off from the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was not you pretty much in liquor? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Did not you first say you was robbed of a watch? - I said I had lost my watch.</p>
               <p>Afterwards that watch was found at home? - It was.</p>
               <p>Is it not very strange you should say you was robbed of a watch, when afterwards it turned out you was not? - In my fright I scarce knew what I said.</p>
               <p>You acknowledge Thomas did nothing at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060024"/> all to you? - He never spoke to me nor I to him.</p>
               <p>This was upon Lord Mayor's day in the evening? - It was.</p>
               <p>The little boy is Thomas? Is it not? - This on this side.</p>
               <p>You said he came up the court again five minutes after to look at you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you say the hair-dresser was taking you up at that time? - I was just up.</p>
               <p>Was it not strange a boy who had been doing you mischief should come up, when a man was along with you ready to take him into custody? - I speak the truth.</p>

               <p>How old are you? - I was fourteen on the twelfth of this month. I came down the Strand about half after eight o'clock at night on Lord Mayor's day. I saw three boys drag this gentlewoman up Palsgrave-place; the biggest boy Cook had his hand round her neck; I stopped a gentleman who was going through the court into the Temple; I told the gentleman that boy was going to pick her pocket. I saw him take his hand out of her pocket and he had some papers in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you see Thomas? - Yes; he was behind Cook laughing at him.</p>
               <p>Did you see Thomas do any thing? - No; he laughed as if he enjoyed the sport; there was another staid at the end of the court watching all the time.</p>
               <p>What condition was the woman in? - Screaming out.</p>
               <p>Was she upon the ground? - No; I staid in the court till the barber came; then she took me with her.</p>
               <p>When the barber came he lifted her from the ground? - Not that I know of; I did not see her upon the ground.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I live directly opposite Palsgrave-place. I was sent for upon Thomas's being taken; I heard the story; I asked Thomas how he came into such an affair as that of robbing the gentlewoman and using her ill, for she was very bad; he gave me a direction where Cook lived, and where I might find another. I took this little boy and the hair-dresser with me. I went to a publick-house on Ludgate-hill; the waiter said they were just gone out; we found Cook in bed about one o'clock in his master's house in Warwick-lane. We searched his clothes and out of his waistcoat came this pocket piece. (Producing it.)</p>

               <p>About five minutes before eight o'clock, on the 9th of November, I was going through Palsgrave-place to buy a fillet. I live in Essex-court. I saw Mrs. Marsano at the end of the court, and I saw Cook with one hand as I thought up to her bosom, and the other hand under her petticoats.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prosecutrix? - Yes, by sight. I went on for the fillet; I suppose I was gone about three or four minutes. Upon my return I saw

When I first saw them they were at the end of the court, in sight of the Strand; upon my return this time with the fillet, which was the third time, she was at the farther end of the court;

               <p>How came you to take so much observation of Cook as to be sure he was the person? - Because I saw this woman wrestling about, and saw his hand up to her neck; as soon as ever he ran away I heard her cry out murder and thieves! I went up to her; she told me</p>
               <p>"she had been robbed"; she seemed frightened. She asked me</p>

               <p>"there is one of them." There were two or three people gathered round, who were passing the court, to hear what she had to say. I said to a young man at the end of the court, I will run and take him. I ran to the bottom of the court; I was afraid to take him by myself; I got a young man to go with me. I laid hold of him by the throat, and brought him up to the prosecutrix; she said,</p>
               <p>"that was one of them."</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say from your own observation at the time, that Cook was the person you saw with the prosecutrix? - Yes, I can. He had a brown coat on, his hair was hanging down, and he had a round hat on.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face? - I did not look at his face. I knew him only by his coat and his hair. When I brought Thomas to her, she said, that was the person who came up to her and said, now is your bit.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You saw only one person lay hold of the prosecutrix, and that person had his hand up her coats? - Yes.</p>

               <p>There was no person near the prosecutrix and that person? - No. I had seen a great many girls of the town up the court; I thought it might be the same then; so I did not take any notice at first of it.</p>

The other two sheets were received on the 31st of August, and the 13st of September. They were taken in by my young man; I was in the shop when they were taken in. They were brought by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you observe no mark on the sheets? - I did not. The mark was in black, and was obliterated with whiting, on that I took in.</p>
               <p>When was the fourth taken in? - That was on the 1st of August; I was not present then.</p>
               <p>Were the marks of them all so defaced that you could not discern them? - I believe all the marks were defaced; they have been one with whiting.</p>

The crowd was very great, I could not get through it, and was under the necessity of standing there; the prisoner, who stood next to me, stooped and put his hand up my petticoats; I immediately put my hand into my pocket, but the prisoner had then taken my money out of my pocket. The money was found in his hand. I lost two half-crowns, and two shillings and ten-pence half-penny, and a farthing; the money was in my pocket when he put his hand up my clothes. He was taken to a publick-house, by the assistance of some persons, and upon searching his pockets some money was found. I fixed upon a farthing and a halfpenny. The farthing had been burnt; I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060027"/> it out of the fire and rubbed it. The halfpenny was black, I had been in possession of it a considerable time. I had a new shilling; such an one was found in the prisoner's pocket, and two half-crowns.</p>

               <p>I was attending the execution. I saw the prisoner near the prosecutrix; I observed she was very much pressed and ill-treated. Just as the common convicts had been tied up, and the coiner was going on in the sledge, I heard the prisoner say, in a low voice, as if speaking to an accomplice, Now to work. I kept my eye upon the prisoner.

            , the prosecutrix, was complaining of the pressure of the crowd. I assisted her in recovering her cloak. I observed the prisoner's hand upon her right pocket; then he took up her petticoats, and stooped downwards. I observed him in that position, and afterwards, when the girl (the prosecutrix) ha d cried out, it was a long time before he could recover himself. The prosecutrix cried out, some person has his hands under my petticoats, this man is robbing me. Upon her saying that, I immediately seised the prisoner. He was taken to a publick-house. I had great difficulty to prevent the crowd from taking him to duck him, which I did by representing to them the impropriety of such conduct. He was searched; his money was in two different pockets. There were two half crowns found in his pocket, two new shillings, an half-penny, and a farthing. The prosecutrix owned the half-penny and the farthing. She said she believed the two half-crowns and the shillings were her's. There was a small knife found in the prisoner's pocket. The prosecutrix's pocket was produced and it appeared it had been cut. The knife was proper for such a purpose.</p>

I paid Mr. Aldridge for the mare three pounds eight shillings and three-pence, and stopped the sale of it, but did not take the mare away till the next day. When I went to fetch the mare, he said the man had been there, who said the mare was his property. I said then give me my money again, I had rather have nothing to do with it. He said, no, the man said it was his, but he had sold it to this gentleman.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the first time the conversation was with the prisoner and Wilson respecting the transaction at Doncaster? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say he bought the mare at Doncaster? - Yes, for seventeen guineas; that he had rode her all the way, and hunted with her, and she was a good mare to hunt with, and he was very sorry to part with her.</p>
               <p>What time did he say he had had her? - He did not say how long, but that he had rode her all the way from Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>What day was that? - Wednesday the 29th.</p>
               <p>Did he take upon himself and appear to you as the real owner? - Yes, and that he had the power to dispose of her as his own. I gave him half a guinea in part of the purchase; I was to bring the other guinea and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060029"/> half to the

               <p>Prisoner. Did I say I would sell the mare? - Yes. Prothero and Clark told me he offered to sell the mare to them that day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been under examinations in Bow-street. Clipson came with another man; they said they would recommend to me an attorney, Mr. Wilson. They told me they understood I had a mare at Mr. Aldridge's; they thought I might want money in the situation I was; that they would lead me any more money one the mare, if I would put it into their care for me. I told them there was a mare at Aldridge's, which I had borrowed three guineas on to pay a debt. I said if they would pay the money and take care of the mare for me, I should be obliged to them. They said they would, and asked me what I wanted. I desired them to give me half a guinea. They said they would, and gave me half a guinea, and said they would give me a guinea and an half more in the afternoon. I understand Clipson lives by going to persons in distress and doing things of this kind.</p>
               <p>To Clipson. He says Wilson first applied to him and told him he understood he had the mare at Aldridge's? - It was impossible Wilson, or I, or the attorney could know any thing of that till he was taken. Wilson was backwards with the prisoner. They came and said he had the mare to sell.</p>
               <p>From the conversation which passed did you understand that Wilson knew of the mare being at Aldridge's before he came there? - He knew nothing of it till he went in; they came out and told me of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the character of Clipson may be enquired into, whether he has not been detected in such things before. He wished to swindle me out of this mare.</p>

My father keeps a shop; he bought tea and sugar in our shop. He had been an officer in America, and was reduced on account of some misdemeanour. He behaved very honestly at Dartford for what I know.</p>

               <p>Was you frequently in his company or only when he was in the shop? - When in the shop. Sometimes I was in his company in the town when he was upon the parade.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to our house with wood on the 26th of October, I let him in. Immediately after he went I missed the watch cases; I had them in my hand when I was cheapening the wood, and had laid them down on the corner of the dresser. I missed the cases before any other person came into the house; when he was in the room with the wood I turned my back to go to the bottom of the stairs, but I was never out of the room while he was there. I went to the prisoner's house and waited for his coming home. Upon being charged with this matter he persisted in his innocence.</p>

On the 24th of November, a little after one o'clock, I lost a basket, and the things mentioned in the indictment, out of my room; while I was at dinner in my kitchen I heard a foot in the passage; upon which I looked up and saw the two prisone rs go down the steps through the garden, which is before the door. I made an alarm and sent my servant after them; I likewise pursued them down the walk and never lost sight of them till they turned the corner; I cried out stop thief! they threw the things down at the end of the row, turning down the walk; they were taken and delivered to me. The prisoners were taken immediately and were examined before a magistrate; they denied the fact. I am very sure they are the men; I know their faces perfectly.</p>

I turned into the field; there I met and stopped them; they had quitted the basket. Upon my coming up to them they both drew their knives, and with many execrations swore they would cut me down if I attempted to touch them, and they both made several blows at me with their knives, and I actually received two wounds in my hands, nevertheless I seised Bowen; upon which Clayton came up to me and struck me with his fist in the face, but did not knock me down, but he stunned me so as to make me let Bowen go, and then they both ran away. I recovered myself and pursued them, and at the end of the field again seised Bowen; then some other people came up and secured them.</p>

We talked about the different coins of money. I took out a guinea. I having drank the beer, turned the pot up and laid the guinea upon it. The prisoner immediately flew to the guinea, and chucked it into her mouth. I got hold of her by the arm, and held her till I got an officer, but I never got my guinea again.</p>

               <p>I was driven into this publick-house in order to shelter myself from the rain. I had occasion to write a letter to my mother; as I was writing this letter, this person came in, and called for a pint of beer; I finished my letter, and sealed it. He pressed me to drink, and we fell into conversation concerning the American affairs; the conversation turned on the currency of notes. The prosecutor pulled out this guinea and laid it on the bottom of the pint pot, and the prisoner immediately came and took it, and put it in her mouth.</p>

               <p>This woman asked me to come to this publick-house to fetch her things to wash; I went to the publick-house. A man was drinking with her; he asked me to drink. He pulled out something and put on the bottom of the pint pot, and said that he would shew us a trick we never saw in our lives, that it should come through the pot, and there should be no hole in the pot. As I was in the publick-house, he came to me, and said I had taken a guinea from under the pint pot. He felt in my mouth. I know nothing of it. She wanted me to wash her things for her. She had been out all night, and got her things dirty. He pulled out his watch to shew me that it went upon diamonds. I never heard such a thing in my life; I did not know what a diamond was. I had the watch several times in my hand; if I had been a thief I might have taken it; and so had the woman the watch several times.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Were there any slight-of-hand tricks done? - I know nothing about any such thing.</p>
               <p>Is it true? - No.</p>

               <p>On the 7th of November, at about twelve o'clock at noon, I went with Mr. Clarke and some more of the officers from Bow-street, to an alley near <placeName id="t17801206-38-crimeloc198">Black-boy alley</placeName>

When I opened the door and entered the yard I saw the house door immediately shut. I ran up to the door and attempted to open it but could not; I went to the window  and I heard a noise in the inside; I called to the others who were at the door to break it open for the people were making their escape; the door was very strongly fastened and they could not force it open. I threw up the sash and jumped in at the window. When I got into the room the prisoner Williams was standing by the fire; I asked her what she meant by fastening the door; she said she did not know what we wanted. I went out into the stable; there were ten cart load of rubbish at least that had been dug out of the earth. Morant in examining the stairs that go up out of the kitchen, found two of the bottom steps loose; there were an hole made at the bottom of the stairs to go under ground by lifting off these steps; I pulled off my clothes directly and went down the hole and Mr. Clark followed me. There was on the left hand of the hole a small press for cutting out blanks; there was a candle burning by it and a sheet of copper in the press; farther on in the cellar which was a hole dug on purpose; there was a large press<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060036"/> with a fly with dies in it for raising the impressions on farthings; there was another candle by that. These are the dies ( producing  them); there was a farthing between the dies finished, and a large quantity lying by in the cellar. Mr. Clark said he was sure they must be some where about. We lit a candle and examined round the cellar; Mr. Clark observed a hole under the foundation of the house farther into the ground; he called out, if there was any person in the hole they must speak and come out; there was no answer. I said take care I will fire a pistol into the hole and then they will be glad to come out. Upon that a voice very low cried out, for God's sake don't hurt me; help me out; and with a deal of difficulty we dragged Harpur out of the hole. We found in the cellar every implement for coining farthings or halfpence.</p>

               <p>I went to this house; Morant found a quantity of halfpence concealed under the floor which occasioned a closer search; at last he pulled up the bottom step of the stairs and there was a hole that went under the house fourteen feet deep, which had caused the house to sink six feet; we got down into the hole; and on the left hand there was a small press fixed for cutting out and a candle burning by it; and another press with the dies fixed and a farthing in the dies, and a candle burning; by that I was positive some persons must have made their escape, or were concealed in that place. I looked on the side of the large press and there was a hole that went into the shore; I looked there and saw the head of Mrs. Harpur, we got her out with difficulty; she had got in feet first, and that had jamm'd her clothes up to her waist, and she stuck fast; there must have been somebody at work within five minutes; the very handle of the press was warm at the time; there were places for three persons to work; one to feed the press and the others to work the fly and cut out the dies; she had on her working dress, a bed gown; her other clothes were in the parlour. We found in the parlour a die in the fire hot to strike the impression on another die.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not the working of the press very laborious and not fit for a woman? - It does not require much strength; it works round without any purchase, and the spring throws it up again. I was informed two men had made their escape.</p>

I found a parcel upon a shelf on one side of the stai rs which had been badly struck and were laid by as waste; in the two pair of stairs closet we found three pair of dies; a quantity of blanks, and the cecil they were cut out of, the whole apparatus was complete.</p>

               <p>I went to this house in Plough-court. In the cellar, at the bottom of the stairs, there was a large press fixed for stamping the impressions; and in another cellar there was a small press for cutting out the round blanks. These halfpence I found close by a water-tub, which was close to the fly. Every thing was as complete for coining halfpence as could be.</p>
               <p>When was Norton taken up? -</p>
               <p>Prothero. I met with him and took him up about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Was there any way to get into the cellar but through the house?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No. Whoever lived in that house must know that there was a large press in that cellar, for by throwing the fly, part of the wainscot in the cellar was broke out to give it room to work.</p>
               <p>What light was there in the cellar? - It is dark, but is light enough to work without a candle.</p>
               <p>Court. Could any man have taken that cellar, or these cellars of the owner of the house, for any purpose of working, or any other purpose? - There was a kind of a small kitchen and dresser, where was a quantity of dies.</p>

            . I lived at the White Bear warehouse, in Piccadilly. On the 25th of November I lost a cask of Yorkshire ale, twenty-six gallons; it was deposited at a Mr. Clark's, in James-street, who not having convenience desired me to send for it. I ordered my man to fetch the ale from Mr. Clark's; he went and brought up the cask of ale from thence. He was sent to deliver it to Mr. Withers, at the George, in the <placeName id="t17801206-40-crimeloc206">Hay-market</placeName>

I directed him to patrole on one side of the Hay-market, I was on the other; to try to discover the cask. At the end of James-street, I saw some people collected together near an hackney-coach; there I saw this cask of ale, and the people attempting to lift it up into the coach; one end of it was upon the boot. I asked what they were going to do with that ale? The coachman pointed to the prisoner and said,</p>
               <p>"that was the gentleman who employed him." I asked the prisoner what he meant to do with the ale? He wheeled round the back of the coach, and ran away. I pursued him, and cried stop thief! I never lost fight of him till he was apprehended. He fell down in Oxendon-street, there he was taken.</p>

I lost as near as I can ascertain twenty-seven pair of silk stockings on the 30th of October, I suppose them to be worth twelve pounds. At about five o'clock in the afternoon I went out of my shop with an intention to stay in the parlour adjoining to the shop; I left a man behind the counter; I charged him not to go out of the shop without calling me. Contrary to my order, a quarter of an hour after I had been in the parlour, he went into the yard as I have since learned. I heard a noise, I did not go out immediately, supposing my man to be in the shop. Some time after when I went out I saw the prisoner Madan in my shop; I asked him</p>

               <p>Were any stockings found upon the prisoner Madan? - No; nor have we found any since.</p>

             came in and asked for a pair of silver knee buckles; I had three drawers of silver buckles out, shewing these two men. While they were looking at them, Bailey came and asked to see some steel knee buckles. While I was serving the two men with the silver buckles; the one not present, said he had rather have plated buckles; I put the drawer with the silver buckles on one side, and took out a drawer with the plated buckles. I agreed with Madan for a pair of knee buckles at 6 s. 6 d. Then I agreed with the other for a pair of silver-knee buckles; they wanted each of them change for a guinea, which must have been to prolong the time; I sent the child out for change for a guinea; and by that time the middle boy turned out of the shop; I observed he had something in his hands behind him under his coat; I said to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060042"/> Cheetham where is the person gone, I will serve him; Chteeham ran after him to call him and came no more back; and by that time the two men had got their change for the guineas. When they had got the change they all of them went out; as soon as they were gone out I saw a drawer open which was at the other count er, in which the four gold chains and thirty-six gold rings were kept; I went to the drawer and missed four gold chains and thirty-six fancy rings of different devices. Upon missing them I called the pastry cook's people opposite into the shop and pursued. We have never got any of them again.</p>
               <p>When did you last see them in the drawer? - Not a minute before the prisoners came in I had the gold chains in my hand.</p>
               <p>Did you see either of the three prisoners, or the other man go to the other counter? - While I was serving the men, Cheetham stood with his hands behind him and his back to the other counter.</p>
               <p>These people did not come in all together? - No; the man not present came in first; Madan next; and the two boys directly one after another; but they did not appear to know one another, except the two boys.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay in the shop? - About six minutes; we soon agreed for what they cheapened.</p>
               <p>Did any other person come into the shop while they were there? - No other person.</p>
               <p>Does your shop open into a back room or parlour? - Yes, a parlour.</p>
               <p>Was there any person in that room? - No; nor in the house.</p>
               <p>Were was the little girl while you was serving them, and Cheetham stood with his back to the other counter? - She was then gone out for change for a guinea; Bailey came up to them to see what they were a buying I did not observe him before; then Bailey went out of the shop. They all three stood before me and Cheetham was behind them at the other counter.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the goods you lost? - Between thirty and forty pounds. Madan looked at me, I suppose to see if I observed the boy; he looked at me more than he did at the things he was buying. As soon as they went out I missed the goods; it struck me they were all connected. They all went towards Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>For form sake I must ask you whose property these goods were? - Mr. Story's; he keeps a shop for the sale of these kind of things.</p>

On the 31st of October, between five and six in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house for a gallon of beer; he said it was for Mr. Williams, in Steward's-rents. He said he would pay for the beer and take it with him; he did, and had a quart pot to drink it in. I sent my boy to follow him.</p>

               <p>Between five and six, I met Ibbetson's boy by Lincoln's-Inn-fields, following the prisoner. He said that man had some beer, and his master wanted him to follow him, and see where he carried the pots to. In the fields he threw all the beer out. I followed him to Weston's Park, there I stopped him, and asked him what he was going to do with the pots; he struck me, and a scuffle ensued. A mob gathering about, I took him into the Sun ale-house, and sent for Mr. Ibbetson.</p>
               <p>(The pots were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I live in Weston's Park. I had paid for the beer and was taking it home. I was in liquor; I mentioned a wrong name by mistake. This man came up and knocked me down, and said I was going to steal the pots. He struck me and I struck him again. It is not reasonable I should pay fourteen-pence for beer to throw it into the street. If I had sold the pots I suppose I should not have got so much for them.</p>

A child found a pawnbroker's duplicate of a sheet, in the room where she lay; that gave me a suspicion of her. I went to Justice Wright and got a warrant against her and another servant of mine, and a Mrs. Riley, whose name was on the ticket. When the constable came I went down to the prisoner to know if she knew a Mrs. Riley, and finding she did, I took her only up. The sheet I had found the ticket of was not marked. The pawnbroker, after she was committed, found out another sheet, and a spoon, which she acknowledged she had pawned.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made to induce her to confess? - I promised before the justice, the first time, if she would confess to all the things I would not prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Did she own to the spoon before or after you made the promise? - Afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did she acknowledge any thing before you made the promise? - She said before the promise, that she had only pawned one sheet.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things found? - Only the two sheets and one tea-spoon. I missed at different times nine sheets, two table-spoons, four tea-spoons, and three table-cloths.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were in the house when she came to live with you? - Yes. About a fortnight before the linen was right, all but one table cloth.</p>

She desired me to carry it to the pawnbroker's for her, and she would have it out in a few days. I pawned it for six shillings, and gave her the money.</p>

               <p>"thing." He then said, other people had been robbed, that he was going farther, and he went away. I sent for Mr. Townsend, a magistrate, to my house, who discovered that Hunsdon was the receiver of these fish. The prisoners were taken up by the information of one Mitchell: They were brought before Mr. Townsend, and charged with stealing these fish. Hetherington said he was guilty.</p>
               <p>Did you make either of them any promise that you would not prosecute them if they confessed? - No, I never saw them till they were brought before Mr. Townsend.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by Mr. Townsend to induce them to confess? - No.</p>
               <p>You accused them of stealing your fish? - Yes, by the information of Mitchell; I found part of a letter of Hetherington's on my premisses; I charged Hetherington before the magistrate, and he confessed taking the fish. Sorrell said that he was with Hetherington and Mitchell. I found some fish on the premisses of Hunsdon, which I thought were mine, but I will not swear to fish.</p>
               <p>When was the last time you lost fish? - I think on the 5th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How large is the bason in which the fish were kept? - Larger than the middle of this place.</p>
               <p>Is it paved at the bottom? - It is not, it is a very muddy bottom.</p>
               <p>Are there no other but gold and silver fish? - I believe there are tench, I have tried to take the tench.</p>
               <p>You lost fish, you do not know that they were stolen, only by the information of Mitchell? - Yes, a great many had been drawn out on the grass, and trodden to pieces.</p>
               <p>You could not pick out your little Neptune among this parcel? - I believe I could. Some of them sell for five shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman TOWNSEND sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a magistrate for the county of Middlesex. These men were brought before me, in consequence of a warrant issued against them on a charge of stealing these fish. Immediately as the prisoners came in they confessed themselves guilty. Hetherington said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060046"/> I have been exceeding guilty, every thing that falls upon me I deserve. He said Sorrell was drawn in by him and by Hunsdon, who was to receive the fish. The evidence of the time when they stole the fish was doubtful. Hetherington  said to Sorrell, You cannot forget the day, it was the day after the great storm; that was, I believe, the night of the 15th or 16th. He further confessed, that he had been there several times before with other people; that he got 80 one night, 30 another, and so on. Sorrell said the bladder was hung upon the tree, and he put the fish into it himself: He said the evidence was more outrageous than the others; that he got into the tree, and shook down the apples; upon which he said to him, You rascal, what are you about? Do you want to make a noise, to cause a discovery?</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said to induce them to confess the fact? - There was not.</p>
               <p>(The prisoners left their defence to their counsel.)</p>

               <p>I am one of the officers belonging to Shadwell, and attend the Rotation-office. I met a woman, who gave me information that work was carrying on at Sheen's; I went to the house, which is in <placeName id="t17801206-52-crimeloc268">Farthing-fields</placeName>

Mr. Farrell, Mr. Elbey, Mr. Cole, and myself went together to the house; the front windows towards the street were shut up; there is a back room on the same floor; there are lodgers up stairs; there is an entry to the house; the back door of the house was open, we got in at that into the entry; there was a large hole in the door of the back room, which comes into the entry, the door was locked. It was about one o'clock when we went. Through that hole I saw Small and Lovell up towards the windows, their backs were towards me; I could observe they were very busy doing something, but I could not tell what; in less than half a minute Sheen came from the fore room into the back room (the two rooms opened into one another) as soon as I saw Sheen come out of the fore room into the back room, he came to the door, and said, who is there?</p>
               <p>He did not see you, did he? - No, but I suppose he heard the noise of our feet in the passage; knowing his voice, we directly broke open the door, and secured him, for fear he should have any fire-arms; we were not a minute securing him; the door and the bed join together in the back room; we broke the door open; Sheen directly threw himself upon the bed, and there we tied him.

             afterwards found 20 or 30 counterfeit shillings upon the bed; I left him safe; then Lovell threw this glove down, and ran into the fore room; the fore room stunk of aqua fortis enough to knock one down, there was half a butter firkin full of it; I heard some metal chink; I went into the fore room, and brought Lovell out into the back room. When I was in the back room I said to Mr. Farrell,</p>
               <p>"There is a great quantity of bad money in the fore room." He said,</p>
               <p>"Do not touch it till I come." I left it for him to take up. I found in the glove four sixpences and two bad shillings; at the same place where the woman was, I found this phial of aqua fortis; in the back room I found another phial of aqua fortis, this scouring-paper, and some metal; under the window there was a sort of dresser, where the women were, which I imagine they had been at work upon. Here is some metal, some pummice-stone, and something they run ingots into. I picked these two shillings and a six-pence from the floor where the women were; I heard them drop, but cannot tell who threw them down. Here is some metal which has been used.</p>

After we had got them all secured, we brought Sheen up to the public-house; Farrel and three or four of us were obliged to hold him while we searched him; we found about 50 s. in his breeches; that was about two hours after we had apprehended him; but we kept his hands tied, so that he could not get rid of the 50 s. While we were busy with Sheen, Lovell made her escape out of the room where we were; Cole and I pursued her, and took her in the necessary; Mr. Cole caught hold of Small's hands, and brought her to us; her hands were as green as grass, and black, as if she had been at work at the money; I examined Lovell, her hands were nothing like that. Here is a receipt I took off the file of

               <p>I went to this house in Farthing-fields with Forrester and the other officers. When we went into the passage we saw a hole in the door; Forrester and I looked through this hole and saw the two women with their backs to us very busy rubbing something, but what I cannot say Sheen came the to door and asked who was there? Knowing his voice we broke the door open; and Elbey secured him. I took hold of Small, upon which she let some thing fall out of her hand; I called to Forrester to pick them up; it was two shillings and a bad sixpence. The middle of her hand was as yellow as gold, and her fingers as black as ink. Farrell said</p>
               <p>"you cannot deny this,</p>
               <p>"Forrester has the two shillings and sixpence."</p>

               <p>That is what is commonly used to produce the colour of silver? - For these fourteen years no other expedient has been used, as has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060048"/> appeared in this court, to produce the colour; they put them into aqua fortis and water; it comes out black; they then scour the piece with sand which makes it white. This dust appears to have been filed off the edges of some of them; (looks at the half crown) This is of the colour of silver; it is forced to the surface by aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Do all the implements produced make it complete for this business? - Yes; they do.</p>
               <p>Is this the prisoner's house? - I believe the landlord is here.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said it was his house.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner came to our house on the 6th of November, to lodge in the one-pair-of-stairs room. On the 10th of November there being some workmen in the house. I put my shoes and buckles in his room on the bed; he was at home that afternoon backwards and forwards. I came home about ten o'clock, and sent the maid into the room for the shoes and buckles. She said she could not find them. The prisoner was then in the parlour; she saw a hat under the bed, which had been in the box before, and the lace stripped off; I suspected the men who had been at work, and would have gone after them, but was advised not; and the prisoner in particular, put his hand upon my shoulder and advised me not to go after them. That night about ten o'clock, I went up for the child's gown, which was kept in an open drawer in his room; that was gone. I went up stairs to to a band-box, where the cloaks were kept; and they were gone. I came down and said I believed they would take every thing in the house; and wished to bring them to punishment. The prisoner said, if you took the persons and got the things again, I dare say you will not punish them. The next day I suspected the prisoner; I had him taken up. I went up stairs with him; and he said, if I would have patience he would give me an account where all the things were; and I found them at several pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>The night the accident happened I slept in the house opposite, in the first floor. I was waked with something flung against the window; at the same time I heard somebody fall on the ground. Then I heard the prisoner say, Logan, he is dead, he is dead! he has thrown himself out of the window!</p>
               <p>What time of the night was that? - I cannot tell. A little after the accident happened and the young man (the deceased) was taken into the house; the watchman called two o'clock. I jumped out of bed almost instantly, and went to the window and saw Dilley at the door with his clothes on.</p>
               <p>He appeared to be dressed as he usually was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you enter into any conversation with Dilley? - No. I looked out at the window some time and heard the young man groan twice. Dilley went from the door up the lane, and the young man they call Logan, came down.</p>
               <p>Was Dilley in the street almost as soon as you heard something fall? - I suppose it was not above the space of a minute at the outside.</p>
               <p>You do not know what time of the night it was? - No.</p>
               <p>(There being no other evidence in support of the indictment, the prisoner was not put on his defence.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of November about half after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner, and another person, who had very much the appearance of a gentleman, came into the warehouse to me at the Castle and Falcon; they asked me if the Nottingham waggon went from thence? I told them it did not; I believed it went from the Bell, in Wood-street, but was not certain. I had no suspicion from their appearance, therefore did not narrowly watch them. I believe I might turn round to the desk again, and did not look at them all the while they were in the warehouse. They hesitated a little and then asked me some more questions. I turned again to look at them; I missed the prisoner out of the warehouse; the other was there. I was going to step to the door to see where the prisoner was; the other rather put himself in my way to hinder me.</p>
               <p>You had some little suspicion when you missed the prisoner? - It might be more curiosity than suspicion. When the other put himself in my way, that gave me a suspicion; I believe the person who was left in the warehouse said something to me as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060050"/> passed him; I got to the door and saw the prisoner going down the yard with two boxes tied together in his hand. I catched him by the collar and asked where he was going with the boxes? To the best of my remembrance his answer was, to the Bull and Mouth. When I had got him by the collar Mr. Harris and Mr. Mott came up. I delivered the prisoner into their care. They took the boxes into the warehouse; they were two little boxes tied together, and directed to Mr. Barker of Grantham; I had seen them in the warehouse not many minutes before; they were within two yards of me. The prisoner was taken into the tap-room. When the constable came the boxes were delivered into his care.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you recollect I bid you a good night, and you bid me good night? - I recollect no such thing.</p>
               <p>How long was he in the warehouse? - I fancy not five minutes.</p>
               <p>(The boxes were produced in court by the constable, and deposed by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Mott seems much enraged, because he has been hurt in losing a deal of property; I myself am innocent of what I am charged with; I went into the warehouse to ask a question; when I came out I bid Mr. Foy good-night (it is impossible for a person to take two such boxes out of such a warehouse undiscovered) when I came out they lay in my way; I moved them, as any body else might have done.</p>
