One of them came just before me, and stopped me; I do not remember he said any thing to me; the prisoner came on my right-side, and took my handkerchief out of my pocket, I saw him take it, and endeavoured to catch at it, upon which he threw it to another of them, and it fell to the ground. The Man had an oaken stick with a tuck in it, he pointed the tuck to my breast, that I should not take it up; then he took it up on the point of his tuck, and I turned about and took it off the spear. While I was turning about, the prisoner got hold of my watch-chain. He pulled it with such force, that the chain broke at the swivel. I catched it in my hand; he run down Queen-street, the other three run cross the way, I did not observe them how they got off; I cried out stop thief, and run after the prisoner to the bottom of Pancras-lane, and there I laid hold of him. I carried him to the Counter, and the next morning he was brought before Alderman Whitaker, and he committed him to Newgate. The prisoner was never out of my sight till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this about their stopping you in Cheap-side.</p>
               <p>Lee. About a minute, or a minute and half, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the person that took the chain and the handkerchief out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Lee. I am very certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Cheapside, the gentleman turned about, and found his handkerchief on the ground; I went by, he called out stop thief, I was taken hold on: before the Alderman he could not swear I took the watch-chain.</p>

I at last went to her, and said, if she would not go to bed, and cease this noise, I would charge the watch with her; the other two chairmen that were drinking with him, paid their reckoning, and went away, and left the prisoner and his wife together: she staid about a quarter of an hour scolding at him, at last she went out at the house-door, and he followed her: they had not been out of the house above a minute, but she returned with her hand to her neck, and said she was hurt. I saw the blood run over her hand, she sat down on a form, she took her hand and apron from her neck, and I saw the blood fly out of her neck. I went to the door, and the prisoner was sitting by the watchman on the bench; I told him what he had done, saying, you have murdered your wife: says he, I have not; he and the watchman came in where she was: so I charged the watchman with him, the house was full of people, and I did not hear what she said.

She came to my house on the Tuesday after; but I was busy, and never spoke to her; she went up stairs to change her clothes, and desired me to bail her husband the prisoner out of the Gate-house.

On the 13th of May, about ten a clock at night, I happened to be drinking a pint of beer in this house, I saw the deceased strike the prisoner several times on his head and shoulders; he appeared very good-humoured, and did not strike her, as I saw. He desired her to go to bed, she would not: she went out of the door, and he followed her; she returned in about a minute's time with her hand up to her neck; I did not perceive the blood at that time; she cried out, the rogue shall not murder me: she took her hand from her neck, and I saw the blood spout out of it; he came in a little time after, and the people told him, he had murdered his wife, and would be hanged; he sat down on a bench, and smiled, and said, he did not care, he was glad of it. The landlord took hold of him, and asked if he had got a knife about him. The prisoner said he had got never a one. I saw the landlord take the knife out of the prisoner's breeches pocket, I took it out of the landlord's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it bloody?</p>
               <p>Daliey. It was a little bloody, it was fresh blood being moist, I put the knife in my pocket, and paid my reckoning, and went out of the house.

            . On the Sunday in the afternoon the deceased was brought to St. George's hospital, I examined her, and found a wound on the right side of her neck, it had been dressed by a Surgeon the day before; and as the woman seemed in very good health, and no bad symptoms, I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174907050004"/> not remove the dressings that day; but in dressing it the next day, I found the wound pretty deep, but I did not apprehend it to be mortal then: she continued seemingly in very good health till Friday morning, and eat the common diet as is there allowed: she was then seized suddenly with a fit, was never sensible afterwards, and died the Sunday following. The reason of her having this fit I apprehend was owing to the violent passion she threw herself in for the concern of her husband being in prison, as she had shewed a great concern for him all the time she had been in the Hospital; she once asked me to sign a note, to get him released out of prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this wound she had received on her neck, was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Maplethorp. I believe the bad consequences that followed the wound, were the occasion of her death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been married to the deceased about four years; she was a very honest woman; she was given to a glass of liquor. I came into my landlord's house with two men with me on the 13th of May. My wife abused me with her tongue, calling me many names, and beat me: she was very passionate, and said she would go away. I said she should not go away: I flung the knife out of my hand, but did not think of hurting so much as a dog or cat: she said she was hurt, and I was committed to the Gate-house; she sent me eighteen pence, knowing I had no money, and she sent word, she would come and get me out on the Tuesday following; she came, and called for a tankard of beer, and we drank it together; she paid for it, and gave me six-pence, and said it was she herself that was to blame; after we desired God to bless each other, she went to the Hospital directly.</p>

They sat down and eat their salmon, they sat till such time the house was clear, there were none left but the people that lodged in the house, I went backward, in the mean time they called for the reckoning; as I was coming in at the door, one of them, that is, Fryer, held a sixpence to me, two of them got to the door, and held it open; as he paid me he put his hand behind me where the tankard stood. A witness that is here cried out stop the boy, he has got the tankard; he pushed out of the house, I ran after him, and saw the bottom-edge of the tankard; he ran one way, and the others another, and, it being dark, we could not take any of them; we found one of their hats, but never found the tankard; it was the same tankard they had been drinking out of. I employed two or three people to look about for them, and one day last week one of the witnesses brought Shepherd to me.

No, said they; Fryer called to pay, I went to him, the tankard was standing by him: says I, here are 2 tankards scored, I apprehend that is all; he gives Mrs. Vandome 6 d. out of his right-hand, and I observed he had his hat betwixt his legs in his left-hand; at the very moment the land-lady open'd the door, that moment he took the tankard, and went by her.

            . I lived with the prisoner six years, he is a very honest man. I was present when the accident happen'd; I was not his servant then, I was there for a pint of beer; I was standing upon the stairs, and I heard the prisoner say, let any man open the door upon his peril. Mr. Smith said, he would do for him presently, he would have a baily there in half an hour's time; he pushed open the door with his hand, the prisoner met him, and fetched a blow at him; but I saw no weapen he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know the prisoner guilty of passion?</p>
               <p>Christian. No, I never did. I know this Smith has been a great enemy to him, and has troubled him many times.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think might be the reason of his thus using the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Christian. I believe he was greater with the prisoner's wife than he should be.</p>

I laid hold of her to secure her; one of the men that was with her put my hand from her, and gave her a slight blow on the shoulders says he, let the bitch alone, she is only drunk; she immediately turned up a court, and the men stood before me, to prevent my following her; I went immediately over the way into a public house, the master of the house, and several more, came out.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I happened to be coming by at that time, being a little way up the Court, I heard somebody cry, stop thief! I happen'd to light of the wig that lay there; there were two men laid hold of me, I knew nothing of the wig.</p>

I said to Mr. Neal these two fellows have got each a load which seem not to be their own; let us stop them and enquire whether they came honestly by them or not. We went after them and stop'd them, and ask'd them if the goods were their own; they said they had them in Spittlefields; one of them said they were going with them to Limehouse-hole; the other said they were going to Black-wall; said I, we shall stop you on suspicion that you have not come honestly by them; I went for a constable, and desired Mr. Neal and the other person to take charge of them. I went and brought an Officer and a Watchman; they were gone with the bundles and Mr. Neal followed them, so we went down to Limehouse Hole to see if they were gone there: we saw a person at the plying place who told us there were no such persons come that way; we all three went back again, and Mr. Neal's wife came and told us they had charg'd Mr. Neal with hindering them in their passage, and he had charg'd the Constable with them: This was in Ratcliff high-way, I went to them, and we had them before Justice Rickets, and he sent them to Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>

I saw the wound on her neck, I put my hand upon it, and called for a Doctor or Surgeon; the wind and blood coming out so fast, she died directly. Her throat and wind-pipe were cut a-cross, almost from ear to ear: said I, you rogue, do not stir, she is dead, and you shall be hanged; I got hold of him, and took the knife out of his hand. I was obliged to strike him twice before I could get it out of his hand. [The knife was shewed in Court, a case-knife with a round point.] here is the blood on it, his hands trembled, and he swore and curs'd. He said, he did the thing, and he did not want to go off; saying, he would be hang'd first. He was not at all daunted at the thing. The next day he said he was willing to die for it.</p>

            . I am the constable. When we took the prisoner before the Justice, he there had nothing to say in his own defence. He signed his own confession, and I carried him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home from the West-Indies in a Man of War, I lodged in Mr. Murray's house, my wife came from Bristol to me. I went and took a room, we lived together 8 or 9 weeks; I got a voyage to the Northward, my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174907050010"/> wife was agreeable, when I was going away: said Mr. Murray, I should be very welcome to let my wife be there till I came back; I thought it would save expences. When I returned, I found the strangest alteration, she looked quite cold and black upon me, in private she would use me very barbarously. On the Friday-night before this happened, I took her to task, saying, What is the Reason of this alteration? She called me Old Dog, and hit me a blow on my mouth, and made my nose bleed. Betwixt 4 and 5 o'clock next morning she got up, and swore (I never heard her swear before) she would never lie in a bed with me more, saying, she would go out of the house or I should. I did not come down stairs till about two hours afterwards; when I came down, I asked her the reason of her usage last night? I kick'd her back-side two or three times, saying, I have a good mind to turn you out of the house (she encouraged that very boy to use me ill, and all the people of the house looked black upon me.) The man of the house came down, and said, I desire none of this; if she is your wife, she is my servant. I went out, and staid till about 6 o'clock. I desired, at my return, to be reconciled: she bid me be gone, and said, I should not lie in a bed where she lay: said I, then go and get my things; she went very willingly up stairs, and tied my things up, (this was about ten o'clock) and came and perfectly shoved me out of the house, I thought it was a folly to return. I went on board the vessel, and related the story to an acquaintance there; he desired me to go and be reconciled. The tide served, I took a wherry, and all my clothes, and came to the back-door, I believe, about half an hour after 3 o'clock in the morning. I knocked there, and put my clothes upon a place; I said to a man, I desire you will take care of these things, and I will satisfy you, while I go up street to see for a house open; I found one, and went in, and called for a pint of beer. When I returned, the man and things were gone: I asked people after them, but could not hear of them. The things were taken in by my wife, she opened the door, and looked earnestly at me, then she shut it, and would not let me in; so I knocked at the door, and no door opened. I went away to the house where I came from, and staid there till about eight o'clock. When I came in, I asked every body about the things, no-body knew any thing of them. I did not see my wife till a good while after; at last I saw her, and ask'd her about the things: she said, D - n you, I know no business you, or your things, have here. Do you think, said I, I will go away without letting the world know the reason? besides, I owe the landlord money, and I shall pay him before I go away. When she came into the kitchen, it was to toast a bit of bread upon the point of that knife. I leaned my back against the bench, and talked to her very seriously; she told me, she wanted no discourse with me. I desired to make it up, and went to salute her; she clapped both her hands against me, and pushed me away, and then took the knife, and flung it at me with all the violence in life. I catched up the knife, and fetched a stroke at her, and knew not where she was cut; she started and run from me: I looked after her, and saw her drop. I never offered to run away.</p>

            . I was constable the 23d of June. I heard a screaming in the street, I listened to it, in about two minutes I heard it repeated, and also they called out for the watch; as I was unbolting the door I saw two men run by me very swiftly; as soon as I got out of the watch house, the prosecutor was at the end of the lane without hat or wig, in looking about we found the prosecutor's wig, and, in the kennel, we found a sort of a crab-stick; while we were thus searching the street, word was brought me, one of the fellows was taken; I would have prevailed upon the prosecutor to have gone down to the watch-house; he was so much surprised he would not, but went home. Upon my returning to the watch-house, Mr. Priest, the prisoner, and two of our watchmen were there. Mr. Priest gave a particular account how he saw Mr. Hane pursuing to the end of the Lane, and how he took him; giving the same account he does now. I examined the prisoner of his being there, and his running away in that manner? His answer was, he saw a riot and quarrel, and he was afraid of being drawn into it. I then asked him, Who he was, or what he was? he gave me no satisfactory answer as to his character; I searched him, and found as before mentioned. I found a pocket-book in his jacket, in which was his discharge from the King's service. I carried him to the Counter; the next morning he was examined by Alderman Winterbottom; he was there asked, why he run away, if he was an innocent person? his answer was, He heard there had been a robbery, and he ran away fearing he should be taken up by the watch. The Alderman told him, if he was an innocent person he ought to have gone and assisted the person robbed.</p>

            . The 23d of June, about half an hour after eleven, I saw three men in Swithin's lane standing up at Alderman Atkins's door, I knocked at our gate, and called our watchman out; I took a particular notice of the three men: as to the man's face, I can say nothing to it; but, as to his size and dress, I think the prisoner at the bar was one of them; this was about four minutes before the cry of Stop thief , &amp;c. As soon as the out-cry was made, we came to the gate, and saw two fellows run up the lane; they, I look upon, to be the other two men, they ran towards Lumbard-street. I went next morning to the Poultry-Counter, and took two men with me, to whom I had given the description, and looked on the prisoner, and found he answered to the description I had given. I then did, and still think, he was one of the three men I saw standing there.</p>

I seized her by the skirt of the coat at the stair-foot, and said, Young gentleman, where are you going? When I examined her, she said she was over-persuaded to rob her master when she got settled, and she was to meet the person that gave her that advice at Hornsey; she had got the two linnen shirts, the handkerchief, and a piece of linnen-cloth in a bundle: she gave very little account of herself, and said, she was very sorry for what she had done.

I went there to dine, and having sat down a little while, my servant coming out of the kitchen with some table-beer, saw a man running out at the door; i. e called out and immediately run into the fore-parlour and cry'd out, the plate is all gone, and immediately run out at the door, and I after her, the turning being so short he was got out of sight; I went through the King's-head tavern into the middle of Holborn, there I stood about a minute looking to see for a man running, and I saw the prisoner cross over to go into Gray's-inn-lane; he made a stop and saw me, and immediately took to his heels, that gave me a suspicion he must be the man: he running made me run, I pursued him down Gray's-inn-lane, he ran into a court, and a woman said, there is a man gone up the court. I ran to the farther end of it, I saw no body: said another woman there is a man in a brown coat gone into that house; as soon as I came to the door the prisoner was coming down the stairs again; I laid fast hold of him by the collar, saying, I have caught you, and guilt appear'd in his face immediately. I said, sirrah, you have robb'd me: he was in a great flutter, he denied he knew any thing of it, so I was pulling him from the house in order to put him in a coach, and a person near us saw something shine in his hand, who said, he has got a pen-knife in his hand, which, when we took them out of his hand were two of my silver salt-shovels; said I, whatever you brought in that bundle must be in this house. His excuse for running was, that he saw a man running in the street, and he ran after him; said I, where had you these two silver shovels? he said, the man drop'd them upon the stairs, and I took them up. I had him before the Justice and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174907050015"/> committed him, and there he told the same story. When I was gone to Justice Fielding's there were three or four neighbours staid about the door where I took him, they search'd and found the plate in the house, ( it is in court, and the witness that found it.) I cannot swear to the prisoner's face, but I can say it was such a man which I saw in Gray's-inn-lane, with a brown coat on, and something in a bundle, and I can swear to the size of the man: this is the apron that was tied about him, which the plate was found in. The plate was in the Buffet at the time I removed out of the fore-parlour to the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant were you from him when you saw him in Holborn?</p>
               <p>Jackson. About the length of Middle-row.</p>
               <p>( Cross exam in'd)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go out of your house?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any view from the fore-parlour to the back-parlour?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to run into Holborn, when you say you did not see which way the prisoner went?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Mr. Hudson the Counsel, whose house is opposite to my door, he and his mother seeing the maid and I run out, Sir, said they, there is a man in brown cloaths run under the arch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any out-cry?</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Jackson; I had seen the prisoner for three days before about our windows, he has often look'd in, and when he has seen me look at him then he would turn his back and lean on a post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the day the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Mason. I saw him go out of the house that day, and I knew him when I saw him there to be the same. I had seen about the window; he was always in one dress.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this robbery committed?</p>
               <p>Mason. About half an hour after two I was coming out of the cellar with some beer, and saw him as I got on the top of the stairs going out of the door; I run into the fore-parlour and miss'd the plate: I called out to my master, my master and I run, but I did not see him 'till he was taken, and then I said I would swear to him.</p>
               <p>(Cross examined.)</p>

We carried him to a publick house, I got a candle and looked about: there was an old woman came down stairs and said there had been a man up stairs.

She took it out, then I put my hand over; said I, here is either plate or China, for it jingles; there I found this apron and plate, some in it and some out, and brought it to Mr. Jackson's house.</p>

There was a cutter came ashore with about ten ton of goods, tea and other things; the tea was packed up in oil-skin bags containing 25 pounds a bag; I saw the prisoner there, he had a brace of pistols and a carbine or blunderbuss; I saw him at work with others in landing and loading the tea: when the custom-house officers came there were three pieces fir'd, then they drew up 12 in a rank; he was then amongst the horses loading them, I saw him carrying the tea away, he drove 3 horses from the beech, there were above fifty horses went away loaded, the prisoner went into the rank the second firing; there were I believe 60 or 70 pieces discharg'd by the smuglers.</p>

            . I remember this 30th of March there were near sixty persons arm'd, the prisoner had a brace of pistols and a carbine or blunderbuss, I know not which; there was a cutter lying off there call'd the Old Molly, there was tea brought on shore from on board her in oilskin bags, about the quantity of eight ton; I saw the prisoner help load the horses, and drive some before him from the beech; I was just gone away as the custom-house officers came, but heard the firing at a distance.</p>

            . I remember this gang of smuglers very well, there must be upwards of fifty; I am a custom-house officer, I went down with the other officers: I believe there were five or six and twenty arm'd when we came down, and about 12 or 14 fired upon us at first. There were about 18 or 20 custom-house officers of us, and some country-people to assist us; we got behind a marsh wall, then we fired at them, and they fired at us, I believe upwards of seventy pieces; they gave ground, and at last drop'd their goods, and went away two or three upon a horse; the prisoner rode by me with a man behind him; the man had a pistol in his hand without hat or wig; the prisoner had a brass piece flung behind him, he was on a bayish horse; we made a seizure of upwards of 3000 weight of tea, there were some half anchors of brandy, some cambrick and a deal of old cloaths, and some rack that I suppose came from the Indies.</p>
               <p>Jervice Cooper. I am a custom-house officer, I was there when this seisure was made; there were 60 or 70 of the smuglers, and many gone away loaded before we came; we took some of their arms and 3664 pounds weight of tea in the usual paccage of uncustomed goods, and some other goods. I did not know one person there.</p>

I paid him the money, and bid him witness it; he wrote his name on the top. I said that was not sufficient; he desired I would write again, and he would witness it to my desire.</p>

            . The 20th of September the prisoner came down to Portsmouth, and came on board the Nottingham, she enquired if any there belonged to Dublin, I gave her some gin slip, she pleaded poverty, saying, she had no money to pay for her lodging, I gave her a shilling, and sent her on shore. We agreed to live together. I took lodgings the latter end of October; I gave her money to purchase goods for me; the first thing bought was a bed cost 50 s. an iron grate, 28 s. 6 d. fire-tongs, poker, tea-kettle, warming-pan and stewpan, 12 plates, 4 pewter-dishes, 7 chairs, a table, a large looking-glass, 4 harrateen curtains and 2 blankets.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lose these things?</p>
               <p>Kelley. On the 20th of March she desired me to go to Deptford to fetch a pig, and we were to get some peas and make it fat; and while I was gone, she got assistance, and carried away all my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did this woman come to you by?</p>
               <p>Kelley. She said her name was Kelley, and she was glad to meet with any of the name out of the country.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I took the room, and paid quarterly for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with your desire the prisoner should take the room?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. We went for man and wife, and lived together as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, tell your aunt you were married?</p>
               <p>Kelley. She passed for my wife; but I never owned her as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you contented she should pass for your wife?</p>

            . The first time I saw the prisoner and prosecutor was in Christmas holy-days; they that time seem'd to take a liking to me and my wife; they have din'd together divers times in my house, and seem'd to be agreeable one with another, but I did not know where they lived; they sold fish, and were pretty customers as they pass'd and repass'd: I do not know whether they are man and wife. One night in particular I heard him say, my dear, go home and make the bed, and I'll not be long before I am with you: after bail was given in the woman was released, and Mr. Kelley and she have come to my house three or four times and have eat and drank together. I took upon me once to talk to Mr. Kelley, for charging the prisoner with a robbery and now to be so free with her; speaking broken Irish, h e said he had no intention to prosecute, or any thing of that nature.</p>

            . Mr. Kelley came to me the beginning of last October to invite me to his wedding dinner, to a house the corner of Prince's-street. I went in the evening, and there was a very great supper.</p>
               <p>Cross examin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any entertainment?</p>
               <p>Stiles. Yes, and dancing too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon them to be man and wife then?</p>
               <p>Stiles. They appeared so to me.</p>
               <p>A witness. Mrs. Kelley came to bring me a gown to make, and told me it was to be her wedding-gown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174907050019"/> and both he and she ask'd me to cometo their house on such a day, saying they should be married that day: I went, there was much victuals, and we were very merry and dancing. One morning after this he came to our house, I ask'd how she did; he seem'd much disturb'd, and desir'd me to go and see her, which I did, and found her with black eyes: she told me he gave them to her; they had fish for dinner; he fed her as she lay in the bed, and said he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they no words about Smith then?</p>
               <p>Witness. There was something said about him.</p>

            . The boy that was robb'd is my own sister's son. A woman brought him to me about nine in the morning, on the 15th of June, saying, she found him crying in the Fleet-market, without breeches and one stocking; the boy telling the woman he had an uncle in town, and the place where he lived; she brings the boy to me, having bought, with the money she has got him, an old pair of breeches and an odd stocking.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174907050020"/> After the boy had told me all his misfortune, I took him up Chick-lane to the turning into Black-boy-alley, I turned in, and came to a place where lay some rubbish, the boy observed some high steps, says he, I remember them, it goes into a court where Williams's mother lives, where I left my bundle. I set him foremost, he points with his finger, saying, that is the door. I went and fetched some persons to my assistance, and also a constable, and likewise sent to Justice Hole, to take out a Search-warrant. We found the house just as the boy had described it: we went to William's door; there was no-body at home. The landlord of the house living in the court, said, he could unlock the door; he did so, we searched, and found one shirt of the boy's under the woman's bed; this was in Black-boy alley. After the boy had described the thieves, said the landlord, come into my house, and they'll be all in the court presently; the prisoner was the first that came, said the boy, that is he that called himself the Jockey, (this was about 2 o'clock) he said, he wanted Ned. Williams, for he had stripped a country boy last night, saying they found him at Cow-cross; he also said before the Justice, he had six shillings of the money: then came Mrs. Williams very drunk, she was so noisy, that we could no longer keep her silent: her boy sent us wrong to find the others, viz. to the Golden-key in Rag-fair, and we found afterwards he was to have met them at the Golden-key on Saffron-hill.</p>

Mr. Baxter came within about a quarter of an hour after he was taken, and then said he was positive the prisoner was one of the men that stop'd him.</p>

As I was coming up Mincing-lane this same night between eleven and twelve, I heard the cry at the top of the lane, stop thief! and this man at the bar came full tilt against me; I took hold of him by the collar and tript him up; and in less than a minute there came another, and he let fly a pistol; he had not an opportunity to turn about before he fir'd, so did no hurt: the prisoner said, I am no way concerned; said I, then you are the better off; so I deliver'd him to the watchman and constable; I know the prisoner to be the man I took.</p>

I went down the New-market, they follow'd me, and seem'd to be going up ow-hill, so I went Chick-lane way, and stopping to make water at the upper end of the lane I observed a lusty man among them, and the rest were boys: this man came and struck me a blow on the side of my head with his fist, then they all fell upon me: the biggest of these prisoners struck me across the face with a stick, and would have pull'd off my hat and wig; finding them going, I got fast hold of my wig: I told them I had no money and turn'd about and saw my hat in the biggest of the prisoner's hand: the lusty man and the women run down the alley, and these two prisoners run towards Smithfield, and I followed them. I cry'd out, stoy thief! and run after them, and at the corner of Cow-lane the biggest was stop'd by a watchman, and another watchman took the other in Hosier-lane.

He asked me to drink, which I did; after that he ask'd me how big my c - k was; I made no answer: he held out his little finger, and ask'd if it was so big; he put his hand to my side, I put it away immediately; then he put his hand to his own breeches and pulled out his - he bid me lie on my side, but I would not; because I would not, he said he'd f - k me that night; then, said he, what country-man are you?
