                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Collins, and live in the parish of St. Leonard, Bromley, in Middlesex. I left our house on the 3rd of July, at ten o'clock at night—I left nobody in the house—I locked the door—the sitting-room window was safe, and fastened inside—all the doors were safely locked—I returned between twelve and one o'clock that night, and found a pane of glass broken in the bed-room window, on the ground floor, and the window was a little way open—it had been unhasped—any body could get into the house—I found the door locked, as I had left it—I missed my husband's hat—I called in a policeman, and then found my drawers open, and missed a gown, three shirts, a petticoat, a bed-gown, a waistcoat, and two child's frocks, which had been in two drawers in the room adjoining the bed-room—there is no door between those two rooms—on the Friday following (the 10th) I saw all the property at Hawes's the pawn<lb/>broker's but a child's frock—I know the prisoner—his mother lives nearly opposite us—he does not live with her—he referred me to No. 16, Stepney-causeway—he lodged there—this was on the night of Fairlop fair—I saw him on the saturdy, the day after the robbery, close to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of July—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of a robbery at Mr. Collins's, at Bromley—he said, as I took him to the station-house, that he did not do the robbery himself, but he knew the parties who had done it—that the two men who had done the robbery had gone to Ports<lb/>mouth, and he knew where part of the property was left—that it was at Kirkham's, No. 16, James's-place, Stepney-causeway—he was remanded—I went to Kirkham's and found two duplicates, among several others, referring to Hawes—I went next moring to Hawes's, with Mrs. Collins, and found part of the property.</p>

               <p>going my rounds, about one o'clock in the morning—I had heard it striks twelve, but it had not struck one o'clock—I was a little distance form Mr. Moore's, a cheesemonger's shop, in Great Portland-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone, and observed a person's legs sticking throught the fan-light over the shop door—I went up, and as I got up somebody fell inside the shop—it was the person whose lege I had seen through the fan-light—I knocked at the shop door, and was answered by a person inside, saying it was all right, but if I did not think so, they would open the front door—I still knocked at the private door, and Mr. Moore answered me form the bed-room window—I alarmed him, and then went to the corner of the house, where I could see the back part of the house, and in about two or three minutes, I heard a noise in the parlour—I went to the parlour shutter—the shutters were thrown open, the bottom sash thrown up, and the prisoner was endeavouring to make his escape out of the window—I pushed him back, and asked what he wanted there—I took him into custody—he was never out of my custody—there was a gas-light in front of the shop, on the same side of the way—I observed it was not about an hour before—the other lamps were all lighted—I cannot tell how this one was put out—the glass was whole, and it was a calm night—I found a spike in the grating of the sewer, about ten yards form the door—I found it fitted to the iron bars of the fan-light—a person could not get without removing the spikes—three were removed, and one I found—I never could find the others—I could not see any more in the grating.</p>

I was coming out form the watch-house in St. Michael's-alley, as it was striking ten o'clock, and heard the cry of "Murder"—I immedistely ran to the spot, and saw a woman hanging to the back of the omnibus, and number of persons collected behind—she said her husband was inside, and she would go in too—the prisoner came up, and demanded her as his wife—he had hardly said a word, before the prosecutor jumpped form the borad, seized him by the collar, and said, "I give him in charge; he has cut me through the leg"—I was taking him to the watch-house, when the female, who was hanging to the omnibus, clung round the priwsoner's neck, and another man who gave his name Carty, (the female gave her name M' Carthy,) endea<lb/>voured to rescue the prisoner form me; but we got him in, and afterwards took the other two—the femele and Carty have been held to bail for the assault—I immediately went back to the spot, and picked this knife up, which laid open on the stones, about five yards form the Royal Exchange pump, within a yard of where the prisoner was given in charge to me—Wastson went with me to the watch-house.</p>

I saw the prosecutor at the corner of Bacon-street, at two o'clock on Sunday morning—he was <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> in liquor—I saw three men in the street besides him; one of them was lying down, and two were up—the prosecutor went to them—I was about six or seven yards from them—Louisa Moore was with me—Mr. Castle said to the men, "Don't hurt the young fellow;" and then he came back to me again, and they all three came closer; and then two of them fell down; and then they all got up, and made a rush at the prosecutor, and ran him back, till they got him as far as Gould's, the grocer's—one of them had hold of the back of his neck, and the others had hold of his collar, holding him down; and when they were running him back, they said, "Come on, Hobbs"—they said to to the prisoner, and then he ran to them—it was the prisoner—I know him—he kicked the prosecutor in his face—the prosecutor was then nearly on the ground at the first kick; and he lost his senses at the first kick; and then they all ran away to the corner of Bacon-street—they picked up a hat and a cap at the corner of Bacon-street, and Hobbs said, "<hi rend="italic">Hook</hi> it, you b—s"—they then all ran away up Brick-lane, towards the Flower Pot—I cannot say who took up the hat, but it was not the prisoner—I stood right facing the prosecutor at the time it happened, and did not like to go over to him till somebody came—I stood over the way till the policeman came—I had left Moore at the corner, and when the policeman came, I went over to the prosecutor—nobody went up to him from the time the man left him till the policeman came—I have seen Hobbs before, selling things in the street, often—I do not know where he lives.</p>

                  </hi>, I am an articled clerk to William David Jennings, a proetor of Doctor's Commons. On the 19th of june, the pri<lb/>soner came to our office, to inquire if any parties had been from the Saving's Bank, inquiring if letters of administration had been taken out to the effects of John Collions, deccased—we said nobody had been there—he said he had been to the Saving's Basnk, and he understood that another party, a woman, calling herself the widow, would apply for letters of administration to John Collins—he said if she did so, it was of no use, as he had a will—we then told him we could not do any thing without seeing that will—he then left to bring it, and, in the afternoon of the same day, the woman called about the letters of adminstration—the prisoner came again on Saturday, the 20th, with a paper—we told him we could not do any thing with it at present, and he must call again on the Tuesday: he left it with us—he called again on the Tuesday, and had a person with him, calling himself the nephew of the deceased, Owen Collins—on the Monday, one of the clerks had to the Savings' Bank on other business, and brought away a pettion, which we examined with the will—this is the will which he gave me, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—we afterwards objected to obtain any probate to the will, in consequence of receiving information from Mr. Clarkson, the proctor—I communicated my suspicions about the will to Mr. Richard Jennings.</p>

I have gone by the name of Mrs. Collins, for twenty-five years last Christmas-day—I had lived all that time with the deceased Patrick Collins—he was generally called John Collins—his real name was Patrick, as far as I heard; but the distinction was made because two per<lb/>sons of the same name worked at the same place—he was taken ill on the Tuesday as he dicd on the Thursday following, the 11th of June—he was taken ill on the 9th, from a fright which he got on the Saturday night before, which so affected his brain or mind, that he died in two days—while he was alive he had deposited some money in the Savings' Bank—I was with him, and paid the money with my own hands, and received this book, (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—the money remained in the Bank to the time of his death—he had very little property—he died at No. 9, Lamb-court, Clerkenwell—soon after he was dead, the prisoner came to his lodging, just as he was washed and laid out—it was the morning he died—he brought a policeman with him, as I was crying over the decreased—I turned my head round, and asked the policeman what brought him there—he said, his business—the</p>

               <p>policeman and the prisoner looked at the body—the prisoner opened Collin's mouth and eyes, to ascertain that he was dead—I did not know the prisoner before he came that day—I had seen him seventeen years ago, but at that time I did not recollect it—that was all he did, looking at the deceased and examing him—he gave no orders for the funeral—he said nothing about his having a will or being executor—I never heard a word about it—I know Owen Collins, by his coming to our place—he gave in his name as Owen Collins, but I know no more about him—the deceased was not on friendly terms with him, but quite the contrary—he did not wish him in his bed-room—he ordered him down stairs—he called me to turn him down stairs, and said he could not bear him in his sight—he said that on the Sunday, as he broke open his door on the Saturday night and frightened him, and he said so till the day of his death, that he could not bear the sight of him, and they were his last dying words—he had broken into his door on the Saturday night, and forced himself into the room—he broke the staple of the lock—I do not know a person named Kelly—I never saw him in my life—I have seen Griffiths here—I never saw her before I went before the Alderman—I know nothing of her.</p>

I know the prisoner, by his having applied to our Institution—his first aplication was, I believe, on Wednesday, the 17th of June; he came to make inquiry relativ to the account of John Collins—I cannot say whether any body was with him on the first application—he was told, any inquiry he had to make must be in writing, as he had not the deposit-book to produce—he afterwards came and presented this petition—this is the book of deposits of John Collins:—</p>

               <p>the circumstances to my mind)—I suggested to him, that the attesting witnesses should attend at our office, to explain the circumstances—an ap<lb/>pointment was made for their attendance on the following day, I think—they did attend—I am not able to say the day—it was immediately after, and I think the next day, or the day but one after—a person, of the name of Kelly, and a female, named Griffiths, attended—they were the names they gave—the prisoner was them, I believe—I am not quite certain; I really cannot speak positively, for I saw the witnesses in my own room, each person by himself—if the prisoner was there, he was not in the room with them—in consequence of what they stated, I desired the prisoner to be sent to me, if he was there; or when he did come he was to be sent to me; and I saw him in company with Owen Collins—it was a continuation of the transaction—I made some inquiry of the prisoner—he said, he had attended the deceased, and, at the deceased's request, he prepared the will for him; and that the deceased had executed the will in the presence of the persons whose names appeared as attesting witnesses—he said the will was executed in a public-house in Clerkenwell, in the neighbourhood of the deceased's residence—I believe Mutton-hill is near Clerkenwell—Owen Collins was going to make some observation, and I stopped him—in consequence of the interview, I explained to the prisoner the oath it was necessary for him to take, as the executor—he declared that he was per<lb/>fectly able to take that oath conscientiously—I then directed the clerks, I think Cox, to prepare the necessary process for his being sworn as executor, and to use extreme caution—I do not think that was in the prisoner's presence—I should say, that a discussion took place with the prisoner as to the property—I found descrepanies in his statement, which induced me to be more particular—I only recollect that that was the result of the conversation—at first he stated, that the property exceeded the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but susequently he said it did not—I do not remember any other descrepancy; but in consequence of that, I was particular in the instructions I gave to my clerks—there is a difference in the stamp-duty, and savings' bank property is exonerated from stamps, where the property is under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the person's whole property does not exceed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he deposited 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and has 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more beside, that renders him liable to the stamp; but if he has altogether less than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the stamp-duty is lower; his being a depositor gives him that privilege—I put a jurat to the will—I was not present, and do not know whether the oath was administered to the prisoner—this is the stamp-office affidavit; it has been sworn, I apprehend, as I believe this to be the signature of the surrogate—I was absent from the office when the prisoner and Owen Collins were given into custody—I was called on to give evidence about a week after—Mrs. Collins had not made any application to me in the mean time—she had previously.</p>

I take the examinations in a minute-book, on the several days on whcih a case is heard, and when it is decided, whether the party is committed or discharged; if committed, the depositions are copied out from of depositions till it is de<lb/>sign them—we do not reduce them into the form of depositions till it is de<lb/>cided that the party should be committed—there were four examinations in this case—on the 6th, 8th, 11th, and 18th of July—Glover was examined on the 8th of July—I never saw him at the office afterwards that I am sware of—I gave nothing farther than the usual notice on the 8th of July, that all partice were attend at the next hearing—the prisoner was called on for his defcne on the 8th of July, and I took down a statement he made (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—he said, "The will was written and signed at the Two Brewers, on Mutton-hill, in the parlour—the deceased and Collins were there from twelve till near three o'clock—we had three pots of half-and-half, and the landlord at<lb/>tende on us—Mr. Griffiths and Kelly were there when the will was finished—I believe Kelly works at the London Dock—Mr. Pattison, of the Bank, got him in—this was read over to the prisoner, and he was asked to sign it—he said it was true, but he should decline signing it, that he did not know whether he should do right.</p>

               <p>I afterwards went before a Grand Jury and preferred this charge—I gave the prisoner notice of my intention of doing so at Queen-square—he was not forthcom<lb/>ing after that—I believe he left Chelsea immediatly I obtained a Bench-warrant—I</p>

I have been an undortunate girl, but am not so now—on Saturday, the 11th of April, I went to the Union coffee-house, Bow-strect—I knew nothing of the prosecutor—that was the first time I saw him—I was in company with Martha Stanley—I partook of some wine with the prosecutor—it was about one o'clock in the morning—the first pint of wine was paid for in silver—he called for a second, and gave a sovereign for it—I should know the person to whom he gave it; it was a person who acted as waiter there—he did not get his change in my presence; he called for it, and the waiter came, but he did not get his change; there was wrangling and quarrelling about it—I went down to the bar with Mr. Brown and my companion—I saw two or three persons there—the prisoner was one of them, but he is not the person who had the sovereign—he was in the bar below when we went down—I should not have thought that Brown had been drinking any thing when he went down to the bar—he ap<lb/>peared sober—he complained of the loss of his change—it was said that they could not give him change, and the sovereign had been returned to him, but I am sure it had not—he said he was determined not to go till he had got it—the person I was with and myself went to have some refresh<lb/>ment in the adjoining room—before I went there Brown produced some<lb/>thing, which I believe to be a bank-note and two sovereigns—he produced it on account of the dispute, as they thought he had had the sovereign—the landlord disputed that the waiter had not returned the sovereign, or that Mr. Brown had given the sovereign—he said he had settled a bill, and changed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and had three sovereigns, and a £5 note when he came in, and produced his money, to show what he had then—I did not see him take any drink at the bar up to that time—he was afterwards coming out, and he was refused to be allowed to go out—I cannot say by whom—the pri<lb/>soner was there at the time, and the waiter to whom he had given the so<lb/>vereign—I heard him called Ralph—after the prosecutor produced the note and sovereigns, he put them back into some private pocket—I should say it was his fob—he had no drink at the bar at that time, to my knowledge—they would not let him go without paying for the pint of wine for which he had given the sovereign; they detained him—I do not know how, for I did not look—I went out—they were wrangling in the bar for not less than two or three hours I should think—it was during the time we were taking the refreshment—I left the house at day-break—Brown was there then—he was stopped at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday night, the 11th of April, I was at the Union coffee-house. I was in the habit of seeing gentlemen at that time—I found the prosecutor there—I went there with Gardner—we par<lb/>took of some wine with the prosecutor—I was there when he had the first portion of wine, and saw him pay for it with silver—he called for more—I was not present when he paid for that—I had left the table for a few mi<lb/>nutes—I partook of some of it, and then he asked for his change—the waiter said he would bring it directly—he did not bring it—he did not re<lb/>turn any sovereign—Brown went down stairs, and asked for it—Gardner I went with him—I have know Brown three months, and more, per<lb/>haps, before this transaction—when we got to the bar, I saw a female in<lb/>side, and a gentleman and the prisoner—I do not know whether he was acting as waiter, but he was in the habit of waiting—Brown did not get his change—they disputed about his having the sovereign—Ralph was there—and the prisoner was out and in, backwards and forwards, from the passage to the bar—Brown wanted his change, and we thought proper not to leave him till his change was returned—the landlord said, "You had better feel in your pockets, Mr. Brown, and see if it is not in your pocket"—the prisoner was within hearing at that time—he pulled out of his pocket a brass farthing, and the landlord said, "Probably that is what you have taken to be a sovereign"—Brown said, "No, I have change a note to-day, and will show you where I put the sovereign"—he pulled out a bank-note, and there were two sovereigns in it—he showed it to the land<lb/>lord, and the persons in the bar—the prisoner was out and in during that time—I suppose this wrangling continued about an hour—we were going away—they detained Mr. Brown, to pay for the wine—I did not see what he did with the note and sovereigns after pulling them out—I do not know whether he put them back or not—they detained him for the money for the wine—they stopped him—he was going out—they spoke to him, and</p>

I was concerned in the management of the Union, in Bow-street, on the 11th of April—I remember a question arising that day about a sovereign having been given to the waiter—Mr. Brown was there—I am the leaseholder of the house, and let out the tavern part—I know the prisoner—he was very unwell on the 11th of April—he com<lb/>monly does business in the house—he did not appear in the house that night—he was very unwell and in bed, I believe—he was not at the bar at any time that night—Mr. Brown came to complain about the sovereign just after the house was close, a little after one o'clock in the morning—he made a com<lb/>plaint about a waiter having received a sovereign from him and detained it—he and one of Mr. Carler's waiters came down, and they were talking about the sovereign—he addressed himself to me, and said, "Sir, I gave your waiter a sovereign, and he has not given me change"—I turned to the waiter and said, "What is this, Ralph? have you not given the gentleman his changed?"—he said, "I have not received any sovereign from the gen<lb/>tleman—the gentleman has had two pints of wine and has only paid for one, and there are several gentlemen up-stairs, sitting at the same table, who can tell you the same"—I then turned to Mr. Brown, and said, "I never heard any gentleman accuse the waiter of detaining a sovereign before, Sir, and will not believe it"—I said "Ralph, do you know any of tne gen<lb/>tlemen up-stairs?"—he said, "Yes; I do"—I said, "Ask one of them to come down—Mr. Beacon came down—I believe he is a law statiner—he came down—I asked him, in Brown's hearing, if he saw Mr. Brown give</p>

I gave it to Lewis—he changed it for me—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and two sovereigns—I had to pay money to Goodenough, the corn-chandler—Goodenough gave me a receipt at the time—this is the bill and receipt I paid him—it is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Woolf, a tailor, who brought the prisoner a coat home, was present at the time I paid Goodenough.</p>

I know the prisoner—I attended him, in April last, for an illness—he had a scrofula enlargement of the glands of the right groin—I desired him to keep as quiet as possible, to lay by and keep off his legs as much as possible—I consider he has the complaint now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, and live at Nol 69, Commercial-road, Lambeth. I was at the Union, in Bow-street, about two o'clock on Sunday morning, the 12th of April, and saw Captain Brown there—he came in about one o'clock—I saw him at the first table at the righe-hand side of the room—I saw below at the bar—I remember some money being asked for, and he produced a piece of paper, rumpled up, which turned out to be a £5 note—he produced the £5 note, and presented it to Harris—it passed from him to the barman, for him to take his money out of it—he could not give change—he gave it to Harris, and Harris gave him five sovereigns—Brown pushed one of the sovereigns along the bar, and told the barman to take his money—Harris asked Mr. Brown for his name—he said it was Brown—Harris asked him to write it—he said, "No, you be d----d, write it yourself"—I have been outside the court while Harris was examined—Harris wrote his name on the note, as I presume, and put it in his pocket—the prisoner was not there at all—Mr. Brown walked out of the house, and I followed him—I went with him to between the Union and the Ly<lb/>ceum Theatre—he there met a female, and said, "I shall bid you good morn<lb/>ing; I know this female, I shall go with her," and then we parted—that was from four to half-past four o'clock.</p>

               <p>this, the time for pleading had expired, and I understood the party intended to defend the action, and being in difficulties, I knew I should be watched into his office and arrested—another reason was, if the parties had made up their minds to defend the action, I must have dropped it; because they would have beat me by producing a most respectable friend, who would acknowledge he had received the money on my account, and paid it away, which would place him in a very awkward position—I had incurred a bill with Mr. Wright, and that was the reason I did not go to his house—the boy was in the house at the time; he is not produced—I still say he had a lodger, and that lodger a servant—why are they not called?—why not have the best proof in a case of suspicion?</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Garnham, an iron founder in Brick-lane. On the 11th of July I was digging for some sand, and found the articles named in the indictment—I called a man to look at them—I then asked the prisoner if there was any thing in the corner which belonged to him, he said, "Yes," I said I had broked the sugar jar—he said, "B----you, and the sugar-jar too"—he said, "Connolly had brought them there, and that a woman was going to call for them on the morning—I afterwards saw the prisoner go the hold and take something away—he went up stairs with his wife to where they live.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I claim your attention; I trust you have not made up your minds to send me over the water without hearing me speak; I did not run away for fear of being taken for forgery; when I said, if I had not been taken that night, I should have gone where I could not be found; I meant to say, my family would have been removed, where he would not have found me that day; for I had been apprised that my old assigees were going to lay hold of my furniture, and meant to move to<lb/>morrow, to save it. You have had one or two witnesses to swear to my handwriting; in answer to their evidence, I shall produce a clerk in my employ, whom will mpositively swear the bills are not in my handwriting; that witness has seen more of my handwriting than any person in court; no part of the acceptance is my writing. In March last I became ac<lb/>quainted with John Batchelor, and asked him to recommend us customers; about the 28th of March, he called at our warehouse, and said a friend of his, Mr. Mitchell, of Rochdale, had come to town, and he would bring him; on Monday I received a note, requesting me to meet him at the Three Bucks, in Eaton-street; he said he had a commission from some persons in Rochdale to purchase hosiery, and named a house which Mit<lb/>chell assured me was highly respectable; and what he (Mitchell) lived in Drake-street, Rochdale. I took down the orders, which being large, I thought it better to get bills accepted, than give them three months credit. I afterwards stated this to Mitchell; who stated, that if I would draw the bills, he would send them down to Rochdale for acceptance. On the 1st of April, I told Tillidge to draw the bills; four were drawn; I gave them to Mitchell, who promised to get them accepted; on the 12th of April, Batchelor called at my private residence, and gave me the bills, accepted by Ormerod and Co., and said he had received them in a parcel from Mitchell, who had returned to Rochdale; the prosecutor afterwards called on me for the payment of his account, 213<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was due in cash; my partner paid him cash and bills, accounting to, I believe, 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he would get the bills discounted, and return the balance; observing I had I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170109"/>
               <p>other bills, he offered to get them discounted too, and I gave him the one in question, and three others; about the 23rd of April, I sent for the proceeds, but he refused to give it up till he saw what turn our affairs took; and being fearful, as our stock was destroyed by fire, that we might become embarrassed, we would not press him for it. (The prisoner entered into other particulars respecting his commercial transactions, but not reffering to the charge.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell White you had no doubt the prisoner forged the accept<lb/>ance of both the bills; for you knew he had paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take up a forged acceptance the day before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that—I will swear I never did say so—I did not see the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and never knew what it was; but I knew there was something wrong about it—it was not proved under the bankruptcy, and this sane bill had been paid—I believe I had been informed so six weeks ago in the country—I was informed that bill was taken up by Hoyle's friends—I might make use of the word "forged" on that occasion—I never meant to say it was forged, I might have said it was a bad bill—I never said that I knew the prisoner had forged that bill, to my knowledge—I did not use the word "forged," to the best of my knowledge—I do not recollect saying I knew the bill had been forged—I never said the prisoner had forged Ormerod's name, or the name of David Lord—I had never seen the bills—I came from the neighbourhood of Rochdale, and so did the prisoner—I do not know George Ormerod, a draper there—I have not been down there since the prisoner was committed—I do not know a man of the name of George Ormerod there—I know a good deal of Rochdale—I was in town when the prisoner was examined the second time at the Mansion House—I was at the examination—I did not state any thing—I heard some of the witnesses say it was his handwriting, but I never saw the bill—I have been to France twice—I gave over busi<lb/>ness there—I did not abscond—I was not forced to go—I went on a jour<lb/>ney of pleasure—I was never a great deal indebted—I did not go to France, to avoid my creditors the first time—nor the second; I went for pleasure both times.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Portland arms, in Wilson-street, Dorset-square. On saturday, the 4th of July, between Five and six o'clock in the evening, the four prisoners came to my house, with another young man not present; they went into the back parlour—two young men, (Cope and Hurd,) had been in that room that day, besides my own family; they were in the room when the prisoners entered—nobody else had been in the room that day—they had a pot of half-and-half, and, I believe, a pint of half-and-half—Hurd and Cope came put of the room soon after the prisoners went in—Newcomb afterwards came out, and went away—after that Stokey, and the man who is not here, came out and went away; and after that Hooker and Goodwin came out, and drank a pint of half-and-half at the bar; but before they came out, they rang the bell, and I answered it—I went into the room, and they ordered a pint of half-and-half—I did not immediately leave the room to get it; and they said "A pint of half-and-half" two or three times, in a hurried manner—I left the room to get it, and they followed me to the bar, and drank it—I observed nothing particular when I went into the room—they went away immediately—I went into the parlour the mo<lb/>ment they left, having suspiction, and observed a small piece of bombezin and a piece of crape on the floor, and a piece of silk hanging out of the drawer—I could not have seen the drawer from the part of the room I was in when I answered the bell; and I cannot say whether these things were there, as the drawers were on the other side of the bagetello-board—I could not see any thing if it had been on the floor, where I was—I went to the bar to Mr. Roberts, and informed her; and then we went together to the parlour—I found all the drawers locked except one, and the key was not there—I believed it had been left in the drawer that morning—I sent for a locksmith; he opened one drawer, and Mrs. Roberts missed several things</p>

I came in town on Monday, the 1st of June, and brought thirteen £5 notes with me, which I obtained at the Southampton Bank—I placed them in my portmanteau—I came to the New Slaughter's Hotel, St. Martin's-lane, kept by Hinks—I slept there that night, and left the room about nine o'clock on Tuesday moning—I took out of my portmanteau four £5 notes before I left my room—I then went down-stairs—I went up-stairs again, after breakfast, into my room, and did not take any notice of my port<lb/>manteau—it stood on a chair in the centre of the room—I left the room again almost immediately, and left the house—I returned at about half-past eleven o'clock, and went into my room again—I went to my port<lb/>manteau to take out some more money, and found that the lock had been picked, and nine notes, which I had left, taken away—it was shut down, but not locked—the notes were part of those I had brought from Southampton—I had received them about the 18th of May—I am certain they are part of what I received on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in a counting-house, and live in Bridgewater-gardens. On the 16th of August, at half-past four o'clock in the morning, I met Smith in St. Giles's—I went with her to a house and went to bed with her, leaving my clothes on a chair—when I awoke, I missed this money from my pockets—there had been another young girl in bed in the room, (who was not Lennard,) and she went away—in about half an hour, while I was arguing with Smith, Lennard came into the room, and said Smith was not the person at all—I went out, got an officer, and we found the money on Lennard—Smith had got up before I did.</p>

I accompained Gilpin to the Guardsman public-house, and took the prisoner into custody—he said Mr. Smith, of No.14, Lincoln's-inn-fields, gave him the cheque—we went there, but could find no such person—he then said Smith gave it to him, near Temple-bar, as part of some money he had got on some estates of his; he being his attorney—I searched him at the station-house, and found on him part of a sheet of a paper corresponding with the paper the cheque was written on, in every particular—the water-mark agrees in the creases.</p>

On the 12th of August, I went out, and padlocked the house—my mother had the key—she gave me the key about oneo'clock in the day time, and I went to the house—it is a lone house—I found the padlock had been opened, and hanging on the chain—I went in, and heard somebody coming down stairs—I said nothing, but the moment he opened the door, I caught him by the collar—he was a stranger—he struggled with me, and gave me a blow which knocked me down—I had a long scuffle with him, and at last he got away, leaving his coat and hat behind—he ran across the fields—I pursued, and lost sight of him for a short time; but he was soon taken—it was the prisoner—I know he is the same person he was taken without a coat or hat—on going into the room, I foud three silk hand<lb/>kerchiefs, and a pair of trowsers of mine removed, and ten shillings and sixpence taken out of the pockets of the trowsers—they were not carried out of the house—the three silk handkerchiefs were brought down stairs, out of my box—the money was found in the prisoner's coat pocket—I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of the London Hospital. The deceased was brought to our hospital between six and seven o'clock on the evening of the 2d of August, quite intoxicated—she had two triffing bruises, one on each leg, one on the chest, and a slight wound of the scalp on the left side; another on the lip, and a fracture of the lower jaw, on both sides—I paid attention to her, and she went on very well till the evening of the 6th, when she became very restless, and during the course of the night, delirious; and died on the 7th, at noon—she was con<lb/>scious that she was in extreme danger for two or three days before she died—I did not hear her say that she should die—after she was dead I examined the body—as far as I could judge, her constitution was broken from drinking—I am not enabled to say what was the cause of her death—from the appearances on dissection, I believe it was from the constitu<lb/>tional disturbance. occasioned by these blows, and the shettered state of her constitution—that is the only way we can account for her death; but I cannot say positively that the blows did cause her death—the anger and irritation of the moment, added to her bodily state, might have caused her death—she might possibly have recovered if she had been in a good state of health—there was no mortification of the wounds.</p>

               <p>I said any thing, and Benjamin, in his presence, asked if Mr. Stephens would give any further security; whether either of the refrees would be<lb/>come a party to the bill—I had given them refrences before—it was agreed at this interview to give four bills—Benjamin Levison drew the form in the prisoner's presence for four bills at three, six, nine, and twelve months, for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, the signature to be left blank—the prisoner saw the paper delivered to me—I cannot find it—I have looked for it, and believe it to be destroyed—the bills were drawn exactly from that form—when I was asked to give security I told him Mr. Stephens objected to give the refer<lb/>ences as parties to the bill, but he had a life-policy which he would give as collateral security for the payment of the bills.</p>

I call this a good piece of lead"—ne said, "Take it, and say nothing about it"—he then said two per<lb/>sons gave it him—I said, "Where?"—he said in the field—I went and returned in a quarter of an hour, and said, "I cannot find any body else, will you come to my master's?"—I went with him to my master—the prisoner laid down in the yard—he then got up and ran away—I followed him, brought him back, and then the constable came and took him.</p>

I was alarmed, and proceeded to the cellar—I had first looked out of the window, and called a lodger of mine—I told him to go out at the door, and I would take a gun and follow him—I did so, and found him at the cellar-flap; and Dance had hold of one of the prisoners—I said, "Let him go, and I will shoot him if he run away"—Dance said, "Don't shoot him; there are two more in the cellar"—I went to get a light to see for them; and when I came back, the other two prisoners had got out, and had been taken—I went into the cellar, but there were no more there—I found a cock turned, and some beer let out, but I cannot say that they did it—I told them it was a good job I did not come first, for I should have shot them—they said, "If we had been here half an hour</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased—there were no external marks of violence; and if 500, 000 surgeons had seen the body, they would come to the conclusion, in the absence of external injury, that the deceased died from natural causes—I believe the death to be caused by a quantity of water collected in the left ventricle, which I pointed out, and which the other surgeons have forgotten to mention—that shows a natural tendency to apoplexy; and she was disposed to dropsy—the well of water in her head disposes me to consider death arose from natural causes—I am not confined to that symptom alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A woman, apparently in health and standing on her legs, is knocked down and dies upon a person falling on her, would you attribute that to natural causes, or the blows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I deny that she was in good health, on account of the well of water in her head—the blood-vessels, to a certain extent, over the ear were full of bood—this shows she was disposed to die of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not a blow and fall accelerate that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not such a blow as she received, viz. a slap of the face from a woman—many receive a blow, and are not killed by it—in my humble opinion, the blow had nothing to do with her death, it left no mark—I mean to say, a blow which did not leave a mark is not suficient to cause death—a blow would assist in causing death in a person of apoplectic habit, but I am not dis<lb/>posed to think it caused death; in the absence of external injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you think she fell down in a fit of apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; excitement produced by drink and passion, and that she was dead before she fell to the ground—that is my idea—there were other symptoms of apoplexy from natural causes—I do not admit that the blow had any thing to do with her death, for she was dead to the world before she reached the gound—I was, house-surgeon at Colchester hos<lb/>pital, when a boy was brought in with a fractured scull; a portion of the scull was knocked in, and he did not die instantly, though it was a tre<lb/>mendous blow from the sails of a wind-mill—my opinion is, that in all human probability this woman would have died on the spot if nobody had struck her.</p>

I was examined before the Coroner—One Friday the 17th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing by the coach-rank in the Borough-road, and saw two old people coming from the Blind-school to<lb/>wards the Borough-road, arm in arm—when they got two or three yards from the Blind-school, a chaise, with two gentlemen in it, called out as loud as they could for them to get out of the way, and the old people pushed back—that drew my attention to the way they were crossing, and when they got near the obelisk, I saw a cab coming from Westminster-road towards the Borough-road—when the cabman came within ten yards of them, I heard him call out "Ahoy," as loud as he could—the horse he had got seemed to spring forwards—the old lady seemed frightened and turned the old gentleman in a different direction, more towards the coach-stand than to the cab, which caused his back to be more towards the cab than his face—the shaft of the cab then struck the man somewhere in the back or ribs, and knocked him down—the man shoved the woman further away—I do not think the woman was struck at all, except the force of the shaft striking the man, caused her to fall—I am sure she was not struck at all—she appeared frightened, and was picked up by somebody—I should think the cab was going at about eight miles an hour—I am no judge of these things—when he hallood out, the horse seemed to go faster than before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Sir Alexander Hood on the 11th of August—I was with his family at Brunswick-terrace—I received this letter on the 11th, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—it was forwarded to Lady Hood, and she forwarded it to Sir Alexander.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letters read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>"Sir Alexander Hood is sorry to trouble Mr. Green upon the subject of that worthless person, who has been such a nuisance to his family, Samuel Hood. He has been to Brighton and alarmed Sir Alexander's family in his absence, and fortunately no gentleman being then present to advise them, he was not placed in the hands of the police; but they were induced by threats to say in writing that something might be given him through Mr. Green. His apparent desire was to go to Spain; if, therefore, he should put himself under the command of an officer in that service, Sir Alexander requests Mr. Green will advance to such officer, or acknow<lb/>ledged Spanish agent in London, to be paid only when he is in Spain, and then only for clothes and necessaries, five pounds; but on no account to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170216"/>
               <p>himself; and sir Alexander will, immediately upon Mr. Green's having done so, send the amount. Sir Alexander thinks it advisable to have him watched by the police, and requests Mr. Green, if he is on the same opinion, to mention the name of some vigilant person of that description to whom he may write to take him up if he comes into the country again, obtaining money under false pretences and threats. The five pounds can only be paid through one of the established agents, so that there may be no cheat<lb/>ing. The person is no relation of Sir Alexander's us he calls himself,—Wooton, Glastonbury, August 10."</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's letter was then read</hi>.) "Green's Hotel, Monday, August 20,</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>, I have just read your infamous epistle to Mr. Green. This is the second time you have endeavoured to swindle me out of what you pro<lb/>misled in writing, which I can, and will produce to the world, Shame! Shame! can you, Sir, stoop to deceive and defrand a distressed relative! 'If you call on Mr. G. in London, you shall have some money.' When I get there, I find I am to go to Spain—and when I should have got there, I should find Sir Alexander's word as much respected as it was at London. You have deceived me once before this, when you sent me to Plymouth, there years ago. You shall not, I swear by the great God of Heaven, deceive me again with impunity—no, you have goaded me to des<lb/>peration by insult, deception, and falsehood. Perish I must, for I have no means of existing; but you, Sir, who promise but to deceive, shall not live to exult over my misfortunes. <hi rend="italic">Were</hi> I to go to Spain, I should go as an officer, and the promise made to me, for your mother of yourself, must be fulfilled without conditions; the promise was made to me; on that I left for London. None but those lost to every feeling and prin<lb/>ciple of honour and honesty, would thus basely, for the sake of a few pounds, forfeit their written pledge. I write to you once again, Sir, from here; and I now state to you that the assistance promised me at Mr. Green's, must be given without any conditions; and then Sir, neither you nor any of your family, will hear from me again. I wait until Wednesday morning. If I have not any communication at Green's, I will call upon you at Brighton. My doing so, will at least give me an opportunity to prove that I did not take advantage of your absence; and it will most likely give me an opportunity of stating publicly, that you (in my opinion, and in the opinion of many hundred others), either cajoled old Lady Brid<lb/>port into giving you all her property, or made the will yourself; the world will then have an opportunity of knowing Sir Alexander's chartacter as it really is, not as it may appear at this moment, superficially. If the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. promised is handed over to me, punish me for a perjured liar if I ever make an application to you again. I will call on Mr. G. on Wednesday morning, if I have no reply from him, I shall leave London directly for Brighton; that at least I may die at your threshould, the victim of your veracity and honour; but I will not die alone, worthless as you have dared to call me, I will prove that my carcase will be as valuable as the proud Sir Alexander Hood's. You drive me to madness, Sir, by your brutal and unmanly conduct. Why did your mother promise, if you or she intended to deceive? I wish to go to Spain, but not in the way you pro<lb/>pose; I would much sooner blow your and mine own brains out, than submit to your ungenerous conditions! Why not have said at once, when I was at Brighton, that nothing should be done for me; why <hi rend="italic">dishonourable</hi> cheat me into a belief that I should have it on my arrival in London; why inhumanely trifle with one who is almost starving—is this an aristocratic</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170217"/>
               <p>feeling? No; no man of honour would forfeit his word, even a trades<lb/>man would have more honour than to shufile in the paltry was you have twice done with me. But rest assured, Sir, that I am not to be played with like a child. You have, by your insulting letter, roused feelings that even I regret to say, possess my wind in an excruciating degree. I repeat, Sir Alexander, that if you will allow the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. promised to me, to be given to me on Wednesday next, that I will immediately embark for Spain, and never trouble you or your family again, and will give Mr. Green an un<lb/>detain to that effect, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> to leave England in three days from thence. I am sure, after the promise made to me at Brighton, it will be impossible for you to refuse compliance with this request; and if I do not fulfill it, punish me as I should then merit; but which I do not, I thank God, yet deserve.—<hi rend="largeCaps">SAM. HOOD</hi>.</p>
               <p>"Sir, If you will permit Mr. G to hand me over the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will engage to leave England in three days from that time, and give an acknowlege<lb/>meant that the money is advanced to me for that purpose, and that purpose alone, and; not to be applied to any other than forwarding my departure for Spain; this Sir, will be sufficient, and will enable you to punish me as I should disserve, if I appropriate the money to any other purpose. To accept the money under your conditions, would be to blast my hopes and prospects at once, and I might as well stop and perish here, us go abroad without a hope of rising in my profession. I am Sir, your obliged, but cruelly treated relative, <hi rend="largeCaps">SAM. HOOD</hi>."</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in a long address, stated that he had made frequent applica<lb/>ions for pecuniary assistance—and that upon hearing the letter produced, read to him, to Mr. Green, he had written the one in questioin, under a state of great excitement, which he now regretted.)</p>
