               <p>him afterwards, living at Claremont-place, Walworth—his family consisted of his wife, and one daughter, who was in her tenth year—I remember his death, on 3rd July—I saw him in his coffin, and was there at the time of his funeral—I continued to know his wife after his death—she died of cholera, on 31st Aug., having taken tea with me on the day before—she had removed to the next house to that in which her husband died, or the next door but one—I know that she had a brother in California—I saw the prisoner at the funeral of Mr. Ross.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Shades Hotel, Leicester-square. I have known the prisoner some years—he brought me this bill on 23rd Dec., and asked me if I would pay it through my banker's—it is dated at San Francisco—he said that it came from California, and that he came by it unexpectedly—I did not ask him on what account, or any particulars about it—I was not inquisitive about it, or interested in it—it had some few days to run because there was a grace upon it—I consented, and advanced him 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at different periods in the course of those few days—there was a funeral at the time for which he wanted an advance—I afterwards, on 27th Sept., wrote him a cheque for the balance, 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the indorsement of D. Ross was upon the bill, but I will not be certain—the prisoner, at my request, wrote his name upon it—I paid him every halfpenny—I took no considera<lb/>tion whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Donald Ross did not lodge there; his widow did—I knew him in his lifetime, by coming in and out; and after his death, Mrs. Ross came to my house to live—I saw the prisoner there once before her death; and about an hour after her death he came, and wished to go up into the room and see the corpse; they only occupied one room—I went up with him, and he asked me for her keys—they were lying on a box by the side of the bed—he took them, opened a box, and searched in it for some time—he said he wanted a Californian note; he could not find it—he only searched in that one box—he locked it, locked the room door, and took the keys with him—he came back next morning, went up with me, and gave me the door key to open the door—I did so, and he went in with me—he did not look about the room; he only looked in that one box—the note was found in a pincushion, in the box—this is it—he looked at it, said that it was the note he wanted, and took it away, and also a gold watch—he took nothing else—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or there<lb/>abouts, which Mrs. Ross owed me—there was a silver watch and three rings in my possession, which I gave to him—lie sent a man to take away the things, and the furniture also; that was after the funeral—the funeral came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid that; he showed me the bill—he took the child away on the day of the funeral, and next day part of the furniture was taken—he came, and asked me if it was all taken away—I said, "No;" and he sent the same man again for it—I do not know where the child is now—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am butler, at Arthur's Club, St. James's-street, and was a friend of Donald Ross—he fell into distress, after keeping a public house, and went to live with his wife and child—he had no rela<lb/>tions in London that I know of—I am acquainted with his writing—this indorsement, "D. Ross," is certainly not his writing—I knew his brother, John, who went to California—on 4th Sept I heard of Mrs. Ross's death, and, in consequence of information I received, I that same day went to the prisoner, and found him at his house, No. 102, Leadenhall-street—(I do not know whether the house is his property or not)—I asked him about Mrs. Ross's property, and what had become of it—he said that there was scarcely sufficient to bury her—it was then about half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—he was in a beastly state of intoxication, and nothing more passed at that interview—he was in what I believe he terms the office, which is two or three stories up—I should say that it was a back room—</p>

               <p>nobody was in the room but himself—he was tipsy, and I came away—I saw him again a week or ten days afterwards, in the same place, and in the same state—he was alone—I had heard nothing about the bill from Cali<lb/>fornia when I first saw him—the second time I saw him was in Nov., and I told him that I was given to understand that a bill had come from California, and asked him the amount of it—he said he would not tell me the amount; that it was not paid, and that he was afraid it never would be—I saw him after that several times, in the same place, and in the same state—I repeated my application to him about the bill, and got the same answer on all occasions, that there was scarcely sufficient to bury her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Boss-shire, North Britain, and have come up to London on this business. I am the brother of Donald Ross—I arrived on 3rd Dec., and saw Mr. Corbitt; I went with him to Leadenhall-street to see the prisoner—I attended at the Mansion-house, when the charge was preferred against the prisoner—I saw the child the day I was at M'Donald's, but I have not seen her since—an application was made to the Magistrate for the production of the child; the prisoner said nothing upon that—they did not produce the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you desirous to take the child back to Scotland? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is for that purpose that I have come to London—I have a relation, who is called <hi rend="italic">Auntie Peggy</hi>; she came up for the child; she was sent for by the prisoner—I did not recommend that she should not be trusted with the child—I did not consider that she was a proper person to be trusted with the child—M'Donald said that <hi rend="italic">Auntie Peggy</hi> would whip the child, and throw it into the sea; and that the child would not come home with her till uncle <hi rend="italic">Sandy</hi> came for her; that is myself—<hi rend="italic">Auntie Peggy</hi> had come to London before me—she was a proper person to be trusted with the child—I suggested in the letter that she should be entrusted to the stewardess—I have only had one letter from M'Donald, which I think Mr. Campbell has—the other letter was not to me, but to Mr. Campbell—I think Mr. Wontner has that—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter to me—(<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to the witness from the prisoner, dated</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th Sept.</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">informing him of the death of Mrs. Ross, that he had paid all expenses, and intended sending the child to the Scotch school; that the child wished to stay with the witness, or with her grandmother, Mrs. Monroe, until her admission to the school was accomplished, and 'that when she grew up she would be entitled to</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and requesting to know the witness's wishes with respect to the child</hi>)—Mrs. Monroe is <hi rend="italic">Auntie Peggy</hi>—on the receipt of that letter I went to the Rev.

I have been in London on this business since 16th Sept.—I have seen the little girl just now—I have been endeavouring to find her often, since I have been in London—I was always looking for her, but could not find her—I went to the prisoner for the child, and he said he never would give her up, or anything belonging to her; that he would not give me a stitch of her mother's clothes, and told me not to lay a hand on them—I said, I <hi rend="italic">ken'd</hi> that there was plenty of clothes, and he said that there was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket maker. On 5th Dec. I was at the King's Arms, Market-hill, Shadwell—the prisoner was there, and two women with him, drinking—one of the women gave me some gin and water—a mate of mine then gave some ale that went round—we were all good friends up to that time—the prisoner went out, and brought in a mate of his—I do not know that man's name—I then paid for two more pots of ale—I put down my pot behind me, and when I looked for it it was gone—I thought somebody had taken it—the prisoner afterwards came with a glass of ale to offer me as a recompense—I said, "You may keep it," and tried to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it over him—I believe some of it did go over him—he had a comforter on—he took it off—I expected he was offended with me, and he wanted to fight—his mate came and caught hold of me right round the arm, and I was quite helpless—I sang out for help, and his mate let me go when two men came out of the tap room—I went towards the prisoner, and made a hit at him—I had my fists up in a fighting attitude—I struck him on the top of the nose, and as I struck him he ran a knife into my belly, right in the lower part of the groin—I did not see the knife in his hand when I went towards him, I did afterwards—the potman caught hold of me round the back, and would not let me go towards him any more—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there three weeks.</p>

               <p>Knubley followed him up to the front door, and struck him once or twice more—the prisoner then drew his knife, and stabbed him in the lower part of the belly—it was a spring back knife—they were fresh in liquor—they had been drinking all the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital when Knubley was brought in, on 5th Dec., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—I found a wound in the lower part of the abdomen; it had evidently been inflicted by a sharp instrument, about one-third of an inch in breadth; the depth could not be ascertained, it had gone through the walls of the abdo<lb/>men—it was just over the seat of the bladder, in a dangerous place—he was under my care about three weeks—the bowels were not punctured; he had acute inflammation come on next day, and he was in a dangerous con<lb/>dition for a week—we despaired of his life for a time; he was very drunk indeed when he came in—that would be very likely to assist in bringing on inflammation.</p>

Leighton—on or about 7th Dec., he came there about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; he said he had a friend going to Australia, who wished for a good family Bible—I gave him a cata<lb/>logue and a specimen of types to show to his friend—he went away with them, and returned in about half an hour—he said his friend was not par<lb/>ticular to price, but wished a really good Bible, and would I let him have two for his friend to select from, and he would return one in an hour, and pay for the other—I said I would do so—I was very busy then, and told him to call again—he said he would, and he did in about half or three-quarters of an hour—I said I was not ready for him yet—he said he was going round to Messrs. Leighton, in Harp-alley, where he should be about half an hour, and he would then return for them—while our man was gone</p>

               <p>up stairs to bring down the two quarto Bibles, I said, "Are you still in Messrs. Leighton's employ?" wishing to make myself very sure upon that point—he said, "Yes," he was—as we knew him when he used to drive the cart, I asked him about his change of occupation, and he said he preferred the in-door occupation now, but at first it had affected his health—I had seen Messrs. Leighton in the mean time, and himself too; he had been to our warehouse, and I understood he was warehouseman to Messrs. Leighton—I then delivered him the books—I did not see him again until the morning of the 19th, when he was in custody—if I had known that he was not at that time in Messrs. Leighton's service, I certainly would not have delivered him the books; the two were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never returned them.</p>

Leighton's place of business very well, there was formerly an entrance in Harp-alley—I cannot say whether there was at the time—I always used to go in at the Harp-alley entrance—I have not been in Harp-alley for three or four years—I am quite certain he said he was still at Mr. Leighton's—he said at the station house that the Bibles had not been parted with, and he could bring them if he was allowed to go to the place—I did not hear him say so when he was taken—the two Bibles came back on Saturday last by the Parcels Delivery Company—the cheaper of the two has the mark of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, since it left our warehouse—that was after he was committed; with the exception of that mark they are not in any way the worse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 178, Prospect-place, Maida-hill, Edgware-road. I know the prisoner—I believe him to be a jeweller—about the middle of Aug. last, I ordered him to make a signet ring, to weigh 8 dwts. of gold, to be hall marked, of the standard of 18 carats fine—the price was to be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner resides in the Goswell-road—I gave him the order in his shop—he told me he would execute the order—he produced a bunch of sizes, made of wire; and after fitting a great many upon my finger, I got one that fitted, and pointed it out to him; he then put a small piece of paper on the size, and sealed it with a bit of sealing wax, and stated that he would have the ring ready within a fortnight—I chose an onyx stone to put in the ring; that was to be included in the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called again at the shop at the time appointed, within a fortnight—it was near the latter end of July—I do not recollect the exact day—I saw him in his shop—he said, "I am not ready for you yet"—I asked him what he had done in the matter—he said, "I will let you see"—he went into a place at the rear of the shop, and brought out the ring—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the ring—it was then in a coarse state, and without the stone—I fitted it on my third finger—I told him that the size answered, and handed it back to him—he said it was ready to go to the Hall to be marked, and that it would be detained some time—there was no mark on the ring at that time—he told me to call between the 10th and 11th of the following month—I said I would call on the 11th—I did call on 11th Aug.—I did not see the pri<lb/>soner on that occasion—I saw Mrs. Nunn, the prisoner's wife—the ring was then produced by Mrs. Nunn; it was in the same state in which it now is, with the exception of this piece being cut off; it has been tested at the Hall—this bill of parcels was delivered to me by the prisoner's wife, with the ring—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the ring—I afterwards found out that the mark was not correct—about three weeks ago I showed the ring to Mr. Cogswell, a pawn<lb/>broker, in Copenhagen-street, Islington—he is here—before that I thought that it appeared very much obliterated—I was buying an article of Cogs<lb/>well, and I asked him his opinion of the ring—I saw him looking at it as it was on my finger—in consequence of what Cogswell said, I went, next day, to Goldsmiths' Hall, with the ring—I there saw Mr. Sharp, the deputy warden of the Company.</p>

Mr. Russell, one of the General Inspectors of Prisons at that time—I got the appointment at the end of the eleven months—between that time and my departure, I was waiting for the appointment—I was about three months waiting for it—I did not start immediately—I was doing nothing between the time I actually got it and my starting—I left Van Diemen's Land on 8th Aug., 1845—I have not been living private ever since my return—in the first instance I received half pay from the Government, on returning here—between 1845 and the present time, I have been in communication with the Archbishop of Dublin and the then Lord Lieutenant, upon the subject of convict discipline, and drawing up a scheme for the management of the convicts—that is not all that I have been doing to gain my living—I have been twice employed by the Government since I came home, for three months at a time; I got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each time—I have got my living in different ways—I do not mean to say that the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was my ostensible means of living—I have 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, an annuity in right of my wife—my wife is dead—it is not payable at the Bank of England; it is a private annuity—that is not the only means I have had of living, except the two sums of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I have had means from my brothers and rela<lb/>tives—that is the way in which I have lived—I have never been a rent collector—I have never collected rents for any one—I did not first become acquainted with Mr. Nunn by going to collect a portion of rent that was due to his landlord, Mr. Young—my friend, Dr. Young, with whom I have been acquainted and intimately connected, was the medical attendant of Nunn's family—Mr. Young purchased a diamond ring from Nunn; and he told me, if I wanted anything, Nunn would be a proper person to apply to—I do not know whether Nunn owed him a debt—I never applied for it—I now live at No. 187, Prospect-place, Maida-hill—I have lived between No. 10 and No. 178, for the last two years—my wife has been dead since-1850—in 1851, I recollect lodging at a Mr. Nightingale's—Mrs. Austin was not living with me there—I will swear that there was not a Mrs. Austin lodging with me there—there was a lady lodging with me there—she passed as my wife, by the name of Mrs. Austin—that was a Mrs. Murray—Mrs. Murray is at present residing at No. 1, Matilda-street—she passes by the name of Mrs. Murray—I believe she did live at No. 7, Dorset-crescent, New North-road—in point of fact, I know she did—she lodged there—she passed by the name of Keymer there, her maiden name—I visited her con<lb/>stantly, and sometimes staid all night, and two nights together on one occasion; but then she was in a dying state—I believe where she lodges now, in Matilda-street, she passes by the name of Keymer—I have never represented myself</p>

               <p>there to be her brother-in-law, never, to any person, I distinctly swear I have not—I cannot say what she may have said, but I will swear distinctly that I never represented myself as any connexion whatever, more than to be the friend of Mrs. Murray—I have never heard her mention to the people of the house what connexion or relation I was of hers—she was ill while she was at Matilda-street—I went to order this ring last July—in July, 1853, I was not at Bow station—I was at the Thames police court, and that for a charitable act, and immediately moving under the direction of Mr. Cowan, the member for Edinburgh—it was on a charge of obtaining a guinea by false pretences from Mr. Frederick Soames—I did not go under any pretence—I went in my proper person, without any pretence whatever—I went according to the fact—Murray preferred such a charge against me, that is, the husband of Mrs. Murray—I had got the pound, and handed it to Mrs. Murray—that was not at the time I was living with her as her husband; she had then ceased to live with me as my wife—she was then living at South Ockenden, in Essex, with her family—Mr. Murray was a schoolmaster at South Ockenden—I believe they had four children—I believe the eldest was thirteen years of age—Murray's distress was such that he had neither clothing, nor a bed to lie upon for a period of three years—I was written to by his wife to go and see the position they were in, and to know if I could do anything to assist them out of it; and his youngest child was dying at the time—I went down—I never took Mrs. Murray to live with me as Mrs. Austin, but when I went down on that occasion I asked Murray what could be done under the circumstances—he said, "If you wait on my friend Mr. Cowan, on my behalf, and explain what you see, I think he will assist me"—he wrote a letter, which he wished me to take to Mr. Cowan—on the following day I went to the Reform Club, saw Mr. Cowan, and represented the state of distress and destitution Murray was in—he said to me, "I gave him some money to go down there some time ago; I am sorry to hear of his state of distress; what can be done?"—I said, "Sir, it appears to me that Mr. Seymour Clarke, at the King's-cross station, will have regard to your application, and in all probability you may get him a clerkship there; I will be the bearer of any letter, and will explain the circumstances to Mr. Seymour Clarke for you"—he said, "Well, that is very good"—I said, "The next consideration is that he should be put in a way to come to show his qualifications to Mr. Clarke"—he asked me how much would do it—I said I could not say exactly, but they were in a very distressed state—he said, "I will draw up a document; Mrs. Murray is highly respectable in her connexions, and I will place 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as my subscription"—I said, "Very well; I shall wait upon Mrs. Murray's friends, Fladgate and Clark, of Craven-street, and the Rev. Mr. Drummond, the executors"—I waited upon them, and upon seeing Mr. Cowan's document, Mr. Fladgate said, "Murray is a very bad man, and nothing will I notice except what emanates from the clergyman of the parish where he has been residing for the last three years"—I then said, "Under the circumstances, I will go down and bring you a certificate from the minister of the parish"—I went down, and saw both the rector and the curate—the curate said, "I am sorry to hear that Murray and his family are in such utter distress; but the fact is, he has been here for the last three years, as I am informed, and I never heard of his being outside his door; what can I say for him?"—when I explained matters, he wrote upon this document that such a person was in the capacity of village schoolmaster, and that he heard nothing against his reputation during the time he was there—he sent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was delivered</p>

               <p>to Mrs. Murray and her children in Murray's presence—the curate told me that he wanted to take his female child to have her educated by his governess, but Murray refused, and said the curate wanted his child for sinister purposes, and he would not allow her to go there—I returned with that statement to Mr. Cowan—I went to Mr. Fladgate, and from this representation he sent a guinea for the use of Mrs. Murray—the Rev. Mr. Drummond, of Charlton, her executor, also sent her a guinea—I went and delivered those sums over to her and to Murray, and as soon as he got it, with a portion of clothing that I brought him, he ran away, and left his wife and children at the Tillage of South Ockenden—the consequence was, that she was turned out of the place with her children—the money I got from Mr. Soames I handed over to her, with which she came to town—she made application to the Lambeth authorities—Murray was found, and made to take his children—Mr. Cowan gave him employment, and when he heard of the conduct he had pursued, having his name brought up at the Police Court, and all that sort of thing, he dismissed him from his place in Thames-street, and Murray left, and has not since been heard of—I have not lived with Mrs. Murray from that day to the present—it was previous to 1851, that I lived with her—I was told that Murray had been three years without a bed to sleep on, and when I went there I saw neither bed or bed clothes—he and his children slept indiscriminately on the bare floor—I did not know Murray until Mrs. Murray sent to me, stating the distress they were in—Murray was examined at the Police Court, and I called Mrs. Murray as my witness—I did not refuse to give my address at the police station—there was a remand, for the purpose of obtaining Mr. Cowan—I did refuse to give my address and for this purpose, until Mr. Soames was sent for to sign the charge sheet—I explained to the inspector that it was a vindictive and virulent proceeding on the part of Murray to prefer this charge, for which there was no foundation, and at that time I was living at No. 4, Kingsland-road—the charge sheet is there, which will show the date when I was first before the Magistrate—I was remanded to the following Tuesday, and for this purpose, I expected that Mr. Soames would come forward and sign the charge sheet, and I intended, if so, to remain under detention to make the charge of false imprisonment against me more complete than it would otherwise be—I remained in custody until the following Tuesday, and was then discharged—I cannot tell exactly how long I remained in custody, I think it was from the Saturday until the following Tuesday or Wednesday—I went to the House of Detention, Clerkenwell—when I came up again on the Tuesday, I might have refused to give any address; I could not swear that I did; Mr. Soames and Mr. Murray were examined; and I called Mrs. Murray to prove that she wrote to Mr. Soames to acknowledge the receipt of a sovereign, as Murray had at that time deserted her, and that he was not present to receive what was forthcoming—Mr. Soames said he could not swear whether he received the letter or not, but that he might have done so; and Murray admitted on that occasion before the Magistrate, that the clothing he was then wearing was what I had given to him—I recollect buying a case of pistols in the Goswell-road, for the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about two or two and a half years ago; there was the crest of a nobleman upon them; I wanted to have that removed, and my own initials put on—I applied to an engraver of the name of Halliday, to know to whom I should go to have it carefully done—he recommended me to a house in Northampton-street, and I went up to a garret there—I found some work<lb/>ing</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you understand much about gold, the standard and all that, con<lb/>nected with it?<hi rend="italic"> A.</hi> I understand that there is eighteen carat gold, and twenty-two carat—I had not purchased any article of Mr. Nunn previous to the ring being made—I recommended him two sisters as customers, to make a purchase—there was no gratuity given me for that recommendation—I do not remember recommending any other person who made any other purchase—I stated to Nunn that a third sister would be likely to make a purchase of him, if he would wait upon her and show her some of his jewellery—I was not to have a gratuity for that; the things they wanted were not to be standard gold of eighteen carats, there was no stipulation of that kind; I am sorry that there was not, for they turn out to be very bad—I recollect giving the precise directions as to the eighteen carats—I do not think I repeated my orders more than once that it was to be eighteen carats—he unquestionably said it should be so—I gave directions that he should have the ring made of standard gold of eighteen carats fine, which I believe to be the standard usually in use—I knew it from public accounts; I have seen an account given in the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi>, of the hall mark, and the usual letters used, and all that sort of thing—I cannot exactly tell you when I saw that; but I have seen it—I might have seen it before I gave the order; I had decidedly—I cannot tell you when it was, but I was always led to believe that by having any particular article of jewellery hall marked, it is beyond all question or doubt a genuine article, and that was the pro<lb/>minent reason why in getting that ring made, I wished to have it done—I said "eighteen carats fine"—the expression "fine gold" I have seen very early in life—I was never in the jewellery line—I said it was to be hall marked, and eighteen carats fine—I named that the stone was to be an onyx, but left the selection of it to Nunn—I fixed the precise weight 8 dwts.—I had not knowledge enough of jewellery to know what sort of solidity a ring of 8 dwts. would present—I fixed upon 8 dwts. because I thought the size of my finger would afford a substantial ring, and I thought that would be large and strong enough—I never weighed any jewellery, so as to know what sort of thing a ring of 8 dwts. would be; it was mere guess—when I called according to appointment, it was the prisoner who brought out the ring from the back of the premises—I put it on my finger, and fitted it, and said it would answer; I then took</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501010025"/>
               <p>it off and looked at it—the prisoner remarked to me that it was then ready to go to the Hall to be marked, which would take some time—upon my oath, the words he used were not that it would take some time to finish it—I swear distinctly, if I was to appear before my Maker, these are the words he expressed to me distinctly, that the ring was then ready to go to the Hall to be marked, and that it would take some time to do it—he did not say that it would take some time to finish—I did not inquire how long it would take to finish—he said, "I will have it done by the 10th or the 11th"—I said, "As I have no other business in this neighbourhood from where I live, I will say the 11th, and do not disappoint me"—on the 11th, after leaving Mr. Nunn's shop, I took it and had it weighed at the next surgeon's shop, Mr. Roper's, I think—in consequence of not seeing the prisoner to receive the ring from him, I went into Roper's shop, and had it weighed—there was a young gentleman in the place, and I asked him to weigh it, and he did—it weighed more than 8 dwts.; I cannot exactly say how much it weighed, but it was beyond the 8 dwts.; that was the stone and all—I had it weighed just for my own information—before I left Nunn's shop, it occurred to me (though I did not express anything) that they did their work very slovenly at the Hall, as I could discover nothing plain in the mark with the exception of the number 18 and the crown; and it also occurred to me that the particular parts that were not plain, might have occurred in the finishing of the ring after it left the Hall—I did not know what I should find besides the number and the crown—I did not know what the precise mark of the Goldsmiths' Company in London was—I had read the account in the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> long before that, but could not bear in mind what the particulars were—where the mark of Her Majesty's head ought to he was not plain—it was about three weeks ago that I went to the pawnbroker's and showed him the ring—the pawnbroker was not a friend of mine—I considered it a friendly action to give me a candid opinion—I had never seen the man before, and when I appeared at the police office, I did not know his name—I stated that I had shown it to a great many persons—some valued it at nine guineas—I stated at the police court that I had shown it to a friend of mine who had found out that it was an old mark, but he said it wad a good ring—I meant Cogswell, the pawnbroker—he told me that late in the afternoon, and I went to Goldsmiths' Hall the following day—I do not know that the very day I went to the Hall, Mrs. Murray went to the prisoner's shop—I will swear positively that I do not know it—on Sunday evening last she confessed to me that she did go there—it was about 3 o'clock in the after<lb/>noon that I went to Goldsmiths' Hall, as near as I can remember—I cannot say that Mrs. Murray had been to the prisoner's shop that very morning—I believe Mrs. Murray is not here—I saw her the same night that I had been to the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 32, Brewer-street, St. Pan<lb/>cras. On 22nd Dec., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in the New-road, and saw a truck wheeled by a boy, who I at first thought was my own son, who wheels a similar truck and dresses in the same way, which made me pay attention to him—I saw him forty or fifty yards before I came to him—I was meeting him, and walked on the kerb till I came within two yards of him, and then a gentleman passed me—I then saw a van, driven by the prisoner, behind the truck, and proceeding in the same direction—the boy was within nine inches or a foot of the kerb, which was on his left all the way—there were three horses in the van—the prisoner was sitting on the box, in front; and the load was piled up on each side of him in such a manner as he could see before him, but not behind him—he told me himself that he could see the boy before he came to him—the New-road is on an incline at that part, and they were both going down hill—just as I came to the truck, I heard a sharp crack, and saw the boy instantaneously knocked between the fore and hind wheels of the van—I hallooed directly, and held up my hands to the driver, and told him that a boy was under the wheels—he began to pull up directly—he had not attempted to stop his horses before the collision took place—he could not see the collision—the road was not obstructed in any way, to make it necessary for the prisoner to drive close to the kerb—there was plenty of room for the prisoner to have passed the truck—he pulled up as soon as he possibly could, but the van proceeded seven or eight yards before he was able to stop it.</p>

I knew the deceased, Elizabeth Hyson; the pri<lb/>soner was her daughter—seventy-two was the age upon the deceased's coffin—they had both been living with me for six years and a half; they used to quarrel very frequently at times—on Tuesday, 14th Nov., about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was alone in my front parlour; the prisoner and her mother were at home in their room, the first floor back—I could not hear anything which took place in the room unless I was listening—I did not hear any<lb/>thing, but the prisoner came down into my room very much excited, and said, "I think I have given the old devil her death blow"—I said, "What have you been doing?"—she said that she had stuck a pair of sharp pointed scissors into her mother's hand—I said, "Oh, dear! how came you to do so?"—she said, "She had been teasing me, because I was so long over my bonnet; she would interfere with me and my bonnet"—I said, "What is that on your hand?"—she said, "It is some of the old woman's blood," and took up her apron and wiped her hand—I said, "Pray do, Sophia, put on your bonnet and go out;" but before that she took up my scissors, I being at needlework, and said, "I have scratched her across the hand, in that position"—I did not think it a very serious matter, and did not go up, nor did I on the Wednesday; but on Wednesday the prisoner came and told me how bad her mother's hand was—I asked her what she had done to it; she said she had put some dripping to it—I said, "Pray do not put that to it any more, put a poultice to it;" and she did so—on Wednesday night she told me that her mother's hand was very much worse, and was full of pain—I told her to apply a warmer poultice, and to send for a doctor in the morning, and she did so—on the Thursday morning, before the doctor came, I went in to see the old lady, and I never saw such a wound in my life; it was on the back of her hand, across these three bones—the deceased said, in the prisoner's presence, "The girl has done this;" the prisoner said nothing to that—a doctor came, and attended the deceased from this time—she died on the 19th—the prisoner remained with her mother till about the Thursday week, and was then sent away by order of the doctor, and a nurse came from the workhouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I think it was on the 7th that I hurt my mother's hand, it was the day after Guy Fawkes day; my mother lived six weeks after I hurt her hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It was on the 14th, Tuesday; I am sure I saw your mother's hand on the Thursday, before the doctor came.</p>

I was sent for in Nov., to nurse the deceased; I cannot say the day—the doctor saw her every day—on the day she died, I had gone away to the house for my food a short time before, and left Ann Deeson with her; when I came back I found that she was dead—I believe that was on 19th Dec.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Kingsland-road, Shore<lb/>ditch. I know the house where the deceased lodged; it is in that parish—I was sent for on 16th Nov., and found a wound on the back of her right hand, about an inch or an inch and a half in length—there was a good deal of erysipelas about it, and a commencement of sloughing; that condi<lb/>tion kept getting worse, until she sunk on 19th Dec.—I did all I could to save her—when I first went, I found that the wound had been poulticed—I saw the prisoner on every visit; she said that she had done it—that wound was the primary cause of death, it produced erysipelas, which went on to mortification—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body, and there was no other cause of death—erysipelas is a very common effect of a wound on an old subject.</p>
               <p>

I have merely come to state her insanity—I have known her all her life—she has not been fit to live with her mother for some years past, but it was her mother's wish—she came out of Peckham mad house, she has been there twice—the last time was eight or nine years ago.</p>

She did not come out cured, but she was not bad enough to be in the asylum—it was the wish of the parish to have her under their care, but her mother wished to have her with her—before that, she was confined in Miles's mad house, and she has been in St. Lukes' mad house; that is about twelve or fourteen years ago—her mother was a poor woman for the last thirty years, and always lived on charity—fifteen or sixteen years back the prisoner was in service, and used to give a portion of her earnings to support her mother—for the last eight years the mother has been expected to die day after day, and the prisoner being so excited, they used to <hi rend="italic">worret</hi> one another—I have not been at her mother's house for the last seven or eight years, but the prisoner has been at my house over and over again.</p>

On 8th Dec, I was on duty in the New-road, about 20 minutes to 9 o'clock—I heard the report of a pistol, and saw a flash, exactly opposite the back of Mr. Moore's house, in the New-road—I was about 130 yards off; I ran there directly, and saw the prisoner running towards me—I ran across the road and met him—I saw him stopped by a man named Cope; I was about three paces off, and came up and took him into custody—there were one or two other persons round him at the time—a man named Moseley, said, "Take him in charge, he has shot a man further down"—I took him to the station, at George-street, St. Giles's—at the corner of Warren-street, he asked me if I would let him have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I said "No, there is no <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> allowed for you"—I searched him at the station, and found this dagger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the sheath of which was sewn to the lining of his body coat—in the pocket of the same coat I found twenty-four ball cartridges which all fit the pistol produced; I have tried them—they also fit this other pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was given to me by Checkley—I also found a quantity of percussion caps in the same pocket, I have not tried them to the nipples of the pistols—I also found two door keys, 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and three cigars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>the head was towards the stairs—the feet were across the passage, about a yard from the front door—I sent directly for a medical man; Mr. Carter came, and he was found to be quite dead—I assisted in carrying the body to the back parlour, and placed it on a sofa there—there was no weapon of any kind in the passage—I found this knob of lead on the floor by the par<lb/>lour door; it fits to this piece of cane, and appears to have been broken off it; part of the cane is left in the lead—there was a strong mahogany chair in the back room, not an arm chair; it was turned over and broken—this is part of it which I picked up, and which was broken off (<hi rend="italic">one of the rails of the back</hi>)—I noticed blood on the wall, about the height of the head of a man who was sitting on a chair.</p>

I was called to No. 73, Warren-street, between half past 8 and 9 o'clock—I found the body of a man lying in the passage on his back—he was quite dead—the head was lying in a pool of blood—the constable, Latto, was in the passage when I got there—the first thing I did was to examine the body to see if there were any wounds—I found three lacerated wounds on the crown of the head—they were three distinct wounds—there was a smaller wound above the right eyelid, through which blood and brains were flowing—there was another small wound on the back of his head—having made this examination, I went into the back parlour to look a candle, for we had but little light—I think there were one or two went with me—I am not quite certain that the policeman did—I think he did—I made an examination of the state of the room at that time, when we found a candle—we found a candle there, and lighted it by the one we had taken into the room—I then observed a broken chair, and splashes of blood on the sofa cover and on the chair cover—they were sprinkled with blood, covered with spots of blood, and there were large splashes of blood on the wall, about the height that the head of a man sitting in a chair would reach—I do not think I traced any blood across the room in any particular direction—I saw the constable pick up this leaden weight from the floor—I looked at it at the time—it had then the broken cane in the lead, exactly as it has now—such an instrument as this would have produced the lacerated wounds which I saw on the crown of the head—I did not notice any blood on the floor of the room—I did not look for it—I afterwards examined the head of Mr. Moore, and found a pistol bullet in the brain—it had entered by the wound above the eyebrow, and passed through the brain—death would have been instantaneous from that wound.</p>

Tidy, or something like that, and that he had given it to him for the labour that he had done—when my master spoke on the Saturday, about going up and seeing the officer, he said he should not like to get the man into trouble, that he was a man that had a family—he told my master that he was at work for an officer—he did not say, "a gentleman"—I should buy this for brass; I am not exactly a judge of what it is composed of—I have been in this establishment altogether, about ten years—I was there before Mr. Andrews came into it—I am pretty well used to the Government marks—I cannot swear to this lead, I fancy this is the same piece; I did not examine it, it was put into the scale and weighed—while I sent for my master the lead remained in the scale; I never lost sight of it until it was delivered to the policeman.</p>

I am foreman in the proof department at the arsenal, at Woolwich; it is where they prove all the cannon—the prisoner was em<lb/>ployed in the same department for above twelve months I think—this lead is very much like that which is used at the arsenal; it is used to put on the vents of the guns when it is wet weather; I have a piece with me—the pri<lb/>soner could go at all times to the place where it is kept, at any time there is a proof—to the best of my belief this is lead which was in the proof department at the arsenal shortly prior to 6th Dec.</p>

               <p>on Small Arms, in the proof departments—during my employment in the arsenal, from the middle of March last to Aug., there was a brass top of a telescope stand that was used in rifle practice under my charge in the armoury, and I believe it has been since missing—it was of the shape of this piece of brass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these pieces all formed one article—it was marked with the broad arrow in four places—I believe these pieces of brass to have formed that telescope stand—this piece has been marked in four places; two of the marks have been obliterated by a hammer, the other two are partially obliterated, but a sufficiency of the broad arrow remains for me to identify it—this round piece is a composition of brass, afterwards bronzed; it formed the swivel top which the telescope fitted into—the broad arrow is the Government mark—these screws were marked with a small arrow, but they have been hammered; there is no mark that I can swear to—to the best of my belief, this round piece is the property of the Crown, and these other pieces I believe to have formed a portion of the same article—I do not swear that they did, but they are similar—the telescope stand was in my care until I left the employment in the middle of August, and I then delivered it over safe to Bombardier M'Cullum, the non-com<lb/>missioned officer that remained in charge—he was employed with me in the small armoury where the small arms were kept—I left this telescope in the small armoury, in a press or cupboard.</p>

Q.</hi> Was this used while you were there, from March till August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was not put by with old materials, it was put for safety in a cupboard, where select rifles were kept—I have handled it almost daily; in taking out rifles it was generally on the shelf at the back, and I always had to take hold of it to prevent it from falling, and latterly I placed it in the bottom part of the cupboard for safety, and to give no trouble—there was only that one instrument of that description in the establishment—I have not seen any other of that make in the whole arsenal—it is by the marks that I swear it is Government property—I did not know the prisoner before March last—he has borne a high character in the regiment to my knowledge for that period—he has four stripes; they are marks of good conduct—if he had not behaved well, he would not have got them—I do not know that he would now have been entitled to another stripe from length of service—I am not aware of his length of service.</p>

I have a warehouse in Barrow's-place—the gate of the harness room opens into the street—there is a bar placed across the door; it goes into a square hole on one side, and on the other into a hook—any one could open the gate by inserting a knife from the outside, and lifting up the bar—the harness room leads to the stable; over that is a hay loft, in which there is an opening, which was formerly a window, and through that you could get into the warehouse, where I had rags of all descriptions—on 23rd Dec. a policeman came, and I went to my warehouse—I found the gates closed, and the bar down in its place—I got the keys of the stable, and my son and the policeman went in—neither of the prisoners had any right to be there—the carman, Durrant, should have come about 8 or 9 o'clock that morning, to clean and feed his horse—Randall had no business there at all, as we never have any work done on the sabbath.</p>
