               <p>Q. At the beginning of October last did some person come to your warehouse and cheapen a gig - A. A card was left in my absence respecting the gig on the 1st of October. In consequence of that I went to No. 51, Great Hermitage-street, I there saw the prisoner, I asked for Mr. M'Dougall, I told him in consequence of the card being left I called upon him, the prisoner said, Mr. M'Dougall was not at home, that they had seen a gig of my manufacture; he said we wish to purchase the gig, as if he himself was one of the party. He and I agreed for the price of the gig, it was to be ninety guineas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Ninety pounds or ninety guineas - A. Ninety guineas. I agreed at last it should be eighty-five guineas. He observed that their payments had been very great that quarter, and that it would be a great accommodation to him if I would take a bill at three months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Who was to accept that bill - A.Mr. M'Dougall and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. That was mentioned, was it - A. Yes, by the firm, at three months. He gave me reference of their responsibility, he referred me to Mr. Thompson of Clark-lane, he said he had dealings with that house, and that Mr. Thompson would satisfy me as to their character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of that apply to this Mr. Thompson - A. I did, I saw a person in the accompting-house; I said, I came from M'Dougall and Company in Hermitage-street, and said that they referred me to him; he observed that he had dealings with him to the amount of fifty gigs, and that they were perfectly safe; upon that I directed the gig to be delivered, and it was delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The house that you went to in Mark-lane was the house of Messrs. Moffatt's, you know Moffatt's is a respectable house, do not you - A. I do not recollect. I saw the name written on the door, Moffett, some time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you arrested the prisoner for this bill upon the gig. You understood from the prisoner that he was one of the firm of the house to which you went - A. Yes, trading under the name of M'Dougall and Company. The prisoner did not state himself to be M'Dougall; the prisoner said, M'Dougell was not at home. I arrested the prisoner for the gig as goods sold and delivered.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of directions that you received from your brother did you on the 3d of October go to No. 51, Great Hermitage-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire there for the house of M'Dougall and Company - A. At the London Docks I did.</p>
               <p>Q. From some enquiry you found M'Dougall was not at home. Was your brother with you - A. No. it was two days after; I enquired for M'Dougall and Company; I found they were not at home. I was introduced into a room, I saw a man which I verily believe to be the prisoner at the bar; I said to him sir, I am come for a bill for the gig which the servant has had, and I enquired if the gig had arrived, I think he made enquiry in the house if it had of some person and the person of whom he enquired said, no. It was very rainy afternoon, and the person which I verily believe to be the prisoner said that as it rained hard the servant would not come round with it to day; I then asked if he would procure a stamp for me to draw the bill. I said the harness was sent with the gig, and I should be glad to know if he would consent to take it as it was particularly ordered; he replied Mr. M'Dougall was not at home, and therefore he could not take upon him to say, notwithstanding Mr. M'Dougall and he were like two brothers. I then said I would draw for the amount of the gig if he would procure a stamp; I said the harness was sent with the gig, and if the harness was not returned in a day or two I should conclude that he had agreed to take it, and should send in a bill according, which I did, about the harness, I then gave a pound note, either to him or his clerk, the clerk went out and brought in a stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. What stamp was it - A. I did not look at it at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the difference - A. No, he replied he could not get change; I proposed, and it was agreed that the difference should be added to the gig. I 
               <persName id="t18120408-1-person55">drew</persName>
             the bill. That is the bill of exchange, I

             a bill, and the person which I very believe to be the prisoner took it into another room, he remained there a short time or staid away from me a short time however and brought this acceptance. This is the bill which I gave to him, and he returned it accepted, it is for ninety-pounds two shillings, the acceptance is in red ink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place upon the bill - A. Yes, he replied Mr. M'Dougell had no bankers as he had lately lost three thousands by the failure of Brickwood's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the bill ever been paid - A. Not as I know off.</p>
               <p>Q. Look stedfastly at the prisoner and tell me whether you have any doubt whether he is the person - A. I can only repeat what I have before observed, I verily believe it to be the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Gibson having any watch - A. Yes. I was going into the Bell public house the corner of Saunders's gardens, Kingsland road in January, I cannot say what day exactly, I believe it was Friday; he said he had picked up an old bit of a watch in the dust, he asked me whether I could sell it for him; he said the money should be spent in beer; I asked him to let me look at it; it was an old gilt metal watch with the glass cracked; I went to Mr. Solomon's house in Hackney-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there - A. Mrs. Solomon; I asked her if she would buy this watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else bye in the shop - A. Mr. Solomon was in a room backwards; I asked he if she would buy that watch; she said, yes; I asked her ten shillings for it; she said she would give me five shillings and sixpence for it, I said no, I did not think that was the value of it; she said she would give me another shilling; I let her have it; she gave me a five shilling and sixpenny piece, and told me to call on the next evening for the other shilling; I gave the money to Gibson, he gave me a shilling, and told me to go on the next evening and get the shilling and keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wiley. Do you know what the watch is worth - A. No.</p>
               <p>Gibson's Defence. I am innocent of the charge; what that young man has sworn is as false as God is true, and what I have been in prison for I do not know.</p>
               <p>Solomon's Defence. I am innocent. I was always instrumental to help my neighbours to their property, but never to buy it.</p>
               <p>Gibson called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Solomon called nine witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

On the 30th of last March, a quarter before eight at night, I saw three women come into the shop, and I came out of the parlour to serve them as I thought; the prisoners are two of the three women. When I came out of the parlour the other woman, who is not here, said she wished to purchase a straw bonnet; I called one of my workwomen out of the parlour to fetch one down; I had suspicion of the women, they all appeared to be in liquor. We had bonnets in the shop, as well as in the room up stairs, but they were old ones for shew. When the bonnets were brought down the woman who is not here wanted to purchase one of those that were brought down, they looked at several.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman try the bonnet on - A. Yes, and these two women stood by at the time, they appeared to know each other by their Christian names;

            . I am a constable of the parish of St. James; the bonnets and hats were delivered into my care at the watchhouse, by Mrs. Dunn's son.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at the bonnets and hats - A. This is the bonnet I took from her, it is one of the bonnets that my work-woman brought down to shew them; the shop-mark is upon it. This is the brown beaver hat I picked up in the street, it is a child's hat, I know it is mine; there has been lamp oil spilt on the crown by accident. This is the black beaver hat that the man picked up in the street, with the gold band, I know that hat, it is finished in a particular manner that many hats are not. This old bonnet was in my care to be altered, I had the altering of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of all these - A. At the lowest rate, I value them at one guinea, which is considerably under the value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your work-woman stay in the shop while the women were examining the things - A. No, she waited to see whether I wanted her to fetch any more, she returned to the parlour, when I told her I did not want any more.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very positive that you did not see her in the act of taking the bonnet - A. I saw her do nothing until the other woman, who was trying on the bonnet pulled the shawl over Burn's arm.</p>

             stand next to that woman - A. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before the woman pulled the shawl over her arm you had not perceived the bonnet - A. No, and then I perceived it, and upon my perceiving this I turned the shawl back, part of the bonnet was in the pocket-hole of her gown.</p>
               <p>Burn's Defence. I had been to the fair on Easter Monday, and as I was coming home I met the young woman who is not here, and this young woman with her; the other said she was going to buy a bonnet, and was going to Greenwich the next day; she asked me to go with her, which I did. We went into the shop, she tried on several bonnets, I did not try on any, she tried that one on, and gave it to me to hold, she said she liked it the best of any. I had not it in my hands many minutes till she laid down another bonnet that the prosecutrix gave her to try on; and the two bonnets that fell upon the floor, I pointed them out to the lady. There were a good many bonnets on the counter, I did not take any of them myself. And the bonnets that were found at the door, the woman that went out was as likely to have them as me.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was coming down Titchbourne street, I met the woman that is not here; she said she was going to buy a bonnet to go to Greenwich fair on the next day. About a year and a half ago she lived next door to me, that is how I came to know her, she asked me to go into the shop with her to buy a bonnet and I went in. I saw nothing of the transaction, but the gentlewoman stopped me coming out of the shop, that is all I know, I did not take any thing.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner came to me on the 9th of November. On the 27th of December I was awoke by the prisoner, seeing her in the room, I said is that you Betcy, she said yes, she said she wanted the keys to open the shop, I then resorted to my pockets, and gave her a key, I meant to give her the key of the shop, it turned out to be the key of the coal-hole; she said do not you get up, I will make the kettle boil and call you, soon after that I heard a violent noise at my brother's door, I called my husband to let him out, and when they went down stairs they said Betcy, the prisoner was not down stairs. I missed some things that I had on on Sunday, and some I had on on Christmas day. I missed two gowns and a petticoat, and a black velvet spencer, that is all at that time that I missed out of my room. I went immediately and opened my box, and found that was rifled, and every thing was taken away.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner in Haydon-street, Willow-street, on Saturday the 14th of March, as she was going into the house where she said she lodged, at No. 13; when I stopped her I asked her if she would go back for me to see whether she had got any things of these people that said she had robbed them; she was upon the step of the door when I took her, she said she never would return there any more. I told her if she would not go there she must go to the watchhouse with me, and there I must search her. I took her to St. James's watchhouse; I searched her, upon her head was that cap.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know this cap, it was taken out of my box, I made it myself, I had it on the day after Christmas day.</p>
               <p>Wilding. I asked the prisoner to come back with me to the room to let me search it, she said she would not, she gave me this key, and said, I might search it myself. The prosecutrix and I went with the key, we searched the room; I opened the room door with the key the prisoner gave me, the first thing we found was this apron, laying on a chair. In a drawer, a sleeve of a gown, and a number of pieces that belonged to the same gown; this habit shirt was in a box that was unlocked, and this cap, the prosecutrix said the lace was hers but not the cap. I then went and asked the prisoner for the keys of the trunk that was locked to prevent breaking in, she told me I should find them between the sacking and the bed, I found them there. On the Sunday morning I went again, and opened the box in the presence of the landlord, I opened the box, and found eleven duplicates, six duplicates of Mr. Turner's, and some of Mr. Harrison's. These are the things that I got from the pawnbrokers, in consequence of these duplicates they delivered them up to me.</p>
               <p>Todd. I have the duplicates. This is a duplicate for a gown, pledged for four shillings, I delivered up the gown to Wilding, it was pledged by a woman in the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my gown, I lost it out of my box on the 27th of December, I never lent it to her, I had seen it the day before in my box.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jenkins. In consequence of them duplicates that were produced to you by Wilding, and which you have now in your hand, did you deliver up any thing - A. Yes, one of the duplicates is written by myself, of a gown for three shillings, pledged by John Graves. This is the gown.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is mine, she took it off the nail, it was there the day before, all the property produced by the officer is mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. He got up and ran away - A. Yes, and on his running away I got up and ran after him, calling out stop thief, as much as I possibly could; I never lost sight of him, when I got up until he was taken by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he ran before he was taken by the watchman - A. About a furlong he went down a dark street, and turned on the right hand into Thornaugh-street, there he was taken</p>

               <p>Q. Did he look at them, or the woman - A. He looked at most himself; they bought a gown, and left two shillings, saying they would call the next morning for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bought it - A. Both; it was for the woman; the woman desired the man to pay the two shillings; I think it was the woman that desired me to cut it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the two shillings - A. The man, by the woman's desire.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the gown come to - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave the shop then or not - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing while they were there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people was there in the shop at the time you were serving them - A. There was one woman, she lived in Kensington; she was in the shop at the same time as the prisoners; the other woman was waiting to be served; none of my people was in the shop besides myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards miss any thing - A. Yes, about three minutes after they were gone. As soon as they left the shop I went to put one of the prints in the window that the woman took out and throwed on the counter, and when I went to the window to put the print in its place, I missed two pieces of Irish linen from the window. The woman had been to the window while she was there, and throwed it for the man to look at on the counter. That piece of print lay on the smallest piece of Irish, I put them in the window that morning. When I missed the pieces of Irish I called my sister, and pursued the prisoners; I went towards Hammersmith; my brother-in-law met them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the property afterwards found - A. Yes, by my brother,

               <p>JAMES BALL. I am brother-in-law to Mr. Breeze. I pursued the prisoners and overtook them by Knight-bridge, they were both together; I procured a constable; I took them and told them they must go back with me to Kensington: I gave the man into the constable's hands and walked with the woman to the watchhouse. They wanted me to go to have something to drink at the public-house, and gave me the bundle, the woman did, they were taken to the watch-house; they were searched, and two pieces of Irish linen were found upon the man. When I caught hold of the man he had got the two pieces of Irish tied up in a shawl under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them from him - A. No, I did not. He carried them himself to the watchhouse, and then the constable searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. And were they delivered up to the constable at that time - A. They were; his name is Winter.</p>
               <p>MR. WINTER. I am a constable of St. Margaret's parish. The prisoners were delivered into my charge the two pieces of Irish linen were under the man's arm tied up in a shawl; I took them from him, I kept them till the evening, and then I delivered them to Gillmore.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they ever out of your possession - A. Never.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. I am an officer. I have had these pieces of linen in my possession from the time that Winter delivered them to me; they were delivered to me in the prisoner's presence at the office, Winter marked them before he gave them to me, and Mr. Breeze wrote his initials.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these two pieces and tell me whether you know either of them - A. Yes, they both of them have my shop mark.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them both before you missed them - A. That very morning I put them myself on the window; I can speak positively to both pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080009"/> Q. What is the value of them - A. I suppose between four and five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the cost price above forty shillings - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man ever near that part of the window where these things were - A. Not close; the woman was there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was never near enough to the window to take them himself, was he, to take them himself - A. No. The woman was near the window while her husband was looking at the print at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were searched - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Winter. Had they any money - A. No, except two or three halfpence I found on one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. There was no alarm at the time in your shop that any thing was taken was there - A. No.</p>
               <p>William Webster's Defence. My wife, and I were walking together down the road, a man came up to me, he said my friend, will you hold this for me while I go and get a glass of liquor: I said, I will. I put it under my arm. When the person laid hold of me, and said you must go with me, you have stolen that property: Me! said I, there is the man coming out of the house that gave me the property. No, he said, you are sufficient, you have got the property, and with that they hurried me to the watchhouse. That is true, so help me God, and my wife is as innocent as me concerning the robbery; I did not know it was stolen, had I known it was stolen or any thing of the kind I would not have had any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Susanna Webster's Defence. My lord, my husband and me had some words, and I had a very bad arm; my husband asked me if I would have a gown; I said, yes; he had money to pay for the gown; as we came from the shop we were going to the hospital to have my arm dressed, and coming along the man said would my husband have something to drink, my husband would not. This man went in to get three half quarterns of gin, he gave my husband the bundle to hold. He shewed the officer the man. They would not take him, therefore we are as innocent my lord as you are.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Ball. When you took them what did they say - A. They pointed to another man that was at the public-house door, and said, that was the man that gave them the bundle, but I saw him with the bundle from where I first overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him with the bundle before they got up to that public-house - A. Yes, walking quite unconcerned.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from the other side of the public-house when you first saw them - A. About a dozen yards; I had seen them on the Kensington side of that public-house nearly an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them first was that man in their company or not - A. I do not recollect seeing more than the two.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took them were they walking on, or were they stopping - A. Walking on, and there was no man with them then.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see these pieces of Irish while they were in the shop - A. Yes; I saw one while they were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before then had you seen the other piece - A. I had not finished dressing the window untill twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had a shawl with them - A. I think the woman had a shawl on.</p>

            . I am clerk in the house of Cox, Merle, and Co. gold and silver refiners, Little Britain. On Friday the 28th of February last, the prisoner brought these pieces of gold to me, and offered them for sale; seeing it was unmanufactured gold I asked him if they were his own; he said he found it in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell; I told him I was sure it was the property of some workmen, I should make enquiries, and by that means I should find the owner; I said I should go to Goldsmith's Hall, and make enquiries if he would come the next day they would be glad to reward him, he said he would come the next day; he did not come, he was brought there; I have no doubt in the world about the prisoner's person, nor never had; he told me that he lived at No. 33, Goswell-street, he gave me the name of Watson.</p>

I was attacked by three men, two of them took hold of my collar, Skippey on the right hand side; I cannot say which of the three took the watch from me, they were all present at the time the watch was taken away, one of them stood before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they take your watch - A. They pulled it out of my pocket; I laid hold of the middle one by my right hand, I received a severe cut in my right hand, and one of my fingers bled very much for sometime, and then I had a violent blow on the knee, which brought me to the ground; I cannot say which of them struck me with the bludgeon on my knee, I have been lame about three weeks. They made their escape as soon as I called out stop thief, one towards Fleet-market, and two towards Holborn. A gentleman coming along at the end of Field-lane gave Skippey a blow and turned him into the hands of the patrols, and he was taken to the watchhouse by the patrols. The watch was picked up by the watchman and brought to the watchhouse. I am sure that Skippey is the same man that had hold of me by the collar; I was very lame, I called out stop thief very loud, one of the watchmen threw his stick at him, he was running without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the watchhouse you was sure he was the same man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Were you quite sober at the time - A. Upon my oath I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before that night - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at your club - A. About nine o'clock. We had a shillingsworth of rum and water, and a pot of half and half between three of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in company with you - A.Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was only three men that stopped you - A. No, there were two women just by, whether they belonged to them I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you or have you not said there was a fight in the street at the time that you lost the watch - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You fell in consequence of the injury offered you - A. Yes, by the blow on the knee. I lost sight of the person that brought me to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it that you saw him at the watch-house - A. About three or four minutes; the blow was given me just after they got the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that you was collared - A. Yes, and after that I received a blow on the knee. The watch was brought in the watchhouse by one of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BROWN. I am one of the patrols of St. Andrew's, Holborn. On the night of the 4th of last month just going upon duty at twelve o'clock, I heard the cry of stop thief at the time of hearing the cry I was going along Shoe-lane, in consequence of hearing the cry of stop thief I returned into Holborn, I saw people running down Field-lane, I made the best of my way down the lane, the prisoner was coming towards Holborn, there was a gentleman behind him, called out stop thief; when the prisoner came towards me I took him, I put my hand upon his shoulder, and the point of my foot against his and tripped him up and brought him to the ground; I took him by the collar and took him to the watch-house. At the watchhouse he said, gentlemen, I have not got any property belonging to any person excepting my own; he took his watch out, he said, gentlemen, this is the only watch I have got, it is my own. The prosecutor was asked by the constable of the night whether he could identify the prisoner, at that moment he could not identify the prisoner. One of the watchmen understanding that a hat had been lost, returned to the spot where the prisoner fell, or was knocked down; the watchman returned and asked the prosecutor if he should know or give the description of his watch, he gave the description of the watch, and further stated that he had the maker's name and number in his pocket book; the description answered to the watch, and then immediately he recognised the prisoner. The prisoner was given in charge and conveyed to the poultry compter.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN. I am a watchman; I was just finishing my round, about a quarter past twelve on the 5th, and coming Holborn Hill, I heard a cry of stop thief, I ran down the hill in order to meet the person, and just as I came to the corner of Field-lane I saw a man running as fast as he could without a hat, I went four doors down Field-lane, I saw the young man down on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that young man - A. Henry Skippey. The patrol was just rising him up off the ground, I helped to assist to raise him up, we conveyed him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the man that you saw running without his hat - A. I believe he is the very same; after being taken to the watchhouse he was searched, he pulled out a watch, he said it was his own property, his father gave it him. They searched him, no property could be found, both the prosecutor and the prisoner lost their hats; I returned to the spot where the prisoner fell, to see whether I could see either of the hats, being late at night, and in looking for the hat I found the watch out of the case. I took the watch to the watchhouse, I asked if the gentleman had lost his watch, the prosecutor answered, I have lost my watch; he said it was a plain silver watch, a small steel chain, and a metal seal; the constable of the night looked at the watch, and saw the maker's name exactly as the prosecutor had stated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not the prosecutor seem as though he had had a good share of liquor - A. I do not think he was the worse for liquor.</p>

             the patrol and I came out of the watchhouse; we were both talking at the end of Shoe-lane, Brown left me and went up Shoe-lane; we heard the cry of stop thief; I called him, he came back; we both ran across the way; we saw some man running on Snow Hill, he turned down Field-lane. We turned down Field-lane about three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080011"/> four doors down I saw the prisoner returning without his hat, he was returning back again from Field-lane into Holborn; Brown met him, whether he struck or pushed him I do not know; the prisoner fell, and immediately he fell Brown took him by the collar; I assisted to lift him up; he said he had done nothing. We asked him what he ran away for, he said he thought a press gang was after him. On going into the watchhouse with him he said he had lost his hat. When we got into the watchhouse the watchman went to look for the hat, and while he was gone two of the patrols brought the hat, which was found at the end of Fleet-market. The watchman on his return came into the watchhouse and asked what gentleman had lost his watch; he said he had lost his, it was a plain silver watch, a steel chain, and the maker's name so and so, which he had got in his pocket book. The watch was produced, and it answered the description that he gave.</p>
               <p>Chapman. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>

I told him I saw him come out of the shop with it, I thought he did not come by it honestly. Mr. Galley immediately sent for a constable to take him to the compter. I never lost sight of him after I first saw him come out of the shop until I caught him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of March, about half past seven o'clock, on going up Wood-street I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way to where the cart was, on the same side that I was on, and then he crossed over the way to the cart that was standing at the door; he looked up at the number or the name of the cart; I saw him take something out from behind the horse in the front of the cart I presume it must be. He came away seemingly talking to himself, he came away from the cart. The cart was about two doors from Bull's Head passage; he turned up Bull's Head passage; I was close to his heels; I said to my partner, Jem, here; I catched hold of the prisoner's jacket at the hind part, he immediately dropped the bundle; I said, Jem, you pick it up; I jumped over the bundle; the prisoner got away; I pursued him into Oat-lane, he was not a yard before me the whole time, I called out stop thief, and he called out stop thief as lustily as I did, and just as he got to the top of Bull's Head passage; I struck him over the legs with a stick, he fell down and rolled over two or three times, and called out stop thief the whole time, I got hold of him; he got up again and said he would not be taken, he said he was an honest man.</p>
               <p>JAMES TOMPKINS. I was in company with Waugh at the time. This is the bundle the prisoner dropped in the passage, I took up the bundle, and followed him. We secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Waugh. Did you see any other man in the passage besides him - A.No.</p>
               <p>Nichols. That is the bundle that was in my cart; I delivered nineteen instead of twenty, this made the twentieth.</p>

The watchmen were perfectly upon their duty. Before he was taken I saw him throw away the watch and almost immediately he was in the custody of the watchmen.</p>

I am very glad that question is asked, I was desirous of making it known to the Court that their was no stick, no bludgeon or knife, merely running violently against me and at the same time snatching out the watch; there was no blow, a mere shove, I conceive it was to put me of my guard, it was by no means to do me any personal injury.</p>

On Friday, the 27th of March, about one o'clock, my boy had gone out and locked the warehouse door which is up one pair of stairs, and left the key outside of the door; I was up one pair of stars higher, in a sitting room. A very short time after the boy had gone out I thought I heard a noise in the warehouse, I went to the top of the stairs, I observed the warehouse door open, the prisoner came out of the warehouse and went down stairs, I called out, who is there, what do you want, she made no reply; I then followed her down stairs as quick as I could, and caught her just at the bottom of the stairs, I put my hand on her shoulder and turned her about; I examined her apron and found three pound and a quarter of cotton that she had taken out of our warehouse, my warehouse is up one pair of stairs, and the upper part of the house I occupy myself, the lower part of the house is let to another gentleman, it is shut up.</p>

            . On the 1st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080013"/> March a little after ten at night I was coming out of my own door on the wharf, I saw somebody outside of the barges and heard the rattle of coals; I got a gun and went on the craft where the prisoners were. The prisoners were in the barges, on the river Thames, I went on the barges, it was near low-water, when I came where the prisoners were I saw a person taking coals out of the barge, he had got a basket of coals, and seeing of me he jumped into a boat with the basket of coals; I told him to stop or else I would certainly fire; both of them endeavoured to conceal themselves under the deck of the boat It was a decked boat they were in called a Peter boat, with a good many coals. I jumped into the boat to them, immediately I got into the boat they put out the sculls and rowed away with me in the boat; as soon as I get my feet to stand at the bottom of the boat where there were a good many coals, I demanded them to stop, and if they would not leave off rowing I would shoot them; telling them that my piece was loaded that I had in my hand; with that the prisoner Blake began to throw the coals over board which were in the boat, I told them it was of no use to throw the coals overboard, I was determined I would take them; the prisoner Darke left off rowing at that time, and begged the other to leave off, saying it was of no use to resist any more. I ordered them to row me on shore, towards Blackfriars-bridge, a young man whom I had left on shore came in a boat along side of us; I then told them I would not trouble them to row me to Blackfriars-bridge, to row me to where I came from, they rowed me back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of coals were there on board - A. Twelve bushels and odd in that boat and the lighter where I saw the prisoners at work; both lighter and coals belonged to Mr. Holl and Bevan.</p>
               <p>Blake's Defence. I was rowing a west country barge out of Pool.</p>
               <p>Darke's Defence. We rowed up to the Pool, there was a west country barge wanted to be rowed up to Putney, they gave us some coals to do it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On the 9th of March I had a search warrant delivered to me; I went with the warrant to No. 8, Upper Marybone-street; I went up to the two pair of stairs back-room, I there saw the prisoner and the woman that belonged to the room; the prisoner lodged there with the woman that rented the room; I asked the woman whether she rented the room; she said she did; the prisoner was present and heard it. The woman said her name was Robinson; she told me the prisoner lodged with her; I asked the prisoner how many boxes she had in the room; she pointed to two boxes and a hat box; I searched her boxes, the keys laid upon the boxes, I asked her whether them were the keys, she said, yes; I opened the boxes, I found several napkins, the gowns were in a bundle behind the bed; six handkerchiefs were in the box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any petticoats - A. Not in the boxes. Mrs. Woodward has part of the property, they have been delivered up to her by order of the magistrate. I have the three gowns here, the prisoner produced them herself, they were behind the bed, and six petticoats with the sattin one.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. We understand that part of the property was delivered up to you by order of the magistrate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the articles, how many gowns are there - A. Three, and a petticoat; the napkins and handkerchiefs were delivered up; I can swear positively to these articles, they had been in that box two or three years, I had not made any use of them for that time, and every thing that I lost was from that box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress came for me at the House of Correction, and offered to take the sum of four pounds to pay the expences of the Bow-street officer; I told her that I had not got the money, but would consider of it; she asked if I had not got a friend that I could send to to give her the money; a friend of mine went to speak to her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever known him before - A. No. A man brought them to me, he told me he would put something into my pocket if I would do it; I was to have the crimpage of them; I gave security for nine pounds, that was the advance of their wages, for which I was to receive six pounds of Mr. Solomons, I was to put them on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both the men willing to go on board - A. Yes, very willing seemingly, they were in sailor's dresses. They were brought to me on Friday the 20th of March, I took them to the office to receive the two months advance, and I gave security for them, and then I took them to my house, I told them to go and buy clothes and other necessaries to go down to the ship that night, they then gave me two pounds to buy them two beds; I told them to buy them themselves. This was about about four o'clock. I then went with them as far as Fleet-market, the prisoner then told me to go into a public-house and wait there until he came back with his things; I went in and waited about an hour, he came in and said, am not I an honest man? he called for something to drink; he said he had got no clothes, he had got to go to Temple Bar: I and the other man accompanied him; this was about half past five o'clock in the evening. When he got me there he said it was only a little further; he took me to a place called the Coal-yard, St. Giles's, and then went into a public-house, and said he had got a duplicate of a watch there, and when he was in there a great many people knew him, some called him Daly and others John.</p>
               <p>Q. They seemed to be his intimate acquaintances, did they - A. Yes, he then sat down, and had a game of cards with the other people, I was in the room and the other man with me; I said, do not sit down at cards, this is a Friday, and my sabbath is a short day, make haste and go home. This was about half after six o'clock, it was then dusk. One of the men pretended to know me, and asked me to have something to drink; I told him I would rather not; he said what makes you so down hearted; I told him I had enough to be down hearted, to be security for nine pounds for these two men, that was a handful of money these times; he then said never fear, I will go and speak to them, and hear what they say; I know they mean to go. He went and spoke to them, and came back to me again.</p>
               <p>Q. The stranger did - A. Yes, he said, I have spoke to them, I know they mean to go. The other man said, I want to go backward; I told him he might go backward if he wanted; the stranger said, do not you know there is a back door, go along after him; I was going after him, I saw the prisoner pass me, go out of the front door; I then went after the prisoner, and caught him in the Coal-yard, at the corner of a stable yard, I got hold of him by the collar, and he laid hold of me, and pulled me down, and pulled my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody in the coal-yard at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080015"/> - A. No; there was a jew cleaning a horse in the stable; the prisoner got away, then the jew told me to get out of the yard, they were all Irish that lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that the prisoner got from you, and run into the stable - A. Yes, in the corner of the yard that he knocked me down, he ran into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get off again - A. That I do not know; about five minutes after this I saw the prisoner come down the yard in long clothes hugging a girl round the neck. I would not leave the yard; I gave a girl sixpence to fetch an officer, the officer came; the prisoner saw me, and run off to the Rose and Crown public-house in Broad-street, I ran after him, there was a serjeant of Marines there, I wanted him to keep him while I went for a constable; the publican of the house said, Daly, go away; he knew him, and the serjeant knew him, he said, Daly go away. The landlord called Daly of oneside, and put him into the street; he ran up a little court by the side of the public-house, I ran after him, he got a matter of forty of his countrymen and women, they knocked me down, kicked me, and rolled me in the mud; they used me very ill. I came out and enquired for the officer of the parish; a gentleman told me to run up the street, there was Bow-street. I went to Bow-street, and brought three officers. We went to several houses, the prisoner was found and secured.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into this coal-yard you had no idea of his robbing you - A. No, I thought he was an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. In the coal-yard upon your catching hold of him he threw you down - A. Yes, and pulled my watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out then - A. No, there were no houses, only a parcel of stables there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. You told my lord that you were a dealer in toys - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not a crimp then - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the habit of giving security for seamen - A. I have done it before. It is very seldom I go to the India House, I do sometimes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What is the name of the public-house that the landlord told him to go away - A. The Rose and Crown.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LACK. I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 20th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor came to the office, he had been terribly rolled in the mud, he said he had been knocked down by two men, and robbed of his watch; I took him into the office to the clerk, and under the direction of the clerk I and Mantz went with him to St. Giles's. We found both the men, he pointed them out, and in their presence he exclaimed of their having robbed him. I told the prisoner what I wanted him for, he resisted my searching him, I was obliged to strike him; he was quiet after that. I searched him, and upon him I found fourteen or fifteen shillings; he denied knowing the prosecutor until he was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. You have heard the prosecutor say that there was only one man that knocked him down - A. To me he said he had been robbed of his watch by two men, and that he had been advancing money for them. We took both the men into custody, the other man was discharged. The publican of the Rose and Crown has left that house, he keeps the Cock in ottenham-court-road.</p>

            . Q. Where do you live - A. In Old Tothill-street, Westminster. On the 2d of March I was going home from Tottenham-court-road I was coming up King-street, Westminster, about five minutes past twelve at night as nigh as I could guess, I met the prisoner and another man in the street. The prisoner said what a nice morning; I knew nothing of him before; I was alone; I answered a very nice morning. We walked till we came to the corner of Great George-street, they turned back with me nothing more was said, they walked with me to Great George-street, just at the corner of King-street which leads into Great George-street, then the prisoner said can we get nothing to drink; I said I would not have any. We walked along past the ruins to the sessions house. When we went into the ruins where the houses were pulled down; the prisoner laid hold hard of me by the breast; he clapped his hand to my coat, then he took hold of the seal of my watch chain; he pulled the watch out, and broke the swivel of the watch; I took hold of him by the neck handkerchief, and by his throat; I sung out murder.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the string or chain and seal - A. He took the ribbon and seal in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that - A. Yes; I saw the seal and ribbon in his hand. When I cried out murder the man that was along with him turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. What he had gone on a little before - A. Yes, he gave me two blows, my hat was cut with the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the other man - A. And the prisoner struck me in the side, and in the face with his fist. Mr. Hilliard came up at the time I was crying out. After Mr. Hilliard came up he struck me twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did - A. The prisoner. Mr. Hilliard called for the watch. I kept hold of the prisoner till the watch came up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner secured when the watch came - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the chain of your watch or ribbon - A. I took it out of his hand when the watchman came up, I have got it here, he had it in his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080016"/> then. I had seen it in in his hand before that.</p>

               <p>Q. You say your coat was torn by him - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you have no doubt that he had hold of you in that way when he snatched your watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the swivel was broke - A. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take the ribbon and seal from him until the watchman came up - A. Not till after the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now produce it then - A. This is the ribbon and seal, there is no impression upon it, I bought it for gold, I gave a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was secured I suppose and taken to the watchhouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. This you say was about twelve o'clock at night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the man at the bar I think you described it to be in King-street, near to the ruins - A. Yes, in the middle of King-street.</p>

               <p>Q. And till that moment that he made a snatch at your watch you were under no apprehension - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You received no blows untill the man had snatched the watch - A. No, he laid hold of me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been since you left your own home - A. I had been at a friend's house, I had some supper, and some beer; I was neither drunk nor sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in this court before in any shape - A. Yes, I have been.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever stand at that bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What was that for - A. Not for felony.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not there a scuffle between that man and you, and a quarrel, and some blows struck by you first - A. No, I never struck him at all.</p>

            . I was at that time a clerk in the Registery office, I lived at that time in Johnson's-row, Westminster. I was returning to my mother in Howland-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your way lead you through King-street - A. Yes, it had just gone twelve; I observed three men just entering on the ruins at the sessions house, I avoided the ruins because I saw three men go on there; at the same time I heard the cry of murder, it proceeded from the place in the ruins where I had seen the three men; I hastened to the spot, as I approached one of the three ran away. When I got up the prisoner was struggling with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the prisoner and Carney were two of the men - A. Yes. When I got up the prisoner was striking him, I saw him strike him two blows; I caught hold of the prisoner's skirt of his coat, and desired him to desist, he told me that Carney had accused him of robbing him; Carney answered that he had attempted to take his watch, and that he had got the seal, I saw the seal in the prisoner's hands, it had a ribbon to it. Seeing no other help at hand I left the prisoner and called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had Carney hold of him or not - A. He had, by the neck; I called the watchman, he came, and the prisoner was secured. After the watchman came up I saw Carney take the ribbon and seal from the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner struck him after you came up - A. Yes, he struck him two blows with his fist after I came up.</p>
               <p>Q.What state was Carney in after you came up - A. He had been drinking, but he was not thoroughly intoxicated.</p>
               <p>- NEALE. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time you heard the alarm - A. In King-street, close to my box I heard murder called, I hastened to the place where I heard the voice, I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner with his right hand on the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hilliard there - A. Yes, I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar, I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. You are sure of the prisoner laying hold of you by the breast of your coat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the same instance you have admitted that you had been drinking - A. I had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you senses enough to take notice of every thing that happened in the the order of time in which it happened. You are very positive of your being laid hold of by your breast, and positive that your coat was torn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Do not you know that there is a forty pounds reward if this man is convicted - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I claim a few minutes of attention for the charge that that is laid against me. On the night in question I was returning home. I live in Westminster; I was returning home through King-street, Westminster, on my passing by the prosecutor he jostled against me, I thought it was an insult offered me, and I did push him again, he was near falling at the time, he recovered, and said, you villain you want to rob me; I said I am quite sure you will find me a person of quite a different description; he seized me that moment by the handkerchief, and by the throat, and held me in that situation by the handkerchief and throat, I called out and struck him three or four blows, a person passing by at the time told the prosecutor to let go my collar and I would go quietly to the watchhouse, and answer any charge preferred against me, and I immediately surrendered myself into the custody of the watchman without attempting to make any resistance. Now, my lord, and gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080017"/> of the Jury, if I had been a person of that description there was only one watchman I never would have been taken in that way. I appeal to you whether I would have surrendered myself in the way I did; I shall rest myself satisfied with the judgment of the Court, and I am sure I shall get justice in this way. This prosecutor has acted with the greatest duplicity to me, and said he would not hurt me, he has persuaded my friends not to come forward, saying that he would not hurt me, that I was in no danger at all, he went to my father's house, told him I need not have my friends come forward, he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Have you used any means to keep away this man's friends - A. I have not, his father is in Court.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 25th of February last in consequence of some information I received. I went to a public house in White Hart-yard, Drury lane; I there saw the prisoner in company with some other women drinking, this was about three o'clock in the afternoon, I took her and the other women into an adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you heard of Mrs. Graham's robbery at the time - A. I had, but I did not know what I was enquiring into led to this. I asked each of them separately, if one of them had not some articles of plate about them; I then asked the prisoner if she had not got some plate about her person, she denied having any such articles, and I proceeded to search her; she then became alarmed, and on searching her I found four silver table spoons in one of her pockets, wrapped up in a towel and a handkerchief; upon my asking her from whence she got them, she said she had them from a person who was with her in a hackney coach, she did not know any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say of a gentleman's servant - A. No. They all seemed so much intoxicated at the time the prisoner was taken care of till the next day when she was identified, that is all that past then. From the initial G upon the plate, it struck me then that it was the property that had been stolen from the house of Mrs. Graham, upon enquiry it so turned out. She was then committed till the next day, she was examined the next day or the day after. I produce the spoons, they have remained with me ever since, in my custody. When I first saw her at the public house she was in a bed-gown, she said she had cut her gowns up to make aprons.</p>
               <p>Q. to Isaac. You said that you found some part of the prisoner's wearing apparel - A. Yes, I did, I rolled them up and put them into my own drawer, I gave them to Mr. Adkins the officer, Adkins gave it to Mantz, and on the Sunday morning it was given to Lavendar.</p>
               <p>Lavendar. On the Tuesday morning the wearing apparel was given to me by Adkins.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080018"/> Q. Open that bundle - A. Here is a gown, apron, and two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Isaac. These are the same that I found on the Sunday morning, I know them by the pattern, they are the same that I found in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the table spoons - A. There is four table spoons, I know them by the G upon them, they are such spoons as Mrs. Graham had, I believe them to be hers; the four desert spoons, I believe them to be Mrs Graham's; three forks, they are marked in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I met this man it was nigh two o'clock in the morning, I was at a watering-house in St. Giles's, he asked me to go with him to Gower-street, Bedford-square. The watchman passed us he said all is well, I said what have you to do with the watchman, you told me you had no family; he took me down into the pantry, he gave me a shilling, it was a bad one, he poured out a glass of brandy, he said it was his mistress's; I said if he did not give me the five shillings I begged to go; he told me he had no more money, if I made any alarm he would charge the watchman with me, he gave me another glass of brandy which intoxicated me; he put something into my hand rolled up in a bundle, and told me to keep that, and in a night or two he would see me again; he told me to go up stairs, he had left the door open, to unlatch the door and go out at the street door before the watchman saw me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q to Isaac. Did you give her a glass of brandy - A. Yes, shrub and brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any thing rolled up in a bundle - A. To the best of my knowledge, no.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these four spoons - A. The table spoons, I think the value of them near six pounds, the desert spoons about thirty shillings altogether, and the forks about fifteen shillings a-piece.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. After you had been drinking with this woman, were you able of understanding what you were about - A. I had been drinking, but I never should give my mistress's property, I had two watches of my own, I should have given them away.</p>

On Saturday April the 4th, I mentioned my suspicion to the partners, I had an opportunity on Saturday night of detecting the prisoner. Before I went into the cellar the prisoner was in the cellar, I called the prisoner up, and sent him with a bag which was standing about the cellar into another part of the warehouse, with a view of going down into the cellar myself. I went into the cellar and concealed myself behind a cask, and presently the prisoner came into the cellar and took two or three bottles off a shelf in the cellar, I supposed them to be castor oil, it was from a place where there ought to be nothing but castor oil. When he had taken them from a shelf he wrapped them up in paper and then put them into his breeches, he left a lamp standing upon a cask, and came up stairs in the dark, and I remained on the premises until eight o'clock. When the prisoner had gone about twenty yards from the door an officer secured him, which we had procured for the purpose, he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No. I did not. I observed that he walked very wide and stradling; I walked close behind him for about ten yards further, then I laid hold of him and asked him what he had got about him, he said nothing, what did I want with him; I told him I was an officer, and insisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080019"/> upon searching him; I put my hand between his legs, then he began to make some resistance; I told him I would knock him down if he took any thing out of his pocket; he was putting his hand into his breeches; I then took from his breeches three bottles, I asked him what it was; he said, oil; I asked him if he was not a porter in some house; he said, no, he was a jobbing porter in the street. I secured him and took him into the watchhouse; I further searched him, and only found his wages which he had received. I took him to the Compter, I there asked him where he lived, he said in Old-street-road; I then went to his lodgings in Draper's-buildings, No. 21, Old-street-road; I there saw his wife, I asked her leave to search the place; I found this quantity of soap of different descriptions, and a piece of rhubarb, and this roll of oil-skin. These are the three bottles that I took from his person, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What soap is it - A. Castile soap.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 2d of March I was walking past Mr. Gedge's door, I perceived the prisoner come out of his door, he had something under his apron, I walked after him about forty yards; I asked him what he had got under his apron, he said nothing; I insisted upon seeing whether he had or not, he lifted his apron up; I perceived that he had got this ham concealed in his breeches; I took the ham from his breeches, and took him back to Mr. Gedge's warehouse, I asked Mr. Gedge if he knew any thing of this man, he said, yes, he worked for him some time. This is the ham.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my ham.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man is not here that took the ham from me, it was taken by one Thompson, it was not taken from me by Wesley; a man gave it me at the corner of Pudding-lane. It was through the instigation of Thompson that that ham was given to me.</p>
               <p>Wesley. I saw him come out of the house, Thompson had nothing to do with him first nor last.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>MARY GARDNER. I work for Mr. Courtney in the Old Jewry. On Saturday evening the 7th of March the prisoner came to my place, and said between Mrs. Smith's house and mine, she said some person threw these things out of a window, she heard them fall on the stones; there was an S upon the spoon, it gave me uneasiness for fear it should belong to Mrs. Smith. On the Tuesday I found out it was her mistress's property.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. I am a constable. I was sent for on Tuesday to go to Mr. Smith's house, these things laid on a table a silver spoon, a pair of stockings, and a necklace; Mrs. Gardner produced them; I was desired to take the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Gardner. What did the prisoner bring to you besides the spoon - A. She brought a few things which she said her mistress threw out of a drawer; the stockings were there, and the necklace she gave to my little girl; I took them all to Mrs. Smith; she said some person threw the tea-spoon out of the window, she heard it jink on the stones.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Smith did not behave to me like a mistress, she behaved very dirty to me indeed. I was nursing the child, the child dropped the spoon out of the door, I picked it up and put it in my pocket. I did not know that the child dropped it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he remain down - A. Three quarters of an hour. When he came up again he passed me, and I looked at him. I then lost my partner, I waited till he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his appearance - A. I observed that he was loaded, I was sure of that. I followed him, as soon as I found my partner, to a public-house, the Ship, near Mark-lane; he got into the house a little before me, I found him at the front of the bar, he was going to pull something out of his pocket, but he had not pulled it out; I could not see what it was; I came in so quick upon him that he covered it over with his coat; the landlady, I suppose her to be, was in the bar, she was standing as if to receive it; as soon as he saw me he walked across the tap-room, I said, I will see what you have got there; he hustled with me a little; I told him it was of no use; I took him into the kitchen and searched him, and found these two tin bottles upon him, they were in the inside coat pockets, the glass bottle I found upon him when I took him to the Compter. There is a gallon of rum and a quart, he said I came very honestly by it, I had it gave me. I did not steal it; well, said I, I did not say you did. When I took him to the Compter I went into Cooper's-row, and I found Pitkeathly locking up the cellar; I asked him if Mr. Chatfield was at home; I found he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the next day to Mr. Chatfield's - A. I did, and I examined all Mr. Chatfield's servants; I told him I was informed by the man that he had given the man a pocket full of rum; yes, he said, I did; he said it is usual to give it him once a quarter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He left it to you to examine all the servants, and the man at the bar, he said he got it honestly - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the excise officer, the question here is not whether it was smuggling, but whether it is stealing. When you examined the servant he said it is customary to give it once a quarter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES PHILLIPS. I am a city constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the officer go into the cellar and come out - A. Yes, I followed the last witness to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the person that keeps the public-house - A. A man of the name of Cramphorn keeps the house the Ship in Hart-street, Crutched-friars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the officer standing at the bar - A. I did, I was the first that entered the public-house after him, as soon as I got in I touched him over one of the pockets; I asked him what he had got there; I told him I must see what he had got in his pockets. We took him into the kitchen and searched him. We took these things out of his pocket.</p>

            , was my cellarman. In consequence of information I had placed these officers to watch the cellar. On the morning after the officers apprehended Holcomb Pitkeathly came to me and said an unpleasant affair has happened; I said, what is it; he said Holcomb is in; in the Poultry Compter I concluded; I said, he had not got there for any good perhaps; he said he did not know, he had given him a little rum; I asked him how much; he said perhaps about a bottle; I then asked him if there was any thing else; he said there might be a tin besides; I then asked him whether the tins might not hold a gallon, or somewhere thereabouts; he said, probably they might, he could not say; he then said he belived it was a customary thing; I made answer, I rather doubted it; he called it a quarterage.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the officer surveyed you that time - A. The last time, only three surveys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of, or sanction any such custom, as to give quarterage - A. Certainly not. It is impossible to swear to rum. I looked at the rum at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards taste that rum - A. I tried it, I did not taste it; I believe it corresponded with the other rum in the cellar; I believe it to be part of my rum. The officer surveyed the quantity of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080021"/> stock in the cellar; there was a deficiency of about fifty gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of a gallon of rum - A. About sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How long has Pitkeathly lived you - A. About fifteen years, and more likely he acted from mistake than principle; I think he might be led into it; I think he acted without thinking of the error he committed.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their counsel.</p>
               <p>Holcomb called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose this bottle of wine - A. On the 23d of March; I was moving wine from one cellar to another, the prisoner was employed in my service; after he had got to the cellar in Suffolk-lane, the cellerman went out to open the door, and left him with the wine standing at the cellar door, which were in open baskets; there were ten dozen in the baskets. While he was gone on to the cellar-door, I promiscuously came down the street, I saw the prisoner take a bottle of wine out of one of the baskets, he secreted it in his bosom, and was going to the door where he lodged, which was close by the cellar; I immediately ran down the street, took him by the collar with the bottle of wine in his bosom, and snatched it from him. My cellar man at the same time was opening the door, he saw me have the man with the bottle of wine; I put him in the warehouse and called my clerk while I went for a constable; the cellar man is here, and so is the constable. I only employed the prisoner occasionally as an assistant. This is the bottle of wine, it contains port wine, being part of that ten dozen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the bottle of wine up with intention of drinking it only; I could not get the cork out. I did not intend to make the least property of it.</p>

Yes, of Grub-street; I fell into Grub-street; I saw a baker's shop, I enquired; I saw a man at the door of the baker's shop, that was the prisoner, he read the note and said it was right, he took the flour in.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, are you sure that is the man - A. Yes, that is the man. I asked him for a note to take back; he said, there is no occasion for one. I went back to my master; I carried back the empty sacks, I had no doubt it was all right. The prisoner took the the note out of my hand, and said it was right, and took the flour in.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the prisoner told you it was right are you - A. Yes; I am sure he read the note and said it was all right.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Agnes. What was the note that you sent - A. I wrote not to send the money by the carter, to stop till I came to town, I would come for it; it was directed to Mr. Skirven, 95, Grub-street; it was a sealed note.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there your place of abode on the note - A. Yes, on the inside. My name was not on the cart, it was on the sacks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are several people that I dealt with had sacks of the same mark.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never employ a factor to sell my flour, and my place of abode was on the sack.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you ever been paid for it - A. No. I came up about a month after the flour was delivered, and went to Mr. Skirven, and when I came there I was very much surprised that the flour was not delivered; Mr. Skirven said I should not wondor if it has gone to that swindler Brown's; I went down there, I saw the house was shut up, I rattled at the door, which caused a person to look out of the window; I went in the premises after that, and saw the sacks there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to your master's house in January - A. Yes, he came to buy great coats on the 13th of January last; he purchased fourteen; they were various prices, amounting to twenty-four pounds two shillings with the canvas they were packed in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they to be delivered - A. They were to be delivered on the Tuesday as he bought them on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. They were to be delivered then the next morning - A. Yes, at the White Horse, Fetter-lane, at ten o'clock; he was going into the country.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he offer to pay you - A. He paid me in notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did you ask him his name and address - A. Yes, on account of making the bill of parcels out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name he gave you - A. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Fetter-lane the next morning - A. Yes. I met the prisoner in Fetter-lane, he told me that he had been waiting for me an hour or more; I was rather five minutes before my time; he told me he had been waiting for me an hour, he did not think the coach went so soon, it was gone he said; he took me into the White Hart public-house nearly opposite the White Horse. When I got into the public-house he pulled out his pocket book; I asked for a pen and ink to write a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him at that time the bill of parcels - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he look at it - A. Yes. The prisoner got the pen and ink, and asked me if I would have something to drink; I had something to drink; I was writing the receipt, and he was counting the notes from his pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass then about the notes - A. The discount was agreed upon the day before; five per cent, discount was to be taken off for ready money; he asked what discount was allowed for ready money at the time that he looked the goods out; he gave the notes to me for twenty-three pounds, they appeared to be bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they consisted of - A. Two five's, five two's, and three one's, making together twenty-three pounds. I gave him the receipt, I had not two shillings to give him to make the twenty-three pound up.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the discount - A. One pound two shillings, therefore he wanted of me two shillings change, there was two shillings coming from me to him; he said he would give me the two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took the notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes - A. I took them to the Bank in about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they out of your possession before you took them to the Bank - A. One note, but not out of my sight. I think it was a two; I took them to the Bank and delivered them to one of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these notes that you received of the prisoner the notes that you afterwards gave to the bank-clerk - A. The exact notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take them to the Bank - A. Because I thought they were not good ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the person to whom you delivered them to at the Bank if you were to see him - A. Yes, I delivered them to Mr. Jackson, he was the person I delivered them to, and then they were detained.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had the prisoner left you before it occured to you that they were bad notes - A. I left him in the house, it was the circumstance of his giving me the two shillings, that made me suspect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At what place did you first examine them - A. In Monmouth-street, at one Thorpe's, he is in the clothes line, I had business to do there before I went home. When I went in I immediately pulled out the notes and looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not give them to him or that you only looked at them yourself - A. Yes, I laid them down on the counter with my hand upon the remainder.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the remainder - A. I looked at one of the notes, I cannot say whether it was a two pound exactly I clapped my hand upon the remainder.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking over them what occurred to you - A. They looked very faint and the water marks more distinct than I thought they did in general, the water marks stronger, then I took them to the Bank immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they did not pass from your hands into the hands of any body else for the purpose of inspection before you took them to the Bank. -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask this man, Thorpe - A. I asked him if he could tell, only the two pound note I put into his hands, the note I shewed him he particularly suspected, he said he should have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon inspection you suspected and carried the whole mess of them to the Bank - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, on the 14th of January, receive from the witness Mason, certain papers purporting to be bank-notes - A. I did. I immediately marked them all before I parted with them out of my own possession, I think it was about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me whether these are the papers - A. They are the same notes; two of five pounds each, five of two pound each, and three of one pound each.</p>
               <p>Q. You have examined all these carefully have not you - A. I have.</p>

I do, about eight o'clock in the evening, he came for two quarts of the best rum, he paid me in a ten pound note, it had the appearance of a very good bank note, I asked him where he came from, he told me from Mr. Phillips's, in Chapel-street, No. 5; I wrote Phillips, No. 5, Chaple-street, upon the note; I know Mr. Phillips very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Shall you know the note if I show it to you - A. Yes, I shall.</p>
               <p>Q. Take the note that I produce to you, and tell me whether that is the note - A. That is the note, I know it by my hand writing being writ upon it at the time; 5, Chapel-street, 24th of the twelfth month.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Not to my knowledge, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason of knowing whether he did or did not come from Mr. Phillips - A. No further than this; he said he was an acquaintance of Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Phillips would be obliged to me to change a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you afterwards to know it was not a good note - A. I paid it to Mr. Whitbread's clerk, for porter, and it was returned to me by the banker's clerk; that is all the knowledge I have of it's being a forged note.</p>

               <p>Q. There is another name as a witness, who wrote that - A. Dempsey asked me to put another name, any name, so I asked him what name to put down, he mentioned the name Cranfield, so I put down Samuel Cranfield.</p>

               <p>Q. Where you ever paid any thing for what you had done - A. Not a single farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you expected to be paid something - A. They did propose to pay me something, but I never got it, nor asked for it, they both proposed it. Daley said three guineas, and Dempsey said he would make it five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known Daley since I suppose, did you use Daley's house after that time - A. Yes. It was in his house I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Dempsey say, in the presence of the prisoner at the bar, what became of Charles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080025"/> Rhodes - A. No, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you remember some time after that being sent by Daley to Mr. Clarkson's of Doctor's Commons - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after this - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a week or two - A. It might be; I cannot say; it might be a fortnight or less.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any thing with you there - A. I took a paper at that time it was folded up; I did not open it all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that paper you took - A. Daley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from Daley what it was you were taking - A. I understood that it was the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you were to do with it - A. He told me to give it to Mr. Nicolls.</p>
               <p>Q. He said Mr. Nicolls - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you understand Nicolls was - A. He did not tell me who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been sent by Daley previous to this to any public-house at Doctor's Commons - A. I was sent and ordered to meet Dempsey before I went with the will; it might be four or five days, or it might be a week or less.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after you had written the will - A. Yes, I was sent to a public-house near Doctor's Commons to meet Dempsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dempsey - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that public-house the public-house where Dempsey afterwards was apprehended - A. I do not know where he was apprehended; that public-house was up by St. Paul's near to Doctor's Commons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is this your first appearance as a witness in court - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Or upon any case of any kind, or any charge, or any thing else, no matter how often you might have deserved it, but this is the first time you have been here - A. Yes, or any other court.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in - A. I used to work on board a ship when I can get it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been speaking of a transaction transacted not in the country of Middlesex, but in the county of Kent - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This forgery, if it is a forgery, was a forging at Deptford - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said Daley, the man at the bar, called you out of the public-room into the private-room - A. Yes, he called me to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to persist in that account now - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Your memory has been hurt by being in prison, do you mean to say that it was the prisoner called you out - A. He called me from the tap-room to the bar; Daley was the first man that called me.</p>
               <p>Q. How often were you examined at the Thames police upon the subject of forgery - A. I was down five or six times.</p>
               <p>Q. Often enough to correct yourself if you at first said what was wrong - A. I do not recollect I heard a word wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you imagine that I think you would tell a story. I ask you where not you examined five or six times - A. I was not examined there at no examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you from first to last before the magistrate say that Dempsey was the person that addressed you and asked you to do the job for him - A. No. Daley was the first that applied and called me to the bar; they both spoke to me at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you come to both - A. I spoke of it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to take it from you now that they both called you to the bar - A. Daley spoke to me first, and then they both asked me about this will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at the magistrate's that Dempsey was the man that called you - A. I recollect that I said it was Daley that called me to the bar at the first examination, the second examination it was mentioned Dempsey called me to the bar, but Daley was the man that called me to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you, am I, the magistrate first took down Dempsey called you and you afterwards said it was not right - A. I told him in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you were accurate or the clerk depends upon you - A. I was correct in what I said,

               <p>Q. You say you had three guineas or five guineas promised you but you never had any thing - A. One proposed three guineas, and the other five, but I never got a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. I see the will was dated in May 1809 - A. Yes, three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not know any thing of the supposed testator Rhodes - A. No, I did not at the same time; I was drawn into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known any thing of him since - A. I have heard of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you were not much pleased that these men did not keep their promise of giving you the three guineas or the five guineas - A. I never asked for it, nor never required it; I never looked for it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were quite satisfied in your mind about it - A. I was very uneasy in my mind when I heard about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a catholic or a protestant - A. A protestant.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you do not confess to the priest you went and confessed to the magistrate what you had done to take the burthen off your mind - A. After I was taken I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as soon as you were taken it was then your mind began to be uneasy and not before - A. I was uneasy before.</p>
               <p>Q. So I should have thought then as you were uneasy before I take it for granted the first day you were in custody you told the magistrate - A. I was not examined that night; I was locked up that night, it was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. But the officer took you, and you had an opportunity of telling him, but you did not - A. No, not till I was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, so far from telling it did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080026"/> you deny the fact untill it was after you were promised to be a witness, and for to screen yourself you told it - A. I said it was a fair will to be sure at first, I did untill I was admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Why as your mind was uneasy did not you think you should go out of your senses you first said it was a fair will, after that, when they promised to admit you a King's evidence then you said it was a false will - A. Then I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of poor Dempsey, your friend - A. He was never no friend of mine; I cannot tell what is become of him now.</p>
               <p>Q. When you made this declaration it was in November last was it not - A. In November.</p>

            , lately belonging to the ship Perseverance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the object of that caveat - A. I do not recollect he mentioned it then, at a further time I understood the man was indebted to him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what character then did he claim to enter the caveat - A. I do not know; he entered the caveat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you upon what ground - A. It was his wish to enter a caveat; at a future time it was mentioned by him that Rhodes was indebted to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you for what - A. I do not recollect nor the amount. The object was I suppose to prevent any other person having letters of administration, to prevent any other person proving a will, or taking out letters of administration.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many interviews you had with him before any relations of Rhodes made any application to you - A. Only one, I believe, or two, I cannot be sure, I think it was but one.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you enter the caveat - A. I entered the caveat on the 17th or 20th day of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Now down to the time of your entering a caveat or to the time of the deceased's relations coming to you had he mentioned to you that he had any will of Rhodes's - A. No, not previous to the applications of Rhodes's friends.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had entered the caveat was it that the first application was made to you by some of the relations to Rhodes - A. Some few days.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of their application did you send to Daley - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you - A. Yes, he did; I told him that the person who said she was Rhodes's mother had applied respecting the caveat that he had entered; to which he answered and said it was very wrong, there was no lawful mother living.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him the particulars of the debt which was due from Rhodes - A. No, he said there was no lawful mother living, that he doubted; he had a will, that he would have his papers searched when he went home, and if he had one he would send it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now had he ever till that moment mentioned that he had any will, or talked of any will - A. Never till that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was the will brought to you - A. In the course of two or three days to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Williams. Stand forward.</p>
               <p>Q. to Nicolls. Was that the man by whom the will was brought - A. I cannot positively say, I believe it might be the man, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you do you believe it was or was not - A. I believe it might be, but I am not sure; it might be another man somewhat like him, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, do you believe or not believe that he is the man, you know what you believe - A. I believe it might be, and I believe it might not.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall not be put off in that way, you have seen him before now. Do you believe, or do you not believe that he was the man - A. He might be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not talk of might - A. It might be the man. I cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you to speak positively, I ask you what you believe - A. I cannot say to further than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe or not believe that he is the man - A. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you whether you was certain, I ask you what you believe, look again - A. I believe it was the man, but I cannot speak positively to it.</p>
               <p>Q. After the will was brought to you how long did it remain in your office before you proved it - A. It might be a month; I think it was the 7th of October the will was proved.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your pocket-book here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were told to bring it with you, I told you at the office. You think it remained about a month with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had it in your possession did Rhodes' relations apply to you again - A. Yes, they called and looked at the will.</p>
               <p>Q. While that will was laying in your office how many times did Daley call upon you - A. Two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you told him what the relations of Rhodes said about the will - A. I told him they had inspected the will, and said they would call again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what they said respecting the genuineness of the will - A. I told him they had looked at it and said they had some doubt it, that they would call again in a few days.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times did you tell Daley that they had called about it - A. I do not know that I told him more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that it was proved on or about the 7th of October - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080027"/> Q. How many offices are there in Doctors Commons in which wills can be proved describe them - A. There are three.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the principal office - A. The Prerogative office, that is the principal; two other offices belonging to the Bishop of London, one called the Consistory; and the Commissary.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the principal - A. I believe there is done at the Consistory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prove this in the Prerogative office - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not - A. We usually prove wills at the Bishop of London's office, or at the Commissary or the Consistory.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you proved this in the Commissary did you know that you could not prove it at the Prerogative office - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the Consistory and find a caveat there - A. There was a caveat there I was told by the officer, entered by Townly.</p>
               <p>Q. In that office there was a caveat entered by your neighbour - A. Entered by him.</p>
               <p>Q. And then without going to Townly you went and proved it at the Commissary office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar come with you and go to that office to prove it - A. No, he did not. I accompanied him before the surrogate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he sworn before the surrogate - A. At his chambers in Doctors Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, sir, did you see him sworn to that will - A. I did, before Dr. Parsons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to Daley before he was sworn to that, that the relations had entered a caveat at one of the offices - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Nor of course to Dr. Parsons - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What became of the prisoner after he was sworn - A. He went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What, home, and you went to the office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you obtain the probat - A. Four days after he was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner get it on that day or soon after you had obtained the probat - A. On the day that the money was obtained, on the 8th.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 2d of October he was sworn - A. Yes, on the 7th the probat was obtained, and on the 8th the prisoner came to town, he met me by appointment in Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. By his appointment you having the probat in your pocket - A. I had; I accompanied him with it to Mr. Moses's accompting-house for the purpose of receiving the money due upon the will. Moses is the ship agent for the ship Perseverance.</p>
               <p>COURT. You mean the money due to Rhodes - A. Yes, the wages to Rhodes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there did you produce the probat - A. At Mr. Moses's in his presence, I did; Mr. Moses paid me one hundred and sixteen pounds and a fraction, he paid me in a check, I believe upon his banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the prisoner leave Mr. Moses - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the prisoner - A. At the King's Arms in Leadenhall-street. I went to Robarts and Curtis's banking-house, Lombard-street, with the check; the prisoner requested me to go and get cash for him; I received the money for him at Robarts's, and went back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the money - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your regular charge for the business that you had done - A.Five pounds for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make out a bill - A. I did not. I put the figures down on a bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You made your charge about five pounds - A. Five pounds; one pound three shillings he owed me before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the debt was six pounds three shillings - A. And ten shillings and sixpence I charged for my trouble going to Mr. Moses, that makes six pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he pay you - A. Ten pounds. The probat was left with Mr. Moses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. You are the clerk of Mr. Clarkson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are now - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you know the prisoner - A. Some years.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first spoke to you respecting the deceased I think it was in last August, and at the time the probat was taken up I think it was in last 
               <persName id="t18120408-32-person324">August. </persName>
            Did not he tell you at the time the deceased was indebted to him - A. I cannot say whether it was at the time, or the time following.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired you to enter a caveat against any will that might be attempted to be proved - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter a caveat - A. I did, in the three courts; the Prerogative, and in the Bishop of London's two courts, the Consistory and the Commissary.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you upon your oath, it is not very usual in Proctors in your situation in the Commons to enter caveats without desiring to know the reason why - A. It is a case sometimes, not always, it happens now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated to his lordship that when he first made an application to you to enter a caveat for him he did not mention any thing to you of a will - A. I have so stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a necessary consequence that a man must have a will in his possession when he enters a caveat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have had a will or might not have had a will for ought you could tell - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated to his lordship also notwithstanding you were acquainted with the prisoner

             the objection made by the relatives of the deceased to the will did you at the time make him acquainted with their objection. Did the prisoner understand from you, or others, the consequence of persisting in it if it was forged - A. I cannot state for that whether I had or no told him the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, you have stated that the will was a month in the office before a probat was taken out - A. Somewhere thereabouts that was in Mr. Clarkson's office.</p>
               <p>Q. While it was there might not any one who controverted the will have an opportunity of perusing it - A. Yes, if they knew where the will was and applied.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080028"/> Q. And pending that time some of the relatives did call - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, I think you said when it was mentioned in Mr. Clarkson's office, something of a doubt was expressed by the relatives of the deceased; Now, sir, is it not a common thing to doubt the genuiness of some of the best of wills that pass through your office.</p>
               <p>COURT. That only goes to the general doubting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Q. Now, sir, you have stated that you took out a probat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner Daley ever in possession of that probat - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And you got the money at the banker's - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Williams. Can you fix the time when what you have related passed at Daley's house, all that we got from you before that it was about a fortnight before you were apprehended; can you fix near about when that time was - A. About two months before I was apprehended; I was apprehended on the 7th of November, on or about two months before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for fixing the transaction to be about two months before your apprehension - A. I cannot be positive to the time; I am partly sure it must be before the 1st of October, I was employed to go down to a ship at Gravesend, and on that day to bring her up, and I was nineteen days on board of her. On the 1st of October I went down, it was before I went down to that ship, it was before the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how long before the first of October - A. I cannot say, when I was examined I could not tell the time, I said on or about two months before I was apprehended, I cannot say how long it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you accompany the officer that made the search - A. I did, and found the quantity of candles, I saw the officer take them both away from under the bed. There were seven India bonds of one hundred pounds each, and several bills; altogether twelve or fourteen hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any means of knowing these candles - A. I understand they are made on purpose for us. The prisoner always had the care of the candles as far as I knew. We did not go to his apartment to look for candles. We looked for silver, and afterwards we found the candles.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CASE. I am a tallow-chandler; I make candles for Cox, Merle, and Co; they are of a peculiar description; we call them Cox's candles, the weight they are nine to two pound; we never retail them; I have examined them before the Lord Mayor, they are the candles that were manufactured for Mr. Cox, Merle, and Co. The candles are worth a shilling and a halfpenny a pound.</p>

            . Q. You are a marshalman of the City - A. I am. On the 8th of March last I went to Mr. Pierson's house; I searched the prisoner's box in her presence.</p>
               <p>Q. On your searching the box did you observe her do any thing - A. Before I searched the box she put her hand into the box and catched out a brown paper parcel before I began to search; she endeavoured to secrete it under her clothes; I caught it from her. Upon opening the paper parcel they appeared to be two bank dollars; upon further examination one turned out to be a bad one; there was a three shilling token, an eighteen penny token, and ten shillings; I then proceeded to search her box, and after I took all the clothes out of the box I saw a quantity of silver laying at the bottom of the box, it contained just the quantity that Mr. Pierson said he had lost. It was loose at the bottom of the box; two three shilling tokens, three eighteen penny tokens, five shillings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080031"/> and two sixpences; I then asked the prisoner how she came by it; she said that she had not taken it all from Mr. Pierson but some of it was what she had from her friends upon her giving that answer; Mr. Pierson, who was close behind, said, if it is the money that Mr. Pierson has lost, it is all marked. We looked it over minutely, and we found every piece marked as Mrs. Pierson had described. I had six penny-pieces produced to me; I cannot say where they were found they were brought to me at the table by one of the maid servants.</p>

               <p>Q. And in consequence of that you had marked your money - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the officer searched the prisoners box - A. I was not present; I saw the money produced.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brand. Shew first the three shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pierson. This was marked with a cross under the word token.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the eighteen-penny pieces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pierson. The marks were not put by me, but this is that I had in my purse marked, they were marked by a young gentleman in my house, under my inspection.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. In consequence of suspicion that you entertained to discover who the thief was when did you begin to mark any of the money - A. On Saturday the 7th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark any before Saturday - A. No, I did not. The eighteen-penny pieces were marked on Saturday night, they were put into a yellow bag or purse, and put into my breeches pocket; my breeches were up in my chamber on a chair back near my bedside.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of coming into your chamber in the morning before you were up for the purpose of lighting your fire - A. She was. It was in the same purse in my pocket that I had before missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning of the 8th did the prisoner come into your chamber - A. She did, as usual to light the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that while she was in the room she was near where your breeches were - A. She was, it was near the fire place, she could not help being near the fire place, after she left the room; I suspected that something had been done, and the officer came within ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to examine the bag in your breeches what did you find was missing - A. Sixteen and sixpence in all; consisting of five one-shilling pieces, two sixpenny pieces, two three-shilling pieces, and three eighteen-penny tokens, and they were all marked, and they were all found by Brand in her box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How old is this poor girl - A. She is sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. You took her from the Asylum - A. I did, in the year 1810; she has been with me two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the females in the house always upon good terms with her with respect to jealousy - A. I do not know with respect to jealousy.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you in the house - A. Two servant maids, who live in the same room with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. To your knowledge had any other servant been in your chamber that morning - A. Not any.</p>

            , the counsel; I have got my living since as an hackney-writer, and collecting debts. On the 7th of March, about ten o'clock at night, as I was passing up Fleet-street I saw the prosecutor going down Fleet-street, four men were following him, two of which were near to his person, one of them touched his person which caused me to follow them: I was going the contrary way, but on the same side of the way. The prisoner was one; there was two tall men and two short men; the prisoner was one of the four; I cannot positively swear whether he was the person that touched the pocket or no; he was in company with the other man that was near to the prosecutor. The two tall men stood talking to a girl of the town while the two short men were pursuing the prosecutor, they stood for the space of five minutes, and then went on; I then followed them, I was behind the two tallest, I saw one of the short ones touch the prosecutor's pocket; I followed the two tall ones that went in the direction to where the two short ones were, and the prosecutor, I followed them all; they came together again, and when I came up to them I saw the prisoner at the bar, he was next to the prosecutor; I saw him take something from the prosecutor's pocket, but what it was I could not tell, and at the same instant he put his hand towards a pocket in his great coat, a side pocket at the top of his coat; they then turned round; the two short ones turned round, and came behind the two tall ones, they were then trying of his other pocket. I went up to the prosecutor and asked him if he had lost any thing out of his pocket; he stopped, and the four men surrounded him; he put his hand into his pocket and said, yes, I have lost an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080032"/> under waistcoat; I said one of these men have robbed you; I laid hold of the prisoner and the other short man, I gave the other man to the prosecutor, and said this is the man that has got your property, at the same instant I put my hand into his great coat pocket, and said, this is your property in his pocket; the prisoner said it was not, he had picked it up on the step of a door. I had hold of his great coat, it was unbuttoned; he turned his arms out of his great coat, left the great coat on my arm, and ran away; I pursued him and cried stop thief, and took him in Salisbury-court; I conveyed him to the watchhouse; the constable of the night knew him; the constable of the night has got the property.</p>

On the 25th of January the same year, the day after my father died, my sister and myself went to look up the money to give to our executors.</p>

             of Bristol. They are the executors of my father's will. On that day, while we were looking it up, we missed the fifty pound note, and then we told my uncle of it, Mr. Stiles Rich, and then payment was stopped at the Bank. We heard nothing more of it till the 2d of March, 1812, then I went to the Bank. The Bank-clerk has the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your father any partner - A. No, none at all.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WEXHAM. About the middle of February last I had occasion to borrow a few pounds of my friends; I called upon

            , I asked her if she could lend me three or four pounds; she said she could not just then; she said if I could call again in a day or two she would see what she could do. In a day or two after that she called upon me, she said, take and change this note, and take what few pounds you want. I looked at the note, and said, what do you call this; she said, it is a fifty pound; I said, have you nothing else but this to let me have, it is not worth while to change this for so small a sum; she said, take that note, and call and give me the change when you have changed the note. I took the note to my master, Mr. Branston in Cheapside, I asked him to change me a fifty pound note; he said, he could not, but if I went to the Bank I could get done; I went to the Bank, I set my name to the note, and the place where I lived. When I presented the note for change they told me the note was stopped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. I believe they were unkind enough to take you up - A. They were unkind enough; I considered it great injustice to put me in prison.</p>
               <p>Q.After this injustice you told this story - A. It is the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not accuse this woman untill you were accused yourself - A. When I was taken I said where I had it.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you were asked where you got it, you said where you lived and where you had it from - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rich. The prisoner, before the Alderman, said she gave Mr. Wexham the note.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I am one of the collectors of the assessed taxes for the parish of St. James's. On the 18th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was standing at my parlour window, I saw a cart pass, and the prisoner Coombs, whom I have known for many years I saw opposite of my window, at the tail of my cart. I did not see the carter; the prisoner was off the foot-path, he reached his arm over, and pulled the coat towards the tail of the cart; I immediately went and stood at the street-door; the cart had not got more than sixteen yards before the prisoner made the second go off the foot path; he laid hold of the coat and put it into a smaller compass; he took the coat of the cart and put it under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080033"/> his arm and turned off with it towards Titchbourn-street, I was not certain at the time whether he was not taking his own coat out of the cart, and I followed after the prosecutor with his team; I overtook him in the Haymarket, I asked him if that coat did not belong to him. Yes, sir, he said, it is there; I said a man whom I know very well has taken it out of the cart, but at the time I did not know but it was his own coat. On the Saturday three weeks afterwards, the 14th of March, was the first time that I saw the prisoner afterwards, he was standing at the corner of Coventry-street, within a few yards of where he had taken this coat from the countryman's cart; I got Knight and Wilding, two constables, to apprehend him, and took him to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the coat ever found - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of June last, did a lighter called Susan come to your wharf - A. Yes, about the 5th of June, I am not positive to the day, my wharf is at Mill Bank.</p>

               <p>Q. To whom did that lighter belong - A. To Mr. Bradshaw.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did the deals belong - A. To Messrs. Wood and Dorvill.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time till about the 11th of June, did that lighter continue unloading - A. It did. On the morning of the 12th I missed her myself, and to the best of my recollection she was tied to the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. About how many deals had she had in her - A. About two or three hundred when she was lost, all the deals belonged to Wood and Dorvill.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe afterwards you sent a clerk of yours of the name of Berney - A. Yes, and from information I went to Scott's wharf at Chelsea, I there found the lighter, she had been sunk, the tide was leaving her, there was water in her; and I went to Mr. Sibley's premises at Chelsea, I there saw about two hundred of the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them to be a part of the deals you lost - A. By the general appearance they were of the same cargo, they had upon them the same marks as were upon the other deals, the rest of the cargo. I had no doubt they were the deals I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the lighter it was empty - A. Empty.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Wood and Dorvill to place these in your wharf - A. Wood and Dorvill treated with me for the purchase, they were offered to me, and being a cargo of various qualities it was thought advisable that we should see how they turned out before we purchased them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were in a course of delivery to you and afterwards you agreed upon the purchase - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At any rate, were you responsible for them - A. So far as being under my care. We have two or three deals, here, they are marked by my servant that sorted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That servant has absconded - A. He has absconded.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long had this barge been lying at your wharf - A. She came up about the 5th of June and we began unloading her until the 11th or 12th, and then she was missing.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she lying on the river - A. On the bank, floating at high-water, and on the mud at low-water.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the part where she was lying in the river - A. Yes. On the morning of the 12th I missed her, I afterwards went in search of her, I found her at Scott's wharf at Chelsea on the morning of the 13th, I found the deals taken out of the barge, the plugs pulled out and the lighter nearly full of water.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the plugs - A. When the barge is overloaded and the water comes in they have no other way of letting it out.</p>
               <p>Q. From thence did you proceed in search of the deals - A. I did, I found them on the premises of Mr. Sibley, I should think it three quarters of a mile from Scott's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. How many deals did you find there - A. Two hundred and forty nine single deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them again - A. Yes, I knew them by their general appearance, by the mark of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080034"/> the cargo, and by the mark of our man, who had sorted them; this one has the mark of our sorter, a W.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it that they have not all the ship-mark - A. I do not know, it is sometimes the case. This one appears to have been cut, the ship-mark is generally upon the edge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you know whether any of the deals were on the wharf - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is impossible for you to tell whether these deals were taken from the wharf or the barge, they are the deals I admit that were originally in the barge - A. All those that were loaded had the sorter's mark upon them, except some few which laid in the barge when the men left off work; I missed no deals that were piled on the wharf, only those that were left in the barge.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it day-light - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner before - A. I know the prisoner by being in my club, how long I cannot say; it might be six months or a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time had you seen him frequent - A. No, not seen him frequent, but I have often times seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you helped to work in that barge the night before - A. I never worked in any craft of Mr. Stevenson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you helped to pile any of those deals from that barge the night before - A. I cannot say; I piled all the cargo, whether it was from that barge I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you piled any deals that came out of that lighter - A. I cannot say whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it - A. I cannot say; I cannot swear for other men.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen that lighter unload - A. No, I never saw her unload at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deals taken out of that lighter - A. I believe, sir, that must be the craft.</p>
               <p>COURT. What makes you so shy of speaking - A. The craft lay under Mr. Stevenson's window, not on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long is the wharf - A. Thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Stevenson's window join the wharf - A. His window fronts the wharf where these deals lay.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why he belongs to your club - A. That I cannot help; I do not enquire what trades they are; I do not know what he is.</p>
               <p>CRADOCK HARDING. Q. Last summer you were in Mr. Stevenson's employ - A. Yes, a backer; that means carrying the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a lighter being lost from their wharf that was found at Chelsea - A. I remember hearing talk of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and you brother on the wharf early on the 12th of June - A. I was walking up Millbank-street between four and five o'clock it was day light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man take the craft away - A. I saw a man on board the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that man do - A. I do not know any more he did than being on board the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the barge after that - A. I do not know. I went to have half a pint of beer as usual in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you find the barge was gone - A. We came back in half an hour, and went to work, the barge was gone, and the man too.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to him - A. Between twenty and thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and tell me whether you see any man here that you believe to be the man - A. I cannot say; I cannot believe any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether you do not believe that that is the man at the bar - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man at the time - A. I did not nor never saw him before, I did not know but it was Mr. Bradshaw's man.</p>

               <p>Q. There were some deals found in your house by the officer, and Mr. Stevenson's clerk - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From what place did you have these deals - A. From Scott's wharf, from on board a board a barge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that barge - A. The day before the deals were found at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. The deals were found at your house on the 12th - A. I saw them the day before at five o'clock in the morning at Scott's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there first, you or the barge - A. The barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it coming up the river - A. No, I did not. I went there by appointment, a person came to me that brought up the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of the barge coming there the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080035"/> day before - A. I expected deals by a barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether he had been with you a day or two before - A. I cannot say it was him; it was a person very much like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look again, you have seen him before - A. I have, at Queen-square; I have some doubts of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have some doubts, have you - A. Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you seen the person that came about the deals - A. I saw him once before he brought the deals; he came and said he sold deals by commission; he offered me some for sale; he said the deals were at Dock-head; I asked him if I could see them; he said he was going down that day, and he would bring them the next morning, and if I did not approve of them I had no occasion to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him the price - A. I did, he said as they were an inferior sort, thirty-five.</p>
               <p>COURT. This was before you had seen them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you mean thirty-five or any other sum, recollect what you have sworn to - A. He asked thirty-five; I agreed for thirty-five if I approved of them after they came up.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said he asked thirty-five - A. He asked more, I believe it was forty; I said I would give thirty-five if I approved of them.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 12th did he bring them to Scott's wharf - A. Yes, on the day before they were found at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you fetched down to Scott's wharf - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Scott's wharf to where you live - A. Near a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did he come in the morning to your house - A. Near five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down to Scott's wharf with him - A. I did. I found the deals in the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on board with him - A. I did, and examined the deals, I agreed upon the price; to the best of my recollection it was thirty-five; I began to land them in about an hour and a half; it took us the whole day to get them into my premises; on the next morning Mr. Berney and the officer came and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were they - A. Upwards of two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, do you or do you not believe him to be the man - A. I cannot say; I believe he is very much like him; I cannot say. To the best of my knowledge he is the man; I cannot say he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Mr. Sibley on board a barge one morning in June last at Mr. Scott's wharf - A. Yes, about five or ten minutes before five; there was another man in the barge with him, they were mooring the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you believe that to be the man that was with Sibley - A. It has the appearance; I cannot say whether it is the man or not; I do not know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gillmore. Did you go in search of the prisoner - A. Yes, me and Sibley. I found his wife by the Old Barge House, opposite of the Temple, on the Surry side of the river; I have from that time frequently endeavoured to apprehend him; at last I gave the warrant into the hands of Evans of the Thames police office; I believe it was the 9th or 10th of February; Mr. Evans brought him in custody to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Now from the search that you made after him, if he had been at home, and in the regular course of his business must you have found him - A. Not the smallest doubt of it.</p>
               <p>JAMES EVANS. I am an officer of the Thames police office. I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of February at Deptford in Kent; he is a boat builder; he told me he had been down into Hampshire to work. I endeavoured to find him all I could, he was out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Stevenson. Have you been out and examined the deals that are in the yard - A. I have, they have two strokes on the edge, that is the ship's mark in this instance in the deal that is here the mark is gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them - A. They are of various sort, upwards of ninety pounds, and a considerable part of them worth sixty pounds a hundred.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you agree with him for it - A. He said himself that he had got a hogshead of Port wine to sell by commission; I told him if he would leave a sample, and if I liked it I would buy it of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Watkinson desire that it might be brought to Mr. Robertson's cellar - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been lately at Mr. Robertson's cellar - A. I have this day week, I saw a claret cask there it had the guagers mark. Claret hogsheads are very much alike.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you knew that his brother-in-law was a wine-merchant - A. I knew that he was in the wine way, I did not know where he lived, nor where his cellar was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you received the permit from the prisoner, or somebody else - A. I rather think I received it from the prisoner himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. Q. You say, sometimes persons in the trade lend wine to another in the trade, is Watkinson in the trade - A. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that the day the wine came, Watkinson came to you and told you the wine was in the cellar - A. No I did not say that, I said he came to me.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you make the discovery - A. In consequence of information. From the nature of my business, and the immense quantity of stock I had, it was impossible to ascertain it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your stock was so large you could not ascertain sufficiently, after you had your stock taken could you ascertain any deficiency - A. I could not exactly ascertain much.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was it by taking of stock, or by the information of your cellarman - A. By the information of my cellarman, who succeeded this man as cellarman, a person of the name of Davis.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you remember on what day you first questioned the last witness respecting this - A. Monday, the 1st of March, and he was taken to Bow-street on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he as early as Wednesday communicate the fact of the robbery - A. He did, and I think he did on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure he did on the Wednesday - A. I am sure he did on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Until he communicated this circumstance did you know any thing of Mr. Ireson - A. I never heard of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then upon his information that you resorted to Mr. Ireson and obtained the information that he has given us - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the claret hogshead been pointed out to you by Tonge - A. I saw the claret hogshead in my cellar in William street, where it was unusual.</p>
               <p>Q. Where should it have been - A. In Villiers-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it come into your cellar originally - A. In the month of April last; this time twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it then contain - A. Claret.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that bottled off - A. By the prisoner's cellar-book in the month of July, that book is kept in the prisoner's own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever authorised the prisoner to sell any wine to Mr. Ireson - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, did you know at all of this cask of wine going out of your cellar to Mr. Ireson - A. I never knew of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you if your cellarman is a place of a considerable trust - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you his character, if he had not been honest you would not have kept him in your service - A. I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the cask - A. I know the mark and number and cut guage, and the time it came into my possession; the shipper puts that mark, I can speak to the marks and the cut guage.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you observed them before July last - A. I bought them upon the Quays myself, I bought ninety-nine hogsheads of Claret at one time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Upon each of which, I take it were the guagers mark - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not singular to find the guager's mark - A. Some guagers do not mark, the cellar-book will show the mark of this cask most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this hogshead purchased - A. I think in the month of April in last year.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably at the time of their coming into your cellar, was in July. Pray, sir, is fifty-eight gallons a small or a large hogshead - A. They are from fifty-five to sixty, very few of them sixty; sixty, we call them a large size.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner leave your service of his own account, or did you send him about his own business - A. It was then each mutually agreed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you soon afterwards take any account of your stock, with a view to discover any loss - A. Not with a view to discover any loss, because I had a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find you stock upon that taking correct - A. That I could not tell, the management of my stock was necessarily under the care of my cellar-man.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you now if you took it for any purpose, did you examine your stock before he left you - A. He rendered me an account of the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause any examination to see whether the stock of wine that he rendered was accurate or not - A. No, I took it as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Who succeeded the prisoner as your cellar-man - A. Barnaby Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that your stock is so large that it is impossible you could have missed any part of your stock - A. I trusted to my cellar-man.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man, Tonge, was eighteen years in your service, and it was not till he was pressed very hard that he told any thing - A. He was not pressed very hard, I was led to suppose that my porters had wine in their possession, I applied at Bow-street office, Mr. Stafford sent Taunton to me, we searched our porters, I found some wine in Tonge's possession upon searching his apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had master Tonge fled at that time - A. He was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you took him in into custody - A. I did not, I took him into my accompting-house, and told him his salvation depended upon his telling me what he had taken, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many considerable wine-merchants in this town, is it not the custom of some of them to permit their cellar-men to trade themselves - A. I have been twenty-five years in the trade and I never knew of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080041"/> Q. Perhaps if great ones do not, little ones may - A. I do not know, I should be very sorry to allow it in my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When Tonge made this charge, how long were you before you took the prisoner into custody - A. From the Monday to the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you took up his brother-in-law - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And then on the Friday the prisoner came and surrendered - A. He did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Tonge communicated to you on the Tuesday - A. He mentioned it on the Monday night when detected, and mentioned it on Tuesday morning: he mentioned it on the Monday night that I found the wine in his room.</p>
               <p>Q. And mentioned Mr. Ireson's name, did he - A. Ireson's, and many others.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you more up stairs than the attic - A. No, not on my own account; all I rent is the shop, parlour, and the sleeping rooms, which are the attics. I pay so much for the whole together.</p>

               <p>COURT. What time - A. A quarter after seven. I recollect sending my errand boy out about seven; I invariably set down the time when I send him out and I think it was about a quarter of an hour after I sent him out.</p>
               <p>Q. What attracted your notice - A. The alarm of glass being broken; at the moment I cast my eyes to the window I observed a man's hand inside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the shop window - A. The shop window, especially at a tray; the tray contained gold chains to the amount of forty pounds, and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that hand take the tray, or leave it there - A. He had some difficulty in taking it away, and it fell out of his hands, and at the same instant I saw that tray fall from one hand there was a second report of glass breaking at the shop window, at the next pane; I saw a man's hand taking out of one of the trays some gold seals; I then turned round to it, and took away those gold seals; there were seven taken away; I missed seven that night; I saw the seals taken out by that hand; I went round to the shop door, and gave the alarm immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your shop door fastened - A. Yes, it was fastened by a rope to the brass handle of the door, and to the scraper, and also to the rails underneath the shop window; I got out in two seconds, in consequence of the brass handle the rope was fastened to breaking by my force, at the instant I got out the prisoner Smith was brought in by a neighbour, Mr. Burne; I went in pursuit of the other robber; I left Smith in the custody of Mr. Burne, and went in pursuit of Harper.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in pursuit you did not know of whom - A. No, I did not. I went in pursuit of another from a description Mr. Burne had given me; I pursued him into George-yard, Drury-lane.</p>

               <p>COURT. Did you see they were seals - A. I felt them fall against me, and before they came to the ground one fell into the officers hands, and one into another person's hands; one or two of the seals came to the ground, which were afterwards taken up; I saw one fall into the officer's hands, and one into another person's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that gentleman here - A. Yes. I did not see the seals fall to the ground, nor I did not see them picked up.</p>

We were taking him across a passage to take him into a public-house; I then observed him throwing something out of his hand; he threw away two or three seals, as I thought, one hit my thigh, it fell to the ground; I put my right foot upon it, and picked it up; this is it.

I took them from the people, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in George-yard that evening, I took the prisoner Harper, he was coming out of the gateway. When I took him I saw his hand in his pocket, I secured his arms; I saw two seals picked up near the spot where he was; a little boy picked up this seal and gave it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Harper was not taken back to Mr. Hamley's - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. What sort of a night was this - A. The light was gone, it was moon light.</p>

               <p>Q. These parcels were all made up in fifty's - A. Yes, in even fifty's: this was one of the parcels wanting ten, all dated the 3d of January of the present year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How soon afterwards did Mr. Costan deliver to you any other note about three quarters of an hour on the same day; Sunday he gave me one more note, 61,408, the same date.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the communications that Mr. Costan made to you when he gave you that note did you speak to the prisoner - A. I did. The prisoner was a clerk in our house; I accused him of the theft; he denied it. I insisted on knowing what other notes he had about him; he produced two others, one of them turned out to be one of the notes I had lost this 61,409, the same date; I then asked him how he came by these two; he said he got them of Thomas Hall in change of a dirty two pound note. The first note I received of Costan; he borrowed it for me, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it known to all the clerks that it is not the practice of the house to take the number of the small notes - A. It is.</p>
               <p>MARY DIXON. Q. You live servant in the house of Messrs. Stevenson's - A. Yes; I am house maid there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a room called the library - A. Yes. On the last Friday I observed in a box a roll of bank notes, I looked at them, and just saw they were one pound bank notes, I put them where I found them, and in consequence of what I said to Mr. Costan, Mr. Costan and I went up on Sunday morning to the same place, I found the roll of bank notes, which I left on the Friday morning in the same place; on the Friday I left them on the top of two sheets of paper, and on Sunday morning they were under these two sheets of waste paper; I told William; he went up with me, and saw them; we both looked at the notes, and we both counted them together, we counted forty-eight. That was on the Friday before Mr. Costan saw them. I left them in the box.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MABBOTT. Q. You are a servant to Mr. Stevenson - A. Yes. From the information of

Yes; the waggon unloads at the White Horse Cripplegate; I unloaded it that morning, on the 26th of February, at seven o'clock; there was no parcel missing by the way bill from the waggon. About half past twelve o'clock I sent a parcel in our cart; the parcel was woollen cloth in a canvas wrapper; that was part of the contents of the said waggon.</p>

             left the yard with the cart, with another person to guard it; I saw the wrapper again at the Mansion House the next day; the prisoner was then in custody.</p>
               <p>JOHN COX. Q. Did you take care of the cart which was to convey parcels that came by the Wakefield waggon - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take every thing that you received safe out of the yard - A. I did. I was going down London Wall, and the wind blew very hard; I found it blew the covering off. I covered them over safe, and this said truss was safe in the cart at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this - A. As near a quarter before one as I can possibly guess.</p>
               <p>Q. How much further did you go before you had reason to think you had lost any thing - A. I went as far as Broad-street, and as soon as I stopped the cart I missed it in a moment; I had occasion to stop the cart there; we had some goods to deliver in Broad-street, I missed the truss in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. In that distance could it have dropped out of your cart by accident - A. I am sure it was impossible it should shake out. I was driving the horse along, walking by the side of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person have got that truss out of your cart - A. There were a number of coal waggons passing at the time, and I was obliged to keep at the horse's head, going by the narrow part of London Wall by the church wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have took it from behind - A. That must have been the way, it could not have fell out; it could not have gone out any other way than some person taking it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any person following of the cart - A. My attention was to the horse at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you did not see any person about the cart - A. Not at the moment I did not; I did not miss it until I came to Broad-street. On the next day I saw the truss at the Mansion House.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 26th of February I went into Broad-street about one o'clock; I saw the prisoner with this truss upon his shoulder; he was going towards Throgmorton-street. In Throgmorton-street I laid hold of him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080046"/> I asked him what he had got there; I received no answer; I saw the truss was falling from him to me, and I threw it off his shoulder backwards; I kept hold of the prisoner and secured him, after I had secured the prisoner he said he wished I had secured the man that passed me; he was the man that asked him to carry it. I had observed that man walking on the other side of the way before he passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that before the man was clean off - A. No, he did not. I took the prisoner to the Compter, on opening this bale at the Mansion House I found this invoice; I found it was consigned to Mr. Blackburn; I went to Mr. Blackburn, and he directed me to Mr. Deacon; I have kept it ever since, it contains a piece of blue cloth, and a piece of green.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Roberts. Look at that bill of parcels you sent with the wrapper and its contents - A. Yes, and the wrapper, and its contents belong to me; the contents are the same I sent up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Deacon. Do you live in town - A. I do; I saw it was taken out of the waggon into the cart; I am the only person that has the carting business.</p>

            . Q. On the day this man was taken in custody did you see any thing of him - A. I saw him at the corner of Winchester-street, opposite the posts; he was standing in the street; a gentleman asked him if he was a porter; he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a knot - A. No, he had not; the gentleman asked him if he would carry that parcel a little way in the city for him; he said he would, and I parted with him; I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the parcel that the gentleman wanted him carry like that - A. I cannot say exactly it was like that, but I took no particular notice, nor which way he went.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was the parcel laying - A. Upon the posts facing of Winchester-street; I went towards Fore-street, I left them together; I went on my business; I am a taylor, I live at No. 72, Golden-lane; I live in the one pair, I do not rent the whole house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does rent the whole house - A. The landlord does not live in the house, he lives in Smithfield: he is a cutler, his name is Dennis; he has a workshop in Golden-lane, and his shop is in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. It is an odd thing for a gentleman to have such a large parcel, did it not strike you. How long have you known the prisoner - A. I have worked for him a twelve month back, and more than that latterly; he lived at No. 80, Grub-street, just above the chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a gentleman was this - A. It was a gentleman, he had a brownish coloured great coat on, or an olive colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you were not in Throgmorton-street that day - A. I was not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you can best know whether you were or not - A. I certainly was not that day, nor week.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you learn that this man was taken up - A. Why I heard from his friends that he had met with an accident.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by an accident - A. That he had got into trouble; they said, did you see James so-and-so, I said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it you saw him - A. The 26th of February; I believe it was Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you told of it - A. I heard of it on the Sunday morning. It was Wednesday that I met with him to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. A. It was past eleven o'clock; it might be half an hour, but I am quite sure it was not twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the truss was it as large as that - A. I cannot say; I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. to Butler. What time of day was it the cart left your premises - A. Within ten minutes; I cannot speak truly about half an hour after twelve.</p>

               <p>Q. to Cox. What time did you leave the inn-yard - A. I am quite sure I was in the inn-yard at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you had left before you missed this truss - A. I do not think it was more than about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Will you undertake to say that very truss was the truss that was in the cart - A. Yes: I know it by the direction, there was only this one truss to Mr. Blackburn.</p>

Not of that amount; my trade is such that I take mostly one's and two's; the circumstance of taking a ten pound note is rather unusual; after I had given him the nine one pound notes it struck me that it was foolish to give nine one pound notes in change for so small an article.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know before you went to the bank that other persons had similar notes - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You doubted the note before you went to the Bank - A. I did, in consequence of something I heard. The prisoner said he came from Barnet; I was busy at the time when he first came in; he was in the shop about half an hour; I sold him two counterpanes; in the course of conversation, he said he came from Barnet, his wife had been there the week before, and she had purchased some articles that she liked; he said he was going in a chaise, he could take take them to Barnet, he had a boy with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon what occasion did you first see him - A. He came into Mr. Mackwell's shop on the 26th of November, I believe between three and four in the afternoon, he was in company of a little boy; he asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs, which I shewed him; he fixed upon two at a low price, he bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price - A. About seven shillings a-piece. He bought something else, some little trifling haberdashery, the whole amount was eighteen shillings; I was not able to give change; I went across the way with it to Alexander Illman, a linen draper in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver to Mr. Illman the same paper that you had received of the prisoner - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any doubt then of his person - A. I had not then in the remotest degree, nor have I now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did you take any particular notice of the man, more than any other man - A. I did, and the impression that it made on my mind, that I recollected the person more forcibly than before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember your neighbour's shopman Jenkins, coming to your shop with a ten pound note for change - A. I do, I took no notice of the day then particular, it was in the latter end of November<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080048"/> I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver that note which he put into your hand to your daughter-in-law, Miss Alcep - A. I said to him, do you know the person you took this note of, the water-mark appears too visible; he said he had it of a respectable man. I said to my daughter-in-law, put Mr. Mackwell's name upon it and give change; I went to the bottom of the shop, I did not look particularly at the note or else I should not have given change at night. I said at night to my daughter, look for the bright note I took of Mackwell; she looked and did not find it, I looked for it and found it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say he said he had it of a respectable man - A. Yes, if he had said he had it of a respectable looking man, a stranger, I should not have taken it.</p>

We had a serious altercation about it, and that at my own house; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080049"/> I had two small ones left which I burnt in the fire before his face, and a woman that was present; I told him I did not think he was capable of deceiving me in that kind of way, from the length of time I had known him, and the often dealings we had together; he told me he hoped it would be all right, and that nothing further would come of it; he returned me a twenty pound Dartford bank note by way of appeasing my trouble; he said he would take care to support me through it, as I never knew they were bad bank notes. A few days after I was apprehended he hearing of this it took a great effect upon him, he was taken ill in fact to his bed, and he died in about a week afterwards; at the time I was in prison he frequently declared to those that were in the habit of seeing him, that he gave me the notes for good notes.</p>

From what I heard on the stairs, I went out from my tea to see if any thing was wrong, I found the padlock off, and the door a little way open, I just looked in and saw no one was there, I immediately turned my head on the stairs, and saw the prisoner stepping off the last stair; I followed him as fast as I could, I saw him drop my brother's coat, I overtook him about twelve or fourteen yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish whether he was in company with any other person - A. I observed that he ran against another man when he got out of doors, as if he did it designedly; the other man ran up Vine-street, and was off. I seized the prisoner, I said I have you. The plow has never been found.</p>

I rode the horse to the turnpike, and came back again, I asked him what he wanted for him; he said twenty pounds; I told him I would give him sixteen pounds for the horse, and the saddle and bridle; he said no, the saddle and bridle is not my own. I bought the horse, and got the receipt of him for the horse and bridle; I gave him sixteen pounds for the horse and bridle. Here is the receipt the prisoner gave me, and then in thirteen days time the horse and bridle was owned by Mr. Robson; Mr. Robson had the horse and bridle, and the saddle he got of some Jews in Petticoat-lane.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Lawrence. I saw the prisoner going out of the door, I immediately told my master; my master pursued him. I did not see him come in, I was busy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawrence. I immediately followed the prisoner, I found him standing at a private house door with fourteen pounds of ginger at his feet; I went up to him, and he turned round; he was in the act of undoing his apron; I took up the parcel and saw it was my property; the prisoner ran away, I cried stop thief, the prisoner cried stop thief likewise; I followed him down Cavendish-street, he went into Charlotte-street. I saw no more of him untill he was in custody of the watchman. I am positive he is the same man; I could swear to his waistcoat, he had on the same waistcoat he has now.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was crying the hour half after eight, and hearing the words stop thief; I turned towards where I heard the noise and saw the prisoner, he was the first I met, he was crying stop thief as hard as he could; he was the first, and there were about an hundred after him, seeing he had an apron on I thought he was a shopman, and not a thief; I bethought myself that he must be the thief; I followed him, and sprang my rattle; he ran into a mews where there was no thoroughfare; he tore his apron off, and threw it upon a dunghill; he returned out of the mews against me; I said where is the man that ran in here; oh, said he, he is gone down the mews; I said, stop my friend, I think you are the man, what have you done with your apron; he replied, I had none; I took him on suspicion as a thief; I secured him; not knowing what he had done I brought him along to Duke-street; Mr. Lawrence called have you got him watchman; I said, I have somebody like him; he said, has he a striped waistcoat on; I said, he had; he told me to take care of him. The apron was found at the same place where I had seen him throw it.</p>

            . I am an officer, on the 20th of February I went with the last witness to Berner's mews by the Foundling-hospital, we traced the pigs to Woburn-mews, Little Guildford-street, after making two hours enquiry I went to the stable window and forced a pane, we undid the door and got in, the two pigs laid under the manger, I suppose the weight was thirty stone a-piece, they were very much fatigued, I could not get them to stir at all; I fastened the door up again and took my station at the top of the mews to see who came to the stable, presently Stone and Connolly came to the stable, Connolly with a sack under his arm, I let them go towards the stable door, Stone put the key into the door, as soon as I saw the key put in the door I came up and seized them both, Stone asked me what was the matter? I said you keep this stable for other purposes besides horses, you keep pigs in it, he said the two pigs were brought there by a man, he gave him leave to put them in the stable; I observed that they were stolen pigs, and that there were three more wanting, he said that he knew nothing about them; I saw his waistcoat was bloody, I asked Stone where he lived? he said he should have no objection telling me if I would not touch any thing at his house, I told him I knew partly what it was by what I had found in the stable, molasses and sugar, and draining of a distillery, a great quantity was in the stable, a great quantity we took to the Excise office with a still that we found at his house; I got my brother officer to mind the pigs, I found out where Stone lived, it was then about eight o'clock in the evening, I sent my brother officer to Stone's house to enquire if he was at home, I desired him to put his foot in the door to keep the door open until I came up, the door was opened by Mrs. Stone, I knew Stone, his real name is Peppitt, I told her I come about some pigs, we found a still and about five hundred gallons of wash fermentation, we did not find any pigs there, we stopped these all night, a little before six in the morning a person throwed some dirt at the window and smacked a whip at the door, presently a man knocked at the door, I opened the door directly, and Limbrick rushed out and seized Hughes, this was Friday morning, we told him what we apprehended him for, he said he drove the pigs for a German butcher from the ry, he had left him down by Bagnigge-wells, I told him that we had two of the big ones, and that they were stolen pigs; I asked him where he lived, he would not tell; I told him I understood he used the Bell down at Battle-bridge, I should take him down there and make some enquiry, we were going along, and by the Pindar of Wakefield he took me of one side and said he did not want to be exposed, he said he would tell me where he lived, and that the pigs were dead at his house, I went to his house in Smith's-place, Battle bridge, there I found the three pigs hanging up dead there, they would weigh about eleven or twelve stone a piece, they were quite warm all the offal laid upon a table in a large pan, the copper was hot, and hair all lying about, they could not have been killed above four or five hours; I shewed the pigs to Keefe.</p>

               <p>Keefe. The pigs Hutt shewed me are my master's property.</p>
               <p>- LIMBRICR. I am a constable, I accompanied Hutt to Stone's house, I helped to seize Hughes, I took him and the whip, I asked Hughes how he came by the pigs, he told me that he was a pig drover, he drove them for a German butcher; I asked him where he lived, he said he did not know, he drove for him ten or eleven years.</p>
               <p>Hughes' Defence. My lord, on Wednesday the 19th of February, I was employed to go down to Cheshunt to see if I could engage a house for a friend of mine, either in Cheshunt or a mile or two of this side or the other; I met with a friend I had known seven or eight years, he asked me where I was going, I told him not much farther; he told me he was going to Hertford, and if I was going further we would walk together; I told him I was weary of travelling; he asked me how I got my living; I told him by hawking of meat and slaughtering, he told me he was going to Hertford to meet some pigs, and if it was agreeable I might drive them home and kill them, I told him I had a very good convenience for slaughtering pigs or sheep, we went on, we come to Hoddesdon, it was about five o'clock when he left me, he told me I had better remain there and get some refreshment and rest myself; I sat there till half after five, or a little better, I asked the people of the house how far it was to the next public house on the Hertford road, I did not like to be idling there so many hours, I went to the public house called the College-arms, I called for something to eat and a pint of beer, and returned to Hoddesdon to the same house that I had left, I called for a pint of beer, I sat there till ten o'clock, I saw the company going home, I walked out, and in about a quarter of a mile of the other side of Hoddesdon I met a man with the pigs and another man walking along with him as a traveller with a bundle, we walked about an hundred yards, and the traveller wished us good night, and the person who employed me to drive the pigs, he left me at the further end of Hoddesdon, he said he must seek a bed there, when I told him it was doubtful the hogs would not travel to town, he told me then I might engage a horse and cart, I came to Enfield highway, I saw Mr. Steel standing in his yard, I asked him if he had got a horse and cart to let, the hogs were drove into the yard, Mr. Steel and his man assisted me with them into the cart, we came on to town to Pentonville chapel, we took three pigs out, we went on to Gray's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080056"/> Inn-lane, I called Mr. Stone and asked him to help me with them into Berner Street. I drove the hogs to a stable that is between him and me.</p>
               <p>Court. Now where is this man that hired you at Hoddesdon - A. He is not here.</p>
               <p>Stone said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Connolly was not put on his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your sister now living - A. She now is.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your father live - A. At Eston, ten miles from Canterbury, near Ashbourne, it lies between Ashbourne and Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your sister live with him after her marriage - A. He was with her two years nearly, at times with my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he knew your father's residence well - A. He made my father's house his home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long after the marriage it was that he left your sister - A. That I cannot rightly say; he left her several times, I think it was about three years that he left her, I believe at Margate or Ramsgate he left her.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had he lived with her, before he finally deserted her - A. About three years, to the best of my knowledge: from the time of his deserting her, she lived with my father during his life, and with my mother since his death. They have removed since to Ashbourne.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body was to enquire for your sister, there would be no difficulty in finding her - A. No. She had one child by him, dead born.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask him one question. As he says that I have deserted this lady, his sister, is he aware of the cause of my leaving her at Ramsgate, in the year 1801 - A. I am not certain of it, he left her in great distress.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to ask you in what kind of distress I left this lady - A. He went away and left her without any money in her pocket, and also took her clothes from her, and pawned her clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not wish to take the witness by surprise; will he swear that I pawned his sister's cloathes - A. From what I heard my sister say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had I any marriage portion with your sister - A. That I cannot say; my father frequently supplied you with money, to my certain knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Speaking within the mark, do you know what was the amount - A. I cannot speak to that exactly; he advanced money several different times; to what extent I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath to what extent he may suppose, does he imagine to the amount of one hundred pounds, or any such sum - A. Considerably more.</p>
               <p>Q. More than five hundred pounds do you imagine - A. I cannot say that it was more than an hundred.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life was your father in - A. A farmer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the witness whether he means to maintain, upon his oath, that I lived with his sister three years: as I was an officer in the South Loyal Gloucester militia, whether I did not leave this lady in my military character - A. I never saw him until after they were married. I never saw him in uniform; he was a military man at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. As seduction seems to be laid to my charge more than bigamy, is he aware that I met his sister about six o'clock; and went away with her the same night - A. He did, but not the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he mean to swear that she did not come away at twelve o'clock at night, from her father's house; does he mean to contend that it was not the same afternoon</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to know that your sister came away with him the first day that she was acquainted with him - A. To the best of my knowledge she was acquainted first with him at Canterbury, and at this time the regiment laid at Ashbourne.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long were they acquainted before they were married - A. About a month before they went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Your sister eloped from your father's house with the prisoner, upon which your father came to London, and sanctioned the marriage with his presence - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After leaving your sister two or three times, distressed, he finally left her - A. Them were not the only times he left her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body in company with you at the time you left the tavern - A. No. It was in the <placeName id="t18120408-71-crimeloc383">Little Minories</placeName>

               <p>Q. What were you knocked down with - A. I do not know, I suspect it was a fist, I had very black eyes the next day, and a black mark on my chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Were them from the effects of violence that you had received at that time - A. I think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who knocked you down, come before you or behind you - A. I do not know, I believe there were three of them; I was so stunned with the blow that I could not observe what passed afterwards. Mr. Vickers, and a neighbour of his assisted me up and assisted me home; one took me of one side, and one the other. I immediately put my hand in my pocket, and said I missed my pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time afterwards see the fifty-pound note, and the twenty-five-pound note? When did you go to the police office - A. About three or four days afterwards; I there saw the fifty and the twenty-five-pound note that I had been robbed of, at Lambeth-street office.</p>
               <p>MR. VICKER Q. On the night of the 11th of March were you in the Little Minories - A. Yes; I was passing through in my way home, I saw Mr. Saunders there, he was laying across the pavement, in the act of endeavouring to get up; I and another gentleman helped him home, he said he had missed his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the appearance of being perfectly sober - A. No. He had the appearance of being in liquor.</p>

After I had talked to Aswell he took me to his master's work-shop, he took a bit of wood off a work-bench, and between that piece of wood and the work-bench was this fifty pound note, wrapped up in this bit of paper; No. 12,504, a fifty pound note, dated the 25th of January.</p>
               <p>Mr. Saunders. That is one of the notes I lost, I had written upon them the name of the person of whom I took them, and my own initials; I can swear to the notes, I took them of Mr. Price, a clerk in the public office. I took them about two days before I lost them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe you caused an advertisement to be made concerning the robbery, did you give the description of the note which was to compose your advertisement - A. I did not, Kinnersley gave it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave Kinnersley the number - A. I did, he gave a wrong copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this is the advertisement, it is described No. 120,54 - A. The 0 is in the wrong place, I corrected the mistake as soon as I saw it, before my note was found.</p>
               <p>KINNERSLEY. I believe it was the printer's mistake, we issued an hundred more before the notes were found.</p>
               <p>NATHAN ASWELL. I am an apprentice to Mr. Aylett, he keeps the Blakeney's-head, Norton Falgate; he is a carpenter besides a publican. Miller and Smith came to me on Friday the 20th, and said they were sent by my master; I gave them the fifty-pound note which I had concealed, I had received that note of my mistress on the Tuesday before; she told me to take care of it; we had so many men in the shop, I did not know who they were, that was my reason for nailing it up in the way I did.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 12th of March do you recollect the prisoners coming to the public-house - A. Yes, both of them; they came between twelve and one; they had rum and some refreshment. Smith produced a fifty-pound note into my husband's hand, my husband gave it me to change, I gave them change, the prisoners came in together and went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was taken in custody, you got alarmed, you gave your apprentice this note to keep for you - A. I did, and here is a twenty-five pound note, my husband gave change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the prisoners - A. No, they had used the house about three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officers came to your house, do you mean to say you gave the same account then that you have now - A. I was taken at a disadvantage that morning for the safety of my husband, I said I know nothing of it.</p>

They both came on the 12th of March between ten and eleven o'clock, they staid about an hour and a half; Smith offered a twenty-five pound none to change, my wife was out, she keeps the cash. I went to Mr. Perkins the pawnbroker and obtained change of him; I gave Smith the change, Hayward was by at the time. After my wife came in they asked for change of a fifty-pound note, I gave the note to my wife, and she gave change for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never said any thing about this until you were taken up yourself - A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SUMMERS. I live with Mr. Perkins, pawnbroker, 52, Bishopgate-street. On the 12th of March I changed a twenty-five pound bank note for Mr. Aylett; this is the note. I wrote upon it the 12th of March, 1812.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. When Mr. Aylett came to Clerkenwell, I asked him if he meaned to swear our lives away, he said no, we were not the persons he took them off. I am innocent of the notes, Mr. Aylett he knows I did not give him the notes, nor his wife.</p>
               <p>Hayward said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. What might be the length of yards in one of these pieces - A. Six yards and a quarter; it will fold up in a very narrow compass.</p>

            , we live at the York Hospital, Chelsea. I did not miss the jacket and breeches, until they were brought me by Benson; they were taken out of the store that we keep locked up. They were brought to me on the 13th of March, when they were taken I cannot say, they are my husband's regimentals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. Yes, in the hospital, he never came to our house, he had been in the hospital for five or six months.</p>
               <p>AMBROSE BENSON. I am a patrol. On the 13th of March, about three o'clock, I met the prisoner with these things under his arm. I asked him what he had under his arm, he said some clothes to sell. I took him to the watchhouse, the cloathes were claimed the next morning by serjeant Lamb's wife.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know it is my husband's jacket, I made it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the things of a man in the street, he said he was going on garrison duty at Guernsey.</p>

I got out of bed and heard what he said; he said he had paid a one-pound note to Mr. Lightfoot, he took a score out of it. On the next morning I went to Mr. Lightfoot, I saw the note; I had endorsed that note with the man's name that I took it of; I am sure I had that note in my pocket-book when I was at Deptford that evening.

The prosecutor brought the man in by the arm, and told me that he had been robbed of his watch; I asked him where the watch was, he said Mr. Morgan had got it. Morgan gave me the watch, and told me the case was lost, he gave me the watch in the state it is now in, without the case or glass. I asked Morgan where he got it, he said, some unknown man gave it him in the street. I searched the prisoner, and found nothing; he said he was not guilty of it. The prosecutor said his watch was pulled out of his fob by the prisoner, in the street; the prisoner denied it, and said he never did such a thing in his life.</p>

On Thursday the 2d of April I was informed that some lead was secreted in a part of the shop, I took it up and marked it, and secreted myself in a part of the premises to see what became of it. The prisoner worked for me, he came in and brought a bag of tools in with him, he immediately went to the spot where this piece of lead was deposited, took it and put it into a narrower compass than it was, and drove a nail through it and put it under his waistcoat, and secured it from tumbling down by putting the nail into a button-hole, he immediately went off the premises with it, I followed him and brought him back and gave him into custody. This is the lead, it was in my charge.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Charles Street, Long Acre. On the 3d of April, the prisoner went to the privy, and as soon as he came out another of my men went to the privy, he came out directly and told me there was some brass in the privy upon the seat, I know O'Brien had been the last. In about ten minutes the man came to me again, and said he saw O'Brien put something in his breast, I sent for a constable, the prisoner was searched, and a quantity of brass found upon him. The constable searched his lodgings and there was found a quantity of brass.</p>

               <p>EDWARD BRITTEN. I am a patrol in Holborn, I came up at the call of watch, and took the prisoner to the watch-house. I knew the prisoner's person well.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAWSON. The prisoner was left, in the watch-house in my charge. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it is worth five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time the gentleman laid hold of me I perceived a person turn round and make his escape.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to Prosecutor.) Could any person run away and make his escape upon the spot without your seeing him - A. I think it impossible.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. From information I apprehended the prisoner as he was coming out of a turning that leads from Petticoat-lane to Whitechapel on the 17th of March, I took his hat off, I found these copper pans in his hat; I asked him whose property they were? he said they belonged to Messrs. Schooling, they were good masters, and he was a ruined man, he said I might as well take the scale beams also, he took them out of his pocket and began to cry.</p>

There being a bill at the window, the prisoner asked if he could have a lodging, it was the 2d of March, about half past eleven in the morning. I told him Mr. Furlong was a very particular man, could he refer me to any body for a character, he said he had come from some distance, and was going to work in the highway, he could not refer to any body. He came in the evening about half after five with a large bundle, saying if I would permit him he would go up stairs and put them things in the room; I went up stairs with him, and shewed him into the room, he asked me to let him put on a clean shirt, I left him there, he was in the room about ten minutes, I was in the next room, I heard him shut the door, I went down immediately afterwards. I went up to him at the street door saying I hope if you bring the remainder of your things to night you will not be late, he did not turn round to look at me, I looked to see if he had a clean shirt on, he had not. I went up stairs and found a sheet was gone, I pursued him and overtook him in the highway, I told him he had got my property I believed, my husband was a working man, that it was an object to me; I begged a gentleman to see me righted, he was secured, one gentleman said he has nothing in his hands, I said no, he certainly has it round his body; he unbuttoned his waistcoat, it was bound round his body under his waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of gates are there to your barn - A. A large pair of gates, and the yard is inclosed by a high wall, and large gates to the wall of the yard; the gates of the yard and of the barn are on the same construction, and the same sort of fastenings, and a wicket to each of the gates; the wicket is locked by a key, and she gates are fastened by a bar and a pin.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 19th of March you, I believe, had been out late - A. Yes, I had been in town, I came home about twelve o'clock, I sent my boy with the horse, he returned, and said he found the gates open. In consequence of that I went to the barn, I found the gates open, I went into the barn, there was a large heap of corn, it was visible that there had been a quantity taken from the bulk.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not given him any directions for carting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080072"/> any of that heap, had you. - A. No, he had not been working there the day preceding, nor any other person whatever. On the next morning the prisoner was taken in custody, I went to his house, his wife came out, I told her that I had come to search for property that I had lost; in a shed attached to his house I found a quantity of wheat in two sacks, about two bushels in another sack. I found about two bushels of peas and beans, and one sack marked with my own name, I also found a fat hog feeding upon clean wheat, which I had no doubt is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of wheat at that time - A. Fourteen or fifteen shilling a bushel. It is a thing that is never done, to feed hogs upon wheat, the wheat the hog was feeding on, it was the same kind of wheat as that in the sack, I compared it with the sample of the bulk remaining in the barn; I have no doubt it is my wheat.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. Q. I believe you went with Mr. Whitbread to search the prisoner's house. - A. Yes, his account is correct.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Were your store robbed of any coals on the 31st of January. - A. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner that I convicted last sessions was a man employed in a stable that we have separted by a boarded partition, and the prisoner was in the stable, and in the act of throwing out the coals. This man was in the stable, and was the man that opened the door to me, and afterwards absconded. It was the stable adjoining the warehouse belonging to me and my partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between the stable and the coal-warehouse. - A. None whatever, the boards were removed so as to enable a person to have access to my coals in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you found out the parties, did you discover that your coals were diminished close to that stable - A. We searched in the morning, and found that a large quantity of coals were gone, and these boards, leaving a passage to the stable where the late prisoner was employed, they could not have been removed from my premises at that spot. In consequence of the coals being removed, I lay in wait. Soon after six o'clock I heard a shovel going in the warehouse, and in the act of throwing out coals, I went to the stable door where the late prisoner was employed, whom I had seen go in with a light, I knocked at the stable door, and in a faint voice, asked the prisoner to open the door and let me in, he opened the door, and as soon as he saw me, he set off and ran away, and we were not able to see or hear any thing of him for a great length of time, I then went to the far end of the warehouse, and detected the other man throwing the coals out, to the amount of eight or nine bushels thrown out; the other man I secured, this man absconded till last Friday week he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of these coals - A. Twelve shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you leave the chambers - A. On Saturday, about three o'clock in the day. When I went out I locked the chamber door, I had locked the outer door on the evening before, both doors were perfectly secure when I went out: I returned to my chambers about ten minutes before four, and when I got upon the third landing I met the prisoner coming down, I went two or three steps further, and saw that the small room door had been violently used, that room door was broken open, Mrs. Kelham occupied that room, I pursued the prisoner, and got hold of him by the collar, on the last flight of stairs; I asked him what business he had on the top flight of stairs, he said, he had been to see if they wanted any pens or quills; he had none with him: I told the prisoner he had not been in the habit of selling pens or quills there, he had no right there, I detained him, and sent for a constable. The prisoner was searched in Mr. Townshend's presence, we found upon him two and three large spike nails, one of them bent, a gimblet in the bosom of his shirt, a small pair of pincers, and a file. In searching the prisoner's breeches pocket, something fell out, the prisoner snatched it up, it turned out to be a caddy spoon. After having secured the prisoner, the constable and I went to the small chamber, we went in, there had been a piece of wood split off the door, about an inch wide, by the lock, and about two feet long, and two or three holes bored slanting, by a gimblet; it appeared that there had been something pushed in the lock, and the bolt of the lock had been pushed back. In the room, two boxes had been forced open, one of the boxes had been corded, and the cords were cut; the other box had been nailed, the nails had been drawn, and two caddys were on the floor, they had been both opened, and the tea spilt about.</p>
               <p>Q. The caddies were left behind - A. Yes, the spoon was in one of the caddies, I have no doubt. On our missing the spoon we asked the prisoner for the spoon, he said he had not got it; we asked for something he let fall, the constable searched him, and found the spoon in his shoe. This is the spoon, it is bent, it was in the shoe, under his right foot. I have no doubt that the spoon is the property of Miss Kelham; I had seen it frequently in use.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080073"/> Bolderow. I am constable and porter. I was sent for, I found the prisoner at No. 11, at Mr. Townshend's. This is the spoon, I took from his right shoe; these other things were delivered to me; I looked at the door, it had the appearance as if it had been broken open with these implements.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your handkerchief - A. On the night of the 28th of March, I was just returning from a short walk at half-past ten at night, I was standing at the door waiting for the door to be opened; as soon as I had rung the bell, my face was towards the door, I felt my pocket-handkerchief moved from my pocket. On looking round, I saw my handkerchief in a young man's hand, whom I supposed to be Spencer, I saw him give it to another man, whom I am confident is Jackson. They walked on a little way together, I followed them, and accused them of taking my handkerchief, which they denied, and I cried out stop thief, they run off, and in a few paces they separated, one went straight on, and the other crossed the road. I followed Jackson, thinking I should find my handkerchief. Mr. Vaughan brought up Spencer, having heard the cry of stop thief. They were both taken to St. Andrew's watchhouse. As they passed to the watchhouse they went through a crowd of girls of the town, they said, if they had any thing drop it; nothing was found on them. Spencer at Marlborough-street office, told the magistrate it was Jackson that took the handkerchief, I supposed it was Spencer that took my handkerchief, when he was brought back, he answered to the description of the man that gave it to Jackson.</p>

               <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN. I am an attorney's clerk. On the 28th of March, about half-past ten at night, I was on my way to Eagle-street, Holborn, I met the two prisoners, I saw them in company together, just by Red Lion-street. I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw Spencer cross the Road, I laid hold of him and told him I stopped him on suspicion of having robbed some person. I know him to be one that I had seen in company with Jackson. I am sure I saw Spencer in company with Jackson. On our road to the watchhouse, I heard the girls of the town say, if you have got any thing drop it.</p>
               <p>Jackson said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Spencer's Defence. I never was in a court of justice before in my life. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Jackson called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Spencer called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I live at 62, Watling-street. On the the 23d of February last, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18120408-118-crimeloc632">Budge-row, Watling-street</placeName>

He then said, sir, I will give you another, a good one, which I took and put along with the other four shillings, I had no other shillings about me. In about three quarters of an hour I examined these shillings, I discovered two of them to be bad. In about two hours afterwards, I saw the prisoner near the Royal Exchange, I went to the Mansion-house and procured an officer, and had him taken in custody. I delivered the two shillings to the officer, the other three shillings were good.</p>

            . Mr. Page pointed out the prisoner to me. I took him to the compter. I found two dollars in his right hand waistcoat pocket, or the right hand breeches pocket; and nine three-shilling pieces, and seven six-pences. Mr. Page delivered to me these two bad shillings, and I found on him nine eighteen-penny pieces, and nine three-shilling tokens, all good; I found also on him two counterfeit shillings and five good one's.</p>
