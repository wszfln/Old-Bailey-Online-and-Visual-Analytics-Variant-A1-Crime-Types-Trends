               <p>Q. Had you known her before. - A. I knew that she lodged in the house with this person. On Tuesday she got up between five and six o'clock in the morning and went out; I was in bed, I saw her go out of the door; she took all my clothes, she left me in bed with nothing but my shift on; I had nothing left to put on, neither shoes nor stockings; I got up and endeavoured to pursue her; she got away, being an early hour, there was no body about to stop her; I sent a person to Mr. Harrison, a pawnbroker, to know if any of the things were there; they said they were not; they were afterwards found there. Last Friday I heard the prisoner was at the election at Covent Garden; I asked her what she had done with my things; she said some she had pawned at Mr. Harrison's, some she had sold, and the others she had wore out. I lost my things on the 20th of August, and I never saw the prisoner from that time till last Friday.</p>

            , captain Delaney, and Mr. Warwick, to the prisoner's apartment up two pair of stairs, No. 10, King-street, Drury-lane; on searching the room I found a great many duplicates; I then asked the prisoner if there were any more duplicates in the room; he said there was not. I moved a jar on the mantle piece; under that I found a duplicate of a pair of leather breeches, pledged for thirteen shillings at Mr. Payne's. The moment I found that ticket, the prisoner was very much alarmed, he begged the captain would forgive him. I asked him what he had done with the epaulets; he told me that he had sold them to a Jew for eighteen shillings.</p>

I had bought a bit of bacon the over night, and I put it in the stable when I did my horses up, and when I came home from my benefit club I went into the stable to take the bacon out; I saw a man in the stable up against the lost window, and the dunghill window was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that left shut. - A. Yes, I left it shut between six and seven o'clock; there were three pair of trace chains for cart horses, they were put in a sack, it stood against the dung hole window; the mouth of the sack was tied, and three ropes he had put loose on the dunghill, with his hat full of horse hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had these things been. - A. We always hang the harness up in the stable; he had cut the back band straps and took the chains out of them, and he had got the dung fork in his hand to try to wrench the bin open; when I went up to the dung hole window I found him in the stable. I called my follow servant back; then he got up into the loft.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man been about the parish. - A. Yes; he at a time had worked for Mr. Boram; he got out of the loft into the barn; we took him in the barn.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the other people do. - A. They ran away. The prisoner was searched, and nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Young man, this is a serious case, I wish you to be clear in your recollection - are you sure the prisoner at the bar is the person who snatched the watch out of your pocket. - A Yes, it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other people by in the court. - A. There were other people in the court, but nobody nigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who went with you to the watch-house. - A. Only the watchman. In the mean time I was holding him, there was a person that wanted to rescue him; he went to the watchhouse; I held up my arm; and when the watchman came he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. You never recovered your watch. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be in this court at eleven o'clock at night. - A. I was coming home from Mr. Simpson's, a public house that I use.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Was not you kept in the watchhouse that night. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken in custody to Marlborough-street. - A. Yes, the person that came to rescue the prisoner, he gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you to say when you held up your arm to him he ran away. - A. Yes; he came up to the watchhouse, and said I insulted him; then he gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What sort of a court is this, are there any improper houses there. - A. Perhaps there might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or meet with any girls in that court. A. There was a girl standing with two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no girl standing with you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand that you had no conversation with any girl in that court. - A. I did speak to a woman, I asked her how she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you intoxicated. - A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone parish. On the 17th of April I was crying the hour of two o'clock; I saw a man come down from a dunghill where this lead was cut off; I went to the corner of Gloucester-place to my partner, and told him to be ready, there was something going on that was not right; in going back to the mews again I saw the prisoner at the bar dropping down from the top of the roof of the kitchen upon the top of the wall, and then he came down from the wall into the mews; I ran to lay hold of him, I missed my hold, and he ran down George-street, Portman-square; I hallooed to my partner, stop thief, he stopped him; I searched him, and out of his hat dropped a great knife (producing it); my partner picked it up. I said what have you done with the knife, he said he had given it him back again; the prisoner said he had not got a knife about him, I insisted upon having it; the lamplighter was lighting the lamps, I called him over to bring his burner; I found the knife fixed in between the rails and the wall, I am sure it is the same knife. I took him to the watchhouse and secured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130006"/> him; then I went to the mews where the dunghill was, and there I found the lead hid in the dunghill (the lead produced); it weighed thirty-eight pound. I fitted it to the place, it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the lead cut from. - A. From the kitchen flat at the top.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you took me in custody did you see me with any lead, or in company with any body nigh me. - A. I saw you at the top of the kitchen, and your partner was receiving it from you.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 21st of April, about half after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the King's private road, St. Luke's, Chelsea; the prisoner had passed me as I was talking to another man in the road; I perceived that he had something of a bulk under his coat, I followed him, and when I came up with him I asked him what he had got under his coat; he pulled out these pieces of cloth that I have got in my hand; I asked him if he had got any flannel, he said yes, he had bought it at a shop in Oxford-street; I said I believe you live in Chelsea, he said he did, I had seen the man before; I said I should have paid a penny a-yard more than I should have walked to Oxford-street to buy flannel; he replied I work in George-street, Oxford-street, he said he was a <rs id="t18070513-8-deflabel49" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

I said, this is the first time, I suppose, he said it was; I told him to be cautious of telling an untruth, for I should search his house, I put him in the watch-house, and went to his lodgings, and there I found the remainder of the cloth.</p>

               <p>MR. DENNIS. On Saturday the 10th of May I was standing at my door, the corner of the mews where the duke keeps his carriage; the prisoner at the bar came past with a bundle under his arm; I had a glimpse of the crest on the button of the great coat; he was going as fast as he could; I suffered him to go forty or fifty yards, and then I pursued him; I caught him by the right hand and seized the coat with the left; I asked him where he had got this coat, he said he did not know; my reply was, that I thought I could take him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130007"/> to a place where I thought he brought the coat from; I conducted him to the duke's stable, knocked at the door, some of the domestics opened the door; I enquired in there was a great coat lost. The coachman came, he owned the coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the piece of floor cloth that was taken by the officer. - A. I believe it is; it was sold to Mrs. Fletcher.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. You are an officer of Worship-street. - A. I am. On the 15th of April I apprehended the prisoner; I asked him what he had done with the floor cloth, he said he knew nothing about it; I told him he should go to Mr. Benson's in Gee-street with me, and there he should find it; he then said he was very sorry, but he had sold it to her for forty shillings. We went to Benson's house with a search warrant; Benson went over with us to the little girl's mother; the little girl was in the room; I took the piece of floor cloth up. It has been in the office ever since, in the custody of Armstrong.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Davison and Newman in Fenchurch-street. On Thursday morning the 2nd of April about six o'clock, I was passing Cullum-street, I saw three men come out of the warehouse of Messrs. Darby and Hilton, and the last man that came out was the prisoner; each man had a canvas bag with goods in. The two first men passed me with very little notice; I noticed that they had bags with goods in it. When I came up to the prisoner he spoke to me and says, how are you master. I believe I have known him for five years. I made some reply similar to that; he followed the other two; I was a little struck; I turned round, I saw him go to the other two, I went to the end of the street, I saw the three men go up Lime-street for Leadenhall-street; I then concluded that they might be men employed by Messrs. Darby and Hilton. I went to my employ and took no further notice. On the next day I was passing by I saw a smith working at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You learned the next morning that they had been robbed. - A. Yes; I informed the prosecutors in the course of the day; I described who the prisoner was.</p>

            . Q. You are foreman to the prosecutor are you. - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner on the Friday the 3d of April in the afternoon, between two and three o'clock, I found him at his own house, I delivered him into the hands of Mr. Holdsworth and the constable directly. On Tuesday morning I went to the warehouse about seven o'clock in the morning, the lock was on but the padlock was off; I found the door upon the spring lock; there did not appear any marks of violence on the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon going into the warehouse did you perceive any thing, could you perceive that any thing had been taken away. - A. It was a snowy morning, I observed some footsteps of men in the warehouse, and part of the way up stairs, there was some flakes of snow on the floor; on seeing them footsteps I had some idea the depredators were up stairs, I went up stairs in hopes of taking them, I found no one there; we missed the goods in question; the woollen cloth was taken from the top of the warehouse, and the linen from the two pair of stairs. I had seen the goods a short time before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these goods. - A. About forty pound altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Barton) Look at these bags, are they the same sort of bags. - A. They are, I believe them to be the same.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. Where do you live. - A. No. 53, in Church-street, Bethnal Green. I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the man at the bar. - A. I have worked for him this three or four years; I make shoes for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting him any morning before he was taken up. - A. I did, in Lime-street, I think it was on the 8th or 7th of April, I cannot say which, it was on a Tuesday or a Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. That will make all the difference. - A. It was Wednesday, the 8th day of the month of April, I met him in Lime-street, rather nearer six than seven, about a quarter after six as near as I can guess; I saw the prisoner have a load upon his knot, he took it off and put it in a Hackney coach, and a gentleman in a light coat and a pair of boots gave him a shilling, and asked him whether that would satisfy him; the prisoner said to me he wanted a word with me, I stopped, he said, now I want a pair of good strong shoes; we went to the nearest public house, we had a glass of liquor, I measured him for a pair of shoes, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130009"/> we parted.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that all you say is very correct, when did you hear that he was taken up. - A. I never heard that he was taken up till last Sunday was a week, when I carried the shoes home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect that it was the 8th of April. - A. Because it was my birth-day.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was the 8th of April. - A. Yes, sir, I be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body give him a shilling. - A. Yes, a gentleman in a light coloured great coat, a dark coloured waistcoat, and a pair of boots; he asked him if he was satisfied; he had an umbrella in his hand, being a coarse morning; there was another person by his side, he looked like a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in the gentleman's company. - A. They were both by the coach, I cannot tell whether they were in company or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to to give an account of this. - A. Not before this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know this was the 8th day of April. - A. Because it was my birth-day.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how you came to know, it was material for you to prove, that the day on which you saw him was the 8th of April - are you quite sure he was not in prison on the 8th of April. - A. I am positive he was not, except it was late at night.</p>
               <p>Cartwright. The prisoner was apprehended on Friday the 3d of April; the trial was put off last session; Wednesday the 8th of April was the first day of the session. On the Saturday before the session he was committed to the Compter, and he was there on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Thursday the 23rd of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Mr. Wood's shop, opposite Mr. Gray's; in consequence of what passed I went out immediately, and saw Jones and another woman in Mr. Gray's shop, and a little child was playing by the door; I saw Sharp by a sadler's shop, about thirty yards off near Devonshire-street; there was a fourth woman, she was standing at the corner of New-street, a few doors from Mr. Gray's; I went behind the carts in the street, and presently I saw Jones come out and the other woman. Jones had a long duffell cloak on; directly these women came out of the shop, Sharp and the woman at New-street followed them; they all four went together up Rose-alley, which is a narrow alley and thoroughfare into New-street, and into Petticoat-lane; when they were in Rose-alley Jones stooped down, and said to Sharp, I want to tie up my stocking, Jones and Sharp turned into the passage of a house, I turned my face as they could not see me; I saw something pass from Jones to Sharp; after that they all four joined together again, and went up the alley together; I was behind them, I could see distinctly a piece of something under Sharp's apron, but what it was I did not then know; after that she rolled it up in her apron and carried it loose; I took hold of Sharp, Jones and one of the other woman turned to the right and the other woman went to the left; I asked Sharp what she had got; I took the print from her; she said she found it in Rose-alley. As I was bringing it back and the woman to the shop, I met Mr. Gray in Rose-alley, he was pursuing the woman. I have had the callico ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Jones. - A. I took Sharp to the Compter, she gave me information; Shepherd and I went and took Jones about an hour afterwards in Rose-lane; I told her what I took her for; I took her to Mr. Gray's shop, and the shopman said that was one of the women that were in the shop, and had seen her in the shop before.</p>

I had but eighteen pence, I had been to Orange-lane, to buy some oranges; as I was coming along Whitechapel I met my sister, we went into the Coach and Horses, and had a pint of porter; I had fifteen pence halfpenny then; going down the corner of Rose-lane there was some people a quarreling, they began to fight, they were both parted; I said what an odious thing it was for women to quarrel in the street; the officers came, one took the woman I was talking with, and the other took me; they let the other woman go; he says you have been stealing a piece of print; I never was in that gentleman's shop.</p>
               <p>Sharp's Defence. As I went up Rose-alley I saw the print lay, I saw no one near it, neither man not woman; when I got to the top of Rose-alley, that gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me what I had got, I shewed it him, he said he would take me where it belonged to; he took me into the gentleman's shop, they gave charge of me; as for this woman I never saw her before I saw her in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Sharp called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>MR. BISHOP. I am a bricklayer, I live at 42, Great Coram-street. On the 1st of May, between the hours of twelve and one at noon, I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's house; I could not swear whether it was No. 36 or 37, I am sure it was one; I saw him come out with something under his coat; I took hold of the prisoner, and took him home to my house; I told my wife to go and ask this person whether they had lost any thing, the woman came over and said they had lost a gown.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down Coram-street, I was not on the side of the way of that house at all, I was going to Islington; I was in want of a house for a gentleman, he had applied to me to get him one; there were several houses had paper in their windows, that the houses were to be sold; I went into a house, I found this gown, I tied it up in a handkerchief and brought it away; when I was in that house he came in, he said do you live in that house, I said I do not; I came to look at it for a gentleman; he then said, you had not that bundle when you came in, I said I had not; he took me to his own house, he sent for the woman, and she swore to the gown.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you go from. - A. From No. 21, Church-street, to No. 32, Frith-street. I went on the 28th of April; I had fastened the doors before the robbery, and the windows; the house was all fastened. I left the house at half past seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark. - A. It was not dark when I left it, between eight and nine o'clock. There was an alarm at 21, Church-street that a man had broke into the house in Frith-street. When I went the door was not locked, there was a lead pipe, a stink trap, and a copper was taken down from the kitchen. I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Do you live with the prosecutor as a servant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the place open the lamps were lighted. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live in Frith-street. On Tuesday the 28th of April, a little after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light. - A. It was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see the face of a man. - A. I could not see the face of a man. Being at my window I saw a man knock at Mr. Williams' door; after the man had knocked he crossed over opposite of my window; I could not swear to the man, he was about the height of the prisoner. About ten minutes afterwards I come down and stood at my door; I then saw two men at Mr. Williams' door, one with his face towards the lock, as if he was doing something to it with his hands, and the other with his back towards the door, with a view of watching any thing that might occur. When the man with his back towards the door saw me, he touched the other man, meaning as I suppose that he saw me. I then went into the shop and told Mr. Wilkins, my husband; on our return they were gone. I kept watching, and about a quarter of an hour more,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130012"/> seeing the door open from within side, and I saw a light through the crevice of the door, and a man coming out with something on his back; being dark I could not discern what it was. I immediately gave the alarm to Mrs. Williams the lady of the house at No. 21, Church-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. When you saw the person crossing the street you say you could not distinctly see his features. - A. No, I was at my dining room window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you met a man in the street you could have seen his features distinctly. - A. To be sure I could.</p>
               <p>- MOODY. I live opposite Mr. Williams' house in Frith-street. On the 28th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I came to the street door, there was an alarm of thieves at No. 32, I saw a man climb-over from the inside of the railing at Mr. Williams' door, I immediately made my way for him, but was too late to pursue him; he went off. On looking down the area I distinctly saw another man. I took him as he was scaling the iron railings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is he. - A. The prisoner now in question. I secured him fast, my master was in the house at the time; I called out to him, and Mr. Williams came down to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean that the prisoner was attempting to get away. - A. Yes, I do; he, the prisoner, was pulling me from one side of the street to the other, struggling to get away; we brought him to No. 32, and from thence took him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. What countryman is he. - A. He says that he was born in London, but that he has spent most of his time in Ireland. On the 4th of May last he was at work at my shop; about three o'clock a friend called upon me, he agreed to stop to dine with me; in the interim before dinner I was shewing him several watches, and among the rest was the gold repeater; that was the last I shewed him.</p>
               <p>Q. You replaced it I suppose. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a valuable watch. - A. Yes, it stands me in upwards of twenty pounds. A short time after I had gone in to dinner with my friend in a back room. I had left the prisoner in the shop; in about twenty minutes or half an hour after that, my servant called me and told me that the prisoner at the bar had run away; I could not believe it at first till they told me he had taken his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out to your shop immediately. - A. Yes, and I immediately missed this gold repeater, and a common silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the silver watch before. - A. In the course of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that. - A. Perfectly so. After consulting a little with my friend we agreed to go to Bow-street. We got there at a time when there was no business done; there we determined to go to several pawnbrokers, and leave the names and the numbers of the watches; one of the pawnbrokers that I went to was Mr. Lee at the corner of Dean-street in Holborn; when I enquired of him whether any of these watches had been offered to him, yes, he said, the silver watch.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker at the corner of Dean-street in Holborn. On the 4th of May, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and pledged a silver watch with me (I am quite certain of his person) for one pound fifteen. A short time after I had taken it in Mr. Duncan called, I shewed him the watch, he said it was his immediately. On the 8th of May, a person of the name of Southgate came to redeem the watch; I asked him how he came in possession of the ticket, as Mr. Duncan had ordered me to stop any person; he told me the person that gave him the ticket was at his house in Tabernacle-square; I took Southgate to Hatton Garden office, from there I went with Southgate and Stanton the officer, and we took the prisoner.</p>

By sight, I never saw him in my life before last Friday, between twelve and one o'clock on the 8th of May, he came into my house, he said he was very aukward, not having a watch in his pocket, he said he had one in Holborn, and if he could get any body to go for it, he would satisfy them for it.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a watch. - A. A gold repeater.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether that is the wife of the last witness. - A. I never saw the man before this business; the woman was in the habit of coming to my shop. I interrogated her concerning the property; she told me it belonged to a captain of a ship, that he was a respectable inhabitant of this parish, meaning the parish in which I live; that he was a friend and regular visitor of one of the ladies in her house. I put the question more than once, whether he was a stranger, or a person she had seen more than once; to which she answered that she knew him well; she added that if she was not sure that all was perfectly right she would not have brought the watch. In consequence of that I gave her eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you gave her a ticket. - A. Yes. On the following afternoon about four o'clock, Stanton the officer, and Mr. Duncan entered the shop; they produced the ticket; and on my shewing the watch, he claimed it as his property. Before I shewed the watch to Mr. Duncan he told me the name and the number; I looked and found it was so.</p>

On Easter Monday I was out before six o'clock in the morning, I was sent for to a place to nurse a person; I did not return any more till the Sunday following. I found my room very safe; on the 11th I was informed my room was broken open by my landlady. I went to it, I found it broken open, my door was broken down.

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On Sunday morning the 12th of April I was going across Hatton Wall. Mr. Barber told me the place had been broken open. From his information I found Mrs. Brand in company with another woman, walking very fast; I took Brand in custody. From information from her son, I believe it is, it was a little boy, I traced out Hobbs near Queen-square, she was servant to a gentleman. I searched her box; not finding any thing that led to the charge I went away; I returned back and took Broomfield to the same place; I directed her to stand at the door till she saw Mrs. Hobbs open the door; she challenged her to be one of the women that came to her along with the other prisoner. I took her in custody; Hobbs told me where the gown was pledged. I and my brother officer searched Brand's room, which was underneath the room that was broken open in the same house. I found this bed-winch; I thought by the marks upon the door post it had been used to force the door open. I fitted it to it, and it fitted exactly. There were two instruments used; Chapman holds another that fits the other mark.</p>

            . I produce a chopper. This was found in Brand's drawer. As I was taking Hobbs to prison she told me that the gown was pledged, and she thought a great deal more property, in Wardour-street. In consequence I took the prosecutrix to the pawnbroker's; there was nothing more found than what is produced.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you know the prisoner before he married your daughter. - A. He paid his addresses to her for a long time, I believe more than a year. I kept my girl from him seven months, I believe, because she was so young.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I think you said he paid his addresses to your daughter for a twelvemonth; that was time enough for you to enquire his character. - A. It was not done by my consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he has behaved well to your daughter. - A. He has not behaved well, but very ill.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Parkinson has known my family for twenty years. In the year 1804, I became acquainted with her daughter, at which time I was a <rs id="t18070513-24-deflabel157" type="occupation">mathematical instrument maker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

After she had put her husband in a private mad house, where he remained thirteen months, she permitted her daughter to sleep with me; in one of my mad fits I slept with her daughter; she was to give me seven hundred pounds to buy a commission in the horse-guards; she promised me two hundred pounds; thirty-three pounds I returned her back; nine pound I paid for a gin score.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you assert that ever you have been deranged in your mind. - A. Yes, from a nervous complaint in my head. At this time twelvemonth I had a letter from Mrs. Parkinson; she there speaks highly of my character; and adds, that she would protect me for the honour I had done to her daughter in marrying her.</p>

               <p>Court. I called on you for your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Parkinson by a drunken habit swore her life against me.</p>
               <p>Court. It is unbecoming you to throw any implication on Mrs. Parkinson's character. I want you to say something in your own defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The infamy of the mother has forced me to do what I have done; she has been infamous enough to take the duplicate of a watch from me; she swore her life against her daughter, and detained her in Tothill-fields. As for the two hundred pounds she said I had, every farthing was laid out in the repair of her mother's house, except forty pounds.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the officers of Worship-street. - A. I am. On Saturday the 25th of April I was out with Vickery and Mason. About two o'clock in the morning I was at the corner of a place that goes into Wheeler-street, Spital Fields; I heard the footsteps of some people; I stooped down and had my eye to the corner of Wheeler-street; in a minute or two I catched hold of the prisoner by the lower part of his body; at that time this piece of lead fell from him between him and me. I kept by the lead, and kept hold of the prisoner; he was very much alarmed at my catching hold of him. As soon as he came to speak, I said what did you drop the lead for; he said he had it not. I instantly, when the other officers came up, turned him round to let them see the dirt marks that were on his clothes; the prisoner was secured, and the lead was advertised, and on Tuesday the 5th of May this piece of lead was produced at the office by Mr. Walker, a plumber; I then produced this piece of lead, and it tallied with the other.</p>

I took a piece of lead that remained on the building, and took it to the office, and matched it to the other piece; it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that - A. About ten shillings.</p>

On the 8th of April I went to Barnet fair, I saw the prisoner with a mare, I asked him if it was to sell, he said yes; he asked eight pounds for it; I told him I would give him five pounds for it if he would give me five shillings back; I bought it for that money; he said the mare did not belong to him, he said his master was in the cow fair who it belonged to, and he had got two black cows and a poled white cow; he mentioned his name, out I cannot recollect it; I could not find his master in the cow fair. After I had paid the prisoner at a public house, at the door of that public house I put my little boy upon it; there were some people who knew the mare, they told me I had better get my money again, otherwise I should get into a hobble; I went into the public house, I told him I had a suspicion that it was a stolen horse, I told him he had better have the mare again, and to give me the money; he accordingly did give me all the money back again but two shillings and three pence, which he said he had spent in the public house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130016"/> The prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

I came up to town with him, I was handcuffed to him for safety; the constable did that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were only put as a sort of clog to him. - A. Just so. Allen charged the prisoner before the magistrate with selling him a stolen horse; the prisoner said he did not steal it. He did not disown but that it was stolen.</p>

            . I am a constable at Barnet. Allen, Buckle, and another man, brought the prisoner to my house on the 8th of April; I asked the prisoner where he lived, he told me at Cowling near Uxbridge; I asked him whether it was his own property or not; he said it was not, he was employed by a man of the name of

I have kept the mare in my custody ever since. I brought the mare up to Hatton Garden, the prosecutors saw it, and they recognised it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) You saw the mare at Hatton Garden, did you. - A. Yes, I was shewed her by Welsh; I swore to her; and here is the stamp that I stamped her in the hoof.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt but it was the same mare that was turned on the moor on the 4th of April. - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>

            . The prisoner was delivered into my custody on the 13th; he came to our office for examination. Before I took him to prison I asked him how he came in possession of the mare; he said a man of the name of Benson that lived near Uxbridge had employed him, he was to meet him on the morning of Barnet fair, against the hand post at the end of the road leading to Harrow; he did meet him there; he had three cows, two black ones and a white one, and a brown poney; Benson kept on the poney, and he helped to drive the cows till they came to Barnet common, near a barn; there they met with one of the Oxford blues that came from Windsor; he did not know his name. The Oxford blue then said they must all change their names, and if we have the luck to sell the cows, as well as the mare, we will all meet at the top of Holborn, and buy new clothes; I'll desert, and we will go down into Yorkshire and steal horses, and sell them at fairs; he said he had met this Benson and the Oxford blue at Windsor, and there this appointment was made. I put him in prison, and went to Windsor; I could find no Benson; I heard of a person of the the name of

            . The prisoner at the bar came to me last Sunday week about seven o'clock, as I was going to bed very ill; there was she and another girl came in with an excuse for me to mend a pair of shoes against the next morning, for her to go to Billingsgate. I told her she should have them done. My watch and ring laid upon the table; they took them both; I will not be sure which took the ring, whether it was the prisoner or the other person, but I am sure the prisoner took the watch; they took them out of my room and fastened my door; I padlock my door when I go out; I sell shoes; they put the hasp on the staple and fastened me in the room; it was about a quarter of an hour before I could get out, I called to my neighbours some time, at last they heard me and took the hasp off and let me out.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house do you lodge in. - A. A bottom room.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this woman before. - A. Yes, as a neighbour, I never had any thing to say to her; she brought me a pair of pumps to mend once before, she lived next door to me. After I got out of my house I went to her house to seek her, she was not at home. On Tuesday morning I found her in bed about four o'clock, I went with an officer; she said she knew nothing about the watch. I am sure she took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you give me this watch on these terms, for to lay with you. - A. Me want a wife! I am seventy-five, bless my soul, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you come in my place and offer me two gowns of your wife's. - A. I did not, there never was such a word spoke.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, do not be angry. - A. No, sir, I am not angry, but a man of seventy-five years of age, it makes me shudder.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your watch since. - A. Yes, it is here.</p>
               <p>MRS. CHANDLER. This young girl brought a watch to me on Sunday night the 3d of May, she asked me to put it by for her for a few minutes. When she came to my house she said it was her mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live off Mr. Archer's. - A. I cannot tell, I keep the Star and Garter, Whitechapel road. In ten or fifteen minutes she came for it again; it was a silver watch. When she brought it to me I said it was an old antique thing, and I put it in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come into the shop. - A. Yes, I am sure of her person, there was a young man in the shop at the time, he is not here; the prisoner asked for a small pattern to make patch work. I shewed her several, and she at last fixed on one.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of that. - A. Twenty pence a yard, she asked for half a yard, and half a yard she had for nine pence; two others came in at the time, and they asked for the same articles; she stopped there; I do not know whether they were in company together, I suspected them all three; and I did every thing in my power to prevent their stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they speak to each other as if they were known to each other. - A. There was nothing past. I cannot tell whether she knew them or not, they all went out of the shop together; the other woman bought a yard of another pattern; I did not miss any thing till the prisoner was brought back. From information I went out, I saw Ealand had hold of the woman, he lifted up her apron, and asked me if that was mine, I told him it was; it was a piece of printed calico that was under her apron; I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she bargained for any thing of the sort. - A. No, I had not shewn it her.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards did this piece contain. - A. Twenty-four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you saw this under her apron, had you seen this piece of calico in your shop. - A. It was upon the counter when she came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you did not see her take it or else you would have stopped her. - A. I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>Q. The other person who was in the shop is not here. - A. No, he was quite in a detached part of the shop, not where she was.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this piece of calico in her apron. - A. She had a bundle in a silk handkerchief; with the pressure of her hands she kept it under her apron; when she was brought back into the shop, she immediately dropped the bundle in the silk handkerchief; somebody observed to her, you have dropped your bundle, she said it was not hers; she said the callico that I claimed she had received it of a young woman.</p>

            . I am a baker. On the 20th of April, about five in the evening, I was coming up Fleet-street, near Mr. Allenby's shop, I saw this woman and two more come out of the shop; I saw a large piece of cotton hanging down below her apron, the greatest part was in her apron, but some part was below it; a gentleman was standing by me at the time I saw her come out of the shop, and turn up Bride's-passage, and she looked behind her; the other woman went towards Bridge-street; Mr. Allenby's shop is the corner of Bride's passage; she turned up there and went strait on; the young man and I said she had stole that piece; I suspected her and went up the passage after her; and I saw the cotton as I walked along at her side; I told her that cotton did not belong to her; she said no, it did not belong to her, it belonged to a little girl that gave it to her at the bottom of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you actually see her come out of the shop. - A. I did, there was no little girl with her or near her; Mr. Hindel went to Mr. Allenby's, I held her till Mr. Allenby came, then I pulled her apron up, I said, does that cotton belong to you, he said he believed it did, he knew the pattern; Mr. Allenby and me brought her into his shop; the calico was given to the constable, and she was given in custody.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had occasion to go into Fleet-street, I wanted to buy a piece of cotton, I met a woman, she told me she was coming away from her husband and he was pursuing her; she gave me this callico at the corner of the wine vault door, she told me to follow her to Black Friar's bridge, she would meet me there, I was making a bit of patch work; I went into the shop to purchase half a yard, it was in my apron when the gentleman made a prisoner of me; I thought he was her husband, as I never saw the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that woman here. - A. No, I do not know where she lives, nor does she know where I am; I am a poor woman with three children, without a father.</p>

I immediately collared him, I took him into the warehouse, and sent for an officer. I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the kettle to be yours. - A. I have every reason to think it is; I cannot swear to it The prisoner went down upon his knees and begged my pardon, and said it was the first time he had ever done so. I saw the things the officer brought from his lodgings; I can swear to the pottidge pot; that has our private mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the kettle which your master took from him. - A. Yes. There is no mark on the kettle. I went with the constable to the prisoner's lodgings; we found three sauce pans, a pottidge pot, two flat irons, and a gridiron; I can swear to the pottidge pot by the mark. The prisoner owned taking the tea kettle.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMSON. I am a servant to Mr. Scholing. I can only speak to the tea kettle; it was one made by my father, he made one dozen last February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I suppose you could not tell one from the other. - A. I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked for Mr. Scholing as porter; I was in the habit of putting things up and taking them down; I was going to hang the tea kettle up; as for the other things I did not know they were in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you use to keep your money. - A. In the bottom drawer of a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out on the Tuesday, did you know what money you had left in the bottom drawer. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it kept locked. - A. Yes, I always kept it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your money in the course of that day before you went out. - A. I had not seen it for a week before, my wife had; when I last saw it there was one two pound note, four one pound notes, and one guinea; I kept them in a tin box.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon coming home Tuesday afternoon did you go to your bottom drawer. - A. I had no occasion to go to it; I looked at it and saw the drawer open; I always kept the keys in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this woman in the house that day. - A. She was, she was hired that day to look after the children; my wife was gone to church. I looked into the drawer, I was alarmed that the tin case and the contents were gone; the indenture and the money together were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman in the house when you returned. A. No, she was gone; I was alarmed that she should leave the house so clandestinely; I did not expect her to leave the house till my wife came home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you expect your wife to return. - A. I did not know when my wife would return; when I came home the prisoner was gone, and left the house in the care of the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come back at all. - A. No. I I found her on the Saturday afterwards in Shoreditch in the street, I saw her in company of my brother-in-law, he had found her out.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is your children. - A. The eldest is ten, the other is eight; I found the indenture by the prisoner's direction in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, where she told me she had slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your money or your notes again. - A. No, she told me where she had changed the two pound note, that was at a pawnbroker's at Islington; the pawnbroker told me the woman had changed a note; he told me he did not know whether it was a two pound note or a one.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she told you that, did not you tell her it would be better for her. - A. No, she made no hesitation of telling me. The tin box contained the whole of the property. She changed the guinea at a gin-shop in Fleet-street; she told me she forced the drawer open and she took them; I found the drawer was forced open; the lock was standing up when I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of her living in the house did she know that you and your wife kept the money there. - A. I do not know; she further told me that she went with Mrs. Butcher, and this Mrs. Butcher had robbed her of one of the one pound notes. The prisoner told me she had purchased a gown and cap at the pawnbroker's at Islington; he said that she had bought a gown and cap there, but he did not know whether it was a one pound note or a two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The drawer was open when I went to the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. You thought the drawer was locked. - A. Yes, I always kept it locked.</p>

               <p>Q. When you left the house was that drawer safe that you kept the money in. - A. Yes, I looked at the money before I went out; I opened the tin case and I counted it; I opened the drawer by taking another drawer out, and then I could get at the money; I have frequently done that before the prisoner's face; there was one two pound note, four pound notes, and a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after she was in custody. - A. I saw her at the Falcon public house; I asked her what she had done with the things. I told her I would not forgive her for leaving my five children, they might have been scalded to death; she told me if I would forgive her, she would pay me by installments; I said how can you get the money, she said she might pay me in a week; I said what rob another poor family, and distress them as you have me; she said she took it out of the drawer, and she knew it was there, for I shewed it her when I went out; I searched her, I found none of the money; she said she was robbed of a part of it.</p>
               <p>- HINKS. You are the brother-in-law to the last witness. - A. Yes. I went in pursuit of this woman, I found her on Saturday the 2nd of May, about a quarter before one, in the street in Shoreditch, facing the Swan public house. I asked her how Mrs. Owen did, she told me she did not know, she had not seen her since Tuesday; I then taxed her with the robbery, and she strongly denied it; I asked her if she would have the kindness to accompany me to Mrs. Green, an acquaintance of hers in Spitalfields, she said she had no objection to go; when we came to Mrs. Green's, Mrs. Green burst out a crying; I had prior to that told Mrs. Green what had past; the prisoner sat down, Mrs. Green told her she had ruined herself, and broke her heart.

             then told me she would tell me where the indenture was; she told me they were in a lodging house, in a street in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get them there. - A. Yes, I went with the prisoner back to the Swan public house, and there met my brother-in-law; we three went to where she had slept, and there we found the indentures, according to her directions. She then told me she changed a guinea at a wine vaults in Fleet-street; we then all three went to Islington; where she had purchased a gown and a cap, the pawnbroker said she was in his house believed on the Tuesday afternoon, in company with Mrs. Butcher, and bought a gown and a cap, but he could not be positive whether it was a one pound note or a two, that she had changed; then she told me that Mrs. Butcher and her went to Highgate to see a child of hers that she had out at nurse; and that she bought the child a doll that cost her eighteen pence, and a small tea pot that cost her four pence; and coming back from Highgate in company with Mrs. Butcher and the hackney coachman, they called at the Britannia to have tea; they went in the coach again, this woman told her the coachman had done her, meaning that he had taken part of the money away; she went to Mrs. Butcher the next morning, and asked her for the money that she had missed, when she was sober; Mrs. Butcher told her she knew nothing of it, and threw a gown after her, and shoved her out of the door. After that she pawned the gown that she had bought of the pawnbroker for four shillings, and laid it out in gin and spirits; and after that money was spent, she pawned her shift, and had no one on when I took her, according to her own account.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the morning when I went my mistress gave me some thing to drink; we drank freely together both she and I; my mistress took out the second drawer, which is next the bottom drawer, she shewed the woman and me these notes; she told me that she had taken one or two out, and he had never missed them Being a little in liquor that day before she went, she ordered me to bring the notes to this place, where she was gone; I did not take them with a view to rob her of them. I being in liquor I changed the guinea in Fleet-street; then I went on, I had something more to drink, and I forgot I had any thing to bring to my mistress; I did not know that I had got any thing of the kind, till I got to Mrs. Butcher's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a half pint pewter pot. - A. I did, on the 8th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the house at the time you lost it. - A. Yes, I served him at the bar with half a pint of beer; he took the beer into the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay for his beer. - A. Yes, and in about a minute or two he left the taproom, my mother-in law was in the tap room at the time; she came and asked me what was gone with the half pint pot. In consequence of that I went into the tap room to see if it was there; not finding it there, me and an acquaintace of mine went in pursuit of the prisoner, and took him three yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the half pint pot with him. - A. It was in his jacket pocket. I know it to be mine; it was marked with the name of the person that lived in the house before me; I delivered the pot and the prisoner into the charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning specified in the indictment, it might be nine o'clock that I went into the house, I called for half a pint of beer, whether I had drank the half pint of beer I cannot say; I tossed up with two or three people in the tap room; we then played with a thing at the ceiling, like the hand of a clock, like that ventilator (pointing to the ventilator); I turned out of the house to make water, I got a little distance from the door, I was returning to go into the house, a man came up to me and said what have you done with the half pint pot; I put my hand to my pocket, there the pot was half sticking out; if I had meant to conceal it, I should not have carried it away in that manner; my pocket is so shallow I am sure it must have been put in by somebody out of spite and malice.</p>
               <p>Jury. (to prosecutor) Were there any other persons apparently drinking in his company at the time. - A. There was no other person, and he paid for the beer on delivery.</p>

About eight in the evening I saw the goods upon which it was placed in a moving state, I went to the door, I saw the prisoner walk away, I followed him, he crossed the way, I saw him change something from his left hand to his right, I could not see what it was; he then crossed the way and went into Grey Friars; he then began to run, I called out stop thief, he threw the dress from him. I picked it up; he was going to the Blue coat gate, it was locked up, he was obliged to return; I had never lost sight of him. A gentleman struck him over the mouth and broke his stick with the blow.

             said in the presence of the prisoner, that the prisoner was the person that took the watch, and that morning a man whom the prisoner lodged with had the watch; the prosecutor found the watch in the man's knapsack, as I understood. I asked the prisoner if that was the case; she said it was; and while I was taking them to prison the prosecutor apprehended the man. He being a soldier the magistrate thought fit to have him tried by a court martial.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Where did you get that watch. - A. Of one of the guards, his name is Manning; I found it in his knapsack. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you fell asleep was Manning in the room. A. No, there was none but these three women.</p>

On the 27th or 28th of April I saw a man come out of the yard with a pair of wheels; there was a stick run in between the wheels, and with his running them along the stick broke. He tried to tie the stick up again; he went a very few yards before the stick gave way; he went into the yard and got another stick, and wheeled them off.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you tell me whether at the time he received the blow, he was sitting or standing. - A. He was standing, his work is standing; after he fell down, not being able to recover himself, he laid two minutes and then got up, and he came out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long did your husband live after the 15th. - A. To the 18th, which was Saturday, I told him that

No, not till the next morning about three o'clock; it was about eleven or twelve when it happened, and at three o'clock the danger was perceived. He went to the police office immediately it was done; he was never out of the bed afterwards.</p>

Yes, when he went for an officer I saw him in the street, a little before twelve; he had a cloth over his head, he was going home; the blood was running over his head and face at the time he desired me to go to the police office to see if there was an officer; I went, but there was never a one; I returned again immediately and stood by him, and during the time the surgeon was gone for; I asked him how it happened; he told me his lad had spoiled him a gun, he said he asked him what he meant by so doing, he told me it was so spoiled he did not think he could alter it; the lad told him he must alter it himself, he had nothing else to do; he asked him what he said, he repeated the same words, he told him if he must hear it again, that if he had spoiled it, he had nothing else to do; he returned to his bench and received a blow; he said he fell down like an ox, immediately; and when he had said this, he fainted away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he received the blow with. - A. No, he said the blow was on his head; I saw him on the evening, I told him that I had heard the lad said, he had beat him violently on his loins with the stock of a gun; he said, if he never entered the kingdom of heaven, he never lifted his hands against him; but gave him a push with his foot. Frequently after that he said he was murdered, and cried out for justice; his voice was so low he could only say, murder, justice.</p>

On the 15th of April, I saw the deceased come from his own house, it is directly opposite of the office; with his head all bloody, and a thick cloth to it; he asked for an officer, but there was none there; he immediately went out.

            . - Mr. Knapp. What are you, sir - A. I am a surgeon. On Wednesday the 15th of April, between eleven and twelve, I was called into the deceased; I found him sitting in a chair, supported by a female; upon examination, I found a wound on the right side of the head, about an inch and a half in length.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the wound, did it appear to be done with a sharp or a blunt instrument. - A. It is impossible to say; the wound corresponded with the extremity of the saw, with which it is said to be inflicted; (the saw produced); on examining the saw, after I had dressed the deceased, I found on the end of it a drop of blood; at that time there was no certain appearance of danger; I saw him repeatedly afterwards, till he died, he got worse and worse; I saw him in the evening when he was perfectly sensible; I asked him several questions respecting his head, and respecting some medicine I had given him; all which he answered rationally; this was the last visit. On the 15th, the day of the accident, the next morning I was sent for, before my usual time of going out; upon enquiry I found a sickness of stomach had come on about three o'clock in the morning; this convinced me there was some injury of the brain. I pointed out the necessity of an operation, and recommended to them to have a consulting surgeon, Mr. Luxmore was called in, 27, at St. Mary Axe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find upon examining him, the brain was injured. - A. Yes, we found a detached piece of bone,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130022"/> which had been forced through the membranes into the brain; he appeared very little better for the operation, and continued gradually to get worse till he died.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of his death. - A. The wound in the head, the fracture in the scull; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>MR. LUXMORE. - Mr. Knapp. Do you, sir, agree with that statement. - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please you, my lord, the blow which I received on my back overcome me; upon which I slung my hand back with the instrument I had got in my hand; I got out of the shop as well as I could and as soon as I could, and when I came to the yard door it was fast; I was terrified for fear my master should come after me. I looked for something to open the latch with; in the mean time my mistress opened the door. I went home and shewed the blow which I had received to my father; my father advised me to go to the office to get a warrant.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you receive the blow with. - A. With the but-end of a gun; when I came to the office the clerk of the office would not grant me a warrant. From that time till Monday last I have been with my friends. I surrendered myself to the office.</p>

The prisoner Baptista lodged in our house for about a week before this business happened; he got up earlier than is usual to get up in the house, he came down stairs, I spoke to him out of my room, I said who is coming down stairs; he went down and I followed him, I found the door open and he was gone; I saw him going away with a bundle in his hand. In about eight or nine days afterwards I saw him in Ratcliffe Highway, I asked him to return me the property he had stolen from me, and I would not prosecute him; he replied I was a girl of the town; he drew a mob round me and ran away; this was on the Saturday. Sunday I saw him again much in the same place, he ran away again. In consequence of information, I got an officer, his name is Mercury; I found the prisoner Baptista on the Sunday night; he was taken in custody and taken to the watchhouse. As we were coming out of the watchhouse Bonnas came up, he said if he could he would have me in a worse place before it was long. On the next day at six o'clock we went before the magistrate, the magistrate wished us to make it up. Not finding any thing upon Baptista, we all went over to the lock-up house for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money to be paid. - A. There was one pound to be paid.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the magistrate order the one pound to be paid. - A. My money was fifty shillings that I demanded of my loss, and Bonnas made answer that he would pay a one pound note, whether I would take it or not, on account of his shipping the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. What is Bonnas. - A. He <rs id="t18070513-36-deflabel230" type="occupation">keeps a lodging-house, and ships men</rs>

He sent for the money, and his wife sent a guinea, it was paid into the officer's hands; we returned him a shilling; Bonnas said it was the last pound I ever should handle if he could help it. I sat down in the place, I did not like the parties; they went away before me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, Bonnas and Baptista went away, and his wife also, leaving you and your brother behind. A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge, they went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130023"/> away about a quarter of an hour before us.

               <p>Q. That is cut just about your waste. - A. Yes. And this is the gown, they were both cut. Upon that my brother came up and seized Baptista by the collar; Baptista then struck my brother, and they jostled one with another a short time. I saw Baptista fall twice during the time they were scuffling together, and the third time he ran towards him and struck him with an instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say strike him or stick him. - A. Stick him with the instrument; my brother screamed out, oh, sister, I am murdered, I am stabbed; Bonnas sprung forward and asked Baptista, he said did you do it; Baptista said yes. Bonnas stamped his foot, and told Baptista to run away. Baptista immediately ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Baptista's running away what did Bonnas do. - A. He knocked my brother down upon his knees; then Bonnas turned his back, took his wife by the arm and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. What time of the evening was it. - A. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark then. - A. Yes, but there were lights in the shop, and the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband is a crimp. - A. No, I do not think he is, he is a sadler by trade; it is my business if I can get a couple of guineas, I take it. I provide slops for the seamen that lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. After your brother came over as you described, they were jostling together, did that continue very long. - A. About three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were no blows that passed between them. - A. I will not venture to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Baptista was throwed down twice before there was any injury done to your brother. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a complaint at the office, and they dismissed that complaint, and told you to settle it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have said when you come to put your foot on the pavement, that moment Bonnas came up and knocked you down without any words. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a very violent blow he gave you. - A. No, he did not hurt me very much, the place was very slippery.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you was a little alarmed at such an unexpected salute. - A. No, it was what I expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you get out of the way. - A. I went out of the way as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother came across the way after you had seen the knife, why did not you call out that the man had a knife. - A. I did not know that it was a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was an offensive weapon. - A. Of course I did. I cried out to him to take care of himself; in the flurry he did not hear. I said we will have him another day.</p>
               <p>Q. That was because you saw the cut upon your gown - you were examined at the police office two or three times. - A. I have been several times there.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon the oath you have taken, did you upon any one of the examinations that took place at the police office, say that you cried out to your brother to caution him of the danger he was in. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. I know all your dress on that occasion - did not you wear a great coat, a pelisse, or any thing of that sort. - A. I had not, I had nothing outside but my shawl I had on me now.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious, I shall call witnesses. - A. You may call as many witnesses as you like, I had nothing but a shawl over my shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no ill will towards Bonnas till this day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great regard for him. - A. No, I had no regard for him; I only knew him by eyesight.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you never quarrelled together. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever travel to Gravesend. - A. Yes, I recollect being at Gravesend, and Mr. Bonnas seemed to be a great man, and he seemed to ridicule poor women.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do to him. - A. I gave him a slap on the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, have you not said that if ever you could find an opportunity you would hang him. A. No. I said if ever he insulted me again, I would try the laws of my country against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you persist in swearing that Bonnas was by at the time your brother was wounded. - A. He was close by when my brother was wounded, but he did not join in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. After the transaction on that night, did you say any thing to Mercury - namely, that Bonnas was the person that handed the instrument to Baptista. - A. I screamed out, oh you villain Bonnas, you handed the instrument to Baptista, you are the cause of this; I said to Mercury are not you a bad man for not taking the man up after stabbing my brother. I believe I said this in Bonnas's house.</p>

Yes, and I asked my sister to go, she said she would not till they were got out of the way; to the best of my recollection it might be near half an hour before we left the lock up house; we went the regular way home. Soon after we got out, we saw the prisoners on the pavement before us; my sister told me to cross over the way, we both crossed; my sister said she wanted a coach; I told her it was not worth while to take a coach; she went across the way before me, I heard her shout; I ran up to the place where I heard the noise; I saw Baptista striking her, and Bonnas was close by; when I came up Baptista struck her on the head; I seized hold of him by the collar; I asked him what he meant by striking a woman, he turned round and struck me on the face, I struck him again with one hand, and I held his collar with the other; then he stabbed me on the thigh; very soon I felt the blow upon my right thigh, upon the groin; after I felt the stab, and felt the blood running, I cried out murder, I was killed; I did not fall by the wound.

Some little time after this transaction took place, I went into Bonnas's house, hearing the officers was there, and knowing how his house was situated; I thought if a man had been guilty of stabbing a man, he might go out the back way. In consequence of that I went round the back way. I found Baptista by the wall of the gardens; he was there close to the wall, there is a little ditch there besides; I said, halloo, what are you about there; I was getting near him, he attempted to spring the wall; I took hold of his collar, I said, I suppose you are the person that has been cutting the man in the street; come sir, I says, you must go with me; he said he was no thief, no robber (in bad English), only cut the man; I kept hold of him by the collar, till I got him into the house; I delivered him to Oliver; we found a very little blood on his hands; I fetched a lanthorn and searched the place, and found no knife at all.</p>

I am; Mr. Eddington was the surgeon of the house at that time; he examined him; the wound was in the upper part of the left thigh, just below the groin; the wound was about two inches in depth, and about half an inch wide; the wound was done by a sharp pointed instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound in such a situation so that death might be occasioned thereby. - A. Yes, it was very near a principal artery in the thigh.</p>

               <p>Bonnas' Defence. My lord, I am an innocent man; I had been down to Gravesend, and while I was at Gravesend my wife received him; when I come from Gravesend I found this man, Baptista, in my house; I had five men in the house besides him. I asked my wife what that man did in the house, she said a captain wanted six men at night; the sailors told me that Baptista was taken for a robbery; I went to the watchhouse, one of the gentlemen told me he was locked up for a robbery. On Monday six o'clock I went to the magistrate, the magistrate said it was a quarrel about the crimpage; he told them to go away and settle it among themselves; we went to the public house with the officer Mercury; Mrs. Kashaw said she would have two pound ten shillings, I said, I cannot give that money, Baptista owes me four pound already; Mrs. Kashaw then would take one pound; I said that will be all out of my own pocket; I sent to my wife for a guinea, she came to me, after that was paid, Baptista walked out of the house first, then Mercury, my wife and me. After I came out of the house I missed Baptista; I never saw 
               <persName id="t18070513-36-person396">Baptista</persName>
             no more till the gentleman brought him into my house. Mercury came and told me that Baptista had stabbed the man; the parish officers came and said they must look over my house for him; I said with all my heart; when the gentleman brought Baptista in the house, they handcuffed me, and took me with him; the magistrate let me go home, and told me to come again tomorrow morning at two o'clock; the next day we had a hearing, the sister swore against me the most vilest she could; and then I was committed to New Prison.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you at any time hear Mrs. Kashaw say any thing and when, that Bonnas had a knife. - A. I did not hear her say any thing of a knife, till the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with this woman about this business. - A. Mrs. Kashaw has often desired me to call at her house, and have a cup of tea with her; she has often said that she would be revenged against Bonnas, if possible, because he was a bad man. About a month or five weeks after this happened, I met her in the Highway; I asked her how her brother was; she said she was going to see him, he was very bad; will you take a walk with me. She said if it was to cost her ten or twenty pound she would not mind it, to be revenged of that fellow Bonnas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Is it true that two pound ten was what the woman required. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you reconciled the matter for twenty shillings. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of that did you have for your share. - A. Ten shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect a captain calling that wanted your master. - A. Yes; and I went to meet him; as I went by the coach stand, I saw two men and a woman struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find your master. - A. Close by the end of New Gravel-lane, almost by the tobacconist's shop; Mr. Bonnas and his wife were together; there was a man bidding them good night. I went home with my master and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on your way home. - A. I saw the scuffle as I was coming towards them, to meet them; we all came strait home to his house.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you see when you were coming to meet your master. - A. I saw two men and one woman struggling almost by the coach stand, just by the baker's; I was in a hurry, I did not stop; when I had got about six yards off, I heard a woman cry out murder; she said a man had murdered her brother. The place was quite clear when I came back.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to be in Ratcliffe Highway on the night this accident happened. - A. Yes, I was returning from Blackwall, a little after eight o'clock. In Ratcliffe Highway I saw a quarrel between a woman with a pelisse, or a long top coat on, done with fur, and a tippet; and two men, one a sailor in a jacket and trowsers, and the other a tallish thin man; I think the prisoners are the men; they were having high words about a guinea. The sailor in the jacket gave the woman a shove, and called her a b - r, and said he would have the guinea out of her; and after that the man catched hold of him by the collar, and several blows were given, and she struck him by the side of his head, and took hold of his hair; after several blows had taken place, by the woman and by the men, the sailor fell down and when the sailor got up he gave him one blow, and left him reeling; he ran away; the man reeled till he came by the side of the door; I called out to Mrs. Lawrence, that the man would go through the window; when the man fell, she gave the alarm that her brother was murdered.</p>

            . I keep a clothes shop, No. 1, Golden-lane, Barbican. On the 11th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop with a box coat on his arm, he asked me if I would buy a coat; I told him to let me look at it; I threw the coat on the counter, he asked thirty shillings for it; I asked him where he got it from, he said he got it from his brother over the water; I then said to the prisoner I suppose you will take eighteen shillings for it; he said no, I will take a guinea. I told him I had every reason to believe he had stolen it. I sent for an officer.</p>

Mr. Trimming, my opposite neighbour, informed me that there were some persons robbing an unoccupied house next door to me, that his wife on the succeeding night had seen three persons attempting to unlock the door, and that he suspected they would be there the following evening; he saw some of the persons had come up the steps. I looked at the door and saw a marble stone, I put it between the door; I went at eight o'clock, the same stone was there; I went out about nine, and gave the watchman charge, I saw the stone was down. I went to my opposite neighbour at the back of the house, I got him to look out of his window; I suppose his candle disturbed them. I heard the door unfasten, and this little man came very leisurely out of the door; I did not attempt to take hold of him on the step; he made a run across the street, I cried stop thief, he ran in a direction for Bury-street. Some person coming there he rebounded into the street again; he was laid hold of, I never lost sight of him; the whole was not above twenty-five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130027"/> yards.

            . I am a watchman of Marybone parish. On the 14th of April, when the serjeant of the night came to me in the division I belong to, he told me to beware of the thieves that night, they were out. I was ordered by the serjeant of the night to leave my lanthorn in the box; I went my rounds as regular as if I were to call the hours. At the hour of one o'clock I was talking to No. 49 watchman, that stands in New Cavendish-street; I left him and turned into Harley-street, Cavendish-square; I come down a good bit of Harley-street, and took Queen-Ann-street, West; hearing the noise of the people coming from Cavendish-street up Harley-street I stopped; I saw three men come across Queen-Ann-street, West; I kneeled down quite close to the railing, the night being dark; and took notice of three persons standing in the street; they stopped on the foot way on the same side with me; I saw them plainly, two of them turned into the door way, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130028"/> one stood with his back to the house on the pavement, the tall man stood on the pavement, he said to the other men, d - n your eyes, you will not have such success to night as you had last night; they had gained a great quantity of lead from the off side of the street the night before. I took of my shoes and went up on my knees and hands, close to the ground where they stood, as close as I could without their seeing of me; I turned into New Cavendish-street, out of Harley-street, and then I stood upright.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the men were in Harley-street were they. - A. I went to No. 49, watchman, and told him that the lead merchants were in <placeName id="t18070513-45-crimeloc276">Harley-street</placeName>

Accordingly Hobbs seeing us, he gave a double small cough, which was a signal to the two men; the two men threw themselves down off the railing at the time Hobbs coughed; they crossed Harley-street; and went on the darkest side; they went into Great Mary-bone-street; they all three walked very gently till they came to the end of Great Mary-bone-street, my fellow watchman darted after them; I catched hold of Hobbs, he ran a few yards before I laid a hand upon him; the two other darted up Great Mary-bone-street; No. 49, watchman followed them, and sprang his rattle; I secured Hobbs, he was getting very resolute to get out of my hands; I sprang my rattle for assistance, the serjeant of the night came to my assistance; and then he came quietly to the watchhouse. My partner took the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time of your seeing them till the time you took them, how long was it. - A. About five or six minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. You were put upon the alarm by the serjeant of the night. - A. Yes, he told us the thieves were out; my partner came to me in New Cavendish-street, and told me they were at work in Harley-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it. - A. Between one and two o'clock, it was very dark; in consequence of that, I went with him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take your lanthorn with you. - A. No, I went into Harley-street, and both of us stooped down; I saw one upon No. 19, he was lifting the lead off, and the other upon No. 21; the third man stood with his back towards the door of No. 20.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which man that was. - A. That was Hobbs, he was the tallest of the three; the other two were standing on the rails, taking the lead off the pediment of the door. One of the three men saw us, he made a cough, who it was I cannot tell. Upon this coughing, they immediately jumped off the railing, they crossed Harley-street, and went down towards Mary-bone-street; I and the other watchman walked after them; Henwright took hold of Hobbs; I saw him seize the tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is one of the three men that you saw together. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lose sight of them when they turned the corner. - A. We were as close to them as six or seven yards; we did not lose sight of them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Henwright seized Hobbs, what became of the other two. - A. The two started, I followed them both, and sprang my rattle; one took to the right and the other to the left; I followed to the left, down Welbeck-street, into Mary-bone-lane; there I seized Guppy; I brought him to the watchhouse; going along I saw Hobbs in custody of the other watchman, and the serjeant of the night.</p>


               <p>Hobbs (to witness). Did you see me stand on the pavement. - A. Yes, it is a fact.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw him in custody of Henwright, did you or did you not know him to be the man that stood on the pavement. - A. Certainly, he never went out of my sight till Henwright seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to swear that you followed Hobbs, Guppy, and the other man, till they turned into Mary-bone-street, and you hardly lost sight of them for a moment. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Henwright) Are you perfectly clear that the prisoner Hobbs, is the same man that you saw standing with his back to No. 20. - A. The very same man; I never lost sight of him from the time I saw him, till I laid my hand upon him; he was beginning to start when we came upon him.</p>

            . I am serjeant of the night. On the 14th of April, at eleven o'clock at night, I saw the man they call captain, that is Hobbs, in High-street, Mary-bone, I knew him very well; he was coming out of a public house. I went round my division, and acquainted them that the captain was out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body with him at that time. - A. No; the night before we lost upwards of fifty pounds worth of lead, out of Harley-street. I came to Henwright's assistance; when he sprang the rattle, he had hold of Hobbs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hobbs appear to make any resistance. - A. He did; and I told him that if he did make any resistance and was not peaceable, I would blow his brains out with the blunderbuss. Then Henwright took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose in your way you met M'Killock with the other man. - A. Yes; after we had secured the prisoners we went back to look at the houses, to see if there was any lead lost; I looked at No. 21 and 19, the lead was torn off, and ripped from the boarding of the pediment over the door, ready to take away; a few minutes more they would have took it completely away; both the places were in the same situation.</p>
               <p>Hobbs. I never was on the premises, I made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Hart. He did make resistance, he would have got away from Henwright if I had not come up. When we took him to the watchhouse, the constable of the night knew him; he asked him how long had he been out of prison, he said on Friday last.</p>

The watchman sat the dog upon me, and by the dog following of me I ran to make haste home to my lodgings; the man took hold of me in Mary-bone-lane, he said I want you, you must come to the watchhouse. The other watchman, when we came up to him, said I was along with this man; I said I was not, no more I was not.</p>

I went immediately to Bow-street for a warrant; on Monday they granted a search warrant, and the officer took up the prisoner as she was cleaning the windows on the first floor; I told the prisoner that several things had been taken from me, that I suspected her; the officer then searched her, and found two duplicates upon her; one was in her pocket, and one against her breast. She confessed the robbery, and said she had done it in order to purchase drink. I could not replace the things for twenty or thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not understand her to confess that she took any one article at one time worth forty shillings. - A. Oh, no. I then went with the officer, Anthony, to look at the articles pledged, and there I saw one of my shirts, it is marked in full length with permanent ink.</p>

Upon finding I had missed the seven shilling piece and the other money, I followed her and gave charge of her to the watchman; she then said she had got nothing. At the watchhouse the prisoner was searched; out of her bosom there fell a sixpence and four halfpence. One of the halfpence I can swear to.</p>

I searched the prisoner; I found in her bosom, when she was unloosing her clothes, a sixpence and four halfpence, they dropped from her; I asked her what they did there, and why she had not put it with the six shillings and sixpence that she had in her pocket; she said that she had them given her in change out of a quartern of gin that she had. I could not find the seven shilling piece upon her; I shewed the prosecutor the money. He said he only knew this one halfpenny.</p>

He said he wanted to go with me, and because I would not let him, then he charged me with a robbery.</p>

             Q. The last witness lived servant with you. - A. Yes. On the night of the 6th of April I found the servant had lost a great many articles of wearing apparel; on the next morning I endeavoured to find the prisoner. From the situation of the chamber I was certain that none but those who knew the house could have gone into the room and taken the things away.</p>

The things were missing on the Monday evening; it was Thursday before I found her and then I took her before Mr. Alderman Hankey; I found nothing on her person nor in her lodgings; the officers and I searched her box and found nothing. I told her I would forgive her if she would let the girl have her things.</p>
               <p>Q. That is very wrong, now, I cannot hear any more what she said. - A. I applied to the person that she had lived with, and through the means of that person she was taken into custody at the next door to Worship-street office. where she had gone to live servant. This was a week or ten days afterwards; the officers searched her box, and found the things laid in the indictment in my presence.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I went to the public house next door to Worship-street office, with Winder and Prince, on Tuesday the 14th of April; the prisoner was a servant there, she had been there about three days. I searched her box; she gave me the key and went up stairs with me. I found these things.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix). On the night you lost your things did you see the prisoner at the house. - A. No. I went to bed between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course your house is open all day. - A. Yes, till ten o'clock. I went out a little after ten; one of the lodgers very imprudently left the door open then.</p>

               <p>Q. That is a three-quarter bore that remains in the house. - A. Yes. To the best of my knowledge the prisoner brought the lead to me between four and five in the afternoon.</p>

I informed the shopman; he came out, and we pursued the woman. When we came up to the prisoner, she was near an hundred yards off; upon our speaking to her she dropped the two pieces of cotton, she had them in her apron; I picked them up and gave them to Mr. Pinches.

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. On the 16th of March I was sent for to Mr. Windsor's, a pawnbroker in Whitechapel; they said they had stopped a woman for offering to pledge a metal watch for a gold watch; they suspected she had stole it; they delivered the watch and the prisoner to me. I asked the prisoner whose watch it was, she said it was her husband's, she was going to pledge it, to make money to pay a quarter's rent; she said her husband worked for Mr. Liptrap, I found he had worked there five years ago; she then said her husband lived over the water, and worked at a brewhouse there. She was sent to prison, and was brought up for examination; and in consequence of what the husband had said, she said then that her father gave it her before he died; she had had it for twenty years; she once pledged it in Oxford-street, that her husband knew nothing of it. She was discharged because no owner could be found. I kept the watch. When the prosecutor called on the 12th of April, I shewed the father the watch, he claimed the watch as his son's watch; the son saw it on the next day before the magistrate, and claimed it. I went over the water the same day, and took her in custody.</p>

I gave it him, he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket a little while; he then said I must give him change. He offered me another seven shilling piece, it was bent, but paler than the other; that I weighed, and found to be a very bad one. My husband sent for an officer.</p>
