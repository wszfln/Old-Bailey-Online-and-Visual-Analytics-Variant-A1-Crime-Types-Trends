I live at 22, Havelock Road, Hammer<lb/>smith, and am a builder's foreman—about February, 1893, the prisoner said to me something to the effect that, in turning over the contents of an old box of his aunt's, he had found a bank-book belonging to his late wife—I went with him to Somerset House—I there saw him sign a document similar to this; I believe these others are in his writing—I signed one; this is my signature.</p>

               <p>of a complaint made by Miss Holder as to the loss of her book, I saw the prisoner at West Place, Chapel Street, Islington—I showed him the notice of withdrawal and the warrant for £118, and asked him if these were his signatures, "W. T. Moorlen"—he said, "Yes; but this is not what Miss Holder is inquiring about; this is all right; it is her own book that has been lost"—I said, "What does this refer to?"—he said, "Money from my aunt's account, which I am entitled to get out; I got letters of administration"—on January 21st, 1897, I saw the prisoner again at 8, Rising Hill Street, his present address—I cautioned him, and told him had come with reference to a complaint by Miss Holder that her sister's book had been stolen from her box, and I showed him again the notice of withdrawal and the warrant, and asked him if he cared to say how the book, which I showed him also, came into his possession, as Miss Holder said it was stolen from her—he said the money was his wife's money; that the account had been opened by his first wife, Mary Ann; that the account had been opened with money he had given to her for the purpose of opening the account; that he had lost sight of, or overlooked, the book for the twenty odd years his wife had been dead, but, in turning over her things in 1893, he found the book, and went and obtained letters of administration—I said the story differed from what he told me in May about it, when he said the money belonged to his aunt, and that Miss Holder said the book had been stolen from her box—he said then Mrs. Moorlen, his second wife, had taken the book as well as the other book, which we were referring to in the other case, and that he was pressed for money, and was tempted to do it, and he said he wished ns to be lenient with him, and asked us to report the matter to the Secre<lb/>tary of the Post Office—I said I should have to report to the Secretary, and he said he hoped we would be lenient with him—I said if he wished to write anything; of that kind he could, and I might be instructed to place it before a Magistrate—he then wrote this letter, "J ": "Dear Sir,—As I was in want of money, I did use aunt's book, and now I must leave it to you to be as lenient as you can to me. Mrs. Moorlen took the book out of Miss Holder's box when she came to live at 63, White Lion Street, and I was tempted to do it"—he wrote that in my presence—I called in James Walker, who was outside, and said to Moorlen, "Do you wish this to be sent to the Secretary of the Post Office?"—he said he did—I said, "You know it will be produced before the Magistrate"—he said, "Yes"—Walker endorsed it on the back as it is here—on the say to the station the prisoner said that as he had had the money he must put up with it, he must suffer—he said he wished me to tell the Magistrate that his sister, Mrs. Anscombe, he thought, would be able to come forward and prove the money was his aunt's money, and that she had expressed the wish that he should have the money when she died—I have seen Mrs. Anscombe; she has not come here.</p>

"; he said, "This won't do," and seized me by the person—it caused a feeling of extreme pain and sickness—I was wearing a turquoise and diamond pin, a gun-metal watch, a gold chain, and I had a sovereign and a few shillings in my pocket—in order to get the shilling I gave him I had to undo my overcoat, which was lined throughout with astrachan, including the sleeves, and had astrachan cuffs and collar—while the man had me in that position he took my pin, my watch and chain, the sovereign and silver (all the money on me), from the trousers pocket from which I had taken the shilling and then he dragged the coat from my back—it is rather large for me, and slips off rather easily; the lining lends to its slipping off easily—the pain and sickness continued while these things were being taken—he held me by the left hand, and used his right for the purpose of robbing me—having got my property, he took to his heels—as soon as I recovered myself, I cried "Stop thief!" and ran after him—the assault and robbery took a very short time; it was very sudden—could not overtake him, and he got away—I went home—within half an</p>

Shepherd and I went and fetched Greenwood. Greenwood arranged to buy it of Shepherd. He went and fetched a barrow. I put the lead in it, and Shepherd wheeled it round to Greenwood's house.

About 9.30 p.m. I was called to No. 3, Clare Court—I went upstairs, and saw the prisoner with Curley and Mrs. Leach—Curley was cut about the head and face, and covered with blood—I heard the conversation about taking liberties with the woman—I took Curley to King's College Hospital, where he was attended by the house surgeon, and the wounds stitched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Central London Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street, West, where patients are received from the workhouse, the deceased was sent there from the hospital on February 15th—I examined him, and found wounds on the head—he was dazed, and during the time I examined him he had a fit—the wounds had been stitched up—he had been in the Bell Yard Infirmary two nights—the fits continued to occur for three days—they were convulsive—they were symptoms of injury to the brain—the fits ceased, and he continued to im<lb/>prove till the 27th, when symptoms of pressure on the brain showed them<lb/>selves, and he died at 1.10 the following morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—ontheboneof the skull was a linear indentation on the posterior part of the top, running to about half an inch—on opening the head and the outer membrane that cover the brain, I found beneath it about a small teacupful of blood pressing upon the brain, partly clotted and partly fluid, and firmly adherent to the outer membrane—the firm adhesion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189703080027"/>
               <p>points to the fact that hemorrhage had taken place some days before death, and the fluid possibly later hemorrhage—the cause of death was pressure of blood on the brain—in my opinion the effusion of blood was caused by injuries received—I have heard the evidence—the injuries described might cause it—they might have caused the indentation, which I should say occurred at the time the wound was inflicted on the back of the head—there was no abscess on the brain—the fits were caused by the effusion of blood on the brain, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fits did not recur—the asylum is a general hospital, and not a lunatic asylum—it is a public institution, supported by the rates—the wounds on the top of the head and on the face had been stitched—there was no obvious injury to the brain—the membrane of the brain was not injured—the blood clot was caused by blood escaping from blood vessels—I discovered no broken blood vessels—the skull not being injured, the force would be transmitted inwards—if the skull had been broken the sharp edges might have cut the blood vessels—the skull not being broken, the injury might be found on the opposite side of the brain—in my opinion, the force was transmitted from the curved hard surface to the softer surface below—the deceased said he was thirty-three years of age, and he looked about that—a drunken man might fall with sufficient heaviness to cause the condition of the skull I found—I could not account for the injuries apart from some violence—there was no suggestion of apoplectic condition in this patient—I said at the Police-court that "the clot of blood was due to some violence, but I will distinctly say that it was due to the violence which caused the indentation," I made an addition to that—I have not examined the earthenware—the blood on the bottom of the chamber might have come from contact with the floor—there is just a faint trace of blood there.</p>

In February, 1894, my father was instructed by the London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Company to investigate a claim with respect of a fire alleged to have taken place at 509, Barking Road, Plaistow. I attended at those premises to investigate the claim. This is the claim (J) sent me by the office, filled up as it now appears. I saw a man and a woman there, but at this distance of time I cannot recognise the prisoners. I had a conversation with the persons I saw, and examined the cupboard in the first floor room, where the fire was alleged to have taken place. There was the appearance of a fire having taken place there. After my conversation, I agreed to settle the claim, and pay £17 in settlement, and the male person I saw there signed this paper (K). The statement made to me by one or other of them (both being present) was that they were both going out, and previous to doing so the man went to the cupboard with a lighted pipe in his mouth, and he presumed a spark from it must have fallen un<lb/>observed on to some clothing.—<hi rend="smallCaps">CLAUDE HARRISON</hi>."</p>

I am an auctioneer and furniture ware-houseman, at 59, 61 and 63, High Street, Stoke Newington—I have been in business there for eleven years—in 1894 I took the prisoner into my service as an outside salesman—on May 10th, 1895 (when he was still in my service), a fire occurred on my premises—Wilson and Coles were in my service then—from what we subsequently learnt, we thought the fire was caused through Wilson smoking a pipe in the basement; Fitch said Wilson had smoked there—I made a claim on the insurance company, and was paid about £430—within a month after the fire I discharged the prisoner for drunkenness—when I gave him notice he came up to my office desk—I said, "You get out; I will not have any more to do with you; I am tired of you"—he said, "I will make you suffer for this," and he struck the desk with his fist, and split it—he said he would burn the b——show—I then got ex-Policeman Jones to mind the place at night—the prisoner would not go, and stopped on at the place for about three weeks—he occupied a suite of rooms on the upper floor—soon after he had left the premises Mr. Hudson, a trade customer, called on me—the prisoner, after he left, frequently annoyed us; he came and stood in front of the premises, and flourished his umbrella in front of the shop, and he would come into my office if I was not in—I have come in and found him there, and have had to send for the police to remove him—I had to send half a dozen times in the first three weeks—he met me in the street once, and said, "Good evening"—I said, "Good evening, what do you want?"—he said, "Money"—I said, "You will get no money from me," and went on about my business—directly after the prisoner had made this statement to the police, the police came to me to make inquiries—I attended at the Police-court when he was brought up on the charge—I instructed my solicitor to take proceedings against him for this libel, as reports had got about about me—there was not a word of truth in his statement that I had conspired with anybody to set fire to my premises; it is a deliberate lie, and a malicious invention.</p>

On February 5th, about one p.m., I went with Seymour to 11, Vine Street, Waterloo Road, where, in a back room on the ground floor, I saw Schmidt—I told him we were police officers, and that I should take him into custody for being concerned with a man not in custody in stealing a quantity of wearing apparel—he said, "I received a note from that man Merle yesterday, and from its contents I went to No. 59, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square. I remained there until about eight o'clock, when the man Merle came in a cab with a quantity of luggage and two bicycles. I assisted him with the luggage into the house; he afterwards gave me one of the bicycles, which I took home. I then returned to Charlotte Street, and had a drink with him, and made arrangements to meet him the following day at three o'clock"—I looked round the room, and saw a bicycle standing there—when he saw I was looking at it, he said, "That is the bicycle which the man gave me"—that was the bicycle which was afterwards shown to Heron at the Police-station—I searched the room, and found this gold pin, brooch and cap—he was wearing this overcoat at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 58, Jermyn Street—at the end of January and the beginning of February I was out of employment—I had been a gentleman's servant—I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>: "To Attendants, Assistants, Army Men, Grooms, Messengers, etc., requiring situations, all parts. Call or write to Messrs. Hall and Co., 303, Strand; oldest, genuine reliable." I called there, and received a form similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read it, and believed what I read—I filled it up, and returned it to Hall and Co. with a postal order for 5s.—I then received a postcard, and called at 303, Strand, about the middle of February, and saw the prisoner there—he said, "I sent out two postcards, and the other one took the situation"—about a fortnight afterwards I called to tell him I had changed my address—he entered it in thib book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he was Mr. Hall—I left, and this receipt for the 5s. was sent to me by post: "Received of Joseph Bodger 5s. for registering situation. Hall and Co. We wish it to be understood that we do not and cannot absolutely guarantee situations"—I never got anything done for me in the way of a situation.</p>

               <p>send a letter, and let me know—he did not seem very pleased to see me—I received no further communication from him—about the middle of September I called at the office, and saw the prisoner; I asked him, if I registered my name again, would be get me a situation, because I wanted day work; he said he could get me a good situation in a few days—I said that he had not done much for me last time—he said he would do his beat for me this time, and I was to pay a 2s. 6d. fee; I paid it, and got a receipt, which I destroyed—I had read on the first receipt that the fee for re-entering was 1s. 6d.; I said nothing about that—I called again about a week after, and saw the defendant; he said he had nothing to suit me, but I could keep looking up—I called a great many times for about three weeks—after Baying a 2s. fee I had a letter from him, and went and saw him; he said he had come to a new arrangement, to put the names in the paper, and asked if I should like mine in—I said, "You can please your<lb/>self," and he put it in and paid for it; it is one line for 9d.—I saw Sergeant Fuller between my paying the 2s. 6d. and the conversation about the advertisement—I have been in the Royal Artillery—he ad<lb/>vertised for me three times, and I got one letter, but it led to no situa<lb/>tion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sergeant Fuller called where I lived after I had had the first receipt; I have seen him several times since—I asked the defendant about getting me a situation as carman, horsekeeper, or porter—he said, "Oh, yes, I think I can suit you in a few days"—I read the receipt; it was printed, and this statement was underlined; I did not make the slightest complaint—I got myself a situation in about a fort-night, but did not take the trouble to write and say so, that my name might be marked off the books, but I went again later on to try to better myself—he said that he thought he could get me a situation, and he was sorry he could not get me one before—I did not get one—I went to a place where a man like me was wanted, as horsekeeper, but another man got there before me—I afterwards got a summons to go as a witness.</p>

I obtained a warrant for the prisoner's arrest, which was granted on the statements of five deponents—I on January 5th I went to Arrest him at 303, Strand—"Hall and Co." was over the office—I asked for Hall; the defendant said, "I am Mr. Hall"; I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest for obtaining 5s. from Frederick Waite, and similar sums from other men; I shall require your books"—he pointed to two books—I read the warrant to him—I afterwards returned and took three books from the office, a letter book, an employers' book con<lb/>taining the addresses of asylums and public institutions, a postage book, and two counterfoil receipt books, and a number of letters—I find in the register, Joseph Bridger registered on February 1st, 1896, as a porter in chambers or a private house, and at that time sixty<lb/>four people had been registered between January 1st and February 1st, four of whom had been suited on February 1st, leaving sixty unsuited that month—when a person is suited the entry in the register is crossed out with red lines, and the word "Suited" is written against it, but in one or two instances it is in black—I find in the register fifteen porters and nine caretakers unsuited between January I stand February 1st—I made this analysis (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dividing them into the different occupations.

               <p>Hudson pulled out a revolver from his right-hand coat pocket, and pointed it at my face—I put my arms up, and he fired—I was about two steps away from him when he fired—I am sure that he fired; I was so confused, I fell up against the wall—I saw the pistol as he put it up—I did not know that there was a bullet, but a lady saw it—the men walked away sharp—Mitchell put a police whistle in my hand—I blew it, and the three of us gave chase—the men separated, and ran in different directions—I lost Goodman, and I chased Hudson through a number of turnings—he stopped and pointed the revolver at me again, which prevented me from getting too close—a man said, "He is gone that way." but he had not—I went back; and I went to the Police-station in Corn<lb/>wall Street, and there found Goodman in custody of Poynter—he was brought before the Magistrate the same day, and remanded for a week.</p>

I am a general servant of Lord Tremletown—I went to bed on February 5th, between nine and 9.30 p.m.—before that I saw that the doors were all securely fastened, including the scullery door—the front door was locked—at two a.m. I was awakened by someone mov<lb/>ing about in uiy room I looked, and saw the rigure of a man with a light in his hand—I said, "Is that you?"—I thought it was my mistress—he blew the light out—I shouted at him—he rushed out of the room—I rushed after him—I went and told my master—he came downstairs with me—we went into the dining-room first—I found the silver, which I had left covered the night before, uncovered and disarranged; the cabinet drawers were taken out and left out, and things were disarranged—in the kitchen the dresser drawers were pulled out, and master's coat was folded up on a chair—the night before it had been upstairs, hanging up—the keys were taken out of the kitchen, scullery, and back door, and put on the corner of the dresser—this is my purse—it was on a chest of drawers—I did not miss it till after I had been at the Police-court—there was nothing in it—this is my ring—I left it on the dresser in the kitchen—the front door was locked, as it had been the night before—the man must have got out through the back window.</p>
