But he not being at Home, I brought him back, in order to have him before some other Magistrate; as we were going along he desired me not to haul him, he would walk very civilly he said, and would-not run away, but the Minute I had loosen'd my Hold, he ran away from me, and Dodson ran after him: The Deceased seeing Carter run, pursued him, and had taken him if Dodson had not with a Jostle thrown him down. I went after Carter, but being informed that both the Prisoners lived with Mr. Leeson a Baker, I returned Home, and at the Door I met an Apothecary, who desired me to send for a Surgeon immediately, for my Servant was Speechless and his Skull broke. He lived till Monday, and never had his Senses all that Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dodson throw the Deceased down?</p>
               <p>How. When Carter took to his Heels, I cry'd out, Stop him, - and the Deceased ran after him; as he passed Dodson he gave him a Hunch, which turned him quite round, and I saw him falling, but did not see him come to the Ground. I saw him (Dodson) put out his Foot and trip up his Heels; 'twas done in a Trice.</p>

               <p>Cross. About a Quarter of a Year afterwards I saw him in Barnaby-street, and as I was speaking to him, and was going to discover my Mind to him, he ran away, and I never saw him since, 'till I saw him in Newgate</p>

The Night this Murder was committed, I was upon the Watch with him, and as I was giving the Hour of Twelve, I heard some body coming along, so I turn'd my self about, and cry'd, - who comes there? The Prisoner, - (I am almost sure, is the same Person) he had a Cask upon his Back, and a Woman was with him. I asked him, what he had got there? Damn thee (says he) what's that to thee? He pass'd over to the other Side of the Way, and I call'd out to the Deceased; he asked me what was the Matter; no Harm, says I, in the Name of God. When he came up to me, no Words in Anger pass'd, for I told the Prisoner, tho' he damn'd me, I would not damn him: But when the Deceased came to my Assistance, the Woman fell back from the Prisoner, and I went after her about 6 or 7 Paces; while I was pursuing her, my Partner cry'd out, - O Lord, Watch! Watch! the Rogue has stabb'd me! I caught hold of the Woman, and told her I would secure her till we found the Prisoner; and as I was carrying her to the Watch-house, I heard some body tripping after me, and turning round to see who follow'd me, the Prisoner stabb'd me in the Arm - I wish I was as sure of the Kingdom of Heaven, as I am that the Prisoner is the Man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any Blow given by the Deceased?</p>

Next Morning, about Eight, I went into their Room, and asked them what Time they came home; they told me, between 3 and 4. I look'd upon him, and saw a Cut cross his Nose: I asked him how it came; he said, he was set upon by two Watchmen, and they were so resticall, that he was obliged to draw his Bayonet, and play away with it.</p>

Well, - that is not all that I do know, he did say and make Answer, that this Woman did know nothing of him, and he was not afraid. Well, - this Woman she did go to Newgate, and she did say to him, with a Proviso he would produce Money, she would do for him; and he did say and make Answer, his Substance was gone, and a Bed to lye upon in Newgate, would signify nothing to him.

That they got in and lay conceal'd '' in the said House till Morning; then '' they went up Stairs and open'd a Beaufet, and '' stole from thence 2 Pair of Silver Buckles; '' and in the Library, out of another Beaufet, '' they stole 2 Guineas. That afterwards they '' went down into the Kitchen, to take the '' Cloaths of Hannah Emberton, a Servant in the '' said House: But hearing her come in about '' 7 o'Clock, this Examinant hid himself, and '' afterwards knocked the said Hannah down with '' an Iron Poker; then he took a Penknife, (which '' he owns to be the same) and endeavoured to '' cut her Throat, and gave her several Wounds; '' that he attempted to make his Escape up the '' Chimney; but before this, he took out of her '' Pocket Three-pence Half-penny.</p>
               <p>Hannah Emberton appeared, in a very weak Condition, and gave the following Evidence.</p>
               <p>I have known the Prisoner these five Years; he was the Dutchess of Manchester's Black. When I went in that Morning, and saw a Door broke, I was frighted; but seeing the Study Door bolted, I thought to my self, Thank God they have got no further; and came out of the Room with a little more Courage; tho' I was no got into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173702160007"/> Hall, but he attack'd me. I begg'd he would lock me up in a Room and spare my Life, he commanded me to deliver up the Keys, and I gave them to him, but I desired him when he had done with them to throw them somewhere where they might be found again; Oh! says he, I must take Care of you and the Keys too: I begged him not to kill me, but shut me up in a Room; he told me, He must kill me, and it would be quickly over; we struggled together till I got to the Top of the Kitchen Stairs, and there he got me down and stabbed me, and cut my Hands sadly as I endeavoured to save myself. He cut me in the Throat in such a Manner, that the Surgeon said there was not a Hair's Breadth between me and Death. He stabbed me before he knocked me down, and when he had knocked me down, he stood over me and whetted his Knife; I begg'd of him not to use it any more, and begg'd God not to give him Leave; he finding I was not dead, gave me five Blows with a Scrubbing-Brush, and after this perceiving there were some Life in me, he gave me as many more with the Brush; then I lay for dead, and he took my Pockets off, and a Silk Handkerchief from about my Neck; then he turned me over, and finding no Life in me he broke open the Cellar Door, I made shift to lift up my Hand and undo the Parlour Door, but I was so weak that my Head fell down, - thus.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Morning was it when he first attacked you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Emberton. To the best of my Knowledge it was about eight or nine that he began with me, but he was butchering about me two Hours. When I had got in the Parlour, I broke one of the Squares in the Sash, and held out my bloody Hand and my bloody Hair. When I saw the People gathered about the Window, I broke down the Blind, and got out at the Window, and there I sat; he certainly thought I was dead. I had only a Silver Thimble and some Half-pence in my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Body in the House but the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Emberton. No, nobody besides himself.</p>

            . Last Thursday was a Fortnight, I was going to Mr. Jennings, who lives next Door to the Marquis of Lindsey, and just as I was going to knock at the Door, I heard the Sash break; I looked to see what was the Matter, and saw the Gentlewoman's Bloody Hand, and she cry'd, Murder! By that Time I was got up to the House, she had opened the Sash and was going to tumble herself out of the Window; I prevented her, and by the Help of some Chair-Men and their Poles, I got in at the Window and opened the Door. I could perceive where she had been abused upon the Ground, and at a little Distance from the Place, there lay an Iron Poker broke in Half, and the Penknife. We searched the House for the Prisoner, and we could not find him; but in about an Hour and a half afterwards we found him in one of the Chimnies; we flung Brickbats in at the Tops, and they did not fall through one of them, so we searched that Chimney, but he got out of that into another, and at last we smoaked him down with Straw; then we searched him, and took the Buckles, the Thimble, and some Half-pence from him; I think it was Three-pence Half-penny. My Lord Carpenter was sent for to examine him, but I did not stay to hear the Examination.</p>

            , Midwife. The Parish Officer sent for me to examine the Prisoner; I found she had been delivered of a Child; when I enquired what she had done with it, she would make no direct Answer, but sat up in her Bed crying, with a Book in her Hand. I could get nothing out of her, but only, that what this Eliz. Bell had done, was by her Orders. I ask'd her what Bell had done; She would not tell me, but only desired I would be favourable, and Bell being gone away, I could not perswade her to tell me where she might be found. At last we found this Bell, and upon her Examination, she said she had put nothing down the Vault but the After-birth; for says she, the Child she threw down there herself. I went to the Prisoner again, and told her that Bell had inform'd us, that she (the Prisoner) had put the Child into the Vault: She own'd she did so, and beg'd I would be favourable in my Information, telling me, it was dead when she put it down. Well, says I, I hope you have not havock'd it; no, she said, she had not. Then the Vault was raked, and nothing found, but the After-burthen: Still she insisted upon it, that her Child was there; upon which it was quite empty'd, but no Child was found. I knew there must have been one born, so I search'd again, with the Beadle and other Women, and I took her out of Bed in a Blanket, and search'd the Bed, behind the Bed I found some Rags stain'd, &amp;c. &amp;c. - at the Feet of the Bed, I found a Box with more Rags in the same Condition: I shook them all out, but found no Child: In another Box I saw something that put me upon enquiring, what she had been doing in it: She told me, she had only put some Cloaths in it. At last we search'd the Closet, and in a Nook which ran into the Chimney, behind a small Trunk, we found it, sew'd up in a Cloth; when I pull'd it out of the Hole, the Prisoner swoon'd away. When she recover'd, I asked her several Questions, - how she could cut her Child's Throat so barbarously, and how she could in her present Condition have Strength to sew it up? She said the Devil had given her Strength, and not God. The Lord have Mercy upon you, says I, and so I left her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Child's Throat cut very much?</p>
               <p>Palmer It could not be cut worse, unless it's Head had been cut quite off.</p>
               <p>A Witness. This Bell was the Prisoner's Land-lady, and seeing her come down with a Mop and a Pail from the Prisoner's Room, I asked her what was the Matter; she told me that Mary, (the Prisoner) was not well. I went up, and knock'd at her Door, and she told me, the Key was under the Door; I open'd it and went in, and I ask'd her what she ail'd: I saw Spots of Blood upon the Floor, and I enquir'd how they came there; she said, she was as Women are, when they are disorder'd, but, says she, my Landlady Bell is coming to wipe them up In the Closet I saw a Pan full of Cloths, not very fit to be seen; - what's all this Mary, says I? God bless you, says she, don't say any Thing, I have miscarry'd and was three Months gone. I told her I was sorry for that, but however, I made her some hot Watergruel, and carry'd it to her in Bed, and left her to eat it. When I was got down Stairs, I endeavoured to settle my self to my Work, but I was very uneasy in my Mind, and (to make short of my Story) I could not rest 'till I had made some farther Enquiry. I ask'd her where she had put the Miscarriage, she told me that Bell had put it down the Vault. The Vault was search'd, but it was not there. It was found at last in a Nook, that went into the Chimney: I was present when 'twas pull'd out, and according to my Judgement 'twas at it's full Growth.</p>
               <p>Midwife. 'Twas at it's full Growth; it had Hair and Nails perfect, and was a larger Child than is common.</p>

I got her some hot Ale, and then I went to Bed.</p>

The Prisoner stood in the Shop, and see me take 2 s. 5 d. in Change of a Half-Crown. There was two Fellows in Company with him, but I did not observe them to come near me: The Prisoner follow'd me out of the Shop, with a Trowel in his Hand, and he knock'd me down, and then struck me with his Trowel; one of my Fingers was so chopp'd, that I was obliged to go into the Hospital, and have it cut off. When he had me down, he took away the 2 s. 5 d. I am positive the Prisoner is the Man, for I observ'd him in the Shop, with his Trowel, and there was a Lamp just by the Place where he attack'd me.</p>

               <p>Holderness. Mr. Harris was directed there, and one of the Men made himself an Evidence against the rest. The Prisoner struggled when we took him, and fought, and would not go along, but after a few Blows were exchang'd, we got him to the Justice's, and the other Man informing against the Prisoner for House-breaking, he was committed to Newgate. When we had got him to Jail, he desired me to call upon him, after I had lodged the Evidence in New Prison: I did so, and he begg'd I would desire Justice Farmer to permit him to be an Evidence, for says he, I can hang five Men, and can knock down the other Evidence, because he has not put all the Robberies in his Information, that I was concern'd in: I committed a Robbery says he, between Rag-Fair and the Tripe-house, and he has mentioned nothing of that.</p>

I had two Purses in my Pocket, one of them was given me the Day before, and I had a Value for it, they took that from me, but as they were going off, I called to one of them (whom I am informed was Bob the Glazier) to return it me again; he stopped to give it me; upon this his Companion, whom I take to be the Prisoner, cry'd; Damn him, - stab him, then they both run away. I pursued them a little Way, but finding it dark and dirty I gave over, flattering myself that my Watch was safe, but it was gone. I can't swear to the Prisoner's Face, but from the Size of the Man and his outward Appearance, I verily believe him to be the same. I never had any of my Goods again.</p>

I live in James-street, Covent-Garden, at an Alehouse; I remember that the Prisoner and Bob the Glazier, was at the House that Night, and had no Money, but they went out and returned again about eleven o'Clock, and called for two Pots of Beer and Ale; I drank with them, and they asked me to pawn the Watch; I told them I did not know where to pawn it, so he and Bob the Glazier pawn'd it at one Bob Fields at Cow-Cross, and afterwards the two Prisoners redeemed it, and they both went over to Holland to dispose of it. Last Sunday I met the Prisoner Goodman in Short's-Garden, and he asked me to drink, telling me he could have lived like a Man in Holland, if he had not carried the Woman-Prisoner with him. He said he got fourteen Guineas for the Watch in Holland, and by his own Description of the Gentleman he took it from, I knew the Prosecutor to be the Person that was robbed, as soon as I saw him.</p>

             I was born in Ireland, and have been about 3 Years in England. In January last, I came in Company with the Prisoner Dwyer, being introduced to him by some of his Partners.</p>

            . I met them first at the Rising Sun in Duke Street, by Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. I went there to enquire for one Serjeant Archdeacon, by William Clark's Direction, but he was gone the Night before, with fifteen Recruits for France. Clark met me there, and he told me that I should have come the Night before, and that I had lost my Passage this Time: But if I design'd to go, I must come by and by; for there would be a Gentlemen there again, who would tell me what I must do.</p>
               <p>Councel. What pass'd when you came in Company with Dwyer first?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Clark's Brother said, there was a Man would direct me what to do; so I ask'd Dwyer where Archdeacon was, he told me, he went away last Night, and that I should have come then. I told him my Cloaths were in Pawn; that I was in Debt, and could not come without my Things I told him I had an Uncle in France, who was a Priest, and if I went over, he would redeem me, says he, there is no Occasion of Redemption, for if you have a Friend there, you may have your Liberty. As for your Cloaths, says he, there's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173702160012"/> no such Thing as having them redeem'd by me, for I was once very ill us'd about some Cloaths that I got out of Pawn for a Man, and was forced to make my Escape thro' a Coffee-House Then we talked of the Pay, and I was to have (he said) Seven Pence Half-penny a Day.</p>
               <p>Councel. Whose Service was you to go into, - the King of France's?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I was to go to Dunkirk, and was to have Seven Pence Half penny a Day. After this Mr. Macmillan came in, and he sat himself down to hear what pass'd. Dwyer told me, I was too low for the Service, and that when there was no War, they took no Men under his (Dwyer's) Size; but Macmillan said, I wore a low Shoe, when he wears other Shoes he'll do very well.</p>
               <p>Councel. So if you wore high heel'd Shoes, they were to make a Man of you. Did you see the Prisoner Macgrass at that Time?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Not at that Time; but afterward I did. They agreed to send my Cloaths after me, and Mr Brettle said, I should get a Note from them to that Purpose. They were pawned in my Name, but before I went abroad, they were to be left in Clark's Name; he was labouring to delude more People into the Service of France.</p>
               <p>Councel Was any Thing sign'd between you?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Not at that Time. We had several Meetings together after this; and to one of them the Prisoner Dwyer brought his Captain; they call'd him Captain Linderkin, this was at the Crown in Short's Gardens, and Will. Clark and the Prisoner Macgrass were present.</p>
               <p>Councel. I ask you if there was any Agreement drawn in Writing at that Time?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes; there was a Note wrote by Dwyer, and Clark, and Macgrass sign'd it. This is the Note sure enough, and Bryan, Macgrass, and William Clark signed it, at the present (same) Time. I saw Dwyer write it, and I desired Macgrass to sign it; he said he suppos'd 'twas no Harm, and so he did sign it. - I am sorry he was concern'd in it, because I believe he was innocent, - only he knew on what Account my Cloaths were to be redeem'd, the Day before the Note was made.</p>
               <p>Councel. Then how can you say you believe him innocent?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Because he never propos'd any Thing at all to me about the Affair.</p>
               <p>Coun. Pris. This Note is said to be a Promissory Note, and 'tis in the Singular Number, - my Objection is, that two Men have sign'd it.</p>
               <p>The Note was read,</p>
               <p>A Suit of Cloaths, a pair of Silver Buckles, the Goods of Richard Murphey, now at the Pawnbrokers, and alter'd into William Clark's Name, to be deliver'd free of all Charges, on the Agreement between him and

            .</p>
               <p>Councel. So they would not venture to mention what that Agreement was. Did you go to the Pawnbrokers to alter the Name, in which the Cloaths were pawn'd?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes, Dwyer and Macgrass, and Will. Clark went with me, and the Name was changed: Clark wrote his Name upon a bit of Card, and the Pawnbroker put it upon my Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Councel. What was the Agreement mention'd in that Paper?</p>
               <p>Murphey. To procure a Man or two for him.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was Macgrass present at any Time when Dwyer and you talk'd about your being enlisted?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes, the Day before he was taken, and then Dwyer told Macgrass, that this young Man (meaning me) had a Design to go abroad; but, said he, Times are hard upon him, - his Cloaths are in Pawn, and he will have Security they shall be sent him; and he desired me to pronounce the Agreement, made between him and me. Macgrass was his Friend (at present) and he bid me tell him the Agreement we were upon; so I told Macgrass what I had propos'd about my Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Councel. What was you to do in France?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I was to procure a Man or two, or to pay for my Cloaths, when they came to me.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was there any mention made of what you were to do?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I was to pass Muster for a Friend, in Buckley's Regiment.</p>
               <p>Councel. You talk'd of Seven-pence Half-penny a Day; what was you to have that Pay for?</p>
               <p>Murphey. To serve like another Man.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was you to serve as a Soldier, or was you not?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I did not go so tight upon them, - they told me I was to have Seven-pence Half-penny a Day.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was not you to do a private Soldier's Duty?</p>
               <p>Murphey. They told me I might pay for a Soldier when I came there, and might work at my Trade every Day.</p>
               <p>Councel. So he told you, if you could get any Body to muster for you, you might follow your own Business?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes, Sir, when he wrote the Note about the Cloaths, he told every Thing I was to do; and I told him, - I don't expect to be serv'd but like a common Soldier: Friends we met (says I) and Friends we'll part. He told me he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173702160013"/> good Friends abroad, and when I was got to France, he would give me two Holland Shirts.</p>
               <p>Councel I would ask you this Question, - Was you to go there to be hired as a Soldier, with encouragement, that when you came there, you might get some body to appear for you in the Regiment as a Soldier, or was you to go over and appear for some body else?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I was to appear for my self; but they said I might follow my Business</p>
               <p>Councel. Pray mind the Question. Was you to go over and appear for any body else, or was you to go as a Soldier your self? and if you had any Occasion to be absent, you might have some body to Muster for you.</p>
               <p>Murphey. I might have any body to appear in a Muster for me. Dwyer said, he would not enlist me; but I said, I desir'd to be serv'd as other Men, or else I would part with him: So he told me, I might pass Muster, and follow my Trade too.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did Macgrass hear all this?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I believe not. Macgrass desired me to propose what I was upon; so I told him all.</p>
               <p>Councel. What did you tell him?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I told him I would procure a Man or two, and so get my Cloaths clear; and I shew'd them one Man, and I told them, I would get another when I got to France: For it I could not get one or two Men to enlist in the Regiment, I was to pay for my Cloaths and my Passage when I got to France.</p>
               <p>Councel. And was it not mention'd to you, that if you could not get a Man or two, you was to stay there yourself?</p>
               <p>Murphey. That was not mention'd.</p>
               <p>Councel. Why what was you to have 7 Pence Half-penny a Day for?</p>
               <p>Murphey. They told me I might follow my Trade, and get a Man to pass Muster for me in Case of Necessity. Macgrass was not present when Dwyer and I had all this Discourse. All the Concern he had in this Affair, was in Short's Gardens, when the Agreement was reduced to Writing, and he signed it.</p>

            . I was present at the Rising-Sun by the Romish Chapel in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, when Dwyer and Murphey were there. I was not one of their Company, they were at a Table, and I was by the Fire Side. I heard what they were upon, so I told one Mr. Brettle. -</p>
               <p>Councel. What did Dwyer say to Murphey?</p>
               <p>Macmillon. I got Brettle to go with me to the Rising-Sun, so we sat down, and I took up a News-Paper (the Penny-Post) and that they might not think I minded them, I seemed Intent upon the Paper. I heard Dwyer say, Why did not you come Yesterday at Five o'Clock? Murphey said, How could I come without Cloaths? Dwyer said, They would have been sent after him. Murphey told him, He would have Security that he should have them before he went; and they talked a good deal in Irish, that I could not understand. At last I said, If the Man is going out of the Kingdom, it is not proper he should leave his Cloaths behind him, if he could take them with him. Aye! but, said Dwyer, he'll have Seven-Pence Half-penny a Day when he comes there. I heard them talk about his Landing somewhere about Calais, and about his Pay, but I heard nothing of what he was to do for it.</p>

            . I was present when the Prisoners were taken. Murphey told me that Dwyer had the French King's Authority about him for enlisting Men, and he said, if we searched him, we should find it. We had Mr. Ibbot the Messenger with us when they were taken. We carried them to Mr. Hodges's, the Corner of Short's-Gardens. Ibbot searched Macgrass, and the Constable searched Dwyer. While he was searching Dwyer, he (Dwyer) pulled a Paper out of his Pocket and put it into the Fire, the Constable went to take it out, and he set his Foot upon the Constable's Hand and held it down in the Fire, but I drew my Hanger and made the Constable take it out. That's the Paper, it is burnt a little, and it was preserved with Difficulty.</p>

I never agreed with him about any Money: I told him there was but little for his Pay, and he said he had some skill in the Irish Character, and would improve himself in France.

               <p>Mr. De Veil. No; Voluntiers are enlisted every Day, without a Farthing of Money; and when they have had the Act read to them, and the Articles of War, and they assent to them before a Magistrate, they are to all Intents and Purposes, as much Soldiers, as if they had received a Thousand Pounds. Reading the Act, and assenting to the Articles before a Magistrate, cannot be done in such Cases as these, where Persons enlist for Foreign Service.

               <p>John Fosset. Between 2 and 3 in the Morning, Feb 5. the Watchmen call'd me up, and told me my House was broke open; several of my Pales in the Yard was pull'd down, and the Back Door of my House was forc'd open. The Rogues when they had got into my Yard, took out some Glass from a Window near the Door, and I suppose they put their Hands in and unbolted the upper Bolt, and the bottom Bolt they wrenched off, and the Batten of the Door likewise. They took the Things mention'd in the Indictment. We found 5 of my Plates that very Night in Bullock's-Court, which is next my House, and the Prisoner was taken the same Time.</p>

               <p>James Bannister. About 5 Weeks ago, I went to Worthington's (this old Woman's) House to enquire for Mr. Hinton a Printer; I waited for him till 11 at Night, then I fell asleep; the old Woman asked me to go to Bed; I did, and in the Morning, when I got up, all my Money was gone. I told my Landlady I had been robb'd, - Lord, says she, I have kept House 40 Years and never any such Thing happen'd before. She told me, she had let the Prisoner in about 12 o'Clock, and she would examine her. While I was contesting with the old Woman, the Prisoner came in very drunk, but we got her to sleep, and she awaked and was come to herself, she told us she had the Money, and that she took it for Funn, but if I would be good natur'd I should have some of it again. I pallaver'd with her, and at last she said the Money was in the Hands of St. James's Watch-house Keeper, so she and I went to him; he asked me who I was? With a very reverend Bow, - I said, - with Submission, you have Money of mine in your Hands; he deny'd it, and order'd me to be put out of the Watchhouse: Well says I to the Prisoner, you said you took it for Funn, you shall go along with me for Funn, and so I pull'd her away with me, and got a Constable; he search'd her and found the Purse upon her. She told Justice Lambert that I gave it her, but in the Round-house she said that Col. Turner gave it her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him what Woman that was that was a Bed with him at my Landlady's? I am an unhappy Woman 'tis true, but I never pick'd a Pocket in my Life.</p>

            . The Prosecutor came in that Night and asked for Mr. Hinton, he was not at Home, so he sat down to wait his coming in, and falling asleep I asked him to go Bed, and he did so. This Prisoner was foul, and she was with me upon Cure; I take in sick People; the Woman to be sure is a vile Creature in her Way, - when she was well, could not she have made use of her own Way of Living again, without robbing the Man? She came Home fuddled two Hours after he was gone to bed, and there being never a Lock upon the Prosecutor's Door, and her Chamber being upon the same Floor with his, I charged her to go up softly. In the Morning he told me he was robbed, I bid him make himself easy, I should hear of it again; while he was disputing with me, in comes Madam<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173702160016"/> with a Man with her; we taxed her with the Money, and under Pretence of helping us to it again, she led us from Bagnio to Bagnio, the Lord knows where; she was in Liquor indeed, but we brought her Home and made her lye down, and when she awaked, I said, how could you do such a Thing in my House, - I that have done you such Service in curing you and making you right again! Why, says she, I did it for Funn, and if he'll be very civil I'll get him two Guineas and a Half again, but if he is saucy he shall have none. About five or six o'Clock we went to the Watchman at St. James's that had the Money; he turned us out of the Watch-house, but the Prosecutor got hold of the Prisoner and pulled her out, she took hold of me, and so I was tumbled into the Kennel among them, but I got out again like a Cat; then we got a Constable and searched the Prisoner, and found the Bag upon her, and then we returned to the Watch-house Keeper, and he owned he had received five Guineas and a Half from the Prisoner, which he gave us back again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray ask him whether the Money that Wingfield the Beadle returned him, - whether the Prosecutor did not give it me, - and ask him for what?</p>
               <p>Bannister. I never saw her till after my Money was gone.</p>

             (that is one of the Prisoner's Names) was not come in We went to bed, and in the Morning the Man said he was robbed, and that he had lost 8 Guineas and some Silver. The Prisoner came in soon after very much fuddled, and she said she took his Money for Funn, and if he'd be civil, perhaps she'd give him a couple of Guineas again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the Witness how she came acquainted with that Man - She's a very disorderly Woman.</p>
               <p>Hinton. I knew him when he drove the Stage Coach for Mr. Baldwin of Slough.</p>
               <p>Defence. The Prosecutor came into this old Woman's House, and ask'd for a Woman, and for something to drink; Mrs Hinton brought him some Brandy or Gin - so he drank to me, and I to him; then we went up Stairs together for about an Hour; and I leave it to you to guess what we did there. He liked me so well, that he said he would come again, and make me a handsome Present; for, says he, 'tis Pity you should live in this old Bawd's House. I will keep you at Kensington. So the Thursday Night following he came again, and lay with me all Night; but on Sunday Night he got to Bed to another Lady of this old Woman's Family, and it made me so angry, that I pull'd off the Bed-cloaths; and he desired me to be quiet - he would oblige me too. I would not let him, but was still very angry: So he pull'd out the Purse and gave it me, not to make a Noise about the other Girl, and I carry'd it directly to Wingfield the Beadle. This old Woman keeps a notorious Bawdy-house; and ever since I have known her I have been miserable.</p>
               <p>Worthington. I took her in foul, and cur'd her, as I do many of these poor Wretches; and I do it for never a Farthing; and when they are well, if they will go to Service, - they're welcome.</p>
               <p>C. I am afraid you are the Occasion of these Wretches being in such unhappy Circumstances.</p>

            . I drew the Wine, and carry'd it into two separate Rooms. They both came in together with the Lady, and they stay'd about a Quarter of an Hour; she came out, and went thro' the House very briskly, about six Minutes after they came out of the private Room, and our Cook shut the Door after her. When they paid the Reckoning they said nothing about what they had lost; but one of them return'd in about half an Hour, and knock'd at the Door, my Master was ill, and he order'd the Door not to be open'd any more that Night. Next Morning my Fellow Servant shew'd him the Lady's Lodgings in Chancery-Lane, and gave him the Case that was found under the Table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At Temple-Bar I met these Gentlemen, and went into the Tavern with them; we drank a Glass a-piece, and then I went with the Prosecutor into another Room, and we had a Pint of Wine there. While we were in this Room together, he call'd the Drawer, and bid him go into the other Room, and ask the Gentleman if he had got his Snuff-box; the Gentleman sent Word he had it not; well then, says he, I have left it at the Fountain, where I supp'd to Night. They kept me 'till between 11 and 12, and he drew his Sword, and said, if I offer'd to go out of the Room he would run me thro', and getting up to take hold of me, he fell down, for he was pretty much fuddled, and so I got out of the House, and I heard no more 'till next Night the Prosecutor came with two or three Men and took me out of my Bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rogers. I was there twice on Monday, and she denied her self.</p>

               <p>Warwick. On my Trial for these Robberies in September, I desired my Councel to ask Drinkwater, whether he had not declar'd he would hang me.

               <p>Drinkwater. What was it for?</p>
