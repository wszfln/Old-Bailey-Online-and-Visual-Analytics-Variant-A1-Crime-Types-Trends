I am clerk to the Watermen's Company; they grant certificates under their Act of Parliament to masters to employ apprentices on the river—the Act requires that the apprentice should have worked and rowed on the river for two years next proceding, and under sec. 2 masters are liable for employing any apprentice who is not duly qualified—the defendant is a freeman of the Company, and on 13th March he applied to the Court, in writing, for a certificate; this is it.(<hi rend="italic">This was the application of Thomas Henderson, for a licence to employ his apprentice Thomas Robert Salter Malt by, who was bound to him on 14th February,</hi> 1888, <hi rend="italic">to take charge of craft</hi>)—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a form, signed by several persons: "We, the undersigned, beg to certify that the within-named apprentice is sober and industrious, and within two years has been employed in taking charge of craft"—we have both the master and the apprentice before the Court before granting that licence—Henderson appeared before the Court on 13th March, and with some difficulty we obtained the information from him that this apprentice had been</p>

               <p>working for himself two months, and for the previous nine months with Mr. Robert Emmerson at Brentford—he first said seven months and then nine months—upon that, as he did not make out two years' employment, the Court refused the application, and instructed the Inspector to call on the parties who had signed the certificate, and summoned the six men to show cause why they should not be prosecuted; and, in consequence of what transpired, the defendant was summoned to the Mansion House; I was there—he claimed to be tried by a jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This certificate is signed by the applicant and six freemen, and is headed, "Apprentice's certificate"—the application was for a certificate for licence, which signifies that the Court have examined the apprentice and licensed the master <hi rend="italic">to</hi> employ him—when we have granted a licence and entered it in the book, if the applicant wants a certificate of the licence he would apply for it, and we should enter it in a book; we record it—I am quite clear that Henderson answered the questions; they were put by Mr. Gray and myself—the boy was there, but I do not know that Henderson referred to him to answer for himself—I have been secretary eight years, and never knew of a prosecution before—the Master stated something to the effect that it was somewhat unfortunate for us that this should have happened at the present moment—there is a Bill before Parliament to curtail our privileges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In the last three or four years the company have had to summon men who made their own applications, and they were told that if this signing went on without their knowing the persons, further proceedings would be taken—they have been warned—the Master said he was reluctant to take proceedings' now because it might look as if we were playing up the Bill—Maltby was questioned, but we could not get anything out of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Militia, and am a member of the Junior United Service Club—Colonel Champion is also a member, also Major Bury and Capt. O'Dell—on the evening of the 27th March I was in the company of Col. Champion and his son from a quarter to ten to a quarter to eleven, and with Capt. O'Dell part of that time—I did not see Major Bury there at all—I know him—on the following morning, the 28th, this letter was brought to me by a servant of the club at my house, No.1, Stafford Place, where I was then lodging, it was in this envelope, sealed with the club seal—I opened it and read the letter—I do not know the writing—I showed it to Capt. O'Dell the same morning—he told me it could not be meant for him, and I then sent it on to Col. Champion.</p>

Champion in the smoking-room—there were other persons in the room—there was not a general conversation taking place in the room, we were all together, separate from everyone else, at one table, in the centre of the room—I was not talking to any other persons—I do not remember seeing the defendant at all that night—I did not know when I received this letter to whom it referred—I went straight off to Capt. O'Dell—I met him in the club and gave him the letter <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see if it could apply to him—he read it—it did not apply <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him—being in doubt to whom it applied, I sent it on to Col. Champion; that was about midday, between twelve and one—I did not think of the defendant as being the possible writer of the letter, the idea came into my head that it was someone else—I do not know that there are some persons in the club not having a very friendly feeling towards Col. Champion; there was not anyone whom I thought might have written it for that reason—I do not remember using the phrase that the letter contained nonsense, I am almost sure I did not call it a nonsensical letter—I will not swear I did not, I might have said so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired lieut colonel in the army, and am a member of the Junior United Service Club—I resided permanently at Combermere, co. Cork, until I left about six months ago—that is my residence—I reside there with my wife and family—Major Bury occupies a place called Little Island, about three miles distant—I know him as a member of the club in London—I was not on visiting terms with him in Ireland—I knew him, and have known him for many years—on the 27th March last I was with Captain Erskine and my son in the club from about twenty minutes to ten till about a quarter to one, in the smoking-room, and after that in the supper-room from about half-past eleven till about a quarter to one, when we left—I saw Major Bury in the smoking-room, sitting on a sofa on the left-hand side between two pillows—to the best of my recollection he must have been there over an hour while I, Captain Erskine, and my son were sitting together—on the following day, the 28th, I received this letter at the club, sent to me by Captain Erskine, enclosed in an envelope, with a short letter—I read the letter—I understood it to refer to me—at that time I did not know Major Burr's writing, and had never seen it that I remember—my suspicions were directed to him, the very first thing that struck my attention was the French expression <hi rend="italic">toute la famille,</hi> Because I knew Major Bury to be talked of as a man constantly using little brief French expressions, and also translating them—I had had occasion before this to write to Major Bury about a Captain Broadley, a mutual friend or acquaintance whom I had not seen in the club for some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189005190017"/>
               <p>years; I was anxious to know if he had got well, so I thought this a good opportunity, and I wrote to Major Bury this letter, dated 29th March; received this reply from him—I compared it with the writing of the alleged libel, and the envelope, and I saw at once that the writing was the same—I then consulted my solicitors, I think the next day, and then I reported the matter to the club—I have myself heard the defendant use French phrases and translating them—in the winter of 1866 and 1867 I was on active service on the occasion of the Fenian rebellion—that was my only connection with Fenianism—I take the word "bounder" to mean a self-asserting, swaggering vulgarian; that is what I think it is generally understood to be, in clubs and in society in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not a <hi rend="italic">bounder</hi> that I know of; I leave it to public opinion—I say I thought the letter applied to me, but not on account of that word; that did not apply to me at all, any more than the word Fenian—I never was a Fenian or a Fenian sympathiser—I never took part in any rebel movement—I thought the letter applied to me, because was the only man of the party in the smoking-room to whom it could apply, and more than that I can swear that Major Bury was the only man in the smoking-room (for I took notice of everybody who was there) who could have known anything about my family—it was intended to apply to me, to destroy my reputation among my friends and in society—I have been a member of this club since 1877—I have been away from Combermere six or seven months; I am now living in town—I believe the defendant has been a member of the club about thirty years; I don't know much about him—I have of course heard other persons use French expressions; he is the only person who has translated French phrases in my presence—he has never visited me at Combermere—I have seen very little of him—we were not on visiting terms—we have never been thrown across each other to have a quarrel—when I saw the expression, "<hi rend="italic">tout la famille</hi>," I thought it was Major Bury who had written the letter—I did not write to him about it; as a gentleman I should not be likely to make allusion to any man without being quite sure—I considered it was most insulting—"I heard when I made complaint to the club, that he denied writing it, and he also made a statement in Court—I took out a summons on the 24th April, which was heard on the 25th—when I compared the two letters I saw sufficient indications to induce me to go to my solicitors on the subject; there is an attempt to disguise the words, not the letters, that was the mistake.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 59, Holborn Viaduct—I have made handwriting a study—I have compared the letter and envelope addressed to Captain Erskine with the one to Colonel Champion, and I believe them to nave been decidedly written by the same person—the initials "J.

               <p>little before 12 till 1.30—three sides of the office are glass—I command a full view of No. 1 yard—I am able to see anyone who leaves the premises, going towards Milk wood Road—at 1.25 I saw the prisoner at the furthest bakehouse door; the fourth, next to the coke-hole; the coke door is the other side of the bakehouse—he opened the door, went in, and came out again immediately—going in there he would have access to the passage leading to the furnaces—he stood for a second, apparently considering what he was going to do, barely half a minute—I did not see which way he went, my attention was called off—Manerson, my head foreman, was with me; he could see the prisoner; he called my attention to him—he left the office at 1.30—between 11.50 and 1.25 I did not see him leave the premises—if he had, with the exception of three minutes, I must have seen him—I was away about 12,15 for those three minutes—I went to my private house at 1.30, and did not return till fourteen to fifteen minutes past three—about 3.25 Hales came to the office—first he ran past it—he returned with a policeman—he told me something, in consequence of which I followed him to No. 1 bakehouse—I entered by No. 1 door through No.1 passage—I went to the end of the furnaces—there is a box there—I saw the dead body of the deceased lying with his head towards the coke-hole and his feet towards the box—I saw this iron furnace bar by his side—it had been kept on the third or fourth furnace fronting my office—it was lying there all day—it had not been used that day; it was an old bar—I had not seen it that day—I go through two or three times a day—I cannot say when I saw it last, but I had seen it frequently—the dead man's hat was by his side, bent in, and blood on one side—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the hat in the condition in which it was found—there are three similar bars to this—they are used to try the coke—there are some back in the store—this is worn out—it was the only one there that day—a tobacco-box was lying near deceased, the feet by the engineer's box, and a pipe by his side, I think—his right trousers pocket was torn out about one and a quarter inch, sticking out from the trousers as if pulled out—there was a good deal of warmth left in the furnaces—there are eight furnaces and two coppers—we had been baking that morning—the man's head was within about nine inches or a foot of a heap of coke; about half a bushel of coke heaped up—I sent for Dr. Garnham—he came soon afterwards—I stayed in the furnace-room some time—about 5 o'clock, from something that reached me, I sent for the prisoner—he came to me in the furnace-room—the body was still there in that corner of the furnace-room—I said to him, "Why were you so late upon the premises to-day?"—he said, "To clear up" or "sweep up this sweepings-room"—(I found out since that he had stayed late on the Saturday previous) he came back about five minutes past two, it was said, to fetch his tobacco-pouch—sweeping up was within his ordinary duty—workmen do not have access to the premises after hours, but if a man left an article we could not stop him—I next said, "Do not be offended at what I am going to request you to do," at the same time making a request to the foreman which he did not hear, 11 Kindly turn out your pockets, and let me see what money you have in your possession," or "in your purse"—he took his purse from his pocket, and showed me what he had in it, 2s. 5d. or 2s. 6d.—I am not certain whether there was a two-shilling piece or two separate shillings, a threepenny-piece and two pennies—I sent a message to his wife—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189005190035"/>
               <p>did not hear my instructions—I said, "What money did you pay your wife out of your wages?"—he said, "32s. or 33s."—he then went away, and I left within a quarter of an hour—there are five clocks upon the promises—they are correctly shown upon the model—one is in No. 2 yard—the Loudon Road gate was shut up and the key in my pocket before I went in to dinner—the dinner hour is 1.30—the gate was locked about 1.27—it is always locked before I go to dinner—Grimsell, one of my junior clerks, locks it—he brought me the key—it is on my bunch—I had it in my possession at 1.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are two gates in the Loudon Road, and two entrances in the Milk wood Road—there is one key to each lock—the Loudon Road gates are only used Mondays and Tuesdays—nothing went out of the Loudon Road gate, facing the office, on the Saturday; it was open to let in fresh air about 1.27—a gate in the Milk wood Road was open two or three times on Saturday to let vans out, but not kept open, and there is always a clerk in charge of it—at the back of the big entrance there is an entrance from the middle yard into the shed—I do my part of the bookkeeping in my office, entering the cash account of the day, and surveying what is going on—no one passed at 1.30—I do not enter who passes—I should take notice of a stranger—I should stop a man who was late and inquire—I should not watch a man unless I had any suspicion—if Manerson had not called my attention I might not have seen the prisoner—I should notice a man passing out of the Loudon Road gate, and another out of the Milkwood Road gates at the same time—there is a pigeon-hole in my shed towards the Milkwood Road on my left, as I am looking up the yard, which forms an outlook, and a small window that lifts up—I paid about sixty-six bakers on that Saturday—they come up in a line—they know the order—the foreman stands by the side after he has taken his own money—he is paid first of the gang—he waits, because he pays for the extra work—I cannot ear mark the coins—I paid the prisoner—the store-room contained building materials to repair the premises, old iron, and so forth—the apparatus is for cooking fruit—a brick place divided it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the second Loudon Road gate was opened on the Saturday it was locked again directly; I would not be certain whether the dung man was admitted at 6 a.m.—one of those gates is open every day—the Milkwood Road cart gate is always being opened and shut the whole day—it is open at four o'clock p.m. to admit the vans, and shut about six p.m.—Inspector Tunbridge took away a piece of coke like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not identify it.</p>

The front gate is always open, because it is the inlet to my office, from 5.30 a.m.—the cart gate is opened about 7 a.m. for a few minutes, to allow eight vans to go out, and then it would be open again between ten and eleven, and then shut; that is the Milkwood Road gate—the other gates were both locked, and I had the keys when I went away—the van gate in Milkwood Road was not usually open on Saturdays between two and four, unless vans leave; three vans were let out on the Saturday soon after two—the last time they were opened was shortly after four.</p>

                  </hi>. lam a clerk at Nevill's—on Saturday, 12th April, I was engaged in the office inside the north entrance to the works from Milkwood Road—on that Saturday that gate was not opened at all, to let vans in or out—when it was open I opened it—the first time I opened it was about twenty minutes past one—I then let five, six, or seven vans out—I remained at the gate, and immediately locked it after they had gone—nobody went in or out except the people connected with the vans—nobody would be allowed out—when I locked the gate the key remained in my possession—at two o'olock I let out three vans in the same way and locked the gate as soon as they had passed out—I did not let out any man, only the drivers of the vans—after that the gate remained shut until 3.50—I then opened it to let the vans in, coming home—I did not see the prisoner at all that day that I remember—he did not pass in or out of that gate during that day—I recollect clearly what took place on that Saturday with regard to that gate.</p>

I have made a mistake about the nearest place I was to No. 1 bakehouse during Saturday; the nearest point would be when I passed up and down No. 1 yard"—I took that down and read it over to him; he then initialed each sheet, and signed it at the end—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the statement which he made, there was no communication between the prisoner and his wife between the times when their respective statements were made; the wife was at her own home, and he was at the police-station—I did not read to him his wife's statement.</p>

               <p>1 p.m. I left off work yesterday a few minutes after twelve. After leaving off work I went into the middle yard and washed. When I left the bakery to wash, my foreman, Mr. Howard, and a baker named Brown were there. There was no other person washing in the yard at the time I was there washing. After I had finished washing I went to the dressing-room on the middle bakery. It was about 12.30 p.m. when I entered the dressing-room. There were several persons in the dressingroom when I went in, amongst whom were a baker named Weston and another named Haywood. After I had dressed I returned to the bakery, leaving behind me both Weston and Haywood, besides others. On reaching the bakery I found Brown there. I put away my tools and then left the premises. Brown left the bakery just before me, and passed out of the gate into Milkwood Road, just in front of me. When I left the bakery there were several packers and others still there, but none of my gang. Amongst those I left behind in the bakery were Wilson, a fruitman; Harding, a packer; a man whose Christian name is George; another packer, and a fruitman named Hitchings. I don't remember seeing anyone about the yard or at the gate when I went out. I looked at No. 1 clock as I went down the yard, and noticed that the time was twenty minutes to one. After getting outside the premises, I turned to the right along Milkwood Road to Heron Road, through Heron Road, up Poplar Walk into Denmark Hill to the Fox-under-the-Hill. In Poplar Walk a man begged of me and I gave him two-pens. This was the only person who spoke to me or to whom I spoke to between the works and the public-house. It is about a mile from the bakery to the Fox-under-the-Hill. I went to the public-house just for a walk I received my money for my week's work (32s.) at the office about 11.80 a.m. It was in three half-sovereigns and a two-shilling piece. The foreman, Mr. Howard, paid me 3s. 5d. for overtime about twelve o'clock in the bakery. He paid me in the following coins, viz.:—a two-shilling piece, a shilling and a sixpence, and I gave the foreman one shilling. When I went into work at six o'clock on Friday evening I had twopence in my possession, and I had spent nothing from the time of going in. I don't know what money my wife may have had on Friday evening, but I should think she probably had about a shilling. On my arrival at the Fox-under-the-Hill, I entered the bar nearest Camberwell, and there were several persons, strangers to me, in the bar when I entered. I know the landlord and landlady by sight, but I am not aware that they know me. I ordered a half-a-pint of 'stout-and-mild,' and a pennyworth of tobacco, as I found I had left my tobacco-pouch behind in the dressing-room at the works. I paid for the beer and tobacco (2 1/2 d.) in coppers. I did not miss the tobacco-pouch until I got to the Fox-under-the-Hill. I had some tobacco in my pipe when I left the works, and I smoked this on my way to the public-house. It was about one o'clock when I was at the public-house, and I only remained there a few minutes. After leaving the public-house I went direct back to the works to look for my tobacco-pouch. I went back by wav of Denmark Hill, Poplar Walk, into and along Jessop Road into Milkwood Road, to the works. I passed by my house on the way, but never went in. I entered the works by the main and only entrance. I had riot seen any person whom I knew between the public-house and the works, nor had I spoken to anyone, or had anyone spoken to me on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189005190049"/>
               <p>way. I noticed it was 1.25 when I entered the works. As I entered the gate I noticed two young men, strangers to me, standing on the opposite side of Milkwood Road, looking into the works. They appeared as if they were waiting about with the idea of getting a job, or for someone to come out of the works. They were two ordinary-looking young men, and I took no notice of them, could not describe them, and should not know them again. As I crossed the yard to the middle bakery, I spoke to Wilson and Hitchings, who had just finished loading a van in the yard. They said to me, "What, haven't you gone yet?" and I said, "Yes, I have forgot something. "I went into the middle bakery, there was no one there when I went in, but Wilson and O'Meaney and another man they call <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> came in immediately afterwards. When I got into the bakery, I went direct to my box to look for my tobacco-pouch, but it was not there. I then went up to the middle ladder to the dressing-room where I had changed my clothes. The three men, Wilson, O'Meaney, and <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> were in the bakery when I left to go up the middle ladder. They were speaking about having just finished their work. I went out of the bakery by the door into the yard, across the yard to the ladder that leads up into the dressing-room. I saw Harding, <hi rend="italic">Spot,</hi> and George sweeping out the middle shed as I was going up the ladder, but I did not speak to them. They were the only persons I saw in the yard. The ladder leads to a bridge, which I crossed, into a passage, and the dressingroom opens into the passage on the left of the bridge, and about six feet from the end of the bridge. On the bridge I joined Hitchings, who came on to the bridge by another ladder, and we both went together to the dressing-room; on the bridge Hitchings said he had just finished work, and was going to the dressing-room to change. I told Hitchings I had come back to look for my tobacco-pouch. We both went into the dressing-room together. There was no one there when we entered. I went to my working clothes, which were in a bundle on a rack, and found the tobacco-pouch in my coat pocket, the outside breast. I told Hitchings I had found it, and then left the dressing-room, leaving Hitchings behind. After leaving the dressing-room I went into the passage, turned to the left, along the passage to the bridge, crossing No. 1 yard. I crossed this bridge and descended by the end ladder into No. 1 yard. When I came down into the yard I saw Packer <hi rend="italic">Nabob</hi> sweeping out the big shed in that yard. <hi rend="italic">Nabob</hi> was the first person I had met since leaving the dressing-room. I did not speak to <hi rend="italic">Nabob,</hi> but crossed direct over No. 1 yard out of the gate into Milkwood Road. I looked at the clock I have previously spoken about as I went out, and saw the time was twenty to two. I had done nothing, nor had I been anywhere, or spoken to any person other than what I have described. What I have described occupied the whole fifteen minutes which elapsed from my entering the works, at 1.25, until I left again, at 1.40 p.m. I could have done all I have described as having done under five minutes had I made haste; but I remained some time in the bakery, speaking to Wilson and the others, but chiefly to Wilson. I noticed no one about the gate as I went out except the clerk—the junior one, who was apparently writing in the office. I don't think he saw me. Some fruiterers, whose names I don't remember, passed out of the gate in front of me; I think there were three, but I don't think they saw me. I did not stand or loiter about anywhere in the works</p>

               <p>between 1.25 and 1.40 by myself. The only place I passed any time at all in was the bakery. The last time I was in the furnace-room before the murder was On Thursday evening about eight o'clock, when I went to fetch some salt out of the apparatus-room, which abuts on the furnace-room. The nearest I was to the furnace-room at any time on Saturday, was when I was in the bakery, where I am employed—I mean by bakery, the middle bakehouse. After leaving the works at 1.40 p.m. I went direct home by way of Milkwood Road into Jessop Road. I neither saw anyone I knew nor spoke to anyone on the way. On reaching home I entered my kitchen and there saw my wife. My wife let me in the front door, I told my wife I had been for a walk to the Fox-under-the-Hill. My dinner was not quite ready when I got home. When I first went indoors my wife said to me, "You have not come straight home; X saw some of the bakers going home half an hour ago, when I was out shopping. It was then I told her I had been to the Fox-under-the-Hill. A, good many of the bakers, after leaving work on Saturday, go direct to the Milkwood Arms, and have a drink together; and I have very frequently gone there with them. Yesterday I took a fancy to go to the Fox under-the-Hill by myself, instead of going with the others to the Milkwood Arms. I have gone to the Fox-under-the-Hill by myself of a Saturday afternoon once or twice before, but it was a long time ago. The last time I was in the Fox-under-the-Hill before yesterday was on Boxing Day. As I have said before, I met no one I knew either going from the works to the Fox under-the-Hill, at the Fox-under-the-Hill, or when returning to the Works. I spoke to no one except the man who begged of me, and when ordering the beer and tobacco. All that passed between the beggar-man and myself, was that he said he was hard-up, and wanted a copper; X gave him twopence. He thanked me for it, and we separated, going in opposite directions. It was in Poplar Walk I met the man. After I got indoors I gave my wife 33s. in all; it was made up of three half-sovereigns and three single shillings. The clothes I was wearing yesterday, from the time I left work, were a navy blue jacket and vest to match, and the trousers I now have on. I was wearing the same tie, but another collar and shirt, and the same shoes I am now wearing. The shoes have not been cleaned since I left work yesterday. I remained at home from the time I reached there, about a quarter to two, until about 3.30 p.m., sitting in the kitchen reading and having a glass of ale. I then went out with my wife shopping in Brixton Market, near the railway station, and there my wife purchased a number of articles of food, but I am unable to say how much she expended. We returned home about half-past four, and when in the Milkwood Road, near home, we met George Sparks and his little boy. Sparks is one of the foremen bakers at Nevill's. Sparks and I walked along together towards the works, and near the gate leading into the works we came up to Harding and two or three other men. Just at the time I met Sparks the police ambulance passed us, going towards the works. I asked Sparks if he knew what was up, and he said he had heard that Nabob had fallen down and got killed. I asked him if Nabob had had a fit, or how it was done, and he said he had heard that Nabob had fallen down, and that was all he knew. Nothing else passed between Sparks and I. It was only about a stonels throw from where I met Sparks</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189005190051"/>
               <p>to the gate of the works, where Harding and the others were standing. As I passed Harding and the others I heard them speaking about Nabob being found dead, but they did not appear to know anything further than Sparks had told me. Sparks and I merely made a halt with Harding and the others, and then passed on to the end of Jessop Road, where Sparks left me, and I turned down Jessop Road and went indoors I merely told Sparks I had been shopping with my wife, and nothing else. I did not say anything to him about having been into the works to look after my tobacco-pouch, or having been to the Fox-under-the-Hill. Nothing whatever passed between me and Sparks except what I have mentioned. After I got indoors my wife prepared tea, and when we were about half through Pawe, one of the engineers, came to my house and said the manager wanted to see me. I went back to the works with him, and there saw Mr. Harding, the manager. He asked me what I was doing at the works about half past one. I told him I had been out, and forgotten my tobacco-pouch, and had come back to look for it. I did not tell him I had been to the Fox-under-the-Hill. He questioned me as to how much money I had given my wife, and I told him 33s. He asked mo to turn out my pockets, and I did so. I then had a two shilling piece, a threepenny piece, and twopence in bronze. When at Brixton with my wife she went into the Atlantic public-house, and there my wife had a half-pint of stout, and I had a half-pint of mild ale. I paid 3d. for this drink. This was the only money I had spent other than that I have already mentioned. After leaving the manager I went back home, without speaking to anyone, and did not go out again until about eight o'clock. I then went to the Bakers' (Sub at the Angel public house, Brixton Road, and remained there about three-quarters of an hour, and then went back home. At the club I paid 2s. 2d., and had a half-pint of stout and mild, for which X paid 1 1/2 d. My wife walked with me from my house to the Bakers' Club; she remainded outside until I came out, and then we went home together. As we were going to the club we went into the Atlantic public-house, and my wife had half a pint of stout, and I had half a pint of Burton ale. My wife paid for these drinks. We got back home again about ten o'clock, and I did not go out again. My wife went out to do some more shopping, but I remained indoors. We went to bed about eleven o'clock, and I got up about a quarter to nine this morning, and was having my breakfast about half-past ten, when Spurgin, another engineer, came to my house, and said Mr. Harding wanted to see me. I went with Spurgin to the works, and was then told I was wanted down at Peckham Police-station, to which place I went with a gentleman who was waiting at the works. I had not been out of doors this morning when Spurgin came. I have a distinct recollection of all that has occurred since twelve noon yesterday, and what I have told you, and what you have written down, is a true statement. I have omitted nothing. I am positive I never went to any part of the works after twelve o'clock yesterday, except those I have mentioned, and I never went anywhere, met any person, paid away any money, or told any person anything beyond what I have stated to you; nor has anything occurred to me other than I have mentioned in this statement. The foregoing statement has been read over to me, and it is a true and correct account of all my doings since twelve o'clock yesterday, the 12th</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was put in and ready</hi>)-after that was read to him he said, "That is true, I did tell him that I did not care about you (the Witness) knowing that I had forgotten I had told Sparks about it; what I told Sparks was true"—the next statement I read to him was that of Balls—(read)—to that the prisoner said, "I was not in the furnace-room, I had no occasion to go there"—Sharville's was the next statement—I did not read the whole of that to him. (This was read in part)—in r, ply to Sharville's statement the prisoner said, "I merely looked in at the door, as I said before"—the next statement I read was that of Hatchings; each of the persons were present as I read their statement—after reading that to him, the prisoner said, "You remember seeing me in the dressing-room?"—Hitchings said "No; I first met you in Middle-yard"—the prisoner said, "You know I told you about my tobacco-pouch," to which Hitchings replied, "You did not tell me anything about the tobacco-pouch; I did not dress in the same room"—the next statement read was Frank Harding's (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—upon that being read the prisoner said, "I was not in the building; I went out at ten minutes to two. When you saw me at No. 1 bakehouse was when I was at the door, just before I went out"—the next statement read was that of Alfred Daniels (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>),—in answer to that the prisoner said, "Yes; that is right; the window I was at is facing the coke-hole; it was twenty-five minutes to one, and not ten minutes past when you saw me"—I was present when Dr. Gallie took some notes of his examination of the prisoner, which I read over to the prisoner—this is the document (read), to which the prisoner said, "The marks on my hand were caused through striking it with the iron end of the trough lead on Thursday night. I can't account for the mark on my throat; I might have done it with my nail"—it was after that that I mentioned the fact that I had seen the prisoner's wife—I said, "I</p>

               <p>have seen your wife, and she tells me as follows," and then I read to him what she had told me—this is the original document—it is a pencil Statement which I took at the prisoner's house (read)—to that he said, "Yes; that is right; I scratched my hand by striking it against the fence., I did not like to tell you about it; I had forgotten I had told Sparkes. I went down to the Fox-under-the-Hill to see some men about the Daily News; but they had gone when I got there; it was about a bet we had made the previous Saturday at the Atlantic public-house"—I told him the clothes had been handed to me by his wife—he said, "Yes; they are the clothes; the button-holes in the collar were broken out in the scuffle with the man I told Sparkes about"—he was still wearing the trousers which he had been wearing on the Saturday—something over half an hour after this, about two o'clock, after all the others had gone, he was charged by Inspector Fox with the wilful murder of Thomas Furlonger, by striking him on the head with an iron bar—he made no reply to that—he was then detained in custody.</p>

On 3rd April I was lodging at the Camden Arms beerhouse, Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell, kept by Mr. Humphreys—I have seen the three prisoners using that house—I believe Wolstenholme is Mrs. Humphreys's brother—he lived at the beerhouse for some time, and acted as barman—I did not notice the prisoners in the house on 3rd April,' the Thursday before Good Friday—I am not always there—some time before they were taken into custody I saw in the sawdust cellar downstairs some implements that looked like long rods—they were wrapped up, and I did not undo them, but I could feel some iron in between—I have seen things very similar outside the Court to-day.</p>

Whitlock, wholesale provision merchants at that address—the premises are approached by a wide outside gate in Allen Street; in the wide gate is a kind of wicket-gate—from just inside the wicket to the office is about ten yards, I should think, not more—the office has the usual appointments, and a safe, and doors back and front, which are kept locked at night—on 3rd April I secured the premises, and made them quite safe, and went to bed; the wicket-gate would be double-locked—at 2 a.m. on 4th April I was called up by the police—I found the wicket-gate forced open—there were marks on it close to the lock—Bury Street is within a stone's throw of Whitlock's premises, and the Camden Arms is five or six minutes' walk off.</p>

Whitlock's premises, and about twelve yards from their door—I was dressed in plain clothes—after waiting about an hour I saw Weston and McLaren come up Allen Street and go to Messers Whitlock's warehouse door—Weston struck a light and did something to the wicket-gate and it went open—Weston went inside, said something to McLaren which I could not hear—McLaren crossed the street and spoke to a man standing on the other side, whom I believe to be Wolstenholme—that man walked away; McLaren returned to the warehouse door where Weston was, and they went inside and closed the door after them—I came out from my hiding place and told Robinson what I had seen—I returned to the corner of Clark Street, two doors from the warehouse, and saw Wolstenholme coming along Allen Street with this bag under; his left arm—Robinson stopped him and asked him what he had got in the bag; he said, "Nothing"—land Robinson took him to the station—at the corner of Clark Street, a turning out of Allen Street, two doors from Whitlock's, he began to resist; he called out "Let me go," and half a minute after I heard someone running down the street and someone calling out "Stop thief I"—about half-an-hour after taking Wolstenbolme to the station, I went to 5, Bury Street—I tapped at the door gently with my hand—McLaren opened the door, he was fully dressed with the exception of his hat; he said in an undertone, "Is it all right?"—I</p>

I then heard struggling in a street adjoining the building, and Weston and McLaren then opened the warehouse door and ran out, and ran away down Allen Street; Weston threw off his hat, and threw something down at my legs; I picked it up, and found that it was this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>; he also threw away the dark lantern. I pursued him through several short streets, and in Sutton Street I said, "Wiseman, if you don't stop I'll knock you down. "He did not stop, and I knocked him down, and Mather came to my assistance, and we secured him. I found this key at the spot where Weston fell, and I returned and picked up the lantern and <hi rend="italic">the jemmy.</hi> I found marks on the warehouse door corresponding with the <hi rend="italic">jemmy" lie-called on 6th May,</hi> Sewell <hi rend="italic">added:</hi> "I went back and picked up Weston's hat, lantern, and <hi rend="italic">jimmy,</hi> and Mather and a uniform constable took him to the police-station; at the station I showed Weston the articles I had picked up, and I said, "Here's your hat," and he took it; he denied any knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy.</hi> I said? "That is what you forced the door with "; he said, "The door was never forced at all. "On the way to the cell Weston said, "I don't know the other two men," referring to the other two prisoners. I afterwards examined the premises, and found a key I received from Mather fitted an inside door of the office where the safe was. The door which was actually forced is a door under an archway leading to the warehouse yard. I produce a correct plan of the premises, which I have made to a scale of 1 inch to 8 feet; I also produce a plan I have made of the surrounding streets.</p>

I said I did not want them—I said, "No, "I would have nothing to do with it; I had not got the money—the bag was put down by the side of the table in my back parlour—that was on the Wednesday—on that day about one o'clock Porter came with Highgate, and the fair man—they looked at the bag, and said, "Don't give it to anyone else but that man," meaning Porter—it was left there, and they went away—Porter came again in the evening with a little boy or two—he came to the side, and asked for the bag, and said, "Would you mind wrapping it up?"—I said, "You can wrap it up"—before doing so he opened it—I said, "I should like a pair of those trousers Walker asked me to buy. Can I have a pair of them?"—he said, "Oh, yes," and opened the bag, and I selected this pair of trousers; I believe I gave him 5s. for them—I took some of the buttons off—I was going to have them altered for my son—the bag was wrapped up in brown paper and string, and a boy took it away—I could not swear to the boy—Porter stayed and treated my brother, Wolstenholme, <hi rend="italic">Fishy Jim,</hi> and several others.</p>

No!"—<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is Mr. Marks—I did not ask Marks to buy fittings, nor he decline; nor did I ever entertain the idea of being a partner in a barber's shop—I never made a proposal to enter into partnership with anybody—Slamervitch did not ask Balberski that day to give me back the money—nothing of the kind was said—I saw Slamervitch that afternoon at Poplar, and I said, "You are quite capable of going as a witness to swear falsely"—that was the last time I was at Mr. Marks'—I saw Slamervitch the same evening at Balberski's—he did not say anything about the money that night—I cannot swear Slamervitch had part of the money, but from his protestations, and saying that Balberski was respectable, very likely he must have—I cannot say what Balberski spent on barber's fittings—I am not a barber—seeing the looking-glasses brought into the place, I said, "What are these looking-glasses for?" and he said he was going to move, and to establish a barber's shop—he never told me he had spent my money in buying fittings—if he had ever told me he was going to spend my money for his own purposes I would never have consented—he said nothing but "There is no book; there is no money"—I never heard of Slamervitch threatening to do Balberski violence if he did not return the money—I cannot say if I saw a Mr. Maxshire—I never told any man that Slamervitch had been badly treated by Balberski and thrown out of his shop because he demanded her money—about a fortnight after my money had been taken from me, Slamervitch said, "The money is gone, and I won't know you"—I first spoke to the solicitor before Easter, when Slamervitch was in prison—I saw Slamervitch in London, and more than five times—I said, in mistake, I had not seen Slamervitch for twelve days, and corrected it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 149, Upper North Street, Poplar, and am a hairdresser and surgeon—dentist—Slamervitch entered my employment on January 1, and remained till he was arrested; I am one of his bail—he slept on the premises—his hours were from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.—he had a half-holiday once a fortnight, on Tuesday, after 2 o'clock—we close at 4 on Sundays—I left home on January 30, and went to a wedding at Manchester, and returned on February 11—Slamervitch did not leave my premises while I was at home, except at the times I mention, and my son says he did not while I was away—he was away once in February, on a Thursday night, and once in March; once was about 9.30, and once at 10—I do not know at what time he came back; I did not see him till next morning—I always make them ask me in the afternoon if they want to go home, and then I stay at home—on a Thursday, in the middle of March, the prosecutrix came in and asked for the prisoner; he came to my private door and said, "A young woman wishes to see you"—he brought her in and introduced her; he stood up and she sat down—she said she came to ask me whether I would allow Slamervitch to come as a witness for her against a man named Balberski—I said yes, provided he lost his time—she said she came to this country and brought £15 with her, and Balberski put it in the bank in his name, and it was taken out, and he bought a hairdresser's shop with the money—I said, "What is he going to do?"—she said, "He is going to</p>

               <p>open a shop in Whitechapel, and now I am left without money, and do not know what to do"—I said, "How can a girl be so foolish as to part with her money in a strange country to people she does not know?"—she said she was sorry—I said, "What sort opposition is this man in?"—she said, "He is very poor"—I said, "What are you going to do, how are you going to get your money back? I should advise you to come to terms and take the things, and you cannot lose the lot"—she said he was charging her so much for food, to the best of my recollection about £2 and so much for lodging, and so much for his own loss of time to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> and buy the things—I said, "That is ridiculous; if he went to buy the things it was for his benefit, you go to him and ask him to settle with you; should he not do so mention my name; and come back and I will do all in my power to get some matron for you"—she said, "Will you allow the prisoner to come with me?"—I said, "I cannot spare him—she said, "As late as 10?"—I said, "Yes, "and at 9 o'clock I sent him down—next morning he gave me the answer, and said that Balberski was a little obstreperous—the girl said that Balberski proposed a partnership, and promised her a little room to live in, and her food, and gave her a writing for the £14.</p>

I am a clothier, of 17, New Street, New Road—I am a director and cashier of the loan company—on February 4 Balberski came there with the prosecutrix—he asked in English to open an account and what interest; I told him 5 per cent., and said, "What name?" he said, "My name is Solomon Balberski"—he then turned to the prosecutrix, and they talked in their language for a minute or two—I could understand it, but it was in a low tone; he turned round and said, "Put it in my name; "I made the bank-book out accordingly, and he handed me two £5 notes and four sovereigns, which the prosecutrix handed to him—I gave him the book and he gave it to her, and on February 10th they both came again to draw out £6; it must have been on Monday, and I am sure it was the 10th—a withdrawal note was made out, which she signed, and the £6 was given to her with the book, and she put it in a hand-bag; I did not give it to her, Mr. Bowman handed it to her—I am positive the prosecutrix is the person who came to draw out the £6—I observed her closely, she wore a short light jacket, and I remarked to a friend that it was rather peculiar that the money was put in last week and drawn out so soon—we are only open from 8 to 10 p.m.; there was another withdrawal on the 11th, but I was not present—when the £6 was paid I could not reach, and I handed it to Bowman.</p>

I live at 4, Steel Road, West Ham, and am the wife of Matthew Wadelow—we kept fowls, which on 29th April were perfectly safe at between 9 and 10 p.m. in the fowlhouse at the bottom of the garden—next morning I got up at 4 a.m. to get my husband's breakfast, and at half-past five I went down to feed the fowls, and found they were gone—the staple had been wrenched out of the door and bent, and had been put back bottom upwards, and the lock was upside down—I had six hens and a cockerel, and all but one hen were gone—they were worth twenty shillings—I have seen the fowls the prisoner was found carrying; I have the wings here; I am quite sure they were ours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Crane, and live at 37. Nelson Street, Canning Town—the prisoner is my nephew; he married my daughter, and lived with me—they occupied the front room up and the back room down—he was employed at Mr. Lisle's sugar refinery—they had two children, the eldest was a boy named Joseph, one year and nine months old; the youngest was a girl, three weeks old—the boy Joseph had been ill for fifteen weeks with consumption of the bowels, he died on 14th March—on the 13th March the prisoner came back from his work about four o'clock—he was very fond of both the children—he nursed the boy a good deal—when he came back at four he had his tea in the usual way, just the same as he always had—about eight I was in the back kitchen with the prisoner's wife and Mrs. Turnbull—Mrs. Wood went upstairs—after that I heard screams of "Mother!"—Mrs. Turnbull went up and I followed as quickly as I could—when I got into the room Mrs. Turnbull had the baby Nelly in her arms—I did not notice anything about her—I went for Dr. Holton, and he followed me, we got back about a quarter to eight—the child died at a quarter to eleven the same evening—about four next morning I was sitting up with the boy Joseph in the prisoner's room, Mrs. Turnbull, and my daughter, and my son William were in the room at the time—the prisoner was lying on the bed with his clothes on—he rose up and said he would have to give himself up for what he had done—we asked him what he had done, and he said he had hit his child on the head with the poker—I asked him what he had done it for, he said he must have been mad at the time—the doctor came again next morning—I heard the prisoner speak to the doctor, and also when Sergeant McEvoy asked what was the mark on the side of the child's head, the prisoner said he had done that—he was asked what with, he said, "With the poker"—my daughter said something to me, and I went upstairs and found this poker in my box; I gave it to the sergeant.</p>

Lisle's; he would sometimes go to his work at two and three in the morning, and work till about the same time next day—sometimes he would not have more than a few hours' sleep in the night,</p>

On the 14th March, about 9 p.m., I went to 37, Nelson Street; I saw the prisoner on the ground floor; I went with him to the room upstairs, and there saw the dead bodies of the two children—I noticed a mark on the youngest—I said, "What caused that"—I did not say that to anyone in particular—the prisoner and Mrs. Crane were in the room—the prisoner said, "I did that, I hit her with the poker last night; I don't know why I did it; I could not help it"—I said, "That is a serious statement to make, you should be careful"—I then asked Mrs. Crane where the poker was—she made some answer—the prisoner's wife then came in, and I put the same question to her—in consequence of what she said, Mrs. Crane went upstairs to her own room and came back with the poker—the prisoner said, "That is the poker"—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I have made a special study of the subject of insanity—I was desired by the Solicitors to the Treasury to see the prisoner—I saw the depositions in the case before I examined him—I saw him in Holloway Prison on the 21st March in Company with Dr. Gilbert—when I first saw the prisoner I saw that he was a man of low type of head, nothing very notable, except a peculiarity about the pupil of the eye, which is very commonly met with in epilepsy, though not exclusively confined to epilepsy; it was so marked that I drew Dr. Gilbert's</p>

               <p>attention to it; it was not well marked, but it was there—his pulse was extremely irregular and intermittent, rather unnaturally slow—I examined him—I gathered from what he told me that he had had a fit in the previous January—from the account he gave it seemed pretty clear that it was an epileptic fit—he spoke of having had several attacks of giddiness since that period—it occurred to me that the fits of giddiness he spoke of were merely a minor form of epilepsy, known as <hi rend="italic">pettit-mal—</hi> he spoke of the illness of the child Joseph, and said how fond he was of the child, and spoke of his sleepless nights—he gave me no description of what took place on the night of this occurrence—he said that his wife went out of the room for a few minutes, not more than five minutes—at that time I had seen from the depositions what he had said; therefore I did not ask for any description; he intimated that he did it then, and he did not know why he did it, that it came over him to do it—his condition for the last two months, as well as his work, would tend to aggravate the condition of a man suffering from epilepsy—epilepsy manifests itself in various forms on different occasions, there is the more severe convulsive attack—I assume that he was also subject to the minor attacks that he spoke of as giddiness, and I think he was suffering from both—such an attack as <hi rend="italic">pettit-mal</hi> would be very brief, a moment or two, half a minute or less, and then it passes away—there is a loss of consciousness to a certain extent with those attacks—there was no evidence to enable me to say that he had such an attack on this night—all the facts of the case that have been mentioned, coupled with those I found, that there does seem to have been insanity in three generations of the family, would lead me to think that the act was a sudden impulsive act, one that was not in the least premeditated—I understood him to say that he had had three or four attacks of giddiness after the fit in January up to the 13th March—such attacks vary very much; there is no limit, they pass by insensible degrees into the more severe attack; as a rule recovery is very quick indeed from the minor attacks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I could not say that epilepsy is a form of insanity; it is closely allied to it, undoubtedly—I find that a large percentage of persons whose minds are affected are epileptic, and in the same family epilepsy and insanity are intermixed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, of 52, Deacon Street, Walworth—on 9th May the prisoner lodged there with his aunt, Theresa Heizenbazzle—they had two rooms on the top floor: a sitting-room, which was also used as a bedroom for the deceased, and a back bedroom used by the prisoner—I have known the prisoner three years and a half—he was addicted to intemperance at intervals; I saw him daily—he had been drunk for five weeks before 19th May, without an interval—he had been a teetotaller for the previous fifteen months—about Easter he was thrown out of employment—on the morning of 9th May, about twenty minutes past seven, he came home very drunk—I found him lying in the passage—I assisted him along the passage—I saw nothing more of him that day—about six in the evening I heard the old lady come home—about an hour afterwards I hear a noise on the top floor like the smashing of glass, and I heard the deceased call out, "I am shot," or "He has shot me"—I ran up at once, and saw her leaning against the wall on the first landing, bleeding from the mouth; she fell down, repeating the same words—I carried her downstairs into my parlour, and at once went for Dr. Waring, and brought him back within three or four minutes, she was then dead—I got a couple of constables and went with them up to the backroom, and there found the prisoner sitting and half lying on the bed; if anything, he was worse than he had been in the morning, as to drunkenness—we took him into the front room—he said to me, "What have I done? what is it all about?"—the policeman said, "Where is the revolver?"—he made no answer at first, the question was repeated, and he then said, in a lone tone, "In the back room"—I held him while the constable went into the back room and brought back the revolver.</p>

               <p>when in drink he was never excited or quarrelsome, quite the reverse, very quiet—just before this he was restless, going in and out continually—I could not say whether the noise I heard upstairs was one sound or two, it was so quick; I believe it was two—I don't suppose he knew what he did.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective M</hi>). About 9 <hi rend="italic">p. m.</hi> on 12th April, I was with Detective Otway in the Crown public-house, my attention was drawn to the prisoner by his behaviour to an old man who was very drunk—I recognised his description, went round to that compartment, took hold of his left hand, and said, "I want you, come outside"—we went out and I said, "I arrest you on suspicion of assaulting and robbing a woman in Orange Street"—he said, "You have made a mistake, I know nothing about knocking a woman about"—the prosecutrix was too ill to come to the station to identify him, but I took her in a cab next day, and the prisoner was placed with other men, and after about a minute she pointed to a man not the prisoner, and said, "That is something like him"—she then</p>

               <p>fixed her eyes on him for about a minute; the Inspector said, "That will do," and as soon as the prisoner moved, she said in a very excited manner, "That is him; I am sure that is the one, and I know him, too, by his trousers; he had a kind of blue scarf on that night"—remembering that the prisoner had a blue scarf on when I arrested him I felt in his pockets for it, and could not find it; I afterwards found it concealed under his waistcoat, and the prosecutrix recognised it as similar to the scarf he wore—he was then charged, and said, "It is all through you; I bought these trousers since this affair"—I said, "When did you buy them?"—he said, "About twelve months ago"—after the prosecutrix said, "That is him; I am sure that is the one," the prisoner said, "You have made a mistake, lady; you cannot identify me by these trousers, for I can prove I bought them since that affair"—the injuries which I am suffering from were inflicted in another case.</p>

I am a cab-master, of 23, Owen Street—I have known the prisoner nearly all his life—on 25th February I had an order to go to Leatherhead (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) to fetch a pony, and on the Monday following I cut this scarf in two and gave the prisoner half of it.</p>
