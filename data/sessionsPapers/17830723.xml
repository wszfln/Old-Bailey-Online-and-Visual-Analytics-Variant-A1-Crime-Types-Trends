               <p>I am a ticket porter, I was coming home between eleven and twelve on Thursday night the 15th, and I went into the ship and star in East Smithfield, for a pint of beer, after drinking my beer and coming out of the door, I saw the deceased standing with his back against the bar window, and there was a young fellow standing along-side of him, there was a little mob, and the two prisoners stood about a yard and a half distance, and Da Costa he rushed out from some of his countrymen, and struck the deceased with his fist, then the deceased and he fell to fighting; then the deceased knocked Da Costa down, and when he was down he kicked him three or four times, then the tall one came up and wanted to strike the deceased, and I would not let him strike him, I told him to stand off and give them fair play, after that, one of the prisoners, the little one, run away to the corner of White's-yard, just by the Three Crowns, and there he fell down again, but cannot say. I saw the deceased strike him, or whether the curb stones tripped him up; I went and picked him up, and said, come away home, you will get stabbed; the deceased and I went as far as the place called George-yard, about thirty yards from the place where Da Costa fell. Soon after, the two prisoners and two or three more Portuguese came after us with knives in their hands, that might be the space of three or four minutes, I cannot say; there was five in all, they had all knives, there was these two prisoners and three more, we continued to stand at the George-yard, we had not the time to go any farther they came so close after us, then the tall one asked the deceased, why he struck the little man, and why he did not give him his hat; the deceased said, he had not his hat, where was his; immediately after he said that, the deceased run away and they after him; I cannot say that I saw them stab him.</p>

               <p>Did you see whether Pinto had any knife in his hand at that time? - Yes, he had one in his hand down by his side, it was in his hand, I could only just see his hand and part of the blade of the knife.</p>
               <p>Court. How far did you see the deceased run? - I suppose it might be an hundred yards, I do not know where he went to afterwards, he went out of my sight, and when the prisoners came back they run up to a young man that is here; I went into a chandler's shop and there I bought a broom-stick, or else I should have shared the same fate; when they saw me take up a broom-stick they then run away immediately, I run down after them into a bawdy house, and they came back immediately, I went with this young fellow and his wife towards home; I went to his house where the deceased lodged, I did not see the deceased; in about a minute or two after he was brought to the door, I cannot tell by whom, and set down upon the step of the door; when he was sat there he said to the landlord, Swinney, dear Swinney, I am a dead man, I shall not trouble any one long; I said, the man looks as if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230005"/> was stabbed, and turned his jacket over one side and unbuttoned his waistcoat, and on his left side over his trowsers, his bowels hung out, he was lifted in, and they applied to Doctor

             there? - I cannot say I saw him there, the prisoner Da Costa had a knife as well as the rest, I immediately applied to an officer to get a warrant, as soon as ever I saw the man's bowels; I got an officer named Wilkinson, and I and Wilkinson and the landlady of this young man, went to the prisoner's lodgings, and somebody asked who was there, and would not open the door without an officer; when the door was open, the officer asked, where were the two men that had run in there, then we went up stairs, and there was Pinto getting into bed, and the little one was under the bed; getting Pinto out of bed this knife fell from under the pillow at the head part of the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pinto. It was none of my knife.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any blood at all, either on the blade or on the handle? - None that I could perceive, and when we went to pull the little one from under the bed, that spear lay alongside of him, then they were apprehended and taken away to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Kevett. You said just now, that after Da Costa got up he run across the way and laid down again, did he fall down by stumbling against the stones, or did he appear to lay down? - I cannot say which way he got down, I saw he was down all at once, but whether he fell down or laid down I do not know.</p>
               <p>In what position was he then? - He was on his side.</p>
               <p>Which side did he lay on, when he was over the way? - I think it was his right side.</p>
               <p>Did he attempt to get up before the deceased came? - I did not see him attempt to get up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Pinto. There was a great number of people in the street, and he did not strike the deceased, somebody else must strike him, for if he had done it he should not have gone to have laid himself so quietly down in his bed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That was because he called me a Portuguese dog.</p>
               <p>The deceased staid as if he was considering whether he would strike or not, or whether he would take the affront; Da Costa stood up, and the rest of the Portuguese came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230007"/> round him and told him not to quarrel, and told him that if the little man was not in liquor he would not quarrel; they got the little one out at the door, and attempted to keep him out, but he made an attempt to strike the deceased in the passage; the deceased said, for why did he want to rump me?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. That is a bye-word in the country, meaning to beat.</p>
               <p>They got the man out a second time, and persuaded the deceased to go out quietly, and told him if he would go they would guard him that the little one should not hurt him; just as he came out of the door this little one jumped at him and struck him, the deceased struck the little man twice in return to the blow he struck him; at the second blow Da Costa fell to the ground upon his face and groaned very much, the alarm for him was pick him up, I heard the words pick him up, Da Costa run from one side of the way to the other, and the Portuguese run after him, the others made their escape and were coming home, the two Portuguese in company followed the deceased, as if watching to see where the deceased was going to, they were neither of the prisoners, they followed him to the corner of George-yard, and in about half a minute two men came up and asked the deceased about the hat, they were neither of the prisoners, immediately there came up three more Portuguese that had been in company, they had been away and came with knives, the little one says to the deceased, why you took my hat, and called him a very bad name, called him a bloody thief, and said he had stole his hat, the prisoners are two of the men, the deceased said I have no hat, where is mine? I looked towards the side of the little man, and I thought I saw by his hands moving something of a knife, I made myself sure and looked a second time, I saw him trying to hide the weapon behind my apron, I cried out immediately they had got knives, I had no sooner spoke the words but the deceased was stabbed; I did not see him stabbed.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the tall one near you at the same time? - Yes Sir, whilst I was looking at the dagger that the little one had, the tall one stabbed him, I was standing between the deceased and the little man, and the tall man was facing him, the weapon the little man had seemed to be the point of a dagger, and I halloo'd out they have got knives, the deceased run as soon as he was stabbed to a very great degree, I attempted to run after him, but I lost sight of the deceased in a very little time, as I was coming back the Portuguese were returned, I met the little one with the dagger in his hand, I went to see if I could find the deceased at his lodgings, but he was not come home, in the mean time the deceased came up and walked very solid, as if unhurt, I stood at the door and said, thank God here is the young man coming unhurt, as he came up to me me I said,

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, The first of the transaction seems to have been when the deceased spoke to Da Costa in the alehouse, and according to the account gave by Wyatt, the deceased accosted him in a civil way; this is very material; after the deceased had gone across the road with Hardy, some of them tell you that there was a conversation between the Portuguese in their own language, then the Portuguese came across the road with knives in their hands; that evidence is given by two witnesses; now with respect to the Prisoner Da Costa, very much will depend on what is your opinion of the transactions of that moment, for at first he does not appear to have had the possession of any weapon till he came across the street, and it is clear that he gave no blow; so that as to this unless you should be satisfied that at the time of that conversation which passed between the Portuguese, and immediately after, when they all crossed with knives in their hands; unless you are satisfied that at that time they all went across the street, with one common design of stabbing the deceased, there will be no ground to impute the crime of murder to the prisoner Da Costa. It is clear that the deceased got his death by the wounds which he received from the hand of Pinto; he was the person that actually stabbed him, the other was present, and if he was acting on the same design, and crossed the road with the same view, he and every person acting with that design, are as guilty as the man that gave the blow; therefore it is extremely nenecessary for you to be satisfied whether he was actually engaged in that design or no: with respect to the other prisoner, his case stands on very different grounds, the boxing was over, but even if it had continued, it is a very violent conduct taking out a knife and stabbing a man, but especially by a man that had not been struck himself; the deceased had crossed the street, and left the Portuguese without any apparent intention or design of returning to them again; the Portuguese crossed the street with knives, and it is material to see how they conducted themselves when they did so cross, for all of them came with their knives and weapons secreted as much as they could: The first prisoner Pinto is proved to have had his hand down by his side, and the weapon in a great degree hid; one witness says he saw only just the point of it; then when he comes over, what is his conversation to the deceased; here had been no fresh quarrel, no violent heat, but Pinto accosts him by asking where is the little man's hat; this is a cool remonstrance, and if you think made use of to watch the opportunity of that purpose which he intended, shews that it was done with a malicious view, and his conduct shews that he could not do it with any other view. If you should be of opinion that the other went over the street with the same design, he is then guilty of the same offence; he went over with the weapon in his hand, and had it secreted, and endeavoured to hide it under the woman's apron: You must observe also the conduct of the deceased, for I cannot help feeling myself for the generosity of an English sailor, even in the hour of death; at that moment he seems to be extremely anxious to distinguish between the two prisoners, and peculiarly so that the prisoner Da Costa should not suffer; he said Da Costa had fought him fairly, and that he was not at all accessary to his death. This is evidence out of the mouth of the deceased, and besides that it is perfectly clear he did not give any blow, whatever was his intention: therefore, unless you are of opinion that he crossed the street with the same intention that the other prisoner did, you will distinguish in the verdict that you give between the men.</p>
               <p>Jury. We beg to ask the Surgeon whether he thinks the other wounds were given with the same instrument with which the wound was given that was the occasion of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230009"/> the death? - It is impossible to distinguish, they were so very slight they might have been given with the point of a knife.</p>

Nothing therefore remains for me, but to advise you to make the best use of this short interval, and to pronounce the sentence of the law; which is, that this Court doth adjudge, that you

               <p>How were the ladies dressed? - They had their hair just-dressed; and had large hoops on, one was in pink silk; they were in quite a different stile to what they are now; Richardson had a blue coat, round hat, and a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>Who had you that Carmelite silk from?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230011"/> - From Mr. Proctor, and here is two pieces tied up in the same handkerchief with the piece that was sold them, this is a tobine, and the other is a Peruvian tissue, at the same time they were in the shop, I observed the Peruvian tissue on the counter, and I saw the tobine about an hour before they were there; all these silks were delivered to me by Proctor tied up in in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the handkerchief? - I never saw it before as I know of.</p>
               <p>Can you say positively that the other three pieces that were lost was your master's property? - I am upon oath, they are Mr. Moore's property, here is one Mr. Evans who will likewise swear one piece to be Mr. Moore's property, and the tissue has my own mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When they came in was this woman, who is not here, there at the begining? - Yes, she and Hill came in together first, I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the person who bought this silk, consulting that woman about the number of yards that would be necessary to have? - King asked me.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand that woman was the mantua-maker of one of these young women? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>To whom did you deliver this silk that was bought? - Hill had it.</p>
               <p>Was not it delivered to the mantuamaker? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that woman say, I cannot purchase it till my mantua-maker comes, and was not it settled between the mantua-maker and her, how many yards would be necessary? - No, Sir, she settled it herself, she said, she would have a yard and three quarters, turning round to Hill and the other woman, and said, she always liked to have enough and to spare.</p>
               <p>Did not you see it delivered after it was paid for to that woman? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor hear her say any thing about her making it up soon? - I did not upon my oath, I have never seen the other woman from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Did not you charge that other woman, when you stopped Hill, did not you say, that tall woman, the mantua-maker has taken some silk? - I asked her what was become of the tall woman, because I had reason to suspect them all; I told her so at the time.</p>
               <p>I believe standing on the opposite side of the way you may see both the doors of the publick house? - Yes, I saw both doors, I saw Richardson coming out of one door, and King coming out of the other.</p>

               <p>Then they could not escape your notice by coming out of one door or the other? - Not at that time they could not.</p>
               <p>You went immediately? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had they any opportunity of going any where in that house? - They might go through the house.</p>
               <p>Could they go to any other part of the house? - One of them might run up stairs.</p>
               <p>Why you saw them instantly? - Before I got two yards from Hill I observed them coming out, and that was the time I gave her to the care of Mr. King, it was some time before Mr. King took care of her.</p>
               <p>Did these people desire to be searched? - Yes, Hill desired to be searched, but said, she would not go to Proctor's; she gave no reasons.</p>
               <p>I believe it is a house where all the basket people use? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am master of the Unicorn, I recollect the prisoners on Saturday the 21st of June, I perfectly recollect their coming to my house very decently dressed, there was another woman came with them, they staid a very short time, they were in the parlour a very short time, our kitchen it up one pair of stairs, the man and the two women at the bar went out, they left the fourth woman behind.</p>
               <p>How long might Richardson, and King, and Hill be absent? - I cannot be sure, we are generally much hurried on a Saturday, I never saw the prisoners come back at all.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the apprehension of Hill, and the taking of Richardson and King by some of the trades-people? - I heard the alarm, it was in view of my house, I do not recollect Richardson and Hill coming back before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the fourth woman going up stairs to the kitchen? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Was that bundle delivered by you to Wallis? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Where did you find it? - Upon the one pair of stairs near the screen that stands by the fire, and that stands upon steps two or three inches high; I went up for something I do not recollect what, I saw this bundle behind the screen, that was when I heard the alarm, and the people were at the next door at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any of the women go up stairs? - I was told that the woman that was absent did go up stairs, but do not know that any of these people were up stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Are you sure that the two women and the man at the bar did not go up stairs? - I believe to the best of my knowledge they did not.</p>
               <p>They went away leaving the third woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no alarm at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, Here is no evidence whatever to fix the prisoners with stealing this silk, it is circumstantial evidence to prove that this silk which was lost, was soon after found in the possession of either of the prisoners at the bar or some of them, and that they were privy to the theft, then they must have shewn how they came honestly by it, here is no evidence whatever that the prisoners at the bar had the silks lost in their possession, because though the silks that were lost in this shop, were found in this house; it does not appear that the prisoners, or either of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230013"/> were up stairs where these were found, there is no evidence to fix them, or any of them.</p>

               <p>I live at Paulin's and sometimes serve in the shop, I remember the three prisoners on Saturday the 21st of June, I came into the shop after I had dined, and found Mrs. Lillington serving these three people with black laces, knowing she had not dined I desired, her to go and leave them, and I would finish serving them, I shewed them several black laces in the drawers, the white laces still remained in the window by the counter, I shewed them several black laces and reached down others, and continued shewing, among which were these black laces.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. You did not know any more but this one? - But this one happened to lay upon the top and is a very particular one, and upon seeing the card I saw Mr. Coates's private number and mark upon the lace.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you never seen any other lace of that same pattern? - I so seldom see any other lace but what I see in Mr. Coates's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230014"/> shop, that I do not think I have; I served the prisoner King with a quantity of lace, which she told me was to trim a cloak; I told her it was 2 s. 7 d. a yard, but as it was a remnant, I let her have it for 2 s. 6 d. she paid me 15 s. they appeared to be in a very great hurry to be gone, it is usual to follow people to the door, I saw them either run or walk very fast up Tavistock court, the short one desired the tall one and the man to go to the coach, and she would soon follow after, and they all went up the court together, either walking or running very fast; I put by the laces after they were gone, I came and spoke to Miss Lillington, who had before served them, I thought they were strange people, because they called me my dear, in a very sociable way, the man did; I did not trouble myself any more, I put the laces by as soon as we found they were lost, I went and took the drawer out, which had not been taken out since; as Mr. Coates was out, he heard such people had been taken up, and upon looking at the laces, he knew they were ours, but sent us to look at them, I went to look at them, it was two or three hours after I saw them at the Round-house; Mr. Hemmings, the Round-house keeper, shewed them to me, I believe the prisoners were taken away then: I kept the laces ever since, they are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You do not know whether there are not several laces of the same pattern? - There may.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to say, that is the only pattern in London? - No, I know the mark upon the card: we do not usually sell a card.</p>
               <p>Suppose there were half a dozen yards, she takes away the card, does not she? - We do not usually do so.</p>
               <p>You lay no store by your cards? - Certainly not, but we do seldom give things that are marked.</p>
               <p>Other goods may go on that same card with the mark on it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Jury. Does the mark on the card corroborate with the mark that you sell by? - Yes, Sir, it is the mark we sell by.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. That card would not do for a different lace? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. But, if I buy lace I may have a card with it? - Yes, there is a seal at the end of every card, till it is cut, and several of these laces were uncut, and have the seal on, and the number of yards on the piece which answer to it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about these being Mr. Paulin's laces? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. These laces were delivered to you by another person? - Yes, Sir, by Hemmings, (the laces deposed to by Mr. Coates) three of them are marked with my own hand-writing, the other by one of my people that I know, I saw them after they were lost at the Round-house, I was told there was some laces taken out of the necessary; I went immediately to the master of the Round-house, and had an Order for them to be taken out, they were very filthy at the time I saw them, the master of the Round-house shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>To Branch. Look at the quantities, and tell me the value of the whole? - Twenty-one yards of black lace, and thirty-one yards that has been put in water, and marked 5 s. 3 d. per yard, that is the selling price; the next is marked upon the card 27 yards, that is a little shrunk, put down 26, the selling price of this is 4 s; the white is shrunk from 15 to 14. about 3 s. 4 d. the selling price of the other is 15 yards, at 5 s.</p>

               <p>Was you or was you not alarmed when he made this charge on you? - The first time I was very much, I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Did you part with your money on account of that alarm? - No, Sir, for the sake of my character, that he should not scandalize my character.</p>

               <p>Court. We do not ask you his character Sir, do you remember the prisoner at the bar? - Perfectly well, I never saw him till the morning he was taken before the magistrate, I was in a little room adjoining the Chaplain's room, having my hair dressed; the prosecutor brought in that note to me, and desired me to look at it, I desired him to wait half an hour or so, as I was quite in a dishabille or else I would have flew out myself.</p>

               <p>The first time I ever saw that gentleman was one night; I was centry in the Engine court in the Park, that was in June; he came to me just as I had come on centry at ten; he asked me what it was o'clock, I told him, he said it was rather a wet night, and we began to discourse about one Mr. Plumbtree that he had known, and I was there about fourteen or fifteen months; he stopped with me till very nigh twelve, till the relief came in; he asked me to come in, as soon as I came off centry, and he would give me some ale, saying a soldier's pay was very little, and he thought it would be very acceptable; I went in and sat with him till very near two; he made a fire, and gave me some ale and some bread and cheese; he said he must go to bed, he told me to call any time I came on guard, I was welcome to some ale, but to call between ten and eleven at night, for if I came there in day time there was somebody there; and he had generally the evenings to himself, I accordingly bid him a good night, and said I would call again as he had behaved so well to me, I thought it very good natured of the gentleman; I called about three or four nights after, and knocked at the door, and he came to the door, and he said, ah! is it you, how do you do, you may walk in; he asked me to sit down, he brought out a bottle of ale; he put his hand in his pocket and gave me a breast buckle: after that, he said he would put a faggot on the fire-place, and make a fire; I sat with him till between one and two, and then I said I would go home, I told him where I lived; he said he would contrive for me to lay there all night; I said I was much obliged to him; he said, if you will undress yourself I will make the bed; but you must get up early in the morning; I went to bed, and after I had been in bed a little while, he began to act as a Sodomite to me; the same as a man would, if he had a woman in bed with him: I immediately jumped up, I asked him if he gave me this breast buckle and this beer, and asked me to come in at this late hour of the night, to intice me in the same situation of life that he lived in himself; he said, no, he did not try to intice me at all; he begged and prayed he might not have his character exposed; I swore I would have him taken up; I said at last when he begged so very hard, I would not; he said, for my goodness he would make me a present; he said, says he, I will give you three guineas, I will give you two to night, and at half past eight to-morrow morning, I will give you another guinea; he said he had no more than two in the house, and he took them out of a corner cupboard in a pretty large room; and, if I would come in the morning, he would give me the other; I said mind, I do not demand any thing of you: In about a month I came again, and brought that piece of paper with a young fellow that was with me; I have a man here that will shew the breast buckle that he gave me, (The breast buckle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230019"/> produced by

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentleman, there was a case of this kind tried before me some time since, and on that case it was the unanimous opinion of all the Judges of England, that that case as proved, amounted to a robbery: To constitute the crime of robbery, it is essential, that money should be taken from a person, in the presence of another, or against his will, and under such threats and circumstances, as may induce a reasonable man to part with his money through fear; in the case I mentioned, there were different circumstances from the present, because it was there sworn by Mr. Fielding, that he apprehended danger to his person, if he had not delivered the money at the same time; there was another charge like this where the fear went only to loss of character, and in the discussion of that case, it was the opinion of the Judges, that any threat which induced a man to part with his money against his will, was such as would constitute the crime of robbery: Now in this case you are to consider, that Miller, according to his own account has acted a very indiscreet part, for he says, that he never saw the prisoner before; and yet he is such a dupe, according to his own account, that from a conversation that happened in the course of a few minutes, while he was lighting his candle, he thought fit to ask this man into his master's apartment, and there to treat him with bread, cheese and ale. (The learned Judge then stated the rest of the evidence, and the Prisoner's defence as before mentioned, observing there was a remarkable circumstance in the defence, for the prisoner says, when the prosecutor offered him a present; he told him, Mind I do not demand any thing of you.)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, upon the whole, the material question is, whether you are upon this evidence satisfied; first that Miller speaks truth; and then whether upon the facts he has stated, you are convinced that he parted with this money against his will, and through fear of an injury that he might receive to his character from the prisoner. If you are of that opinion, you will find him guilty; if you think otherwise, you will acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Corporal. Was the prisoner ever in the black hole? - Yes, a little before that time, I forget the day, I think he was kept there forty-eight hours.</p>

               <p>On Sunday June 29, about a quarter after eleven at night, I was robbed by one man, he accosted me in very illiberal terms, called me thief, and villain, and ruffian, he damned me a good deal, he carried me from the pavement under the rail, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230020"/> took me by the collar; he said something when he first approached me, but I do not know what it was, to the best of my recollection it was come this way; he pulled my watch out of my sob, I gave him my purse out of my right-hand breeches pocket, and he searched my left-hand breeches pocket, and my two waistcoat pockets.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your purse? - Three guineas and some loose silver; I lost a gold watch, two red cornelian gold seals, one was a cypher, a gold watch-hook, a gold watch key and a metal seal, a sham cornelian, and a steel watch chain.</p>
               <p>How long did you keep under the rails? - Between two and three minutes.</p>
               <p>Was any body passing by at this time? - Not a soul.</p>

               <p>Do you know him now? - No.</p>
               <p>Has your property been found again? - Yes in part, the watchmaker has the watch, and one of the Justice's men has the purse.</p>

               <p>I went to search the prisoner's lodgings, No. 12, Castle-court, in the Strand, on Monday the 30th of June, when we first went in there was a lady in the apartments that seemed very busy about the feet of the bed, I desired her to walk into the dining room, and sent a person with her while we searched the bed-chamber; in searching a trunk we found this pistol, loaded with powder and ball; in searching further we found a coat with a key of the street door in the pocket, we then took the lady up to Bow-street, and returned a second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose coat that was? - It was in Mr. Atkins's lodgings, we came back and searched again and found nothing, the person that was with me went down to the necessary, to see if there was any thing there, I walked into the ground floor that belonged to the people of the house, and saw this box on the ground there; it then came fresh into my memory, that when I put the lady into the dining room, I had seen that box in that room; in that box we found these three purses.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that that box was in the room when you first went into the house? - My Lord, I am confident that a box of that size and shape was in the room; I know nothing of the apprehending of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Best. Did you apprehend the prisoner? - He came to my house after Mr. Chadwicke, and I stopped him, to know how he came by it, he said, he had it of one Mr. Hett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. He went to Mr. Chadwicke's house, before he came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he came after Mr. Chadwicke, when he came to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not hesitate at all, he followed him to the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The purse deposed to by Mr. Luard.)</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230023"/>Do you know where the prisoner was the night before? - He was at home at half after eleven, in his bed.</p>
               <p>What time did he get up the next morning? - I carried him a pint of ale and a pint of beer, and I asked her if I should put my chain up, that was on Sunday night; I have two keys of the door, one he had himself, and one I kept; the Justice's man has one key; the gentleman never asked me for the key, but I gave it to him one night in case he staid out.</p>
               <p>So he kept a key every night by your consent? - Yes, Sir, I offered it to him, he did not ask me for it.</p>

               <p>What time was he up next morning? - He got up between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Did he stay long in your house after he got up? - I know he breakfasted in the house, I dare say he went out by twelve, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You are sure, you say, that he was in bed by half after eleven at the furthest? - I am sure of that, for I carried her up a pint of porter, and she desired me to bring up a pint of ale, for says she, we shall mix it, says I, is Mr. Atkins come home, and she said, he was in bed; I did not see him, but I heard him cough in his bed, I never saw any thing of him, but like a gentleman, he kept regular hours.</p>

               <p>On Sunday evening before I was taken, I was walking in the Park, and another gentleman; and I was tapped on the shoulders by another gentleman, I turned about, and it was a Mr. Hett whom I immediately accosted, and asked him where he had been these seven years past, he said, he had been in Ireland, I asked him some questions about an affair that had happened before, and he gave me a decisive answer, he told me that he went off to Ireland, that he was ashamed not to have sent to me, said, he was ashamed to borrow money and not be able to pay it he said, he lodged at the Swan with two Necks; I asked him if he had settled with the people of the house, he said, he had; I said, I wish you would pay me now; he said, he would settle with me in the morning; I asked him to breakfast with me at eleven, I then parted and went home; next morning at eleven o'clock I expected him to breakfast, he did not come, I waited a very short time, and I was determined to go down to Lad-lane, to see where he was; when I went about two streets from my lodgings I met him, I asked him his reason for disappointing me, in not coming to breakfast, he said, his hair-dresser did not come to him in time; so we walked on discoursing about indifferent things, he pulled out his purse, said I, that is a pretty purse, where did you get it, and he said, a lady in Ireland knitted it for him, I looked at it, and produced mine, I offered to change it, says he, I will give it to your wife, if you will give it her; we walked on, says I, can you give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230024"/> me any money, says he, I have a bill on a Lord in town, for 200 l. but he has put me off for a few days, and says he I have no other mode to give you some money than to dispose of my watch, I knew the debt was a bad one, and for my own sake I took the watch, which I certainly should not have done from any other gentleman; he told me he bought it of Mr. Best, in Cornhill, says I, if you will go there yourself he will give you a better price for it, says he, you will do it better, I shall be ashamed; I consented to do so, I went down as far as Cornhill, and just by Cornhill I went into a shop to enquire for Mr. Best, I told the gentleman my business; I shewed him the watch, he asked me what I wanted for it, I said, twenty-five guineas; he said, he would shew me the way down to Mr. Best's house; I went into a silver-smith's shop, and I asked this gentleman to buy the watch, Sir, says he, will you shew it me; I saw him go out, and I immediately supposed, in my mind, that he was gone to the maker, I went to Mr. Best's shop myself, Sir, says I, this gentleman has shewn you a watch, I told him, I had a commission from a gentleman to dispose of it, Sir, says he, a gentleman has been robbed of it last night, says I, the gentleman that gave it to me is now standing at the corner of the street, and I requested of him several times to let me go out, he would not, nor would he send anybody there; I sent a constable to Lad-lane to enquire for him, but there is no account of him, I am informed, he is gone Ireland.</p>

               <p>Do you know all the connections of this young man? - Very well, very reputable connections and family in Ireland, they are all there and I am the only person in this country to whom he could apply; he is a very distant relation of mine, but so distant that I cannot trace it, nor my father.</p>
               <p>What general character has this young gentleman at the bar? - I never knew any wrong of him; he came last November with a letter from Ireland, and introduced himself to me by that means; he was in the horse in Ireland, in the blues, five or six years ago he sold out; he wished to go abroad.</p>
               <p>What is his general character? - I never knew any harm of him, he never visited me much, nor was I ever out of the house with him, all his connections are in Ireland, every one, he has a brother, very respectable uncles and the most reputable kind of relations.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You observe, that from the time the prisoner went out in the morning he never returned at all, then how could this purse be found locked up in the box; it is therefore impossible that he could receive the purse from Hett; that is a very strong and a very pointed contradiction; a robbery was committed late on Sunday night, and the property is found on the prisoner the next morning totally unaccounted for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, it was in the Park when I asked Mr. Hett for money that he gave me the purse, it was in the Park on the Sunday night, I made a mistake in that respect.</p>
               <p>Court. Then that is directly contrary to what you said before.</p>

The things I found on Edson were all mine; the shirt was by him, he laid on his face over the ditch; and I found this at the place where they knocked me down, he said he was the wrong person, he knew nothing about it, when he came into the Bull, he said where you got me, you'll find the rest of the things;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230027"/> they went back and looked, and got the bundle out of the pond and his hat.</p>

               <p>Did you find any thing in the ditch where Edson first lay? - A shirt and a piece linen.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of view had you of Spong the other prisoner? - As he run past me, and as he turned again, threatening to blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Was it late? - It was break of day, I had a full prospect of him when he turned again, he was only the other side of the ditch, I am sure he is the man; I described Spong before I saw him again; I went with Mr. Warrington to look for the things, and we found a hat and a coat in a pond, and a pair of stockings between the hedge and the pond.</p>
               <p>How far is the hedge from the pond? - About fourscore yards from the pond, they were laying in the field near there, we returned the things to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>What Justice were they carried before? - Justice Blackborrow.</p>
               <p>(The Court ordered Dinmore and Redgrave to leave the Court till they were called.)</p>
               <p>Court to Parrott. After you were first examined at the Justice's, and did not positively swear to the man; had the Justice's people any conversation with you afterwards? - They told me to find him out among a number of people.</p>
               <p>When did you look at him afterward to be more sure? - In the space of five minutes.</p>
               <p>During that time, and in the room, what conversation had you about the prisoner with Redgrave and Dinmore? - They said nothing to me, only they asked me if I knew the prisoner, and I said it was the same person.</p>
               <p>At the time they told you there was a reward of forty pounds, if the men were convicted? - Nothing at all, nobody told me any such thing.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You will swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you first know there was a reward? - I never knew any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230028"/>You know it now? - I do not know any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. WARRINGTON sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came to my house the 13th of this month, I keep the Bull at Holloway, they called me up, and Joe said, he had been robbed, and Parrott and I went to look for the things.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear the little prisoner say any thing about the things before you went out? - Not a word about any thing where they were, he denied being the person, I went with Parrott with his direction, but I did not hear Edson say a word about where the things were, I found the hat and the coat in the pond, and this handkerchief, and a pair of stockings just over a ditch where the prisoner had made an escape over.</p>
               <p>Court to Parrott. Before you went out to look for the things, did you hear Edson say any thing about them? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Shuker. Are you positive that Edson told you that you would find the things where you found him? - He said to me and a Sailor, that is a waiter at Mr. Warrington's, says he, if you look where you found me you will find the things.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. How long were the two prisoners with you to the time they left you? - The time, I suppose, could not be above two minutes, it was just break of day.</p>
               <p>Then there was but a bad light? - I could see to pick up a pin, it was quite light, I was quite sober, I am sure of the persons of both the prisoners, I am equally sure of Spong, as of the other, if I had seen him among a thousand I should have had no doubt.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, he is indicted for stealing a knocker, he did not steal that knocker, although he was in all probability, attempting to steal it; in the present state, the knocker was affixed to the freehold, and therefore no felony could be committed; and as to the knob that was taken off, that is not mentioned in the indictment, therefore you must acquit the prisoner.</p>

             of York, bookseller; I went to Sampson Wright, and got a search warrant, and as soon as we had taken the man, he owned the whole affair, and pointed out a number of books that were my property; we found him at a house in Round Court, I was present, and asked him to point out my property, desiring him particularly to point out none but what was mine; the constable then seized him. I told him I have you at last, for says I, you have had no mercy on me, you have robbed me considerably; I had sufficient now to convict him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him it was better for him to say where the rest were, because you wanted to get the rest? - He cried out for mercy, and the children cried for mercy; I never made him any promise whatever.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing more to him? - I do not recollect I did; he said he stole these books from me while he worked for me.</p>
               <p>(The books produced.)</p>
               <p>- ATKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>These are the books, and the prisoner pointed out several more; these I picked up and sealed in the presence of Mr. Cadell; I went to the house and enquired if Mr. Robins was at home, the child said, yes, the wife ran down stairs, I said, is your spouse at home, she said yes; I ran after her, and there was nobody but the man; he said to Mr. Cadell, for God's sake Mr. Cadell, have mercy upon me for the sake of my family, and I will shew you the books; I came down before Mr. Cadell; I believe it was after Mr. Cadell said, we have got you; he took down three or four large piles of books, and then he went to the other side; he took out of his pocket his watch, and his pocket book, I took that, he said there was an account of Mr. Cadell's books.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I believe he thought that would have satisfied Mr. Cadell? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>He took down almost all the books? - He did, and Mr. Cadell said, if they are not mine, I will not take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cadell. There was one book that was not bound as I bind my books, and I objected to taking it, and he said, that is yours, for I took some unbound, and bound them afterwards.</p>
               <p>- EVANS sworn.</p>
               <p>Passing through Round-Court, I saw some books which I suspected were Mr. Cadell's property. I saw two books which I had seen at Mr. Cadell's house; I bought them, and paid 2 s. for them, they are Sherlock's Sermons, I shewed them to Mr. Cadell; (Mr. Cadell deposed to the books) I bought them of the prisoner's wife; I then went before the Magistrates in Bow-street, and I returned back with a search warrant to the prisoner's house; the moment he saw Mr. Cadell, he begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take so much notice of the books to know them again? - I have frequently dined at Mr. Cadell's house, and had seen them there repeatedly, there is writing in the front page, in a handwriting that I can swear to.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Mr. Cadell promissed me he would not hurt me, if I would give up the property, and I did so immediately.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who all gave him a very good character, and said he had a wife and four or five children.</p>

             told me, there had been a robbery done in the Willow walk, he said he knew the man that did the robbery, we went round to a great many public houses in our neighbourhood, we passed by his lodgings; but we did not call there, we waited some little time together at the bottom of Pye-street, while we was standing consulting there, a hackney coach came up the street, and the coach stopped, and this man at the bar came out, says Peachey, that is the man; but he has changed his coat, we found nothing on him, he went into a house next door to where he lodged, we afterwards went to search his room, but found nothing, we ran after him, he turned and presented a knife to me, and I secured him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council to Aldus. Do you know Roberts at all? - Yes, two or three years.</p>
               <p>What is she? - She is a servant to a girl of the town.</p>
               <p>You do not give her the best of characters? - I never heard any thing against her character.</p>
               <p>You have seen a good deal of this gold chain work? - I never saw one like that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council to Miss. Catley. You know this to be the card you say, why you have not the fellow of it? - I have not the fellow to it now, I had it some time, but I believe in want the same way that is gone, but that is not to the purpose now; I suppose you could not match it in England; I have sworn to it already in two places before I had the honour of coming here, I had five guineas sent from him, not to appear against him.</p>
               <p>Whether you was not going to take the prisoner as a servant in your family a few days before? - I was.</p>
               <p>You have known him for twelve years? - Yes.</p>

               <p>During that time you entertained that opinion of him, that you would have taken him for a servant? - Certainly Sir, I always took him to have been honest; the only fault I never found against him, was his drinking; I never could keep him sober, but for all that, that is my chain.</p>
               <p>You told us this was a present to you? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Has no other person any concern in it? - No, Sir, I am not a married woman.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been married? - Never, nor never intend it, I never shall; but I suppose I am not obliged to swear that Sir, am I; if the court say, I shall answer it.</p>
               <p>Court. I will explain to you how far it is material, the prisoner was indicted for stealing this property as belonging to you as a single woman, therefore, in point of law, if you are married, he must be acquitted? - I am not, nor I never was, nor I never shall.</p>
               <p>Court. We do not understand you as having sworn to the latter part, only as to what has passed, but not as to future.</p>

               <p>What was it you pawned with Mr. Aldus? - I do not know what it was, it was on a card, I should not know it again, it was on a Monday, I never carried any thing but once; Mr. La Roche asked me in Chapple-street, to go to a pawnbroker's, I told him yes, he bid me go to the pawnbroker's and bring him a guinea and a ticket, for he must have it out to-morrow; I asked him no questions, and he told me nothing; I should like to see the chain; I have been there too often for my interest; I have carried things several times since then, I believe it is seven weeks ago, I never carried any thing upon a card before to the best of my knowledge; I believe that is the man that desired me to carry it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever carry any thing of this kind, whether gold or not rolled upon a card, to Mr. Aldus's but once? - No, Sir, never but once.</p>
               <p>Then who did you get that thing from? - From a man they called Le Roche.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - I have known him a great while to have been a hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>That is the man is it not? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - I believe it is the man, he has not the same cloaths on; if I could swear to the man, I could not swear to the chain; Mr. Aldus said, it was what they put round gentlemen's waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether that is the man? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt but that is the man? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Are not you sure? - I would not be sure, he had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Then you only know him by his coat, upon your oath is that the man or not, go look at him? - I am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Was not the man you shewed to Aldus in the street, the man you got it from? - I did not shew him to Aldus; I asked him for a guinea and a ticket, he said, whose was it, I said, I will not tell you, I said, it is La Roche's, he went out and found him at the publick house, I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>(The chain shewn her.)</p>
               <p>This looks like it.</p>

               <p>Can you swear positively that is the man that struck you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barker. You swear very false, you said before the Justice nobody struck you.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he strike you with? - With a club stick.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts? - On the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Did either of them say any thing to you? - They stopped me and asked me what money I had about me, I told them not to use me or the woman ill, and they robbed us both, they robbed me of one guinea.</p>
               <p>Did you see either of them rob the woman? - I saw one of the men stoop and unbuckle her shoe.</p>
               <p>How soon after this robbery did you see them? - I saw them the Thursday following at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - It was rather inclinable to be cloudy, I think there was a moon.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of the other men? - I know them all three, I can swear positively that they were all three in company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said before the Justice that you did not know any of us.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could be sure of their features and countenance? - Yes, I am clearly positive that these were the three men that were in company that evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Be cautious, their lives may depend on what you swear now, how did they come to you? - Two seized me and one the woman, she was not more than two yards from me.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to a man's countenance at the distance of two yards at ten at night? - They were all together when they first came up; the Thursday following I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you know them immediately? - I was positive in my own breast that they were the men.</p>
               <p>Did you say so at the time? - No, my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>Were you asked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you sent for there? - The way I came there, I took it from the advertisement in the daily paper, that such and such people were taken on suspicion, and I being robbed, I attended there to see if there was any of my property.</p>

               <p>You did not say so at that time at the Justice's? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not say at the Justice's that these were the men that robbed you? - No, I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go away from the Justice's without saying so? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230038"/>How came that? - The reason was, though I was positive in my own mind, yet I rather chose to see them again before I made oath.</p>
               <p>When you saw them at the Justice's were they under examination a t that time about any other charge? - No, only the said

               <p>How long was it after this that you expressed yourself so, that you charged them with being the men? - At Hicks's-hall on Monday last, I never saw them only once at Bow-street from the time I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When we was all at the office under examination that gentleman was there, and they asked him in what manner he was stopped, and he said he could not tell, for they put his hat over his eyes.</p>
               <p>Is that true? - They did put my hat over my face after I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Did you say at the office that they put your hat over your face so that you could not swear to any of them? - No, I said they put my hat over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barker. The woman said the same, but the man said at the office that we held his hat before his eyes, and he could not distinguish one from the other, and they asked him if he could swear to us, and he said he could not.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I believe I did say I did not chuse to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Did you give any reason for it? - No, my Lord, no reason particular.</p>

               <p>Was you in company with them? - No, I was only by myself.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was you called upon to recollect it? - Only last night.</p>
               <p>How came you to know that this was the 7th of June? - To the best of my knowledge, it was the 7th of June, I know it was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>How long was it ago? - I believe it may be seven or eight weeks ago, I cannot positively say.</p>

               <p>What clothes had they on? - The man in the middle had a light coloured coat on, the right hand man had such a sort of coat as the man in the middle had on; Smith had a loose brown coat, I can swear to my gloves.</p>

               <p>What became of the other men? - They stood by, they did not speak to me; he did not touch me no further than taking the leg of mutton from me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen either of the men before? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing either of their faces? - I had a great while an opportunity of observing them all, I know two of them, I saw them the Monday following, it was not very light of dark.</p>
               <p>Did you know the men again which took the leg of mutton from you? - It was Gahagan, I saw him the Monday after at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230044"/> the Justice's, and knew him again, nobody pointed him out to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gahagan. This woman could not swear to me at the office, nor never a one of us.</p>

               <p>How near did the other man stand by you? - I was upon the King's highway, and they were upon the foot path.</p>
               <p>Do you know the other man again? - Yes, I cannot find him here to my knowledge, I cannot swear to one; the furthest one I do not swear to, but there were three in company.</p>
               <p>When you was at the Justice's you say you swore to your property; what property? - A handkerchief that they took from my husband.</p>
               <p>Did you find the bag again? - No, I could not, but the weight was seven pounds and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith.

               <p>I lost a mare on the 12th of June, she was turned out between six and seven in the evening, and the 13th she was up here, at Smithfield; I missed her the next morning; and Bradbury came to let me know the mare was at Smithfield, and after that he offered to give me ten pounds not to appear against his brother-in-law, who he said had bought her; he said, he would give me ten pounds, and give me the mare again; I sent for a constable and took him up, and had him before the Justice at Uxbridge, and he had two men to be bound for him; the next morning I came to see after my mare, and I found her with a lock round her foot, the same that she had on when she was turned out; I found her at this man's house.</p>
               <p>Court. How came Bradbury to apply to you? - He came down to let me know where the mare was, and then he said, a brother-in-law of his had bought this mare in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the mare been advertised and cried at Smithfield, before Bradbury came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- BRADBURY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a butcher, I know nothing otherwise than I saw the prisoner come with the intention to sell the mare at Sharp's alley, and Mr. Beaumont stopped her directly, on suspicion of being stolen; that was the 18th of June; I cannot particularly recollect the day, she had not been advertised then; Beaumont is a stable keeper in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Court. What had you to do with the mare? - I had nothing to do with the mare, only seeing her stopped, I never offered him any such thing as he says; he said, the mare was worth ten guineas, but that is more than anybody liked to give, and I never offered him ten guineas.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to Smith at all? - They said, I should he troubled about it.</p>
               <p>Why so? - On account as the mare was stopped in a yard where we live by; but it is an open yard, where the people put carts and things; it is a place called the coach yard.</p>
               <p>That is your yard? - No, only we have a place that joins the yard.</p>
               <p>Do not you buy horses to kill? - No, Sir, I never killed one, nor I never bought above two horses in my life; I never was in trouble in my life; I am sure I cannot tell how I came to be afraid of getting into trouble; the mare was offered to me for sale, by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>What bargain did you make for her? - The time we was going to buy her, he brought her down to our place, to sell her as a glandered mare; he said she was old.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you buy horses to kill? - Upon my oath, I never bought one to kill in my life; I took it round to one Mr. Bosworth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230047"/>What is he? - He is a neighbour of mine, not a brother-in-law, and while Bosworth was bargaining for it, Beaumont came down and took charge of it; the mare was hardly down in the yard.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a glandered horse? - I do not know what a glandered horse is.</p>
               <p>You were bargaining for this horse for Mr. Bosworth? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there when Mr. Beaumont came down? - He was.</p>
               <p>How came you to offer Smith the ten guineas? - I never offered him any such money.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him no money? - Yes, I have offered money, I cannot particularly say what; I cannot recollect what I was going to do directly.</p>
               <p>Recollect Sir? - I cannot, I do assure you, it might be a pound or two for ought I know.</p>
               <p>What did you offer him that money for? - I cannot tell, I never was in such a thing in my life, I suppose with intent to make it up.</p>
               <p>Make what up? - Because I should not come into trouble.</p>
               <p>What was you afraid of? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Have you any other witnesses here, that were present when the prisoner offered the horse to you for sale? - No.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell why you was afraid of coming into trouble? - I cannot tell; one and another told me I should come into trouble.</p>
               <p>What for? - Because I bid money for the horse.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you, you would be in trouble because the mare was found in your possession, and she was stolen? - She never was in my possession at all; I did offer money, but I cannot tell how much.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. What did this man say to you when he came first to you? - When he came to me first, he told me where the mare was, and after, he offered to give me ten pounds to make it up for a brother in law of his, on account of buying her; but this was the man that bought her, I told him I would not take it; here is a witness at the door that heard him.</p>

               <p>Court to Bradbury. Now, what do you say, have both these witnesses sworn falsely? - I do not say they have, I do not deny that I offered money, I cannot take upon myself to say how much, I have only one brother in law; I cannot recollect having said such words, I was so much confused, I never was in any trouble.</p>

               <p>You did not see the prisoner sell him? - No.</p>

            , Gardner, of Slough, in the county of Bucks.</p>
               <p>On Friday June 20, I came up to London, setting out at five o'clock in the morning, to walk up to see a father who was ill, and my having occasion to purchase a horse, which I wanted for a temporary use to go in a cart to bring up fruit to the London markets, the produce of my own garden, and what I might occasionally purchase, and being informed it was the market day at Smithfield, I repaired there, where I spoke to a man going through the market with a horse, I asked him the price thereof, he told me twenty shillings; I told him I thought the horse was glandered; he said that was not a found price, and asked me my use for the said horse, which I informed him was to bring up fruit from Slough twice or three times a week to the London markets, and should not have occasion for him above three months; after which time I must sell him again, which was my reason of purchasing one at so low a price; he then answered me, that if he was well kept, and going to grass a day or two in a week, he might answer my purpose for that time; I offered him sixteen shillings for the said horse, which he took and we parted.</p>
               <p>Some few minutes after a man came to me, and asked me, had I that horse to sell, I answered, no, but had just purchased it; he asked me what I had given for him, I told him sixteen shillings; he said, what might be my use for him, I told him to bring up fruit from Slough to the London markets: he said he was very bad with the glanders, and was certain he would not be able to perform or go through one journey, and was of no use but to kill for dogs flesh, I then asked the advice of one or two persons standing by, who answered the same; and said, that in the time of the market, I might purchase one for twenty-five or thirty shillings, which might answer my purpose, there being such brought into the market at this time of the year.</p>
               <p>I having then the said horse on my hands, had not cash enough to purchase another, without disposing of the said horse, which I was unacquainted with where to do; they informed me there was people who bought such horses to kill for dogs flesh, at Cow Cross, where I went to dispose of him, when a person came and took me up.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, If you can place a thorough reliance on the evidence; the property was found in the possession of the prisoner, and offered by him for sale very recently after it was stolen; but the prisoner is certainly intitled to the benefit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230049"/> of the contradictions arising out of the evidence against him, and there are as strong contradictions in this case, as there can be; for Smith, who seemed to speak fairly, he gives an account of Bradbury, in circumstances, that shew a consciousness of his being himself a guilty man, for there is no way of accounting for his offering so large a sum, without being conscious of having a share in that transaction; Smith's evidence goes strongly to impeach the evidence of Bradbury, who, upon the whole, appears a witness very little deserving of your credit.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. From the circumstances that have appeared in evidence, in this case, if you had not been examined as a witness, and a part of this case came out from your own evidence, I should certainly have directed you to have been detained, and indicted for buying this mare, knowing her to be stolen; I therefore recommend it to you, to be very careful in future how you conduct yourself; there is also another thing to which you might have been liable upon the evidence you have given in this case, and that is an indictment for perjury; you may therefore think yourself very well off that you are permitted to depart the court.</p>

               <p>You say, they asked you for money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then I suppose as you wanted money, you took and put it into that bag? - Yes, Sir, for paying prize money.</p>
               <p>Did you apply this money ever to any other uses? - No, no other uses.</p>
               <p>Where did you get the money? - I had the money at the bank.</p>
               <p>You reckon that you was answerable to Mr. Maylor for that money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any prize money due to them then? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Court. A man may steal his own property; if there had been prize money due to them, and they had demanded it with a pistol, I should have considered it as a robbery.</p>

               <p>I was collector at the turnpike gate, at the time this affair happened, I saw the prisoner hit Cooper with the whip; he refused to pay his toll, I stopped his horse, and told him that he should pay his toll, he was going to strike me over the head with the whip, it was a hunting whip, he did not strike me; on hearing this contest between the prisoner and me, Cooper came out, and took the whip out of his hands, and threw it into the toll-house; then he dismounted his horse, I tried to stop him from going in, I hit him twice in the face, he pushed me, and I fetched blood of him.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner, or yourself that struck first? - I believe it was myself; I saw no more till after the whip was delivered; on the delivery of the whip, the deceased was turning from him to go to the house, and he hit him over the head with it, as he was going in at the doorway, I did not see or hear what passed between them to occasion this; the blow was on the top of the head, I saw only one blow; the deceased reeled against the door way, and said for God's sake, stop him, for I do not know whether I am not a dead man or no; I never saw them together after that time; I did not hear them speak together; the prisoner was stopped, Mr. Flowers, a surgeon, was sent for to dress the wound of the deceased, he came and saw him in the toll house, I believe he bled a little in the face.</p>

               <p>Some blows passed, you struck him, but he did not strike you? - I do not recollect that he did, Cooper took his whip from him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his breaking his whip? - No, I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Before he seized the whip, had this man struck Cooper? - No.</p>
               <p>Then afterwards the whip was returned, and one blow was given? - Yes, he was taken before the Justice and discharged.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner strike Cooper, I have a lodging opposite the gate, I was up stairs and I heard a noise at the gate, I went down to see what was the matter, I saw the prisoner, his face was bloody; I said to him, you had better go about your business, you must pay the toll; he said they have a shilling of my money, I said then you must have your change; Cooper said here is his change, he brought out the change, and when he brought it out Cooper gave him a knock in the face; says I, why do you do that; says he, he struck me before; his whip was within doors, the prisoner said he would not have it; he gave it to him, he took it into his hand, as Cooper was going in doors again.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure you recollect this circumstance of the deceased being turned round when the blow was given? - I am very clear of it, it was directed to the side of his head, and he leaned against the door-post, he did not tumble down, I seized the prisoner and took him in doors; between the giving of the change, and the time of the blow on the head, I believe might be a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Was any thing else done then going into the house? - No, he gave him the change, then he went back to fetch the whip, and gave it him, and he struck him over the head; he did not take the whip directly.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of June, in the afternoon, I was called to see the deceased, and I found he had received a wound on the left side of the head, about two inches in length,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230053"/> which had not penetrated the scull; after having cleared it as was necessary, I perceived no symptom at that time that indicated any danger, but being taught that all wounds on the head are dangerous, and having from experience seen they are so; I was very particular as to my enquiries of his state of health, and I could not discover he had any of those symptoms which could indicate that any injury was done whatever, he had no sickness or giddiness, he never was stunned; I dressed his wound, and was in hopes every thing would go on well; but I think it was on the twelfth or thirteenth from the accident, that he complained of a stiffness in the joint of his jaw, he said, he believed it might proceed from a cold; the next day the stiffness increased, and his jaw was locked, and he had other symptoms of a locked jaw; he lived till the 16th: In order that there might be no possibility of being mistaken, I opened a portion of the scalp, in order to examine the bone, and there was no injury whatever, therefore we continued to treat him in the usual way that we do locked jaws, but he expired on the sixteenth: On the seventeeth, I opened the head, and there was no injury apparent.</p>
               <p>What occasioned his death? - I suppose he died of the locked jaw, which locked jaw I conceive might have proceeded from the wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Might it have proceeded from any other cause?</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any other apparent cause? - He was perfectly well in health.</p>

               <p>I am a magistrate, the deceased was before me after the assault, it apeared to me to be a quarrel between the people, and from the relation of Cooper, I found that the turnpike people were the agressors, Cooper struck him first, and I believe gave him one black eye, I do not recollect whether he struck him more than once.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime of murder is killing another with malice prepense; it is either express or implied; implied is often a question in law, and arises from the instrument, or the manner in which it is used; in general cases, where a person is killed by violent means, the author of these violent means, is at first sight deemed guilty of murder, and it lays on him to prove the circumstances attending the case, to extenuate the degree of guilt, and reduce it to a lesser offence; now if a man has been insulted himself, and receives any personal injury, and there is any reason to believe that the blow which was given, proceeded from sudden heat and violence, that reduces the crime from what the law calls murder, to the crime of manslaughter only; now from the evidence, it seems to be perfectly clear, that the unfortunate deceased got his death from the blow of the prisoner, for although a locked jaw was the immediate cause, yet that proceeded, as the surgeon says, from the wound; the next question therefore is, whether this blow was given in a sudden heat by the deceased, and on some personal injury he had received from him; as to that, there seems to be no contradiction at all in any part of the evidence, Perier tells you &amp;c. (here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on both sides, and then added) from the evidence on the prosecution it is clear, that the prisoner had been assaulted, not only by Perier, but by the deceased; the prisoner might be wrong, in making any difficulty in paying the toll, and perhaps they might be justified in taking something to pay the toll, but Perier gave the prisoner two violent blows, and at last the deceased gave him a blow, without any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230054"/> cause or provocation whatever; the blow which the prisoner gave the deceased, was not given with such violence as to create any fracture on the scull, and the surgeon saw no circumstances of danger at all.</p>

            , I was sitting in the fore parlour with the children, there was nobody at home but the children and me, they were Mr. Martin's children, the prisoner knocked at the street door, I never saw him before, when I opened the door the prisoner asked me, if Mr. Tweedale or Mr. Martin were at home.</p>
               <p>Are they in partnership together, as taylors? - Yes, I said, they were neither of them at home, he asked me if I thought they would be in in an hour's time, I said, I could not tell, perhaps they might; he said, then he would come in to write a note, and he came in, and I went up into the dining-room to fetch him some paper, pen and ink; I shewed him into the fore parlour, and as I was coming down stairs, I heard the cupboard door go to; I did not take any notice of that, I went into the passage to the little boy, who was sick there, and I heard the door again.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the beauset a fixture in the house, or is it a cupboard of itself? - It goes into the wall.</p>
               <p>It is not a separate piece of furniture? - No, Sir.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230055"/>Do you recollect whether when you went up stairs and left the parlour, in order to bring the prisoner the ink, whether you left the beaufet shut? - It has folding doors, the doors were put to when I left the room.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How does it shut? - There is no lock on it.</p>
               <p>How does it fasten? - There is no fastening only as it shuts to; I left the little boy in the passage, and came to the parlour door, and I met the prisoner at the parlour door, and he asked me if I could give him a candle, to seal the letter, I told him, I could not give him a candle, he said, a light of a match would do if I could give it him, I told him, I could not give him either; he said, then he would make a wafer do, and he put a wafer to it, and he gave it me, this is the note.</p>
               <p>(The note read.)</p>

               <p>As the prisoner was going out of the parlour door, I looked into the cupboard, and I saw the things were gone.</p>
               <p>What things did you miss? - Two salts, two salt spoons, and one table spoon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these things were in the closet before the prisoner came into the room? - The children were both in the room, the eldest is but three years old.</p>
               <p>Were they old enough to reach up to the beaufet? - The eldest could open the beaufet door, but could not reach any thing that was in it; when the prisoner was going to the door, I went into the passage and I told him to stop, for he had got something that he should not have; I was going to open the street door, and he caught hold of me, and told me, if I offered to speak or to move, he would beat my brains out; then he gave me a blow over my eye, I thought I had lost the sight of my eye, for some time I could not see, and with the force of his fingers in my mouth he forced out one of my teeth, he told me, if I would be quiet, he would go out quietly; I told him I would, and he opened the street door, and went out; I was laying down in the passage; he forced me down when he had his fingers in my mouth.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose property were the spoons? - Mr. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Court to Martin. Were the spoons and salts your property? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner, can you with certainty speak to his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure you cannot be mistaken? - No, it is impossible; Mr. Blacketer brought the prisoner back to our house, in about ten minutes, that I might be sure it was the same; I immediately recollected him, I told him he was the same person.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live opposite to Mr. Martin's, on the 13th of July I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of Mr. Martin's house, I heard the children and the maid cry out before he came out.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner walk gently away, or did he run out? - He came out the same as I would come out of my own door, and then he ran afterwards.</p>
               <p>At what distance did he begin to run? - When he was got from the door about ten yards.</p>

             speaking to you? - I went to know what was the matter, and the girl looked out, and her face was all bloody, I did not go into the house till I fetched the prisoner back, she looked out of the parlour window next the street door.</p>
               <p>To the best of your recollection, what did she say to you? - To run after that man, she was in a very shocking condition, I did not know what was the matter with her, her mouth was all bloody.</p>
               <p>What did she say the man had done? - She told me to run after the man, and I ran after him, and overtook him in about the space of six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him? - Yes, I lost sight of him, on purpose that I should catch him again, I met him in Gerrard street, and I took him, I only lost sight of him that once, that was when he ran about one hundred yards, I thought he would come into Prince's-street again, I am sure he was the man I saw coming out of the house; I brought him back to the house, I did not know what he had done, till I came back, when I came back, I went into the passage, and I left him in the parlour, I searched him afterwards in the watch-house, I found nothing on him; when I brought him home to the house, I went to ask the girl if this was the man that used her ill; she said yes; he said, says he, she says I am not the man; I heard her say no such thing, but I heard her say, he was the man when I came back again; the maid had picked up two salts, two salt spoons, and a table spoon; one of the table spoons was laying behind the door; the prisoner swore and wrangled with me, and threatened to strike me; I told him not to strike at me, he should go to the constable; I never left him till I saw him locked up in the watch-house.</p>

            . Are these the things that you saw there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see these things on the floor in the fore parlour when you recovered yourself? - I was in the room, but the children were standing in the window, where the things were found after, and there was nothing at all in the window, I was in the back parlour when the things were found on the floor; there was one more table spoon in the beaufet that he left, they were all laying together, and a pair of sugar tongs was left; the table spoon was on the same shelf, and the sugar tongs was on the shelf below it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Blacketer. What situation did you find me, when you took me, was I running or walking? - You walked to a house, and could not get in, and then you went into an alehouse; I caught him by the collar, and said you must go with me, he made some expressions at me, and damned me, and struck at me, I did not mind what he said, I was strong enough to take him any where, he tried very much to get away.</p>

               <p>How many were in the room the time you was with me in the parlour? - To the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230057"/> best of my recollection there was only one man, and two women, there was, I dare say a dozen came in after, at least, and I ordered the door to be shut, and I would let no more in.</p>
               <p>Court. When you brought him into the room at first, did you see any spoons on the floor? - I saw nothing on the floor but the carpet.</p>
               <p>If there had been any thing on the floor, would it have struck your observation? - Yes, I took him to the place where the things were found, and desired him to sit down a minute, and if they had been there, I must have seen them.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, The many notoriously false publications, which have daily appeared in the papers since my commitment, might probably prejudice me in the opinion of this honourable Court; but, however, conscious of my innocence with respect to the same; I trust that every aspersion which has been so vilely propagated against me, will be discegarded by you; and I doubt not, but my conscious innocence will fully appear: The evidence that this girl adduces, states, that I came there between the hours of six and seven in the evening, and knocked at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230058"/> door, when she opened it for me, she admitted me in the parlour, went up stairs, and coming down heard the cupboard door make a noise; that she came down and challenged me with taking something, and afterwards she says, she looked into the beaufet and missed some things; my Lord, she thereupon laid hold of me by the hair of my head, and endeavoured to tear my coat; I tried to extricate myself from her; Mr. Blacketer says, he did not see me run out of the house, and cannot say whether he saw me run or walk: Gentlemen, you see my situation; a servant maid had before, in this court, positively swore, that I had robbed her mistress of sundry wearing apparel, and it was fully proved, and is well known to many gentlemen in this court, that the property she swore I had robbed her of, she had robbed her mistress of herself; and servant maids in general are very aukward, and so destitute that they often take their master's and mistress's property, and lay it on others: But I shall not intrude on the time of the court; I shall trust to your Lordship's known goodness, to give in charge to the Jury that I am not guilty: I certainly endeavoured to extricate myself from the girl when she laid hold of me and tore my coat: I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How do you account for being in the house? - My Lord, I knocked at Mr. Martin's door, with a view of having some things made; he is a taylor.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you account for the note that you delivered? - I left it for Mr. Martin to call upon me.</p>
               <p>Court. It is signed C. Jenkins? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Martin. Do you know anybody of the name of C. Jenkins, that answers to the description of the prisoner? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I went by the name of Jenkinson at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. But unfortunately for you this is Jenkins.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, with respect to the present case it may be proper to inform you, that if a person knocks at a door, in order to get in to commit a felony, it is in the eye and in the consideration of the law, as much a breaking, and will as much satisfy the charge of burglary, as if the door was broken to pieces; because where ever a door is opened contrary to the intention of the owner, if they knew the errand of the party, the law will consider the door opened in this manner to be a breaking, but if you should be of opinion that this entrance of the prisoner's does not meet the strict legal idea, then the last count of this indictment does not state a particular breaking and entering; but states only a stealing in the dwelling house, and an assault on

             then being therein and put in fear; and you will observe that under this act of Parliament, the value taken must be five shillings; now gentlemen, you will judge how far a person is put in fear, against whom violence is used, and who appears in the condition this girl did; not that the law requires actual force, because if there is a violence used, and goods are taken through that violence, against the will of the person, it is sufficient to satisfy the indictment; for there are particular circumstances, by which, if actual force was requisite, the prisoner might escape; as for instance, one man may be knocked down before he is aware, and another may possess a manly spirit, and be as it were incapable of fear, especially of a person whom he sees to be by no means his equal in strength; therefore the law always implies fear where there is a proof of violence.</p>
               <p>Another circumstance for you to consider in this case is, supposing it was established before you in the fullest proof, that this plate was never taken out of the house, and it had been thrown down on the floor by the prisoner, before the prisoner had been out of the house; yet the least taking, and the least carrying away, tho' to ever so small a distance, with intent to commit a felony, is a taking away sufficient to satisfy the law: Having now laid down the law, I will state to you the evidence, (here the learned Judge summed up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230059"/> the evidence, and then added) if you credit the witnesses, there can be no doubt, but that the prisoner was in the house, and you will judge of the intent with which he came there; indeed, if there was any doubt with respect to his being in the house, his own defence has fixed that, because he tells you he was in the house, and he assigns the reason why he hurt the girl, which he says was upon her attempting to detain him. It is not necessary for me, Gentlemen, to be extremely circumstantial in observing on this evidence; I have laid down to you the law that applies to it, and you are much more competent to judge of it than I can possibly be: The girl is confirmed in her evidence by those who heard her cries, by those who saw her at the window; and likewise by the Prisoner's Defence, who mentions that the usage she has received, was while he and she were in the house: If therefore, you believe her testimony, as confirmed by the testimony of others, you will find the prisoner guilty; if you have reason to discredit her testimony, and think that there is any inconsistency, any link wanting in the chain, any chasm, by the failure of which the evidence is not brought home to the prisoner, then you will acquit him; or it is in your power to acquit him, with respect to the robbery, and find him guilty of the larceny only.</p>

             swore a great oath and blasted his eyes that he should not go out there alive; he endeavoured to make his escape from them, and he pushed up the sash of the window, and in pushing up the sash he got part of his body out, and they finding that he was rather hard to pull back again, they took him by the legs and threw his feet up against the sash of the window, and then he pitched upon the stones of the street: on his shoulder, and he was taken up by a young man that knew him, who led him across the street.</p>
               <p>Jury. How high was this from the ground? - A parlour window, and he said his leg was sadly cut with the glass of the window, and he turned his stocking down, and put his finger and thumb into a hole and pulled out a large piece of glass, and the young man that stood by him said there is another piece of glass in the other hole, and the young man took the other piece of glass out of the other hole in his leg; the young man asked him how he found himself, at that he said full of pains and very faint, and he asked if he could drink any thing, and he said he could drink a little brandy, and he fetched him a glass of brandy, and he drank part of it, and the other part was washed on the wounds, then his leg was wrapped up with a handkerchief and he was taken to the surgeon's, he died that very day fortnight on the 9th of June.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did he tell you that he endeavoured to jump out of the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you? - He said he believed the giving way of the window was by the force that they thrust him against it, I believe it had a lead in it, but they threw him with such violent force against it that it gave way.</p>
               <p>Court. You believe, that is only your supposition, did your husband tell you so? - He said so.</p>
               <p>Court. Did your husband tell you what was the cause of this? - Mr. Carmichael who is a broker and receives rent for a gentleman, he came to ask my husband to go with him to Murphy's.</p>

               <p>What was the consequence of that? - The consequence was, that in about a fortnight after, there were symptoms of a locked jaw, and the third day after the symptoms appeared he died.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 22d of June I and my wife went to Streatham to dinner, and left this lad in the house, we went about eleven o'clock, and returned between nine and ten in the evening, when we returned we knocked at the door several times, and could not make any body hear, we concluded he was gone to bed, we got a young woman to go in at the window and she let us in; going up stairs the first thing we found was the dining-room door broke open; the next was the bed-room door which was likewise broke open, we always put the key down by a carpet inside the bed-room; all my clothes and linen were taken out of the drawer, the beaufet was broke open, and a milk-pot and spoons taken away, there was a box drawn from under the bed and some more plate taken from that, there were some large gravy spoons, a and pair of salts, the boy had lived with me about three or four months.</p>
               <p>Court. Where had you him from? - He came out of the country.</p>
               <p>How had he behaved? - Pretty middling. On Monday morning I got up and went to Highgate to enquire if any of the York coaches had got such a boy, they had not, when I came back we heard by a little boy in the market that he was gone over London-bridge with two blue bundles.</p>
               <p>- BIRD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, the prisoner offered me these to sale, and I stopped him, it was on Thursday the 26th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning; the first time he came was on the Tuesday before along with two sailors; when they were there one of them said you may as well sell those little things in your pocket, and he produced a thimble and a hat-buckle, the sailor said I have done this boy a service; I have got him a birth, they sold them, and I gave them the value; they went away; on Wednesday the prisoner sold me a spoon, I have it with me, I asked him where he got it, he said he had it in his box amongst other things which he brought out of the country; Thursday morning about eight o'clock I saw the prisoner walking about the window, and in about five minutes he came in and offered these spoons, I asked him whether they were to be pledged or sold, they were bent, I said I thought he had not come by them honestly; because he had sold the other to me the day before, he said an uncle of his who lived at Westminster had given him them to carry to his friends at Hull in Yorkshire, I asked him what his uncle would think when he heard it, he said he did not know what his uncle might say or what he might think; on looking at my papers I found a bill describing the marks of the spoons, on that I stopped him and said, I am afraid there are others concerned with you, he said he had never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230066"/> any thing of the kind before, I said if he had any accomplices he had better turn evidence, he said two men were concerned and they filled their pockets, and went to the North Fields near Peckham, and those were given to him for his share; I asked him how he came home, he said he came over London-bridge, I went to Leadenhall-market and enquired if any body had been robbed, and Mr. Gregory asked me if I had got him, Mr. Gregory came with me to my shop, and he knew the boy and the property.</p>
               <p>Court to Gregory. Are these spoons yours? - I believe them to be mine, having had them in use so long.</p>
               <p>Court. Have the spoons any marks? - The two salt spoons have.</p>
               <p>What marks have they? - T. B. and A. at the bottom; I do positively believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bird. After Mr. Gregory came to my house, he said he was surprized he should serve him so; he said there were two men concerned with him, and they both lived at Peckham; I said, he should not go till he had been before a magistrate; he said, there were a good many things on board a ship at Dice's Key.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any promise made, to induce him to tell where the other things were? - Not as I heard of, we went on board the vessel to demand the property, and we carried it to Lime-street to examine the box; we found in the box, two gravy spoons, a milk pot, and some other things.</p>
               <p>- RUSSEL sworn.</p>
               <p>I got these things out of the box that came from on board the ship; I took a list of them.</p>
               <p>Gregory. This punch ladle I believe to be mine, and these two spoons, and here's a spoon marked with my own name, these silver sugar tongs marked with my own name; I believe all the other things to be mine.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of them all? - Ten pounds at the least.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My master told me, if I would tell him where every thing was, he would let me go.</p>
               <p>Gregory. When I first went in, I asked him, what have you done with the others, and I said, if there is any other person concerned with you, you had better turn evidence, and I will bring you through.</p>

               <p>Jury. I suppose a great many servants had access to these things? - I never locked them up; the servant gave some information and in consequence of that we got a search warrant, we examined the prisoner's house, and found half a dozen table knives and forks, I cannot say how many pair of silk stockings, there were some pairs and some odd ones; we found one pair loose at one side of the room, and others were found in a cupboard tied up in a diaper napkin, the knives and forks and stockings were all tied up in that towel, the prisoner was present, she said, she hoped I would be merciful to her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. You took good care I understand of your master's things, for you never locked them up? - Never but when he was out of town.</p>
               <p>All the servants had access to them? - Every one.</p>
               <p>One of them I think you said lodged with this prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner was employed to do any thing at your house? - I cannot say what.</p>
               <p>Nor whether this young woman or any of the maids took them you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>All you know is finding them at her house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And one of the maids lodged at the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You and she did not perfectly agree before this time, she did not like you quite so well as you could wish? - I always behaved civil, I think she had no reason to dislike me.</p>
               <p>I know that you was kind but she was cruel; did the other servants visit her, or their other fellow servants? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner and another take the basket out of the cart, and was running round Pye-corner, I saw the prisoner and another man taking it; the prisoner took hold of one handle, and the other person the other handle, they was going to take it into Cock-lane; I called out Stop thief! and ran after them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they run away? - Yes, and when I got up to the prisoner I caught hold of his collar and said, he must go back with me; he had dropped the basket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he ever out of your sight? - No, I am quite sure this man is one of them; he dropped the basket, and he asked me what I wanted with him, I said, if he would go back I would let him know, and as I was taking him back, he put his hand into his pocket and said he would stab me; there was a knife afterwards found in his pocket, but I prevented his getting at it; the basket has been in my possession ever since; this is the same, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>I live at the back part of the house belonging to Mr. Barker; on the 10th of June, between three and four in the morning I heard a great noise and got out of bed, and I saw the prisoner standing in the entry, about three or four yards from my door, I happened to know him by his living near me, he went down the stairs of his own door, and then he got on the window and took the lead.</p>
               <p>Court. What quantity? - Three pieces rolled up, he took them at three different times.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>You perceive how slight and trifling the offence is with which I am charged; an illiterate and ignorant man presumes to intreat your lordship's assistance, he has no friends or money in this very aukward and critical situation, but he humbly craves the humanity of this most honourable Court, being two hundred miles from home, living in Yorkshire, and his wife and family there.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner here fainted and some water was ordered by the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been in town?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About three weeks, I came with some horses, I bring up horses for dealers, there is Mr. Dymock, in Oxford-road, has been two or three times with me in prison, he is gone to some fair, and the gentleman where I lodged came to appear to my character three or four times, but he thought my trial was not to come on to night.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have any people of credit in town to give you a character, let them come on Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Court. You are on your oath not only to speak the truth, but the whole truth, therefore if you suppress any circumstance, from any motive whatever, you are as guilty of perjury as if you speak falsely. - They were in a bundle, I pawned them directly, they met me on Snow-hill all three of them, and which gave me the bundle I do not know, they were tied up in a handkerchief, I believe it was a young man in black that gave them to me, three men met me on Snow-hill, I believe it was between ten and eleven, I was going down to Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Who came to you on Snow-hill? - There was two besides that young man.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - He works with his mother, he wickers silver handles and tea pots.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of these three men? - Yes, he was, they asked me if I would go take them things, they had a bundle.</p>
               <p>What were you to do with the money? I gave it to the young man in black, that was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who had the money? - The young man in black, he was taller a great deal, and very much pockfretten.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - If I saw him I should know him, I did not know his name, I knew the prisoner, they all stood on Snow-hill, and I brought them the money.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath which of the three was it that desired you to pawn the things? - It was the tall man in black, who is very tall, I did it seeing the prisoner with them, whom I know, the prisoner's mother is a good sort of woman and lives a little decent, I pawned them with this young man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, when she was before the Justice, she said, the prisoner gave her the things. - As for that I was in a fright and I did not swear it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. You did? - I did not, it was before the Justice, I will speak the truth, but Mr. Seasons and all of them frightened me in such a manner; I have lived there this ten years, every body on Snow-hill knows me, Seasons said, if I did not say that the prisoner was the person, he would have a warrant out against me for perjury, and now I tell the truth, I was very much frightened, and I was in labour, as it was very well known to every one that was there, I have been brought to bed since, and this is my little child.</p>

               <p>How came you to go to the pawnbroker's? - I was inquisitive enough to go to see what it was, and I went into Fleet-market on my own business, and I went into the pawnbroker's to know what it was, curiosity led me, I wanted to know what it was.</p>
               <p>What business had you to know what it was? - No other business than my curiosity, my business called me down to Fleet-market, I did not go on purpose, I asked the pawnbroker what it was, I went merely from curiosity.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care what you say. - I asked the pawnbroker whether it belonged to him and he said yes, I asked him what it was and he told me, he said, where did you get this, I hardly know now what I said.</p>

Then I asked him to open his mouth, and he did so, and held down his upper lip, I then turned up his upper lip, says I, you are the man, his teeth are very rotten and bad; he then swore he would not go, we were about four or five times on the floor of the tap-room, I struck him several times with a pistol, he gave me three cuts with that knife, here is my coat cut twice, the landlord of the house would not assist me, the landlord is since dead of the fright, I then took him to my house, his face was very bloody, and I got him water and washed his face, and gave him some porter, and took him in a coach before Alderman Hart, he said, says he, Seasons I was determined whenever you came to take me to try whether you was good or not, that is what he said upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Look at that paper.</p>
               <p>(The confession of the prisoner handed to the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was you with that poor boy, before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you a long conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>A short one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had had a good opinion of the boy, and was kindly disposed to him, to deal kindly by him? - I was.</p>
               <p>You gave him some encouragement? - I promised him no favour.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I asked him, if he knew of any goods that had been lost from my warehouse, and he said, he knew of none.</p>
               <p>Why should you apprehend he would discover to you, unless you would make him some promise that was worth his while.</p>
               <p>Court. The Court and the Jury will judge, whether any confession obtained from the prisoner, was obtained honestly, and fairly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I am sure Sir, however you may desire to reach publick justice, yet you will say every thing that is right with respect to the prisoner and yourself, I am sure you came with no wish to convict further than the law allows you to convict; I therefore must ask you again, what did you say to him? - The first thing I said to him, was, telling him I had lost a quantity of black modes and Persians, I asked him, whether he took them, or knew any person that did; no, he did not, and was surprized I should suspect him, that was his answer as near as I can recollect, nothing particular came out that evening.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. At that time he denied all knowledge? - Yes, Sir, at Guildhall he openly confessed that he had taken at two or three different times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. But I want the material conversation before he was led into that circumstance? - I before observed that in my own house, nothing passed but only his denying his knowing any thing of the goods, and at Guildhall he confessed.</p>
               <p>He went to prison before he went to the Alderman? - No, Sir, he was satisfied with staying in my own house.</p>
               <p>What did you do with him? - He said he would content himself to stay at my house till the morning.</p>
               <p>What conversation took place between you and him in the house, or between him and any body else? - There was some conversation passed between him and my boy, but I do not know what it was, I had him in my dining-room, I told him he might go down in the warehouse and sleep with the boy.</p>
               <p>Is that boy here? - No.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted that you behaved as well to him as you were called upon from kindness and hospitality to do? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Before he came before the magistrate had you any conversation with him in order to prepare his behaviour before the magistrate, to tell him how he was to conduct himself there? - I believe, Sir, I mentioned to him in the Mansion-house that his person was described, and he wanted to know who the person was that described him; I told him, if he knew any thing of the goods being stolen he had better confess it, because the person would be brought that would describe him; I meant that he had better confess it there, before he went, I said nothing more.</p>
               <p>Court to Council for Prosecution. You must not give any confession in evidence after this.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. My Lord, I submit to the Court that here is no promise by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230090"/> the prosecutor, I humbly conceive this does not amount to any promise of favor: In fact, my Lord, the object of the prosecution is to bring the receiver to justice, who is now discovered, therefore if upon a trial the principal should be convicted, I shall take the liberty to recommend him to mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. You need not give yourself any trouble, it strikes me that this must either be a promise or a threat, and I think it is both; if you do confess it shall be the better for you, and which is necessarily implied, if you do not, it shall be the worse for you; therefore I think though the special favor intended to be done, or the special severity intended to be inflicted is not particularized, yet it contains a general promise or threat, and cannot be received.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. To be sure, my Lord, I cannot proceed any further, we have no evidence to bring this robbery home to the principal but his own confession.</p>

               <p>I live in Smithfield, the prisoner at the bar brought a horse to my yard the 20th or 21st of October last, he asked me to put him up to bait, and then soon after he had put him up, he offered him for sale to me, I said, I did not want such a kind of a horse, and he said, if I had one that was less, he would change with me, that would ride and draw, I told him, I had such a mare, and I shewed it him, he said, the horse was too big for his cart that he had, and he wished to change with me, and what I would give him to boot, I asked him a guinea, and I said, I thought my mare was of much more value, as his horse was a blemished horse, I think he asked eight pounds for him, I reckoned my mare worth six or seven pounds, I asked him his name, and where he came from, he said, his name was

               <p>Court. Was not this horse worth more than eight pounds, he was only three years old, coming four? - Not to me, to sell again, and to run the hazard of keeping him, he might be worth more to the owner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230094"/> I very seldom keep any horses to draw at all, but to let out to ride.</p>
               <p>Had you any evidence by when you bought the horse of him? - There is one here that was by,

               <p>What day and time? - The 21st of October, between nine and ten, I was in the stable, I saw the horse when I came out of the stable, he brought him there, and offered him for sale as soon as he came in, I did not hear what money was agreed on, I was not at the finishing of the bargain, I think the price was near upon ten pounds, what I heard there, was half a guinea between them, as I was cleaning a horse, just by the door I made answer to the prisoner, when I heard there was only half a guinea between them, I said, if you will allow me to speak, I would split the difference, the prisoner said, I have abated some money already.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing about a mare? - I cannot say whether it was a mare or a horse in regard to a change, he was to take a mare in exchange, I understood the prisoner that the horse was too heavy for him, and he would wish to have a lesser horse to ride, I think they did agree to exchange, I do not know what money was paid at last by this man to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the same man that brought the horse into the yard? - Why I cannot positively say that he was.</p>

I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How came it to be so long as five or six weeks before you became active in pursuit of the person that robbed you? - I had always the sight of her in my mind, I have not been at home since.</p>
               <p>How long did you purpose staying in town when you left Birmingham? - It was very uncertain.</p>
               <p>How came you by this property? - By my business, I am a broker at Birmingham, I brought it from thence, and part I took at Newmarket, I came on purpose to go to Epsom.</p>
               <p>Oh, what to the races, then I understand you are of that description, you came up to pay a bet did not you, and was going to Epsom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the consequence was if you lost this money you could not pay the bet? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>To what amount might that bet be? - I cannot say, they were different bets.</p>
               <p>Do you usually carry your money about with you? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230097"/>Why is there no banker at Birmingham? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What kind of pursuit have you made after that girl for these five or six weeks? - Very great.</p>
               <p>Have you been backwards and forwards through Temple Bar? - I have been once or twice but not at night, I will not go again.</p>
               <p>Then I understand when you are at Birmingham you are a broker, and when you are in town you are a horse-racer? - I received some money to bring up.</p>
               <p>What time did you sup that night? - We had no supper at all.</p>
               <p>What all drink? - I believe we had a lobster or two, we staid till two or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>And will you take upon you to tell those gentlemen there, who are intelligent men, that you were sober? - I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Are you married? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You paired yourself as well as your companions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The girl met you the other side of Temple Bar? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you go into the house your companions went into? - I told them I would treat them all, I did it to accommodate my townsmen.</p>
               <p>Being come to the bar you all drank together? - Nobody drank at all.</p>
               <p>How many companions had you with you? - Three or four, I believe some were at the door, I believe two or three women came into the house, and two or three of my countrymen; we stood at the bar.</p>
               <p>You did not retire into any more convenient place? - No.</p>
               <p>When you four were together you described the girl as being uncommonly amorous, and putting her hand about you, and then it was that you met with the loss? - She had felt before.</p>
               <p>She had taken this from you before she came into the house? - No, I tell you.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been able to trace any of these notes? - I have been seeking after them.</p>
               <p>Have you found any of them? - I wish I could.</p>
               <p>Have you advertised them? - No, I went to Mr. Drummond's to have them stopped.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you said, this woman put her hand about you before you went into the house? - She drew her hand between my thighs, and up and down my thighs, says I, my dear do not you be too busy.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not she have picked your pockets at that time? - No, Sir, she did not then pick my pockets.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. This girl it seems had deserved some nick name from you? - I know her very well, as well as I know you Sir.</p>
               <p>Something better perhaps, however, this girl knew you as well as you knew her? - I dare say she did, but she denied knowing me.</p>

               <p>Did he strike him so as to knock him down! - I cannot say, but it was the prisoner that shoved him and gave him the blow, he fell by one or the other; I told him it was a shame to treat a poor old man so, and he made a kind of laugh and began to swear, I said it is certinly robbing at noon day, the prisoner said, master I hope you will let me go, I have not got any of the money, the other man has got the money; the prisoner opposed my laying hold of him very violently.</p>
               <p>Was any body near? - I only saw two people for the length of an hundred yards.</p>

               <p>This is an indictment for a robbery on the highway; it is unnecessary for me particularly to state the evidence to you, if you believe the two witnesses that have been adduced to prove this case; this man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230103"/> was stopped, he was shoved by the prisoner at the bar, the money was knocked out of his hands , and two shillings were taken away from him, that does not rest merely on the evidence of the prosecutor, but is confirmed by

            ; and the prisoner in his defence goes so far as to say, that he gave him a shove: It is also in evidence, that the other man run away with the money: The sum, Gentlemen, to be sure is trifling, but then the man is poor, from whom that sum is taken, and he is to be protected in his property, as well as people in a superior station: If you think that these two men were in one common design, to do this poor man an injury, and to take away his property, the act of the one, in the construction of law, is the act of the other, and it is not extremely material which gave the man the shove, or which took up the money. Gentlemen, at the same time, that it may be right to discountenance a proceeding of this kind, especially in a man, who, from his own witnesses, cannot give any very good account of himself, and who appears to be a man of a very indifferent character; yet considering the sum taken, the manner of taking it, and that there was no very great violence offered to the man, perhaps it may let in a discretion, which in point of humanity, the law has permitted you to exercise, that is, to acquit the prisoner of the robbery, and find him guilty of the larceny, or it is in your discretion to acquit him generally, as you think the nature of the case in point of example requires.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I had no more intent to hurt the man, any more than I had to hurt you; I am only my own enemy and nobody else's, they speak against me from the market, because I will not work for them at under price, and I will not do it.</p>

But this man may be punished if he has practised an imposition on Mr. Omine; if the money has been paid to him improperly, it may be traced back again, I should have thought that they would have set up some other proof that this man was a sailor at the time on board the Sybill.</p>
               <p>Was you ever a seaman on board the Sybill? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How soon was it that you applied to him after you had been at Mr. Omine's? - That very day, the prisoner said I was not the man that had given him the power of attorney, he said I was not the man that went with him before the Mayor.</p>

               <p>Court. Well, what did you see him do? - I saw him heaving coals out of that barge into his boat for upwards of a quarter of an hour, I do not know whose coals they were, the number of the Barge was 172, and named the Fanny.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This prisoner is a very facetious gentleman, to hold this conversation with you, if you had been stealing coals, would you have said any thing? - No, I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>I Did not you think it extraordinary that the prisoner should declare it? - No, I thought it not so, because it is what he lives by, he is up and down every other day, stealing coals.</p>
               <p>You are very wrong in saying that, it will have a proper effect on the Jury? - He swore he would be the death of me.</p>

               <p>What do you mean by strangling? - He put his two thumbs here and strangled me, I was awake when he came in.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was you capable of calling out, when he fastened upon you in that manner? - I cried out as long as I was able, and the people came to assist me.</p>
               <p>Does this boy, the prisoner, lodge in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Where does he lodge? - At his mother's.</p>
               <p>How did he come into the house? - He came in our back yard, and then he came up the ladder, I heard him come up the steps, the back door was open.</p>
               <p>Whose business is it to shut the door of nights? - We forgot to shut the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told me that the boy came in at the back door? - I heard him and two men talking in the back yard, and he came up in a quarter of an hour afterwards, the back door was not bolted, it was open.</p>
               <p>How do you know the back door was open, you was not the last man that was in bed? - There was no fastening to the back door.</p>

               <p>I had been at King-street, Seven-dials, and was coming along about half after ten, and when I was about half way down the street, I heard the alarm of Stop thief! and directly a man run past me, and threw a bundle down close by me, then I stood, and they took me; I am told, that several of the runners has told this man to swear against me, on purpose to get a share of the forty pounds reward.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, this prisoner is indicted for a highway robbery, which is a taking from the person of another, by force and violence, and either putting in fear, or using such violence, as might impose fear on a reasonable man; in this case, there was no previous force, no threat used by the prisoner, nor any fear on the mind of the person that was robbed, therefore at all events, I think you must acquit the prisoner of that part of the indictment, but there remains another part of the case, which you will take into your consideration, for though he should not be convicted of the whole offence of which he is charged, yet he may be convicted of the larceny; now larceny is taking goods any way, with intent to steal, and there does not seem to be any room for doubt, but this bundle was snatched away from the prosecutor, by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>When Dixon came from the Justice's, what did he say then? - They said where the horse was, Bland acknowledged it, I did not see him till they were going to the Justice's.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you look round your house before you went to bed that night? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you look at this window? - Not in particular any more than the others, I saw they were all fast, the window shutter was taken down without being broke some how or another, I cannot tell; it was fastened with a couple of forks, I suppose they shook them out; the window was fastened with a strong large hasp, that was not broke it was opened by half the quarry of the window being out; in the morning the casement was open; I lost a large piece of beef, and almost a quartern loaf, and a parcel of cucumbers; they were in a cupboard, where they are put every night in the back part of the house, a little room that parts two kitchens below.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any of the locks inside the house broke open? - No.</p>
               <p>You said just now this was about half after three, what induces you to fix the time? - I asked the first neighbour that came by in about five minutes after I discovered it; I had a dog in the house, and he waked me, and I jumped up and went to the window, and I saw that Gentleman run out of the house; I told him, I knew him, he had been at my house several times before.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough at that time for you to see him? - Yes, it was quite light.</p>
               <p>Where was you when you saw him first? - At my window, I saw him very plain, he was just slipped out of the window.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he clear from the window, for if he was clear of the window, he might be standing by it; how do you know he slipped out of it? - He was slipping down when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Court. Why the sun was up at that time? - I took him last Wednesday was sen'night.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your beef and your bread again? - It was picked up in a field about a hundred and fifty yards off by some persons here, and one cucumber I found in his shirt; the beef and loaf was not in a cloth, he had it in a cloth when I saw him run away.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the beef and the bread were with him? - He owned it to me, he would have given me any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him, to make him confess? - No, I cannot say I did, I said, I would bring him to Justice, he pretended to say there was another with him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him if he would confess himself guilty, he should not be prosecuted? - No.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime of burglary is breaking a house in the night time, it is an essential part of this offence, that it should be committed in the night time, now you find this fact was committed at half after three; so that as to the burglary, you must acquit him of that part of the charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you was desired to go you went to the house of Mr. Willett, then you gave the alarm of course to the servants, in the first place that you wanted to search Willett's house, and you wanted to know which was Allen's lodgings; and the maid then told you which they were, and you went into the room that Allen had occupied, and you found nothing; the maid told you that she had removed the things out of Allen's room, for the sake of accommodating the guests, and they were openly exposed? - No, they were locked up.</p>

               <p>Did he work at Mr. Hartley's? - No, I have a number of lodgers.</p>

               <p>Did any of them work at Mr. Hartley's? - I do not recollect at that time that there was any body worked at Mr. Hartley's house, there was some few days before.</p>
               <p>How many might they be? - I do not know whether it was one, two, or three; I believe it is near half a mile off, the workmen in course frequented my house, and several of them lodged there at times, sometimes they spent their evenings at my house, I never saw the bundle with Allen, nor in the bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Several people you say lodged there before the discovery took place? - Yes, but I cannot say to a few days.</p>

             lodged there, I know nothing of the bundle being brought into the house by Allen, I have seen the bundle in the room where he slept, in the two bedded room, nobody slept in that but himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What, did not one man sleep there? - Workmen sometimes slept in that room.</p>
               <p>You say you never saw Allen bring the things? - No.</p>
               <p>He never gave you charge of these? - No.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Do you recollect of telling Mr. Stevens when he came with a search warrant that that was Allen's bundle? - It was the bundle that I carried out of Mr. Allen's room.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to say that that was Allen's bundle? - Only that I carried it out of Allen's room, I cannot say it was Allen's.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Mr. Hartley that that was Allen's bundle? - I told him it was the bundle I carried out of that room.</p>
               <p>I ask you did you say it? - I said no more than what I say now.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say to Stevens that was Allen's bundle? - I said it was Allen's bundle that I carried out of his room, Mr. Hartley and Mr. Stevens were both together.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care what you say, do not bring yourself into the hazard of swearing a falshood, I ask you, as it will rest upon your testimony, I ask you upon your oath, and apprizing you that there are two gentlemen here who were present; whether you never told Mr. Stevens and Mr. Hartley that this was Allen's bundle that you took out of Allen's room? - I told him that it was Allen's bundle, because I took it out of Allen's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That is a necessary conclusion: How do you know it was Allen's bundle? - I did not know it was his, it was in the room where he slept.</p>
               <p>Then you only informed him it was Allen's bundle, because it was in the room where Allen slept? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you have, upon the oath you have taken no better evidence that it was Allen's bundle than that? - No, I have not, and in that room there were two beds, and workmen frequently slept there that worked at Mr. Hartley's.</p>
               <p>Court. I desire you will recollect yourself, did you never tell Mr. Stevens and Mr. Hartley that that was the bundle that Allen brought in? - I never did because I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you no other evidence that Allen brought it into the house? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230127"/>Mr. Hartley. I wish to be understood to the Court, that I am no more interested in this prosecution, than your Lordship or the whole Court; I do not wish any evidence to be adduced, that is not fair and legal, but I do really wish to take notice of an evidence that appears like that woman, and I cannot help saying, that the declaration was positive; and Stevens will say the same; it was natural for me to ask Willett, how came these goods here, Willett says, I cannot tell, and he grew refractory, I said then, I will take you before the magistrate, upon the maid seeing I collared Willett, she said, Sir, this is Allen's bundle, brought in by him.</p>
               <p>Court. Your evidence will not establish the affirmative, if the woman takes upon herself to say positively, she did not say so; she says it at her peril.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think, after Mr. Hartley has given his evidence, he has no right to reply.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Hartley seems to conduct this prosecution with a good deal of candour, but his evidence will not establish the affirmative.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I want to put the prisoner forth into the world again, with as good a character as he had before, and the Court and Jury will pardon me for the trouble I give them.</p>
               <p>- SANDERS sworn.</p>
               <p>From the time the prisoner had worked for me I have known nothing of him, but as an honest man, I always put confidence in him, and he always discharged his trust with fidelity.</p>

               <p>I live in Drury-lane, at the Barley-mow, opposite the prosecutor a few doors, I saw nothing go forward at their house on Friday night; on the next morning, Saturday, the 19th of July, at four o'clock, I was looking out of my window, and I saw the two prisoners come from out of Mr. Webb's, Hollis came out first, I had frequently seen the prisoners pass backwards and forwards before, and one of them I have seen carry beer for Mr. Webb, the young man in light coloured clothes, which is Hollis, came out first, and next came the young man in grey clothes, with a little box under his arm, covered over with a napkin or a cloth, they were both together as near as they could, one after another, there was one door between Mr. Webb's and the corner, and as he turned the corner, the wind blew, and I saw part of the box, I at first thought it was a little coffin but I thought it was too small, it was a little wooden box, I am not mistaken in the prisoners, I am perfectly sure as to their persons, it was four o'clock and very light, they left the door upon the jar when they came out, and did not shut it close.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher's Council. How came you to be up so early? - We are open at three o'clock every morning.</p>
               <p>Which way did they turn? - They turned through vinegar yard, that is before they came to our house, they turned and smiled one at the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230129"/>Jury. What distance is Vinegar-yard from your house? - Some little distance, there is an apothecary one door, and a broker the other, there is only one door between Vinegar-yard and Mr. Webb's.</p>
               <p>Is Vinegar-yard between you and Mr. Webb's? - It is the same side that Mr. Webb's is on, but nearer us.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish the persons that came out of Mr. Webb's? - Yes, I did, and as they came nearer I could more easily distinguish them.</p>
               <p>What window was you looking out of? - The tap-room window.</p>
               <p>You never came out at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know Buck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him go out that morning? - No, I have seen him go out many times, but I did not see him go out that morning, he goes earlier than that, I had been but a quarter of an hour at the window.</p>
               <p>What makes you so punctual as to time? - Because the printers were just going away, and I looked at the clock and said, Gentlemen, you are going very early this morning, I hope you will not get fuddled to day, they came in for some refreshment, they print the Morning Post, and the Morning Herald, I have kept my house nineteen years, the printers quitted my house about half past three, it was four when I went to the window.</p>
               <p>How many people went by that morning? - There was not many on that side of the way Mr. Webb's was on.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FLETCHER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of it, I came from my lodging about half after eight o'clock as usual, and went to have my breakfast, I saw the house was in confusion, and the prosecutor's wife asked me to walk into the parlour, I went in, and they directly chastised me with being guilty of the robbery; I consented to any thing, I was taken up and searched, they asked me where my lodging was, and took the key of my box, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. None of the property was found.</p>

               <p>I am innocent as a child that is unborn, the house I left nigh about eleven o'clock, I went to my lodging and went to bed, till the prosecutor fetched me out, it is a house that I always made my home ever since I knew London, the prosecutor has known me from a child, and my father and mother before me.</p>

               <p>I am nurse to Mrs. Nelson, she now lays in; about half after ten o'clock, the prisoner Fletcher came in and I fastened the door, the key the maid put upon a nail that is in the kitchen, we never double lock it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Could any person withinside open that lock without the key? - They might, it was fastened likewise with three bolts, a bar and a chain; I was up the whole night with my mistress, in the dining room, at four o'clock I went down stairs, into the cellar, the chain was up, and the bar was up, and the door was as fast as I made it at twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>If anybody had gone out, must you have heard them? - Certainly Sir, nobody could possibly have gone out, our door makes such a noise, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>What distance is this house of yours from Mr. Webb's? - About a quarter of a mile.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230130"/>Jury. You say the bar was up at four o'clock in the morning? - It was a very rainy morning, he could not possibly come down without my hearing him.</p>

               <p>What has his character been all that time? - I never knew any thing but well of him, and had a very good opinion of him, the other man went away that very morning, I charged this man on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to let three or four days elapse before you apprehended this man? - He denied it.</p>
               <p>Court. That was nothing, you could not expect any otherwise? - Because we wanted to catch and have them both together, Justice Staples persuaded me to have them both together.</p>
               <p>Court. The way to have them both together would have been to take one first.</p>

               <p>Did he never attempt to abscond? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you consider the other as the principal thief, the other who put it into the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Would you ever have indicted this man if you could have apprehended the other? - We have been robbed so much that we should have indicted them both.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me strange that you should not immediately take up this man and secure him, one mark of innocence is a man staying in the way? - We thought we were sure of taking the other because he was a housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Court. But you was not sure of keeping this? - These men were both in one situation, I do not know that the other is the principal thief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Were they armed? - Yes, the one had a pistol, the other a cutlass; when they met us they turned us round with an open cutlass, saying to Wotton, your money or your life: Mr. Wotton said, he had got nineteen shillings and gave it him, and he covered his eyes with his hat, I made a great alarm not to hurt Mr. Wotton, the prisoner told me not to make a noise, and I should not be hurt; he had a pistol in his hand, and he put it in a breast pocket in the lining of his coat, he did not present it when the prisoner first came up he said nothing. I had a pair of black slippers in my hand, which he took immediately, and the other things mentioned in the indictment; after he took these things he turned me round, and looked for my buckles, I had slippers on, and no buckles, he turned me round, and looked at my gown, and thinking it a gown of value, the other man was going to cut it off with a cutlass, only a cart came by which prevented him; the prisoner pushed me and bid me walk forward, if I looked back my life was at a stake, I looked back, I saw them pass over by the Fox, about one hundred yards from where we were robbed.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it light enough for you to see them? - Yes, a bright star-light night, I am clear that is the man; I did not see him after, till I saw him at Bow-street; I knew him immediately I saw him, and swore to him.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning between four and five, I was alarmed with a noise in the house, got out of bed, and listened at my room door for a quarter of a minute; I looked down the stairs, and perceived a man below, I asked him what he did there, and two other men came from the bottom of the stairs, I called thieves, and in the space of a minute four men went out of the house, one of the men lifted his coat up, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230135"/> seemed to be blue; one of the men turned the left hand, and the other three turned the other way, and crossed towards the meeting house:</p>

They were in my sight about two or three minutes, I put my clothes on and came down stairs: I suppose they got in at a warehouse window, for it was open; it had been fastened the night before, and there was an appearance of a man's foot in the window sill: I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, several of which were found soon after: One of the men I saw soon after in the watch-house, but I could not swear to him.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner and another person pass me between four and five o'clock, in Moorfields; they were running before they came to me, and one of them dropt something like silver, and I saw the other pick it up and wrap it in the skirt of his coat.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Court. How far was they from you then? - About ten or a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Court.

               <p>I had just left the watch-house, and was having a halfpenny worth of saloop and somebody cried stop thief! and the prisoner and another was running I pursued him, when we came opposite Broker's-row we came up with them, and one of them (not the prisoner ) presented a pistol to me, and said, he would blow my brains out, and he dropt a silver pint mug, I picked it up, and pursued him down Long-alley; I cried, stop thief! and he was stopped.</p>

               <p>My business is to sell saloop in Moorfields, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I cast my eyes about to see from whence it came, and I saw a man running, and another came close by me, and I said, my son, stop them.</p>
               <p>Court. What time in the morning? - About four or five o'clock, the man said, it was was a joke, it was fun, but I would not be funned that way, he would have avoided the matter if they could, but I said, stop them right or wrong; Cooper and my son run about one hundred yards, before they took the prisoner, then they got him in possession; I must say the prisoner behaved very genteel.</p>

               <p>Court. Where did your saloop barrow stand? - In what we call Middle Moorfields, at the extremity of Lower Moorfields, and just at the edge of Upper Moorfields, from which I could see into Moorfields, and down Brokers-row; after they got the prisoner in possession about a minute or two, I saw another man run past me, and he run up with a pistol, and rescued the prisoner out of their hands.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they had stopped the prisoner before that other man passed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Cooper at that time? - With my son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Where do you sit friend, with your saloop? - It is facing Bedlam, between the two mad houses, but I bless God, I have got my senses yet, there are a many cribby islands and places thereabouts, where people that do dark actions, love to go into.</p>
               <p>Court to young Miller. Where was you standing? - I was standing at the head of my father's barrow, my father said, I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230137"/> not believe that man is a good man, stop him, said he, right or wrong; he said to the prisoner, he believed he was a bad man, or he would not have run, the prisoner said, it is only a game they are making of me.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to tell that at the first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I fancy he has been instructed on the outside? - No, I have not been told.</p>
               <p>Court to Door-keeper. Did any body come out and speak to this young man? - I remember one question was asked him, whether he thought the prisoner was guilty or no, there was nothing said to him in private.</p>

               <p>As I was in Moorfields, on Sunday morning, getting some worms to go a fishing, I saw three men running on Finsbury-pavement, that man was one, and they crossed over and jumped over the rails down by the side, I saw them before they came to the saloop man.</p>
               <p>Who was the foremost of the three men? - I cannot tell, the prisoner run along with him that had the plate, I saw one had the plate, he had it under his left arm, in the skirt of his coat, and a pistol in his hand.</p>
               <p>How near was the prisoner to the man that had that in skirt of his coat? - Within about a couple of yards, the third man jumped over the quarter, he run right down the Middle Mall, and the two run down by Broker's-row, I saw nobody running after them.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner and the other man run by the saloop man? - Yes, the prisoner was first, the other was about a couple of yards behind him, they were very near one another.</p>
               <p>Did you run after them? - Yes, as far as the bottom of the rails, I saw two men run after them from the saloop barrow, the two men caught hold of one of them, and the other came up and said something to him, and he loosed him, while I was jumping over the quarter.</p>
               <p>Did you run again? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - They turned down Long-alley, and I saw them no more.</p>
               <p>How long might it be, between the two men getting hold of them and the other man coming up? - About half a minute, they were rather afraid of the other man that was behind, that had the pistol in his hand, I saw the pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not he follow? - Because I picked up two pieces of plate, I saw a man drop them, it was not the prisoner, it was the man that had the pistol; one was a tea cannister, and the other was a butter boat, I carried them home to my master, and he delivered them up to Mr. Grace, before the Justice, I was present, they were the same that I picked up.</p>

               <p>Did they take your shoes and buckles away with them? - They were not found on the woman, one of the witnesses found them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - I live servant with Mr. Wardell.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a carpenter by trade, and keeps a shop, I did not live with him, when this affair happened.</p>
               <p>In what employ was you then? - I had been in London about six weeks, or rather more, I came from seven miles on this side of Northampton-town, I lived with Mr. Merchant, the milkman, and his wife and me disagreed, and I came away, and I had no friends in London, and I happened to be walking along that field, and intended to go back to Northampton.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you ever in that field before? - No.</p>
               <p>Was nobody passing by? - No.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - It was between nine and ten at night, it was quite dusk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What business had you upon Chelsea-common at that time? - No business at all, I was a young girl, and came away from my place.</p>
               <p>A great many other young girls at this time, on Chelsea-common? - I did not see them.</p>
               <p>There was some talk about paying your footing, was not there? - I heard no such thing.</p>
               <p>You had a bundle at this time? - Yes, I gave her the cap out of my bundle.</p>
               <p>They did not meddle with your bundle? No, there was nothing in it worth any body's taking.</p>
               <p>You do not keep company with men at all? - I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Was not you turned away from Mr. Merchant's service, by a soldier coming after you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. You have no right to go into any transaction of that kind, you cannot affect her character by any thing that comes out of her own mouth, you must call witnesses to her character.</p>
               <p>Had you any character from Mr. Merchant? - He gave me a character for being honest and sober, I came there without a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230139"/> character, I wish I had not, my shoes were never returned, the patrol came and I told them, and they searched the man and woman, and made the man get up, and the shoes were under him, and I owned my own shoes.</p>

No answer was made, but in a few minutes after I saw a man having a cutlass catch hold of a woman, and she had something in her apron, and they were a pair of shoes, and I saw one of these men take a pair of shoes from the woman, I cannot swear it was the woman prisoner, the girl came and looked at them, but they were not her shoes, then a man came and said I have got the man and the shoes, and the girl then said these were her shoes and buckles, I cannot swear to the man prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. What reasons have you for saying so? - While we was gone one time to see my wife's mother, she got a man into the house and locked the door, and a customer of mine came for some milk, and knocked at the door several times.</p>
               <p>Do you know this of your own knowledge? - It was by her own acknowledgment in my own house, and coming down she was very much confused, she said she had been up stairs to shew the lodging to the gentleman, and she locked the door because she thought somebody might come in, but however we never saw any thing of it, and she offered her service to go home with a black to America, if he would take her.</p>
               <p>The prisoners each called two witnesses who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Before you went to the magistrate did you receive advice from any body to bring this indictment, and to lay it so as to affect those people's lives? - Sir, these gentlemen bid me say the truth, and I have said no more than the truth.</p>
               <p>Did they give you any particular advice in regard to bringing this indictment? - They did not give me any particular advice, before the magistrate I was asked the questions the same as you have asked me, and I resolved them.</p>
