I am the wife of George Henry Walklett, a shunter in the service of the Railway Company at Reading—I made the acquaintance of the prisoner at Reading at the beginning of September—he had just returned from South Africa—I became on very intimate terms with him—on October 13th I left my husband and went to a Mrs. Clifford's at 146, Caversham Road, Reading—I stayed there about five days, and during that time the prisoner came there—he once slept there on a sofa—on October 23rd I left with him, and went to lodgings at 21, Lower Richmond Road, Mortlake, where we occupied one room—he had some money from his Army pay—I had no money—while at Mortlake I made the acquaintance of Mr. Egan, of the Mulberry Tree at Twicken<lb/>ham—I wished to learn the business of a barmaid—I mentioned it to Mr. Egan, and he arranged that I should go the the Mulberry Tree to learn the business—for the first week I went there in the morning and left in the evening—I was still living with the prisoner, who got a situation as billiard marker at the Crown at Twickenham—he used to come to the Mulberry Tree and take me home every evening—after the first week I slept at the Mulberry Tree—I went to live there about three weeks before December 10th—the prisoner came there nearly every day—we were on very good terms then—on December 9th I received a letter from him—it has been destroyed since—I cannot remember what was in it—on December 10th I saw the prisoner in the bar about 9 a.m.—he asked me to leave with him on the Friday, and that if I did not go with him he would shoot me—he left the bar then, and I next saw him between 7 and S p.m. the same day—I was in the bar when he came—he asked me if I had thought any more about what he had said to me in the morning—I said I had not—he said I should know the consequences if I did not, and that if I did not leave with him, or go and see him alone on Friday, he would shoot me over the bar—I did not say anything—he stayed in the bar a little time—nothing passed between us—I next saw him in the bar parlour—the governor called me in there, and the prisoner asked me to receive £5 from him on the Friday, when he would receive some money—I said I did not want any money—I had not time to say any more because he fired at me—he was then about two yards from me, and I bent down to escape to the bar—looking at this plan, the prisoner was stand<lb/>ing at "A,"I was standing at "B," and Mr. Egan at "C"—while I was going into the bar the prisoner fired at me again.</p>

It was a very kind letter—I desired to see him while he was on remand—I did not see him—I do not think he said in the letter, "By your forsaking me you are driving me mad"—he implored me to go back to him—I do not remember his saying that he was much worried by my being away from him; there was no threat in it—it was a pathetic letter—he first met me in Reading on September 7th—when we first met I do not think he knew I was married—Miss Leather was in the bar with me on the morning of the 10th—she did not say that the prisoner had asked her to tell me that he wished me to act differently, as I was driving him clean off his head—when the prisoner offered me £5 in the bar parlour I declined it, and said I should like 15s. to pay a bill with—up to that time I was perfectly friendly with him—he did not threaten me on the morning of the 10th—when he asked me then to go back and live with him, I did not say, "No, I do not want anything more to do with you—I do not want to see you any more"—I did not lead him to suppose that I had abandoned him—I did not notice that he was very much excited—I had not time to see in which direction the pistol was pointed in the parlour—I cannot say if he fired at me or if he fired at random, or if it was an accident—when the second shot was fired I was fleeing from the room—he had not been drinking heavily in my presence—I know he was invalided home from South Africa suffering from enteric fever—I know he had two enteric attacks out there—he frequently said he had pains—he was generally in a poor state of health.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector T.</hi>) At 9 p.m. on Dec. 10th I found the prisoner detained at the station, and from what I was told I went to the Mulberry Tree and made inquiries—I returned to the station and said to the prisoner, "You will be charged with shooting at Annie Walklett with intent to murder her"—he said, "It is all right Sir, I did it"—he was then formally charged, and the charge read over to him—he made no reply—about 2 a.m. he said he wished to make a statement—I cautioned him and he made this statement which I took down—I read it over to him and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "I, William. Manning, after being duly cautioned that what I now say will be taken down and used in evidence against me, wish to make the following statement. I first met Mrs. Walklett on or about September 7th last at Reading. I was in her company every day, and stayed with her' ill late at night, and have on one or two occasions stayed with her till 4 or 5 a.m., when her husband, who was employed as shunter on the railway, was on night duty. On October 18th her husband kissed her and said "Good-by sand b----you, and, if you are hereto-night I will turn you out."This was about 12 a.m. I saw her about an hour later, and she told me of the incident, and what he had said, and she said she would drown herself. I gave her £5 in gold, and persuaded her not to do so. She packed up her things and sent them to Mrs. Clifford, 146, Caversham Road, Reading, she stayed there five days, during that time I stayed at the same house at night, I slept on a sofa, on October 23rd we left there and came to Mortlake together. We took lodgings there at 21, Lower Richmond Road, we occupied one room, I was at that time out of employ<lb/>ment, during the time we lived there we formed the acquaintance of Mr. Parker, of the Jolly Gardiners Arms, Mortlake. At this house Annie Walklett made the acquaintance of Mr. Cornelius Egan, of tie Mulberry Tree, Twickenham. I was present when she first met him. My money was then getting short, and she having previously suggested that she should like to learn the bar business the matter was mentioned to Mr. Egan, and he arranged that she should go to the Mulberry Tree to learn the</p>

               <p>business; she went there, and during the first week she was there, I used to go and take her home at night, after that she slept at the house, and I got a situation as a billiard marker at the Crown public house, Twickenham. I visited her there nightly during the past fortnight. I noticed a change in her manner towards me and asked her the reason, she said her husband had been to see her and had threatened to kill her with a table-knife which she used to use at home, and had also threatened to kill me if he met me; she suggested we should go to America together, but we had no money. I still visited her, and she would not give me an answer as to what she was going to do, and she treated me with in differ<lb/>ence; I was annoyed at her treatment, and, in consequence, I did drink to excess. On Monday last I went to a friend at Lavender Hill, and obtained from him a revolver; and the same evening I purchased six cartridges at a shop in Twickenham. The same evening I saw her at the Mulberry Tree, and was in conversation with her for about ten minutes, we parted on friendly terms; I also saw heron Friday morning, the 10th, in the bar, and about mid-day I sent here letter by post, asking her to think over what she was going to do, and let me know at once. Last evening about 6.15 p.m. I went to the Mulberry Tree and again asked her to give me an answer, she told me to wait till Friday. I was afterwards told by the landlord that she was leaving there; I was annoyed because she had not told me so. I asked her to speak to me alone, and she refused to do so; I left the house and afterwards went back and asked Mr. Egan to let me see her, he invited me in, and we, Mr. Egan and I, went to the back parlour, and he then called Walkett in; I asked her to accept £5 from me when I drew my pension, she said, "No, what I want is 15s. to pay a bill at Mortlake, and my mother's ring, which you have always worn"; and with that I fired the revolver and was put out of the house."</p>

Mumford—I handed £100 to Brooks on June 17th—he thanked me, and said he hoped I would let him have the other £100 in a fortnight—I agreed to that—I asked him for an I. O.

               <p>and thanked me—he said he had taken it to Mr. Harding—in July, Brooks said his mother had turned him out, and that he was living at the Kennington Social Club—Raycott was present, and said that Brooks wanted £50 for living expenses and to pay off his debts; that he had lent him 335 sovereigns, and could not let him have any more, as he was going to get married—I said that it was inconvenient to advance any more, but I thought the matter over and advanced £43 by this cheque of August 16th, obtained from Messrs. Mumford—after Francis married Miss Candy at the end of August I saw no more of them till, I think, June, 1900, but Brooks continued to call between August, 1899 and February, 1900—Brooks had about £200 more in sums of £2, £4, and sometimes more, for his living expenses—he said he had no money to go about on until he came of age—on February 14th, Brooks said he was celebrating his birthday, which was afterwards, and that there would be a trial at the Law Courts on March 19th as his mother had disputed the will, and that Sir George Lewis represented Brooks' mother's side—in consequence of that state<lb/>ment I went to the Law Courts, had some conversation with an usher there, and then went to Somerset House—I went to Mr. Harding's "office," and found it was a tailor's shop—I found out nothing about the trial, or the probate suit—I spoke to Brooks about it—I had to sell and realise my property—I consulted Mr. Devonshire, a solicitor, and at one interview Brooks was present when this acknowledgment (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) of August 15th, that his debt to me amounted to £500 was drawn up, and signed by him—I got back £3 in small sums—in January, 1901, Francis and his wife called upon me—Mrs. Francis had called about 6 months before and <hi rend="italic">recognised</hi> her debt of £10, which I had lent her—on January 7th, 1901, they asked me to lend them £30—they said they commiserated my position, and that it would benefit me, as they would allow me £1 a week—I had not any to lend, and did not advance any—I never got the £10 back which I had lent Miss Candy—in February, 1901, I accidentally met Brooks in the street—he showed me two papers, one signed by Raycott, and he said that he had had some of my money—I noticed my name on it "Mrs. Emily Jane Idenden "and" £50—one paper was stamped—I did not notice the other, I could not read it—he said it was the same—after I left Brooks I went straight to Francis' house for my £10—I saw Mr. and Mrs. Francis—I repeated what Brooks had said to me, that I had seen the documents, and that he, Francis, had had some of my money—I said they were for £250—Francis said if I had seen them they were forgeries—that was the last time I saw Francis—except £3 I have not had any part of my money back.</p>

Mumford—Raycott was present—Brooks gave me an I.O.U. for the first advance, I believe the same evening—he signed, and Raycott witnessed it—I put it in my mother's box where I kept papers—I have seen it there since—we have lately removed—I missed it after Miss Candy left—later on Brooks sail that his mother</p>

I live at 5, Bramah Road, Brixton—I am an assistant to Mr. Cox—on October 3rd, about 7.30 p.m., I went down stairs and waited outside the premises for Nicholls to go and have refreshments at my suggestion, which he accepted—Craggs came out, and afterwards Nicholls, who shut the door in the usual manner, by slamming it—he joined me, and we went to the Criterion Hotel and had refreshment—I stayed about three minutes and left him 30 or 40 yards from Cox's house—the next morning I saw him in Cox's workshop—I remarked that this burglary must have taken place at the time we reached the hotel—he said, "It must have done"—I asked him how long he waited there; he replied, about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, and knowing that it was usual for him to pass that way, I suggested that he must have</p>

Duncan—I have seen Smith, Lewis, Nicholls and my father together about three weeks or under a month before I left my situation—I went with my father to the Rifle public house, Kennington Park Road, where I met Nicholls—we went along the Kennington Park Road, and met Lewis and Smith—they shook hands and walked back to the Mansion House public house, Kennington Park Road, where the five of us had drink, and they called each other by their Christian names—then we went back to the Rifle, had more liquid and then a parting drink at The Horns, and came out and wished one another good-bye and shook hands—Nicholls walked towards Westminster Bridge with Smith and Lewis, and my father and I went home.</p>

I am a member of the English Bar, and a Justice of the Peace for Johannesburg—in 1880 I was practising in Kimberley in South Africa—in July, 1895, shortly before the Jameson Raid, I went to practice in Johannesburg, as Consulting Counsel and Jurist—I was never admitted as a member of the South African Republic Bar—after the Jameson Raid I took a part in South African politics—I belonged to the South African League, and was elected the president in July, 1899—previous to that I had been one of the Vice-presidents—the main object of the League was the upholding of the British supremacy in South Africa—Dr. Krause was practising at Johannesburg in 1895 when I went there—he had preceded me by about two years—he afterwards became Public Prosecutor for the Transvaal Govern<lb/>ment the South African League was opposed to the abuses of the Government, that was its object—Broeksma was third Public Prosecutor, I think—I do not know whether he was a jurist also—in July, August, and September, 1899, there was a great deal of political agitation in Johannesburg—on September 29th, I left there to avoid arrest by the Republican Government—I went through Natal to Cape Town, where I was placed in command of the civil branch of the Intelligence Depart<lb/>ment—I remained in Cape Town in that capacity till May 14th, 1900, when I joined the Intelligence Department of the head-quarters staff of Lord Roberts in the field—I joined the head-quarters column at Kroonstad, and was on the inarch to Johannesburg—on May 30th, with Major Davies and Mr. Sam Evans, and an orderly, I went into Johannesburg, with a white flag to demand the surrender of the town—I found Dr. Krause was acting commandant—he was in charge of the town—Major Davies requested him to go out to see Lord Roberts, and he accompanied us out—when Lord Roberts took possession of Johannesburg, I was appointed legal adviser to the military governor—two courts were established, the military tribunal and the court of the chief Magistrate—Dr. Krause was at first permitted to practice before the magistrate—he appeared in one case—I gave certain advice to the military governor, after which no advocate was permitted to practice who had not taken the oath of allegiance—Dr. Krause declined to take the oath, and he ceased to practice—on July 24th, 1900, I ceased to be the legal adviser to the military governor, and I left to come home, I think, in August, 1901—I had been acting as correspondent to the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, and after I ceased to be legal adviser, I acted as correspondent to the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> in Johannesburg—while so acting I saw a letter in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> of February 25th, 1901, signed "A. B. Markham," which embodied a letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190201130045"/>
               <p>signed "F. Krause," in which Krause spoke of me as a very doubtful character" (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "London, December 7th, 1900.—Dear Sir,—In reply to your inquiry, I have to inform you that it is quite true that Major F. Davies who was sent to Johannesburg, by Lord Roberts, on May 30th, 1900, to demand the surrender of the town, was accompanied by Messrs. G. Douglas Forster and Sam Evans. Forster was a man of very doubtful character, well known to Kimberley men, and just before the war he was selected chairman of the South African League, an organization justly hated by all true Africanders, by reason of its malicious agitation. Sara Evans was connected with the Eckstein group, and a man not very much admired by Africanders and by moderate and progressive Uitlanders. In my interview with Lord Roberts arranging terms of surrender of the town, I protested against the fact of these men accompanying an English officer on such an occasion. Lord Roberts expressed his regret and stated these men were sent because he was told that they were acquainted with the town and local officials Immediately after the British occupation both these men obtained temporary billets under British rule. With kind regards, yours sincerely, F. E. T. Krause." (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Markham's letter to The Times, published on February</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1901, <hi rend="italic">was then put in and read.</hi>)—I commenced an action against <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> and Mr. Markham for libel—the paper apologized at once and the action against them ceased—the action against Mr. Markham is still proceeding—Exhibit 73<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi> is a letter to "Brooks" dated June 14th, 1901, and signed "F"—the second paragraph says, "Douglas Forster (you know him) has instituted an action for libel against Markham on a letter written by me and published by M. in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> in which I say that 'he is a man of a doubtful character'"—I have read that letter, and I say that the Douglas Forster referred to there is myself—(<hi rend="italic">The letter also stated that "F." had from about</hi> 1883 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 1884 <hi rend="italic">deserted his wife and treated her in a shameful way, and openly lived in adultery with a Madam Piermain; that he travelled about with her in a theatrical company under the name of Adolphus Ellis; that the writer wished for definite information with dates and places; that he believed the woman died from drink at Johannesburg; that he believed an hotel keeper named Bex knew all about it, and that he had distributed the "medicines</hi>")—Exhibit 74A. is a letter from Broeksma to Dr. Krause, dated from Johannesburg on July 10th, 1901, beginning "Amice"—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he could not write all information about "F." by this mail as people lived some distance from each other; that they were very strict on him (the writer) so he could not go to Pretoria, but he had a reliable person who would get everything out of Rex; that when Mrs. Voet returned from Europe in</hi> 1885 <hi rend="italic">Mrs. F. had already left her husband; that there was no doubt that she was a generally respected lady in K</hi>—, <hi rend="italic">that he believed she left for England; that, a Jack Hodgkins also lived with Madame Peirmain, and that if he could be found everything would come out; that Adolphus Ellis had with her again in</hi> 1885 <hi rend="italic">and played in her company; that when Ellis wanted to resume his practice at K—his colleagues refused to have anything to do with him, and that the writer did not think Krause would have any difficulty in proving that Adolphus "is a man of very doubtful character"; that his conduct was open talk in Kimberley, and that he must ask Krause to keep</hi>

All the other letters, etc., etc., I have despatched with the necessary remarks, particularly concerning money. Everything is going on here in the same old way, much and great progress has not been made, and I firmly believe that the opposition is too weak to exert any influence for good. The lies which are published here with design is unbelievable, and the person "F." of whom I wrote is greatly the cause of this, and therefore I also wrote to you the previous week that our people should be made aware of this, so that he can be shot dead in some lawful way, or other<lb/>wise put out of the way. This is absolutely necessary, and the sooner the better for our cause. Up to the present I have only sent you excerpts, but to-morrow I will make arrangements to send you weekly the <hi rend="italic">Daily News.</hi> This paper is the most influential on our side.

Greetings to all friends.—H.F."—I say the "F" there clearly refers to myself—Exhibit 63A is dated from the "Highland Railway Company's Station, Hotel, Inverness, August 30th, 1901, 'and is signed H.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I began to practice in Johannesburg in 1895, and continued to do so till I left in September, 1899, in consequence of the state of political feeling—during that time I only had professional relations with Dr. Krause—he did not mix in the circle which I associated with—he was not a member of my club, and I saw him, I may say, not at all—I knew him best on board ship in 1893, when we were fellow passengers—politically we were at the extreme end of the poles—our policy was to expose the Transvaal (government, and he was one of the officers of the Government—from 1895 till I left Johannesburg in September, 1899, I took a most active part in political agitation—the petitions to Her late Majesty originated in me, and I drafted them both—one of them was sent over in March, 1899, the other was refused by Sir William Butler—the Bloemfontein Conference resulted from them—I was not a combatant in the war—I was head of the Civil Intelligence Department in Cape Town—I did not take part in any military operations from May, 1900, to August, 1901, except on one occasion—it was a condition of residence that all British subjects should be enrolled in the Rand Rifles—it was purely a volunteer force—we had no uniform except on parades; we had weapons—we were ready to fight if necessary—we were called out on one occasion, but we did not see the enemy; they had gone—when I went to Johannesburg with Lord Roberts in May, 1900, that was the first time I had seen Dr. Krause since he was after me with a warrant—I say he was after me with a warrant because I knew he had the issuing of warrants, and I know he had issued it because I had the information from his office—I was telegraphed for in May, 1900, by the Director of Military</p>

               <p>Intelligence, to join the head-quarters staff with my own staff—I joined on May 16th, 1900—I think we marched from Kroonstad on the 20th I was not in uniform, I was in <hi rend="italic">mufti</hi> all the time—I was for some six weeks legal adviser to Colonel Mackenzie, the Military Governor—from July, 1899, to August, 1901, I was acting as correspondent to the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—I was supplying them with a weekly letter—I wrote against the Boers as strongly as ever I could—I took a view which I hope was justified by my opinion—the articles were not signed—they are headed "From our own correspondent,"I had a proper appointment from the paper—I think it was pretty well known that I was acting as correspondent for the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—I wrote an article for the paper, published on July 17th, 1901—it is a long one, and deals with various matters; the Press censorship, which was very vigorous, was one of them—in one passage I said, "In two words, if this war is to be ended once and for all, all the Boers now in the field must be treated as robbers and bandits, and not as belligerents"—that is quite right, my view on June 14th, when I wrote that, is my view to-day—I think they should be shot or hanged as British subjects in rebellion, that is the view I have advocated throughout: the strongest possible measures should be taken—under the heading of Vlakfontein, I made a reference to the shooting of some gunners—I got that information from wounded officers who were present at the fight—I did not know that Lord Kitchener had contradicted it, and I was very much surprised when I heard he had—I wrote, "Not trusting to their own capabilities, they ordered the few artillerymen still alive—an officer and one or two men were all that were left; to train and fire them." (<hi rend="italic">The guns</hi>). Naturally the order was met with a point blank refusal, whereupon, without more ado, these brave gunners were instantly shot down"—when I wrote that I did not know that, according to Lord Kitchener, it was inaccurate—the contradiction was made on June 6th, but we got very little news in Johannesburg—I knew a Mrs. Piermain—she was an actress—I acted with her—I also engaged in a theatrical speculation with her—the company I was financing was travelling, and I frequently went down to several places and played with them—I should think knew her for about 2 1/2 years—during that time my wife was in England, she had left at the end of 1884, and did not return till 1887—then these anonymous letters made things unpleasant, and we separated—I was only absolutely with the company from about the middle of 1887 to the end of 1887; then the season came to an end at Durban—I left for England and never saw Mrs. Piermain again—I was financing the company in 1886, but I did not act so regularly—I acted at various times with her from 1885 to 1886—after that I acted regularly with her at Durban and Kimberley—I was practising at Kimberley—I gave up my practice to go to Johannesburg in 1887—that was the first time the company went there—I acted at Johannesburg and at Pretoria—my wife did not come out to South Africa in consequence of my acting with Mrs. Piermain or of what was rumoured or spoken about me—it was in consequence of her being flooded with anonymous letters in reference to Madame Piermain—I presume the letters were about my conduct with Madame Piermain—my wife saw me about it, and we agreed to separate—I was married in 1872—my wife had lived in South Africa for some time—she was well known there—we went out in 1876—scandal was</p>

               <p>caused by these letters in Kiruberley—I cannot say if it was thought that what had led to the separation was what was said to have taken place between Mrs. Piermain and myself—there was a class of persons who took an interest in my private affairs and who did talk—I cannot say that I regret that there has been an opportunity for me to say that these scandals are untrue—I regret that they have been started—I cannot say that it is ever nice to go into an action for libel—I brought an action against Mr. Markham—the defence of that action is a payment into Court and an—apology.</p>

This was signed "F," and commenced "Dear Brooks "; it stated that the writer had sent the medicines to Williamson, Mrs. R., and was T.; that all arrived safely without the destruction of a single bottle, and without being opened, and that it was difficult to send the advertisements of the prescription for the medicine as all publications took up so much room, but that he would endeavour to do what he could.

Rainsford Judges said that they did not express an opinion as to whether the prisoner had incited, but he was convicted of the attempt. In Reg v. Most, there was no evidence that anybody had read the paper, but the prisoner wax convicted of endeavouring to persuade: it was for the Jury to say whether the prisoner wrote the letter, whether it incited to murder, and whether he did all in his power to have—it delivered, a ml that it was not material whether it affected the mind of the person to whom it came.</hi>

As the case must go to the Jury with regard to the other Count* I shall say but little now, as I can, if necessary, express my reasons more fully. I think the words endeavour to persuade-" in the Statute are descriptive of the character of the offence which is bring attributed to the person charged under it in, relation to the persons whom it is endeavoured to persuade, and that they have the same meaning with reference to such persons as the words encourage, "solicit," "persuade," and "propose to," and therefore I think there must be some communication to a person in order to constitute the statutory offence. I will only say, with reference to the argument used, that. I in no way accede to the suggestion that, if this view is right, the communication, in, a foreign language, or to a deaf man or woman, could not be an office.

I have no doubt, if I may say so, that if there had been sufficient evidence of the receipt of an earlier letter by Broeksma, the case would be different, but the only reference to the earlier letter is in the letter of August 6th, and on the evidence before me, I cannot put the letter of July 28th on a higher position than the letters of August 6th. I am of opinion that the Counts alleging an offence under the Statute must be withdrawn from the Jury.

I stole some jewelery from Mrs. Sharpe on January 27th, at 6, Park Road—I think two or three gold bracelets, and there were rings—the most valuable thing was a pair of ear-rings—one was mounted all round with diamonds—it was a little larger than a shilling—the same night I sent a letter to Brook making an appointment to meet him—he has been giving evidence in this case—I met him the next morning outside the Pruden<lb/>tial Insurance Company, Holborn Viaduct, and handed the jewelery over to him as I had taken it—I had not altered it, I barely looked at it—he crossed the way, and went down Furnival Street with it—he was away about half an hour, perhaps a little longer—when he came back he gave me either £20 or £30—I believe it was in gold—I com<lb/>mitted a robbery at 26, Lower Belgrave Street—I got in there in the same way—it was shortly after the robbery of Mrs. Skeafe—I stole nothing very striking, mostly small rings, a necklace, an amethyst bracelet, four or five rings, about the same number of bracelets, and a pendant or brooch mounted in diamonds—the next day I met him by appoint<lb/>ment at the fame place, and handed the jewelery to him—he took them down the street, and I followed him to see where he went—he went in at a doorway in Furnival Street with "Victor Lidden" on a plate on the door—I went back and waited for him—he came back and handed me a small sum, £20 I think, and I gave him £5 back—on three or four occasions we went to a bank in Holborn, opposite Gray's Inn Road, to get some money—I saw no cheque—this was after he had deposited the jewelery—I remember committing a robbery at 53, Hans Place—I got in the same way as before; it was in the London season—I stole some jewelery there, a diamond necklace, a turquoise and diamond necklace, a diamond pendant, a half-hoop diamond ring, a diamond, and a very large ruby and diamond ring with two diamonds—I made an appointment with Brook, met him next day at the same place, and handed all the jewelery to him except the diamond and ruby, in the same condition as it was when I stole it—he took it away—I met him later in the day and asked him £150, but he gave me, I think it was, £120 in notes and gold—I kept the diamond and ruby ring about two months as I had an idea of disposing of it myself, but I eventually made an appointment with Brook, and went with him and waited outside the door, and he brought me out £25 or £30, I think it was in gold—at the latter end of 1599 I committed a</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>). I should like to correct a mistake I made yesterday—I said that Brook gave me £200 at Spiers and Pond's Restaurant, Ludgate Hill—it was the Bodega, Ludgate Hill, where he paid me the money—I wrote the endorsement "J. Howard, 16, Wardour Street," on the £5 note 23413, of September 14th, 1898, and "George Clayton, 4, Belring Road, Tunbridge Wells. "on the £5 note 23418, of the same date—I lived at the latter address—I never lived at Wardour Street—this is my writing on the £5 note of December 1898, 57589, "George Martin, 16, Rupert Street"—the endorsement on the £10 note 28314, of January 11th, 1899, with the Leicester post mark and the stamp of the Leicestershire Banking Company, of "Alice Howard, 24, Tennison Street," is that of Alice Cope, my wife—she lived there—I gave her the note—the writing on the £10 note 96598, of August 22nd, 1898, bearing the Leicester postmark and the stamp of the Leicestershire Banking Company, of August 21st, 1899, "G. Clayton, 2, Kimberley Road," is mine—I lived there—I had two wives—I purchased furniture of the Worcestershire Furnishing Company, to the amount of about £80—this is the receipted bill; I left it in my house at Broadwater, near Worthing, before I was arrested—I saw it safe two days before—I had been there 12 months—looking at the £5 note, No. 32416, of March 22nd, 1900, I know nothing of the endorsement "H. L. Crane, 4, Newman Street, W."—the endorsement partly erased, "Ciayton, Camberwell Road," on the £5-note 95940, of February 28th, 1900, is mine—"G. Caley, 6, Prebend Street, Bedford," on the £5 note 95945 is not my writing: it is one of my fancy names—"George Johnson, 16, Evington Road," on No. 95946 is my writing—I was not living there—"H.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We are experts in jewellery and old silver—the value of pearls depends a great deal on minute circumstances—for a necklace they should be perfect, a sort of lustrious white—there are hundreds of grades between the perfect article and the worst—it is the most difficult jewel to judge the value of, and is an education of itself—we form by our own technical knowledge a base of its value, which we multiply by the square of the weight of the pearl—and assuming that pearls were wanted for a necklace that would be the first thing to consider, and then we look to see whether they are quite round or uniform in shape—these are fairly round but a little yellow—a good base would be 8s., which at 2 1/2 grains, at 18s. a grain, would be 45s. per pearl—if we had to go and buy them there would be an extra profit again to be found—they are rising in value almost every day—I knew Brook as a broker trying to sell goods for wholesale houses, and so far as I knew he was an honest man—he said on the first day that he came from Victor and Hidden—he asked 11s. per grain—we offered him a seal, which means we put the pearls in an envelope and seal them with our private seal, and so long as that seal is unbroken we are bound to give him the 10s. 3d. per grain we offered—it is to prevent offers being made by the trade to our prejudice, and is the common practice—I consider 10s. 3d. a fair price for those pearls—we divided them into three necklaces, one of 76 pearls, 220 1/2 grains, which is the one we returned to Lady Arbuthnot; the next one 87 pearls, 240 grains, we sold for £195; the third necklace, 90 pearls, 240 1/2 grains, we sold for £100—that £295 includes diamond snaps, which we had to make—the one we returned to Lady Arbuthnot we should sell for £200—we should not be able to live on 9 per cent, profit, we keep three hands in one house and five in the other—Brook said he had refused 10s. elsewhere and that is why I offered 10s. 3d.—a few pearls have been added since I had the necklace—we had no suspicion of anything being wrong when we bought them.</p>

F. Lidden," to this receipt of the Finsbury and City of London Savings Bank for £80, part of the money due upon my account, and dated 8th November, 1899—I withdrew it because my son asked me for some money, as he said ho had good business, or a good deal, and I let him have it—I ought to have given seven days' notice, but they agreed to dispense with it—this other receipt of the same date for £40 is signed by my wife, Malinda Lidden, and wit<lb/>nessed by me—the £120 was withdrawn for the same purpose.</p>

H. Brook, and endorsed in the same name—directly I gave Cope the money out of that cheque he gave me the pearls—I left them at Victor and Lidden's for them to examine them, and to see if they could sell them—in the afternoon the money was waiting for me—I cannot say the actual sum I got on that afternoon—I cannot say what this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 24) was for—it is endorsed by me—I received it on November 10th—This one (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 25) was paid to me on November 11th by Victor and Lidden for my own commission on the pearls, and was passed through my wife's account—on that occasion Victor and Lidden and Cope paid me commission, as I resold them for Victor and Lidden to Creighton Brothers of Bond Street—I had some jewelery made up for Cope at Victor and Lidden's—I had some loose diamonds made Up into a half-hoop ring and a half moon brooch—I introduced Cope to Victor once at the restaurant bar at Spiers and Pond's, on Ludgate Hill; we simply talked about these diamonds which Cope wanted made up—in November 1899 I sold some loose diamonds for Cope to Victor and lidden,. also two emeralds, but they returned the emeralds to me saying they were not real stones—I think I got £50 for the diamonds, but I cannot remember the weight or number of them—when I got the pearls in June 1900 I handed them to Victor and Lidden in a paper parcel just as I received them—I had several articles of jewelery at the same time—I do not remember any other articles of jewelery, I have got a very bad memory—I got about £20 a for the whole lot—I think about £150 was allocated to the pearls—on the last occasion I drew the money from the bank all in gold—I gave it to Cope, but he thought it was too bulky, so I changed £200 of it in notes at the Bank of England—this is my endorse<lb/>ment on this blue slip (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); it is a pay ticket—I was present when the sale of the pearls to Creighton Brothers was concluded, but I do not know if I was present when the signing of the bill took place and the signing of the cheque; Victor was present and the representative of Messrs.

Allen, Edwards &amp; Co., the accountants, of Birmingham—I have repaid most of the money to my father-in-law—I am 40 years old now, and have been connected with the trade since I was 16—Winter bottom gave Cope an excellent character—I had a transaction for Cope with a man named Wasserberg—I did not know that the stuff in that transaction was stolen—I did not know that Cope was stealing the jewelery at the time—when I went to Wasserborg I met Victor, who was a clerk there—he did not do any buying—I heard that Victor had started for himself in 1898—I do not think Cope has handed me jewelery worth £9,000 or £10,000—on one or two occasions I tried to sell the goods else-where, but could not get such a good price for them—Cope seemed to have a fair idea of the value of the things; he fixed his prices—the Prince of Wales' feather brooch was a sort of <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lys</hi>—I should think there would be 20 or 24 small stones in it—it was not a brooch with ten large stones in it—I thought £16 was cheap for it—I did not buy it myself because I had not got the money—I never told Victor and Lidden that the stones were stolen—I did not tell the Court I knew they were stolen—I did not plead guilty to that indictment—I never really knew that they were stolen—I pleaded guilty because I was advised to—I asked Cope where he got the goods from—he said he bought them of a member of the Eccentric Club, a man well known in the West End; he did not give me the name—a good deal of jewelery is made up and given away as presents to ladies and others—a good deal of that from a certain class of ladies finds its way to the pawn shops and other places—</p>

               <p>the original price and the price it subsequently realises are very widely apart there are sales of jewelery nearly every day: they fetch a fair price—for a long time I did not think that there was anything strange in Cope having this jewelery to sell—I did not break it up and then sell it—I have sold loose stones for Cope to Victor and Lidden—I did not tell Cope that I had seen a bill of stolen property which tallied with the property he had given me, and he did not then tell me they were stolen—I have seen Inspector Drew twice since I have been in custody, both occasions in August, after I pleaded guilty—I did not receive a message from Cope saying the information he was going to give was false—I hope efforts will be made to get my sentence reduced—I have not asked Drew to assist me—I did not hear that there was someone stealing large quantities of jewelery in the West End—the jewelery from Drayton Gardens I took to several places to try to sell—there was no concealment about it—I did not take it to be stolen property—Cope told me he had got it from people on the race course who were betting—it was one of the most valuable parcels I had—I got £450 for it—I only got about £30 out of it—if I had questioned him and shown I did not believe him when he brought me the jewelery I should not have got any more business from him—the settings of the diamond ear-rings were not of much value, they were mostly silver—I should have got £18 or £20 for the ear-rings alone—£27 or £29 I thought was a fair price for the rest of the articles—I thought £47 was a fair price for the lot—Cope had fixed £50. I tried other places, I went to Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's at the bottom of Chancery Lane—a man known as well as I was and with the character I then bore, would have had no difficulty in selling things like these without inquiry—I have sold articles value £500 or £600 without inquiry—except the ear-rings there was nothing of very great value on the first occasion in 1899—I believe there was a turquoise necklace among the things I sold on May 11th or 12th for £36—it was a small parcel—I do not think Cope gave me on that occasion two diamond brooches, six gold ear-rings, or an emerald locket—I will not swear he did not, because I cannot recognise any of the articles—he told me he had pawned goods—I do not know that you can get good prices by disposing of things in that way; it is done—I have dealt in pawn-tickets myself—a pawnbroker would not take in a parcel like this without inquiry—you would break it up into small parcels—I remember selling some jewelery for Cope in June, for £132 10s.—there was a diamond necklace among it—with the exception of that necklace there was nothing in the parcel of any great value—I think it was all paid for by cheque—Cope gave me a turquoise necklet—I have never seen the gold scent bottle—I did not know the parcel was worth £486—I sold them for the price Cope asked for them I had a diamond and ruby ring—the stones were taken out, I do not know if they were put back—on November 8th I had a <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lys</hi> brooch—there were no large stones in it—it was sold for £16—it was not broken up—a jeweller would take the stones out by cutting the little claws, when the stone would come out—the brooch which I sold for £16 you could buy new for £30 or £40, it is absurd to value it at £160—the <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lys</hi> brooch I took to Victor and Lidden's answered the description of Madame Dominquez'</p>

               <p>—he said, "I am quite willing to give you all particulars of my dealings with Brook; as far as Mr. Howard is concerned I know nothing about him"—I showed him a photograph of Howard—he said he recognised it as a man named Johnson, and that he met him at Brook's; and he had mounted a half-hoop, a single-stone ring, a half-moon ring, and a brooch for him—before that he said, "Brook brought the things back to me as the single-stone was a little off colour; I did not bay them"—I said, "Howard says he gave you two emeralds which were given back; do you remember that?"—he said that he did remember something about it—speaking of Johnson, he said, "If it is the man that I mean, I met him twice; once I had lunch with him at Spiers and Pond's, Ludgate Hill"—I asked if he kept books of persons who he bought jewelery of, he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he would let me look at them; he produced his bought book, and said that all the entries were in his own writing—I asked him to turn up the purchases for Novem<lb/>ber 1st, 1900, which he did, and told me that there was an entry there of a purchase from Brook of some brilliants, 20 carats at £6 a carat—I asked him how the payment of £150 was made, he said, "By cheque"—I asked if he could show me the cancelled cheque, he said that he thought he could, and went to a drawer, and produced a large bundle of cancelled cheques—he examined them, and found this cheque on the London and County bank, Holborn branch, dated November, 1900: pay self £150, Victor Lidden, and endorsed Victor Lidden—I said, "Why is the cheque not made payable to Lidden?" he said that he could not explain it—I asked if he had had other dealings with Brook, he said yes—I asked him how they were paid, he said "By cheque"—I asked him to examine the cheques he had, he did so, and picked out some for large amounts payable to Brook and endorsed by him; I asked him to explain why this one was not, he said he could not—I told him that Howard said that he bought a quantity of jewelery from him on November 8th, 1899, and asked him to turn to his bank book of that date; he did so, and showed me a purchase from Brook of brilliants for £286, and then called my attention to the fact that that information about the £286 could not be correct, there being no entry to that effect in his book—I called him "Johnson "and "Howard," I did not know his name was Cope—I asked if he would furnish me with a fuller list of his dealings with Brook, he said that he would, and called out twenty-five entries from September 21st, 1898, to November 21st, 1900 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—the entries of November, 1899, relate to brilliants exclusively—this book is not in the same condition; it was very old, and the cover was torn, and the leaves partly torn out—it had been re-bound when he produced it again, but I should say that it is the same book—I have a list of jewel robberies which have been reported to the police, eleven of which correspond with sales to him the next day according to his book—there are 25 dealings with Brook—he appeared very much excited, and said that it was very curious—I asked how long he had known Brook; he said, "Some years"—I asked if Brook ever told him where he got the jewelery from—he said that he understood he bought it about the country as a dealer, that he had engaged Brook as his traveller from November 7th, and he was not to work for anybody else—I asked how it was that Brook's name appeared</p>

Old<lb/>ham Co. brokers, Bishopsgate Street, which was established in London in August—I came to England in October, my father having gone back to America—since he left I was the only partner in this country—we bank at the London and Westminster bank at their head office in Lothbury—In October 1899 I discovered that I was debited in my pass book with £780 in respect of two cheques I knew nothing about for £400 and £380, and communicated with the Bank—those cheques were not drawn by me nor by my authority—the signature is a good imitation—(<hi rend="italic">Signed "E.

I am cashier to Thomas Cook &amp; Son, Ludgate Circus—I was on duty on October 18th—Mr. Huskisson, a junior cashier, was behind the same counter assisting me—the counter is an enclosed portion on the ground floor, with brass railings and extending the length of the room—the prisoner came in between 12.30 and 1 p.m. with a £100 and two £50 Bank of England notes and asked for change of £200 into French money—I put the usual question if he would have French notes or gold, and I further told him that I had not French notes of the amount—he said that he preferred English money—the whole amount in gold—I gave him 400 francs—2 francs in silver and 40 English sovereigns—I asked him to endorse one of the notes, and saw him write the endorsement and endorse the other two £50 notes with the same name, "J. Wilson, 8, Richmount Gardens, W.C."—I noticed that he wrote slowly—I was afterwards spoken to by the police, and gave them his description, which Inspector Cox took down in writing—he subsequently showed me this photograph of a group on board a steamer, the centre figure of which I recognised as the man who cashed the notes—I after<lb/>wards, at the request of the police, went to Paris and saw the prisoner in custody—after he had been ordered for extradition, I came back to this country and identified him from about half-a-dozen people in the cells at Guildhall before I gave evidence—when he cashed the notes on October 18th he was dressed in a short jacket suit and low hat or cap, which I afterwards recognised.</p>

Oldham's—I asked him who was in the habit of coming to his office—he gave me several gentlemen's names—I went once to the Economic Bank to subpoena one of the clerks and get a statement—I saw Hickman's account of his visit there—the clerk was present at Guildhall, but not called—I went to Hickman's place of business, but not upstairs to his office—I did not see this clerk—I ascertained that his address was 2, Vernon Chambers, Southampton Row—I found great difficulty in tracing him—I found out Vernon Chambers from inquiries at 3, Pem<lb/>broke Square, Earl's Court, from a gentleman named Grant, who had resided there—it was stated that Grant was looking for flats, and that caused me to look at all the flats—I got Hickman's address from the housekeeper, who said that he and his wife had left, and were believed to be in Paris, and he afterwards gave me a letter which gave the address of the Oceanic Hotel, Rue de la Pepiniere, Paris—I found they were there—Hickman's office was on the fifth floor of Salisbury House—after the arrest I went to look at the office—I saw Hickman's name on the door—I do not wish to state how I got the photograph—I showed it to Griffin—I showed him a few photographs a week before that—he could not identify those—Hickman wanted to come back at once to London—Mrs. Hickman is in delicate health—I found in Hickman's possession about £10 in gold, 7 Napoleons—I was present when he was searched by the French authorities—I asked for his boxes to be searched at once—when asked by the French authorities he said, "I do object to have my boxes searched until I see the Ambassador or the French Consul"—subsequently he allowed them to be searched—he was present, Mrs. Hickman was not—she had one small box and a brown bag—one box contained wearing apparel—I examined some scrip from one box—it is in Court—this list was sent with the extradition papers [<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>]—these things have been handed by the police to the solicitors of the Bank and kept in a safe—there was a seal of the Burt Gold Mining and Milling Company, a note book, some letters, and 8 blank cheques on the Economic Bank, and vouchers and accounts, certificates for shares in the Pacific States Oil Company, and in the Manufacturers' Mercantile Agency Company, sealed and signed by the accused, and other certificates—he is the publisher of the "The Credit Review," and treasurer of the Bankers' Manufacturing Agency—I traced two £100 notes to J.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Economic Bank, 34, Old Broad Street—I have been employed there nearly a year—Mr. Massey is the manager—this is a draft for 100 dollars, payable to Mr. Hickman, dated October 18th—I know him as a customer—I have frequently seen him at the bank—he came in on October 18th at about 12.30—I was looking at the clock, thinking of the Exchange List, which I am supposed to get at 10.30—he went into the manager's room—about five minutes afterwards I was called into the room, and asked to get this draft for 100 dollars at Brown-Shipley's Joint Stock Company in Lothbury—I left the bank to go that errand at 12.45—I was at Brown-Shipley's ten minutes—or a quarter of an hour—I was told to take it to Hickman's office—I went to the Exchange first, then to Have a cup of <hi rend="italic">coffee</hi>, then to Hickman's office—he was sitting at his desk writing—I gave him the draft, he gave me this cheque in exchange—I returned with it to the bank—when I left the bank, Hickman was in the manager's office—I remember dis<lb/>tinctly it was a wet day—I have never seen Hickman in any other than a silk hat—I do not remember seeing him in a short jacket or a turned down collar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I remember it was October 18th by its being a wet day, and by the date of the draft—I cannot say when I left the bank on October 17th or 19th; nor when I got the List—I should get the List at 10.15—the place opens at 10 in Copthall Court—I have no regular time to get it; I go as early as I can—I am told about it if I am later than 10.15—I cannot say when Hickman was last in—I was at the counter making up pass books when I was sent out—Brown-Shipley's is in Pounders' Court, about four and a-half minute's walk.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been very ill—I am managing trustee of the Economic Bank—prior to that I was 25 years in William Peebles' Bank—I know Hickman as a client since August 30th—I recollect October 18th by this draft on Brown Shipley's or Brown Brothers, the New York House, for 100 dollars—Hickman called about 12.30 and asked me to obtain it—I instructed the clerk to take it to his office—he went to obtain the draft between 12.30 and 12.45—Hickman remained in con<lb/>versation, and waiting for the draft about three-quarters of an hour—when the clerk came back, I told him to take it to his office—I believe it</p>

               <p>was a wet day because I wanted to go out in the morning and did not go; other people wished to see me, the weather kept me, and I wanted to go to lunch, and Hickman kept me—the draft was on Hickman and Read—Read is the partner—they were doing work for our bank in New York—before entering into a contract I made inquiries, and the answer was that they were respectable, very well connected, but not of large means—I was a couple of months making inquiries, and sent over and got a gentleman to go to New York to inquire personally, and he brought back the same account—the contract was never entered into, but expired by lapse of time—I recollect a gentleman making inquiries at the bank on October 29th—I believed him to be Mr. Oldham—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Oldham was called in</hi>)—I do not think that is the man.</p>

I am a clerk to Brown, Shipley &amp; Co., bankers, in Lothbury—this draft was issued by us on December 18th, 1901, and from the signature I think between 12.30 and a few minutes past one, because these are usually signed by the chief clerk, Sir Rowland Roberts, and he goes to his lunch at 12.30 and returns shortly after one, but this is signed by the manager, who signs in his absence—Sir Rowland Roberts was there on October 18th.</p>

Oh my! I was only minding them. Let me take them back. I only wish I could send them back. Won't you give me a chance? I will give you every information.

On December 28th, soon after midnight, I was on point duty in the Barking Road about 50 yards from the Ordnance Road—I heard women screaming "Police" and "Thieves"—in the Ordnance Road I saw the prosecutor's wife, and a little way behind her the prosecutor holding the prisoner by his coat—he said, "This man has stolen my watch, I shall charge him"—the prisoner made no reply—the prosecutor's face was covered with blood—both were sober—this watch was picked up in the road—it was covered with blood—this bar was still fastened to the centre button of the prosecutor's waistcoat—Mrs. Lucas brought this part of the chain to the station shortly afterwards—when charged the prisoner said, "I admit striking him, but I did not take his watch, I had nothing to do with the watch"—he was charged with stealing the watch and chain and assaulting the prosecutor—I saw no man with a crutch in the street.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prosecutor's coat was torn open and one of the buttons missing, which was afterwards found; his lips were very much swollen and his face and clothes were smothered with blood—that might account for the blood on the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hydraulic crane driver at the Royal Albert Docks for the New Zealand Shipping Company—I was returning from my employment in the early morning of December 28th with my wife—we met the prosecutor, and the woman was standing on the left of the pavement—my wife said something, and the prosecutor said, "That woman is my wife"—I said, "If she is your wife take her home; see the condition she is in," and I said to her, "Is this your husband <hi rend="italic">V</hi> and to him, "Don't put your face too close to my wife's"—I drew back, and was knocked and fell—a man helped me up and picked up my hat and stick and gave them to me—then the prisoner said to the prosecutor, "You vagabond to strike a man who cannot defend himself"—(<hi rend="italic">The Witness was lame</hi>)—the prosecutor said, "You can have the same," and she saw him fall in the road, and said to me, "Come home"—I live in the same road, 42, Malmesbury Terrace, Canning Town, as Weeks, the man who struck me—I went home and heard no more till the prisoner's wife informed me that her husband was in prison, then I went to Plaistow Station and asked what I could do—I pushed Weeks away from my wife, and I suppose that upset him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor's wife was standing on the kerb opposite—they were abreast of one another—I saw one constable 70 yards off on point duty—I wanted to see the result, but my wife pulled me along—Mrs. Lucas came out of her house, a barber's shop, and her husband followed—I doubt whether they saw me in the rush—I was not there when the police came, my wife took me away—I do not know the prisoner—I was in bed four days after I went home—the prosecutor's wife came to my house and asked for the man who was knocked down and I explained the matter—I heard no complaint of a watch being stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William King—I was with him in the Ordnance Road three days after Christmas between 12.30 and one a.m. coming home—I saw the prosecutor knock my husband down—the prisoner came across the road and I asked him if he would help me pick my husband up and he did so, and gave him his cap and stick in his hand and said to Weeks that he ought to be ashamed of himself for hitting a cripple, and Weeks said if he liked he could have the same, then Weeks hit the prisoner and both fell to the ground; his wife called out "Police," and I was so frightened, Weeks being a fighting man and my husband a cripple, that I thought the best thing was to get away, and we did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We simply said, "That looks like the woman across the road," and the prosecutor said, "That is the woman that lives across the road, she is my wife; what do you know about her?"—I said, "Nothing"—with that he hit my husband and knocked him down—I am not complaining of the prosecutor's conduct to me—he looked me in the face; his hat touched mine, and my husband said, "That is my wife, take your head <hi rend="italic">out of her face</hi>"—I did not know the man—I knew the woman—she lives at No. 2, and she appeared to be going away from her home—we were going from the Royal Albert Music Hall, where my husband is an attendant—he also works as a crane driver for the New Zealand Shipping Company when they have work—Weeks lives in the same street—I</p>

I have not the money," and my sister refused.</p>

I said I should not think of buying it without my father's approval—I asked to see the receipt for it; he took it out of his pocket and said, "Here you are"—<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt for £5 for a cycle from a cycle maker at Streatham</hi>—he said he would let me take the machine and the receipt to my father, and I was to meet him outside the Enterprise at 4 o'clock—he said the machine was not his, but that he was selling it for a friend who was ill—my father did not approve of it, and I went down to give it back to the prisoner when I saw a detective—I saw the prisoners at the station and recognised them—this is my bicycle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>
