               <p>THough the Sessions for the City of London and County of Middlesex be held almost every month, yet so incorrigibly wicked are people, that no warning of the untimely Ends or other punishments of their Fellow Criminals, can deter them from the same Evil Courses: so that there scarce ever fails to be a great number to receive Justice for their Demerits at every Jayl-delivery. Thus was it now at this time: of the most notorious I shall here give you a particular Account.</p>
