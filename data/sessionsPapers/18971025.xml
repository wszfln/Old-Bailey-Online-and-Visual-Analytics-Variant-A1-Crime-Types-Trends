Home sent me in April this bill for £167 16s. accepted by them, and I signed it as the drawer—I knew the prisoner slightly, and had had transactions with him before—I wrote to him, and two or three days afterwards I showed it to him and said that I wanted it discounted—he said that he had a banking account at the Mercantile Bank, Old Jewry—I gave him the bill, and on April 24th I saw him out<lb/>side the bank and stood outside while he went in—he came out in ten minutes with the bill and said that he had seen the manager who would discount it, but that it required my endorsement, and the money would be paid on Monday, and the rate would be 5 percent—I endorsed it and handed it to him, and he took it into the bank and came out and said that the bill was all right and we should get the money on the Monday—I arranged to be there at eleven o'clock on the Monday, and went and waited an hour but he did not turn up—I employed a detective to find him, but did not see him till August 7th—I received this letter: "Old Jewry, Monday. Unable to get to the City till late, being engaged on important business; I will meet you to<lb/>morrow, when the matter can be discussed"—I enquired at his private address but was unable to find him.</p>

On May 14th Mr. Woods and Mr. Home came and saw me—they said, "This bill is in wrong hands"—it was very late in the afternoon, and I wanted to get away, and said that I had given it back to Hayes—that was a lie—after that I communicated with Mr. Brydon.</p>

Mrs. M'Lean, Liverpool. Dear Madam—Your most extraordinary and one-sided and selfish letter to hand. You ignore the fact that I gave up my position and ruined a successful career at your daughter's instigation. I had hoped to get on again and do well, but as I refused to desert your daughter several positions offered were withdrawn. She has been to several health resorts to no purpose. I have not seen her for some time. It is, however, of no avail, and the end must come for both, I know that I have erred, but liave paid a bitter price—your daughter likewise. I had a lovely home and good position, and gave all up for what has culminated in ruin. Your other ignorant impertinent remarks, curses, &amp;c., are not worth notice. Had I not been unfortunate Sarah would have been a lady, and I have no doubt there would have been sychophants about instead of curses. P.S.—Sarah has just shown me her brother's wire. I am more than astonished. She would not have asked had I any money to give her. I have none. We have failed to mend it together so we will end it together. If I recollect aright Sarah was extremely kind to her brother and sister in Coleraine, and would be yet if she were in a position to be. I am not aware of any reciprocating, but I am sure her kindness was not extended with that idea, for my note referring to the brother's duty had simply got to do with the end, which is in heaven. When writing I had no idea of Sarah's wire. If she had looked after herself half as well as she did other people it would have paid her well to<lb/>day. She did not, and has to pay the penalty.—W. S.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It might cause vomiting; that is a very well-known consequence; I don't think it is usually the case—if a man accustomed to the drug took two or three ordinary doses of laudanum the stomach, would retain it; it might produce vomiting—22 grains of opium would contain about an ounce of laudanum, or a little more—if a man tossed down two or three ounces of opium he might retain it, or he might not;. vomiting might ensue—I would not say probably; if the person was unaccustomed to the drug it would be a well recognised symptom—I will not go farther—a person in the habit of taking it would be more likely to retain it—the result of taking small doses would be to produce sleep, and afterwards disordered digestion, a furred tongue, and a general feeling, of illness—the system would absorb three grains—the signs I found led me to the conclusion that there had been about four hours between taking the dose and death, and in that time about two grains might have been absorbed; if the interval was longer the absorption might have been more—in my opinion the quantity taken might have been greater.</p>

I am an Inspector of the Derby Borough Police—in consequence of information received from London, I went on September 1st to the Newland Station, Derby, and made inquiries, and then went to 84, Abbey Street, and in the front room up stairs found the prisoner, between four and five in the afternoon—he was lying on the bed, fully dressed, in the room occupied by his daughter—I asked him if his name was Stormouth—he said, "Yes"—I said he was wanted by the police at Bow Street on a charge of murder, and I cautioned him—he replied, "It is a bad job, and it is a serious charge, I expected a visit from you, I attempted suicide once, but was not successful"—I took him to the police station, and there searched him, and upon him I found this key of his room at Guildford Street, I put it with the other property of his; he said, "It is the key of the room which we occupied, and which I locked prior to leaving the hotel, and the room where the body was found—in my presence he wrote this letter to his wife (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "My dear wife, I am now about to be taken to London, and I beg and pray you to do your best for me, and to work with my brother, Hugh Anderson, and Mr. Jno.

                  </hi>. I am the medical officer of Holloway Prison where the prisoner has been confined since September 3rd—from then till October 11th I saw him almost every day once or twice—I could not detect any indication of his having taken opium in excessive quantities, or in any quantity at all—opium has only been supplied to him twice since he has been in prison, and then only in very small dosed in pills in combination with other things, because he complained of diarrhoea—persons who have been accustomed to taking opium in large quantities, and who are deprived of it suddenly are, as a rule, very nervous, frequently sick, restless, sleepless, and without inclination for food—they are very marked symptoms at the time—I have not observed any such symptoms on the prisoner during the time he has been in prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Those symptoms would depend partly on the amount of opium that had been taken, and partly on the interval since he gave it up—in a person who had taken large quantities of opium, but was not a confirmed opium taker, most of the symptoms would rapidly disappear after ceasing to take opium, but symptoms of indigestion would be left for a few days usually, and after that the effect would probably pass away—there is no distinct external sign of whether a person is under the influence of opium except the pupils and the odour of the breath—the pupils contract usually when the effects are passing off—the abnormal state of the eye usually passes off as soon as the effect of the opium passes—I examined the prisoner's eyes—on the evening of his admission they "were in an ordinary state, and not abnormally dilated—there was nothing unusually marked about them; the pupils were rather larger than those of many people—contraction of the pupil is a sign of confirmed opium eating—dilatation of the pupil is not a sign I should look for—contraction of the pupil is the usual effect of opium in a large dose; it depends on the stage—possibly there may be contractions in the early stages and dilatation in the latter, but it is not so usually in my experience; I should expect a contracted condition—in cases going on to a fatal result probably jthere would be contraction in the early stages, and dilatation in the ktter; I should not expect it in other cases—to some extent it is a question of degree as to the stage—you cannot derive much information from the examination of the eyes of a person who has not taken opium for some time—opium taking leaves an effect on the tongue for some little time afterwards; it may be for a week or more—it is of varying character—depression of spirits, general mental distress and disturbance, lassitude and weariness are very marked frequently—the condition of the tongue and indigestion might be due to other causes.</p>

On the early morning of September 21st I was at the junction of Vauxhall Bridge Road and Regency Street—I heard screams of "Police" and" Murder" in the direction of Chapter Street, towards Victoria—I saw a number of men apparently struggling in the road—getting nearer I saw the first witness lying in the roadway and the prisoner and a woman on the top of him, she beating him with her fists, while he was singing out—I pulled the man and woman off him, when the prosecutor signed with his five fingers and called out "money," and touched his waistcoat pocket—I told the prisoner I should take him into custody for robbery—he replied, "You cannot take me for robbery"—he then became very violent, kicking me in the left shin—I got assistance of another constable—the prisoner was so violent it took all our time to hold him and get him to the station—he was searched and 5s. silver and bronze found on him—when the charge was read over at the station, he said, "If a Turk hit you, you would hit him; I deny robbing him"—he did not say anything about the Turk hitting the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was charged at the station with assault<lb/>ing a constable—the case was remanded twice because Mr. Shiel was away—the defendant's solicitor said he was guilty of assaulting me—the defendant did not object to that—we both came to the ground in the struggle—the prosecutor was not drunk—I did not see the prisoner pass any money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, of 11, Coleman Street—on September 1st I interpreted to Aribler the charge, and in answer he said, "On the Sunday in question I was at work at a shop, 62, Dean Street, and a young man came in and said to me,'Is the governor in?'—I said, 'No'—then he said 'Take those three papers (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> "4," <hi rend="italic">"B" and "C"</hi>) and when I shall call in the man who stands outside, tell him the governor has left those tickets for him, and if he pays you £3 10s. he can have those tickets,' and I have done so—the man came in and paid £3 10s., and I gave him the three tickets"—on September 20th I interpreted the charge for Schaefflin—on the way to the station he said, "How I came to be connected with this affair is, I knew Zamell about twelve months, he lived in James Street, East End, and I knew he was a very poor man; but I met him, some time ago, and he said, 'Why don't you come to see me?I am a rich man now, I have got two good shops; T have got a lot of jewellery'"—he gave him his address, and he happened to be that way, and he went in to see him—while having a conversation he said to him, "Do you know anyone who wants to buy a ticket to go to New York?"—he said, "Where have you got the tickets from?"—Zamell replied, "I bought some tickets at the Jubilee time, for the excursion, cheap—I have</p>

               <p>got some of them left, therefore I can sell them to people"—this prosecutor had just moved in from his father's place, and he had a letter from his brother from America to come there, and he said, "I know who has got cheap tickets to sell." and he took him there, but did not find Zamell at home; but he met him yesterday and said, "This is the man who wants to buy the ticket"—he said, "How much do you want for it?"—he said, "£4"—the prosecutor replied, "have not got £4, all I have got is £8 10s."—Zamell said, "Very well, as you have no more you can have it"—the prosecutor said he must consult his wife as to whether to part with his money—Zamell said. "If you call on Sunday for the ticket, and I am not at home, I shall leave it with my workman" [<hi rend="italic">Aribler</hi>]" and if he could give him the money (£3 10s.) you shall have the tickets," and then Schaefflin went with him to Hyde Park, where they sat in a place where there was no music, and Schaefflin said, "I will go and see where the music plays." As he went there he found a pal who asked him to go to the Brussels Exhibition. He said, "I have not got sufficient money," and he said, "I will pay for you," and then he went back with his friend to look for the prosecutor and could not find him.</p>

I don't wish to do that, but if you don't go with me again I shall be avenged. Good-bye. I remain, your ever-loving and affectionate true lover, J.

               <p>road from the kerb and approached me, and said, "Mr. Palmer, how has the case gone on?"—I said, "You will know soon enough,"or" by-and-bye"—he passed me on my right; my daughter was on my left side—he went behind me, and not liking the look of him, I followed round—I had already said to my daughter, "Maggie, go on"—when he went behind me he raised his hand, and in it I saw he had a pistol—as he approached he seemed to have his hands behind him—I called out, "Bill, he has got a pistol," and at the same time I rushed at him and clutched hold of the pistol, and forced it down—as I was forcing his hand down the pistol went off—when I saw the pistol in his hand, and made the rush at him, the pistol was pointed at my daughter, who was a few paces in front—my daughter fainted, and was taken into the Institute—a policeman came up, and the prisoner was taken into custody—when my daughter, on recovering, came out of the Institute, I said to the constable, "I give that man in charge for attempting to shoot my daughter"—the prisoner said, "And I will do it again if I get the chance," or "opportunity," I won't be sure to the exact words; but that, was the purport of what he said—I don't know who had the pistol then—when it went off, the prisoner remained in possession of it—assistance came, and I looked round and saw my daughter on the ground, and I thought I had been too late—I did not touch the trigger with my hand—I seized the barrel—I saw distinctly it was a pistol—it did not go off directly I got hold of the barrel; but as I was forcing his hand down.</p>

I am one of the firm of Craig, Gardner &amp; Co., Accountants in London, Dublin, and Belfast—the prisoner is my brother—I have been assisting him for years—he has been annoying me for years, by post-cards—I know his writing—these post-cards are written by him—the writing is undisguised. <hi rend="italic">the post-cards produced stated</hi>: "You are a dirty dog." "You unnatural dog, leaving me here starving. What about the bastards, are they starving?" "I am keeping at it. You are a brute and a dirty ruffian." Some were addressed to "Mrs. Nora," the wife whom he is stated to have never seen, and contained references to "Craig's dirty bastards," and other offensive imputations on the prosecutor and his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner stated that his name was "Gardiner" and the indictment was amended. He then objected to the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court. This objection was overruled.</hi>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as Bryden and Co., corn dealers, 203, High Road, Kilburn—at the end of 1896 I arranged with the prisoner to sell goods on commission—I agreed to pay him 5 percent. commission on the returns, the customers were to be his connection, and he was to collect and hand the money to me, the cheques to be paid into my bank when received—there were transactions first on and then subsequent to December 19th, on which I paid him commissions on the orders he had obtained—he introduced Mr. Ling, corn dealer of the Borough Road, Southwark, as a customer—I paid him three com-missions on Mr. Ling's orders when he brought the orders—there was no account between us—subsequently I gave him an additional 1/2 percent, commission on certain goods—he had no authority to put my name to cheques, nor receive the proceeds—this cheque for £5 I received from Mr. Ling after it was paid through his bank—it is endorsed by the prisoner—I never received the proceeds—I know the prisoner's writing (<hi rend="italic">This was on the London and County Bank, and endorsed "Bryden &amp; Co."</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a musical director, and reside at 18, Brighton Street, Secombe, Cheshire—some time in May or June last year I received a circular, of which this produced is a copy (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "Fourth Year—The Augurial Syndicate—Shares £5 each—Committee, <hi rend="italic">H.

I took an interest in horse<lb/>racing at that time, and was in the habit of betting for a couple of years, and taking some sporting papers, not the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Life.</hi> I did not know till later that investing in horses was recommended in the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Life</hi>, but I understood so—I heard that "Augur," of the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Life</hi>, was one of the best known advisers in sporting matters—the advice was that the money should be invested as "Augur" recommended, on a system—I did not know what the system was—I thought if that advice was followed the money would be made—I did not know that in 1895 it was successful, I never took in the paper—my idea was that the money was to be invested on "Augur's" nomination—I never had any acknowledgment of my cheque—I had heard of "Augur" as a sporting name—I did not look in the paper to see whether his nominations were followed—I went on backing horses for myself during the year for some time.</p>

               <p>think it was a white one lite this produced—I saw the heading of it, about the last three years' profit, and that this was its fourth year—I read the circular all through—I believed the statements in it—I saw the balance-sheet on it—that impressed me a little bit—the circular brought with it an application for shares—I filled up one of the application forms and enclosed a cheque for £5 for one share the Augurial Syndicate—this is ihe cheque, dated March 24th, 1896, I made it payable to F. Thomas, the secretary, I got a receipt for it, and another circular not many days after—I received 10s., and subscribed anoher £5 for another share, dated April 6th, and I received another 10s. and another 7s. 6d. dividend, altogether £1 7s. 6d.—on May, 21st I received another circular, but before getting that, I had subecribed a further sum of £5. I read that circular and then burnt all the papers, at least my wife did—she opened the circular before I saw it—I got no more dividend, and heard no more of the syndicate.

I am a manufacturer, of 115, Bishopsgate Street Without—in March 18th, 1896, I received a circular of a syndicate—I believe it was pink, like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read it and believed the statements and sent £5—I went to 66, Finsbury Pavement and saw the name painted on the wall, but did not go in—I do not know any of the prisoners—I no doubt got a receipt, but I have destroyed the papers—I got 10s. dividend, probably three weeks afterwards, and with it a letter regretting that it was so small an amount, and hoping it would be better next time—this is my cheque, it is dated April 8th—there was a printed circular stating that the money was lost, and asking for more money to be applied in the same way—I did not send any more—before I sent the £5, I got a letter, which I destroyed, it stated that what was set forth in the prospectus, that it had been audited by a chartered accountant who would not have staked his reputation upon it if it was wrong—I went to Winchester Street to see if there was such a man, and saw the name of Robertson there, and that is why I sent the money.</p>

I advanced the money, and thought I was not going to be put to any risk—however successful Mr. Anstruther might be on the race-course I was to be safe—I thought my money was to be invested in horse racing which there is no certainty about, but the money being lost took me by surprise, because I thought I should get it back, not that it was as safe as Consols or Government securities but I thought it was as safe as any commercial undertaking—my letters were always answered.</p>

I live with my husband at 7, Red Lion Street—we were formerly caretakers at 2, Portsmouth Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where there was an office occupied by Marchant &amp; Co.—it was only for receiving letters, a very small room parted off from another, at a rent of 2s. 6d. per week—letters came there; there was a letter-box for Marchant and Co.—Tarrant fetched the letters, but my husband had more to do with that—Tarrant resembles the man who fetched the letters—it was in 1894; the early part—I did not see George Marchant there—after he had been there about six months we had a visit from the police—my husband told him, and he went immediately—they did not leave any address—the letters that came were returned to the post office.</p>

W. George &amp; Co., and that in November, 1896, he was served with a Petition of Bankruptcy, and that the landlord took possession for rent; (53) that since that time he had been at the old business of selling wines and spirits on commission; (77) that there was a claim against his estate for £100 on account of his having become bail for Fenn, the brother of his friend, whom he did not know much about, and that the brother was also bail.</p>

I am a clerk—I was employed by Tarrant, at 70 and 71, Bishopsgate Street, on July 20th, this year, up to the day of his arrest—the office consisted of one room on the first floor, the name up was Frank Tarrant &amp; Co.—my occupation consisted chiefly in directing envelopes and taking them to Devonshire Chambers—letters came occasionally to 70, Bishopsgate Street, addressed to Frank Tarrant &amp; Co., by the morning post, about fifteen or sixteen; about three or four at mid<lb/>day, and about three or four in the evening; averaging about twenty<lb/>five in the day—I took those letters so addressed to Devonshire Chambers and gave them to Miss Tarrant or Miss Sheen, and made appointments for the writers to see Mr. Tarrant at the office in Bishopsgate Street, or if they could not come to see him, he would write to them—some called to see him, not frequently—he was seldom there; if be made an appoint<lb/>ment to see anybody, he did—I saw him there on two occasions only—I saw nothing of Fry—I never saw Fry there—I saw him three or four times at Devonshire Chambers—no books of account were kept at Bishopsgate.</p>

               <p>to call for them, and on one occasion I saw Fry call for letters—I did not give them out myself; the secretary generally did; but when he was at Paris I have given them to several girls, who were employed in Writing upstairs—I don't think anything else was done there except calling for letters—when Fry came to be there I gave them to him, after talking to him he said it was all right, he was Tarrant's brother-in-law—those offices were taken in December, 1894—Fry came some time in 1895—I took possession in 1895.

                  </hi>. I am secretary to Mr. Green, the laodlord of 66, Finsbury Pavement—in May, 1896, Fry took an office there in the name of Stephen Fry, and signed this agreement dated May 18th—the name of "W. Simpson &amp; Co." was put up and" S. Fry" underneath—the Augurial Syndicate had started operations about a fortnight before that, but I had not heard any complaints about it; I said nothing about it to Fry, but in June, 1896, the day after the Augurial Syndicate left I told Fry not to have anything to do with the Tarrant lot, as I heard they were swindlers—I cannot recollect that Fry said anything, but I know he smiled—he left at the end of August—he had been there a fortnight and had not paid, in fact, I do not know when he went because he took the keys with him—I did not know he was going, he left no address, but I found that out afterwards.</p>

I am a clerk in the Mercantile Bank of London, Old Jewry—I know Culliford—he had an account there in the name of Bameti about 1894, that was closed, and on July 6th, 1897, he opened another account in the name of Hartridge &amp; Co., 8, Duke Street, Adelphi, with £395—I produce a copy of it—it remained open up to July 20th—Culliford is the person who signed and drew on it—altogether £625 was paid in—the last debit was on July 20th—I have here the particulars of the payments in and out—that £395 does not appear to have come from the Capital and Counties Bank, it was cheques and notes—the last debit but one is £12 drawn out on July 17th; that was payable to W. Hawkins—there is no other payment to Hawkins—there was a balance on July 20th of £18, which is still to their credit.</p>

I live at 23, Church Street, Plaistow—I am the prisoner's eldest child—he is a carpenter, employed at the Beckton gas works—there have been eleven children in the family; six have died—one named Amos has died since James—on Sunday, September 19th, I went with my sister Ruth and my brother James to stay with Mrs. Bannister at Stanford-le-Hope—James was four years, eleven months old—he was in his usual health when we went to Mrs. Bannister's, and had nothing the matter with him; he seemed just the same as usual—about the Wednesday he seemed to have a slight cold—on Friday afternoon, 24th, we all left Mrs. Bannister's together—James was not so well on the Friday morning, but I thought he was sufficiently well to come home—we came home by train—the station is between five and ten minutes' walk from Mrs. Bannister's; James began to walk, but he did not seem able to get along, so we carried him to the station—we reached home about four—my mother met us—father came home at his usual time, about six, that evening—when he saw James he said he could see he was not well—James had a little tea, and was put to bed—he slept pretty well during the night—Mr. Southgate, an elder of our people, and a labourer by occupation, was called in, and he laid his hands on James, and prayed over him—the next day, Saturday, James did not seem better; at nine o'clock he did not seem so well—at one o'clock he seemed ill—at two o'clock he was taken suddenly worse—he died at 3.30 on that Saturday afternoon—mother went for Mr. Southgate again on the Saturday, but he was at work, so Mrs. Southgate came in his place, and stopped with mother till the child died—my father came home</p>

               <p>between one and two; that is his usual time on the Saturday—he saw the child when he came home; he went upstairs and prayed—no doctor was called in—no doctor has ever been called in to any of the children.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29, Remford Road, Stratford—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of deceased child, James Senior, on September 27th—all the organs were healthy, with the ex-ception of the lungs and heart—the lungs were congested over a small area at the base of the right lung, and a narrow fringe at the front of the same lung was collapsed—the heart was merely flabby, but otherwise sound—the stomach was healthy, and contained a very small quantity of thin fluid and a few semi-digested grapes with the stones—the child was well nourished—in my opinion the child died from syncope, due to the congestion of the lungs; I did certify congestion of the lungs as the primary, and syncope of the heart as the secondary cause of death—the disease of the lungs was in an early stage—it might have been produced by an ordinary cold not attended to—in my judgment, the child's life would probably have been prolonged if medical aid had been called in—so far as I can speak, I feel convinced of it—I believe there is reason for saying that the life would probably have been saved—I have had many such cases under my treatment; it is a very common condition among children—there is well-recognized treatment among medical men for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found no marks of violence—the child was well</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189710250091"/>
               <p>nourished—I found very little in its stomach—there might be various causes for that—in my opinion sufficient nourishment had not been forced on the child, but I do not wish in any way to cast any reflection on the parents—it is a well-recognized fact that doctors and nurses are in the habit constantly of forcing nourishment on patients for their own benefit; it is a material part of the treatment—death was due to cardialgia; I do not think I said the vibration of the train had anything to do with that—I cannot say whether the child, being in a weak condition, the vibration of the train had done anything to accelerate that; the journey was one factor in producing weakness in the child—many children recover from this complaint without drugs—a good deal would depend on care and nourishment—in my opinion the child's life would have been prolonged had I or any other medical man have been called in—I believe I stated at the inquest that I could swear that had I been called in I could have prolonged the child's life—I do not know that the death rate of the Peculiar People is much below the average death rate; in this particular family the deaths are 50 percent.—I have no knowledge of the death rate of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Apart from the use of drugs, there is well<lb/>recognized treatment for congestion of the lungs in children—the forcing of nourish<lb/>ment is a very material point, but drugs are of great assistance—medical men would see to the forcing of nourishment, and stimulants, and poulticing, and the condition of the atmosphere in the room—from what I saw it was obvious that such treatment as I would have recommended had not been resorted to—nourishment had not been forced on the patient, and from evidence given here and at the inquest, I gather that remedial treatment had not been followed—there are well-recognized drugs that would have been of assistance; expectorants and remedies to relieve the cough might have given the child a quiet night, which would have had a great effect on its recovery—I am sure medical aid would have prolonged the child's life; otherwise my profession is absolutely useless.</p>

I am the Relieving Officer of St. Saviour's Union, and live at 11, Surrey Square—on September 29th I went with Dr. Ashby to 6, Preston Buildings, and into the two rooms occupied by the prisoner—she answered the door, and walked backwards into the room with which was apparently a bundle on her left arm—she walked towards a sofa and laid the bundle down, and then I saw it was a child—there was another child on the couch, aged about four; it looked very young—I opened that elder child's clothing and saw it was very emaciated and dirty; it was sitting in its own excrement; it was suffering from scarlet fever—it was removed under my order to the hospital—I then undid the bundle, which was the child Rose who died on October 2nd; it was in a worse condition than Willy—it was dirty; the bit of clothing it had on was covered with excrement and was very dirty indeed—there was a girl of about 11 in the room—the room was very dirty, but the girl, who is known in the neighbourhood as the little mother, had a pail of water and a small bit of cloth, and was trying to wipe the flooring in one corner of the room—in the adjoining room, used as a bed-room, there was scarcely any furniture but an iron bedstead, on which was a mattress and some dirty filthy rags, not enough for anyone, and the bed-clothing was begrimed with excrement—I asked her what she was feeding the children on—she asked me who I was—I told her, and introduced Dr. Ashby—she then pointed to the table, and said, "That is what I am feeding the child upon"—on the table there was a cup containing a yellowish fluid, which I told her smelt very stale—she said it was egg and milk—in my opinion it was not fit for food—I pressed her to allow me to remove the younger child to the infirmary, and the elder one of four to the fever hospital—she was very excited and incoherent, and I could get no defiaite reply from her—the stench was so overpowering that I left her for about half-an-hour, and returned again—she then permitted William to go, but, pointing to Rose, she said, "I won't let that go; you can see it will soon die"—she said, "I don't want you here; I have not sent for you; my husband is earning good wages; I want nothing from the parish"—I tried to ascertain from her where he worked—she could not say; but told me he left home about eight in the morning, and returned about midnight—I left a message with her saying, I desired to see her husband—he did not come—on Friday, October 1st, about twenty minutes before midnight, I went to the house, and saw the prisoner, her husband, and three children in the room—I called his attention to the sad neglect of the two children—he said, "I do not want you here"—at that time there was a fire in the room, and the child, apparently, had on better clothing, and was wrapped in a blanket—the condition of the child would appear to be</p>

                  </hi>. I am Coroner for the Reigate Division of Surrey, which includes Carshalton—in consequence of information received I held an inquest in proper form on the body of Harry Watts, at Carshalton, on September 16th—the prisoner was present—I said to him, "You are not bound to give evidence tending to criminate yourself, but what you say will be taken down, and if necessary, used for or against—he expressed a wish to give evidence, and this deposition, taken down by me, was read over to him afterwards, and he signed it—he made no correction." "<hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL GILBERT</hi>, after being cautioned, said, I wish to say all I know—I live at Wandle Mount, Carshalton—I am a labourer—I have known the deceased about ten months—I was in the King's Arms, Carshalton, on Monday evening, and deceased was there the second time I went, which was about 9.30, and he was not sober, and he asked for a half-a-pint of beer, and I gave him a penny to call for it—I did not see who supplied it, but Mr. and Mrs. May and the barmaid were in the bar at the time, and I saw him drink the beer, and afterwards there was a talk amongst some there about having half-a-pint of beer with gin in it, and deceased then said we would have some, and I said, "I will give it to you"—then I gave him twopence to pay for a pennyworth of beer and a pennyworth of gin, and I think the barmaid supplied him with that, and he tfien drank it straight off, and I then stood him another, and two other chaps, who I don't know, paid for the others—none of those drinks were interfered with—he then became noisy, and the potman put him outside—he was unable to stand, so was carried out by the potman, and I saw him lay him down just off the path and by the side of a private wall—I and another man afterwards carried him to</p>

               <p>in the park by the side of The Belt, when I noticed the pheasants running and flying out of The Belt—I went to see who was there—I saw Curtis in The Belt where he had no right to be—I asked him what he was doing—he said he had been doing a job for himself, meaning he had gone for a natural purpose—I noticed fur on his coat and something in his pockets—I said, "What have you in your pockets"—he said, "Not anything belonging to you"—I said, "I am going to see what you have got in your pockets"—I searched his coat pookets and took a rabbit out—we struggled and fell—he got up and kicked me with his right foot on the right shoulder, a very severe kick—afterwards I had no use in my arm—I cannot use it now—I got up and went out of The Belt—he drew an open knife at me and said, "I'll do four years for you"—he got out of The Belt, went into the road, and <hi rend="italic">pelted</hi> me with stones—the struggle was in the wood, and on my master's land.</p>

We went into a public-house about 12.30, just in time to have a drink, and we walked for an hour in the wrong direction, and then stopped the cab<lb/>man, and the policeman took us. I am innocent. Talbot will say that he is the only man who did it.</p>
