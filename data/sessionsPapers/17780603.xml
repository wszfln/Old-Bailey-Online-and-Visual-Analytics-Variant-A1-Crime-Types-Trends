The watchman and I came out, and the prisoner followed us; the watchman took hold of my right arm, and the prisoner took hold of my left, and asked me what countryman I was. I said a Herefordshire man; he said, he came from the same country, and talked very freely to me; just before we got to the watch-house I felt his hand in my pocket, and I felt the glove in his hand as he pulled it out, and he went off immediately; I did not pursue him, because as the other people were all strangers, I did not know, but they might all be concerned. I immediately lost sight of him, and did not know how to pursue him.</p>

I said, as it was that time of night, I could not tell; he said he had a sum of money about him, and should be glad of a lodging; I told him I would take him to the watch-house, to the constable of the night, where he would be safe; we went into the Horse-shoe, a public house, in <placeName id="t17780603-3-crimeloc10">Benjamin-street</placeName>

Edwards called to him, and asked him if he would come in? He said, no; it was late, he would get home. When they came into the watch-house, they bid him show his money; he felt in his pocket, and said his money was gone; he did not say how he lost it; he only said it was gone; I believe he did not know how he lost it. I don't believe the prosecutor knew who had hold of him by the left arm, till the Monday morning. The prisoner was not mentioned till Monday morning by the prosecutor, not by the watchman. The prisoner asked me as he went out of the public house, which pocket he put his money into. I told him his right hand pocket.</p>

On the 20th of May, about five in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to look at some lace; they said, they wanted some lace for a cap; they wanted a cap made up. I desired my sister to wait on them; they said, they wanted some very nice lace; they looked over a number of laces; in ten minutes after, Mr. Moravia came into the shop about some business with me. I left my sister, showing the prisoners the lace,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030008"/> and talked with Mr. Moravia in the farther part of the shop; I stayed there about ten minutes; he then went back, and spoke to my sister; he came back again to me in one minute, I believe; I went behind the counter again, and asked my sister if she could not please the ladies: she said, no, she could not; she seemed much confused; she wanted to pass me; I said, I believed, there was a lace that would suit the ladies; I looked in the box; I could not see it; my sister gave me a nudge on the toe with her foot, giving me to understand that she suspected them; I took a piece of lace from the window, and recommended it to Mrs. Hollis, and asked if that would not suit her: she said, no; it was not fine enough, and she hoped I would not wish her to buy lace that did not please her, that she would go else where and buy lace, and bring it, if we would make it up for her. Mrs. Hollis then ordered half a yard of gauze to be cut off, and paid a shilling for it; then they went out of the shop; my sister as soon as they were gone said, she was sure they had stole some lace. I went out, and took hold of one by one hand, and the other by the other, and desired them to come back again, for I suspected they had stole lace; I desired Mr. Moravia to watch that they did not drop any; he said he would, as soon as they came within the shop, Mr. Moravia said, here are two pieces of lace dropped; my sister immediately stooped, and picked them up. I did not see them dropped, but I saw my sister pick them up from the floor; I made them go into the back room, behind the shop, and sent for a constable, and searched them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing upon Hollis? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>When you went out after them, and told them you suspected they had stole lace; Did Mrs. Hollis make the least objection to going back? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL MORAVIA sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of May I went to the prosecutor's to settle an account with him; when I came in, I saw the two prisoners cheapening some lace; I did not take any notice of them; they were very genteelly dressed; I thought they had a mind to buy lace; I went to the farther end of the shop with Mr. Wateridge; I told him what my business was; we stood talking two or three minutes; he said he would settle with me presently; I went to the farther end of the shop back again, and the sister looked at me very earnestly, and said to me, did you tell my brother what I told you this morning? I observed she was rather confused. I went back to her brother at the other end of the shop, and said, your sister looks confused, as if they had stole lace; go round the counter. He said, no; he did not think they looked like any thing of the kind; he went round; I walked to the farther end of the shop; I saw them looking at one card and at another. Mr. Wateridge showed them several cards of lace; at last he took one from the window, and said, I think that lace will suit you very well. Mrs. Hollis said, no; I think this is not good enough; I think to have a very good lace, and you would not have me lay out my money without I could please myself. Before she went out, she said, she would go and seek for lace somewhere else that might please her better, and if so, she would come back again, and she supposed they would have no objection to make the cap for her, if she got the lace elsewhere. He said, no; he said to Mrs. Mitchell, don't you want any thing? she said, yes; she wanted half a yard of gauze; they purchased that, paid for it, and then went out; as soon as ever they were gone out, the sister said, she believed they had taken some lace away. He asked me to go with him, and see that they did not drop it; we went out, and he caught them both by the arms; he desired me to keep behind, and see that they did not drop it; they made no objection to coming back to the shop. Hollis went in first, Mitchell followed her; as Mitchell was going in, I saw a piece of lace upon a card, and the other piece that is loose drop from under either her cloak or gown. I said to the prosecutor's sister, there, they have dropped the lace; she picked it up; they were taken backwards into the back room that adjoins the shop, and I went for a constable; the constable came, and they were both searched; there was nothing found upon them, but two or three bits of ribbond concealed under Mitchell's stays;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030009"/> they seemed to be very easy; they said, they knew they were very innocent, and not guilty of what they were charged with. The constable found but 7 d. or 8 d. about them, though they were bargaining for lace of 7 s. or 8 s. a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The lace they were about buying, if they had met with any to the liking of Mrs. Hollis, was to have been put upon a cap, was it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then there was no occasion for money to pay for it then?</p>
               <p>Witness. This is the lace I saw drop from Mitchell.</p>
               <p>What is it worth a yard? - Five shillings. I import lace. I sold this lace to Mr. Wateridge the day before.</p>
               <p>MITCHELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never had a bit of lace in his shop. I met Mrs. Hollis accidentally; she said she was going to bespeak a new cap, so I went in with her.</p>
               <p>Hollis was not put upon her defence.</p>
               <p>(Mitchell called five witnesses, who gave her a very good character.)</p>

As soon as the woman passed, they called to me to stop, and said, blast your eyes, if you don't deliver your money, I will blow your brains out! I did not give them the money directly, on which Dracott snapt his pistol; I bid them take away the pistol, and I would give them my money; there was a person coming up, and the biggest, which I believe to be Webber,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030010"/> turned round, and held out his pistol, and said, if he came a step farther, he would shoot him. Mr. Stratton coming up, they snatched my watch, and ran away; two ran down a lane, and the other, (which was Mills) ran up the town; I pursued him; he was stopped by a Mr. Hatfield, a shoe-maker; I never lost sight of him; Mr. Stratton and his brother pursued the others; in about a quarter of an hour after, I saw Dracott brought down the town; I knew him again immediately, and should know him from ten thousand.</p>

               <p>I passed Mr. Dickens that evening by the watch-box; there were three men behind the watch box; I can take my oath that the prisoner Mills was one of them; they all stood together; as soon as I had passed Mr. Dickens, they all came out upon him; I heard them say, now is the time; and then I heard them say, d - n your eyes, deliver your money! I was frightened, and went away as fast as I could; just after that, I heard a cry of stop thief! I met Mr. Hatfield, and told him to make haste, for that three men were robbing a gentleman; as Mr. Hatfield and I were together, Mills came full butt at us; Mr. Hatfield had a firkin of butter; he threw it down, and stopped him; Mr. Hatfield had a stick; Mills knocked it out of his hand.

I am certain the prisoner was one of them; he was taken almost immediately. Mr. Cornwall's washerwoman used to hang her linen on the hedge of the field next to mine.</p>

I found the door on the single lock; I left it double locked when I went out; when I opened it, three men rushed through the passage, out of the house, into the street. I am positive the prisoners are two of the men, though they were not both dressed as they are now; one was in a green coat, the other in a light; one of them was taken immediately, and was admitted an evidence. The things that were lost, part belonged to my master, and part to myself; the sword and the shoes were my master's; they were kept in the closet up one pair of stairs; what I lost, which were a silk handkerchief and two silver tea spoons, were kept in the back kitchen. I had used the spoons that day, and had the handkerchief about me very lately. I had seen the sword hanging up a few days before in the closet; the sword was found by a witness in the street, and the shoes were left in a bag at the bottom of the kitchen stairs.</p>

I took no notice of them, but when the outcry was made, I came out and mentioned what I had seen; it was so light, I could distinguish them very plainly, and they walked about so much in the street, that I took particular notice of them.</p>

I had not seen them from the Friday, for another person fed them, but when I came to the stye on Monday morning the 11th of May, I missed three pigs out of the five; they might be worth more than 6 s. a piece; the stye is about two furlongs from the house. Mr. Carr came to Hampstead on the 26th, and told me that he had seen his pigs; I went the next day to town, and found the pigs shut up in a back place, at the George Inn, in Long-Acre. I can swear to the three pigs; the next day I carried them to the sow.</p>
               <p>How do you swear to the pigs? - By the marks that they had, AND THE SOW WOULD SWEAR TO THEM TOO; for when I carried them home, the sow and they perfectly well knew one another, and the pigs began to suck immediately.</p>

               <p>I am one of Sir John Fielding's men; I received an information against the prisoner for robbing Lord Onslow's fowl-house. I went down to the prisoner's house, at Clapton, when I came there: the prisoner had left his house; this was on the 14th of May, on Monday the 18th I saw him in Hatton-street, in a cart, selling turkeys. I laid hold of the cart and horse, and the prisoner not choosing to tell where he lived, in order to find out his dwelling-house, I let the horse take his own way with the cart, and the horse went down to the prisoner's house at Hoxton. I found his wife in the house; I knew her, and in searching, I found five pigs in the stable; his wife looked out at the window; I took the five pigs, and brought them to the George Inn, Long-Acre: these pigs were the same which were afterwards shown to King, and he swore to three of them; King described the pigs before he saw them.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher; I live in Goswell-street, and deal in Smithfield-market; I have no shop. I was in Smithfield on the 15th of May, and there I saw a man cheapen six pigs; I believe the prisoner to be the same man.</p>
               <p>What sort of pigs were they? - Prick ear ones of the Norfolk kind.</p>
               <p>How large were they? - They might be worth seven or eight shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>How came you to trouble yourself about these pigs? - I bid the man money before; six shillings.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner bought them, or no? - I cannot tell; I did not see him buy them.</p>
               <p>What colour were the pigs? - Spotted.</p>
               <p>All spotted? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were they all of the same size? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no conversation with the prisoner at the time? - No; never in my life, other than seeing him about Smithfield-market.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to appear here, since you are as you say, a stranger to the prisoner? - I heard the man was in custody.</p>

She said, do not shut the door, my husband is coming in: my husband then missed a bundle of stockings. I went to fetch a constable, and saw the prisoner, at the corner of George-yard, with the stockings under his coat; he attempted to run away; I laid hold of his coat, upon which he dropped the stockings, and a man took them up.</p>

               <p>I am a coach wheelwright; this coal-yard runs parellel with Holborn, and comes into Drury-lane. I saw this child crawling in the foot-path; its head was off the kirb stone; I followed the cart all the way from Short's Gardens; the prisoner was coming along the foot-path, on the same side where the child was lying.</p>
               <p>Do you think he saw the child? - He must see the child, when he was going past it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he step over the child? - No; he walked by.</p>
               <p>How do you know he saw it? - He went by the child; I screamed out before the wheel touched the child; I saw the child for the space of half a minute before the wheel went over it; I screamed out just as the wheel was going over the child, and then it was not in the prisoner's power to stop it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner cry out wo? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any body by to take care of the child? - No.</p>

The reason why I went to the window, was, I had a writ out against me; the other man came right up into the room.</p>

               <p>This woman washes for me, and the shirt I had hung at the fire when these men came into the room, this woman told me, if I would come up in the afternoon, that she would wash it, and get it done for me against Monday evening; when I went up, I saw a tall man and these men in the room; I set myself down by the chest of drawers, and I had not been in two minutes before these men came; that man was by the fire side; he took up a poker, and began to beat this young man as he was half out of the window; I said, don't hurt the young man; then he hit me on the head with the poker, and cut my head; I went to get out of the room, and the man that stands here knocked me all down stairs, and after I fell down, he came down after me, and beat me with the poker.</p>

               <p>I am overseer to Mr. Baldwin.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoners? - Yes; I know them both; one was an apprentice in the house; but I knew nothing of the woman till she brought the information. I went with the clerk to Pearce's lodgings to see about the paper; she said, though she was concerned with him, he was so great a villain she would do any thing she could to get rid of him. I went and found the paper at Mr. Kettle's; then I went in search of Blake. As soon as Blake found the woman had betrayed him, he told me the woman was equally concerned with him; that she was as guilty as he was; that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030030"/> went with him, knowing he was going to rob his master. I promised him nothing. After he was fully committed, he confessed twice to me that he took the paper.</p>
               <p>- KETTLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a chandler's-shop in Union Court, Holborn: Blake sold me twelve quires of paper; this is the whole of it (producing it) he brought a quire first, and asked me if I would buy any of that paper; I looked at it; it was a damaged quire. I asked him if he had any more; he said he had, and brought the rest; he asked me three shillings, I gave him half a crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selfe. I have compared the paper with that which is at home; it exactly corresponds both as to size and marks. I have no doubt of its being Mr. Baldwin's property. The paper was made for a particular piece of work - Johnson's Poets. Upon the woman's information we examined and missed the paper.</p>
               <p>Question from Blake. Ask Mr. Selfe if ever I was near the house since I was out of my time, which was two years ago? - Yes, my Lord, and he knows I have frequently bid him go out.</p>
               <p>BLAKE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A young fellow, one Clews, brought this paper to me; he is a barber; he said he was going to Bath, and bid me make the best of it. I sold it to that man.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of May I saw the prisoner in Barbican, with a bundle under his arm; I followed him into Aldersgate-street, and stopped him; he said he found it under a cart in Aldersgate-street; it had rained that morning; I examined it, it was not dirty; I opened it, and finding it damp, I said I thought it had been stole out of a cart or waggon coming from some callico printers; I showed it to a draper in Bridge's-street, who knew the mark, and the prosecutor was sent for.</p>
               <p>[It was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

I said, I cannot; put your hands into my pocket and feel, I have no more, I have nothing here but my keys; he said, I live just by, I will show you the shop where I live, go over with me, I will take no advantage of you, but take care what you do; it is only to give you a bill of the shop, that you may not forget where I live; upon that I went over with him to the shop; I said, I don't want to go into the shop, for I was afraid of confederates, as I was all alone; but I went into the shop; he called out to two women that were sitting there, give me a bill of the shop this minute; they gave him one, and he gave it to me, then he asked again if I had no money; I told him, I had not, and then we parted; it was a trimming shop, two doors on the Westminster side of Cragg's court; it is now turned into a milliner's; all those people are gone away. My first idea was to go to my lawyer; I recollected that I had been weak enough to give him money, for before I parted with him, he said, be sure you come, for remember you have given me money; that was the burthen of his song, be sure you come, remember you have given me money. I went part of the way next morning to my attorney, and then upon reflecting how weak I had been, I thought it better to comply with my appointment; accordingly I wrapped up five guineas in a piece of paper; I passed the shop, looked into it, and turned up a little alley; he presently followed me, and I gave him the five guineas. Sir, said I, this is a wretched way of getting money, and I am a wretched fool for giving it you, but as I have been a fool in the first instance, I cannot help it, and I must pay for my folly; he received it with the greatest thanks; he asked for a few shillings to buy a pair of breeches; I gave them to him; he said that he was extremely poor; that he had no manner of living; his creditors were numerous, and he was forced to this. I said, though I have been injured by you, I am sorry to see a poor fellow creature in this way; that was I a great man, I would even compassionate a poor man; he then asked me if I could get him a place. I gave him a false direction, and a fictitious name, and then came away.</p>

            's, when you made this charge against him? - He offered to fall down upon his knees, and ask my pardon in the most submissive manner; he said, Sir, I ask your pardon ten thousand times over! I declined accepting any such submission, and was bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>The person you met in the park you had never seen before? - Never.</p>
               <p>He was in a very shabby dress? - Yes, in a shabby large great coat.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see him? - By the lamp, just by Carleton house, where he spoke to me; he was just by the first lamp, about one hundred yards from the Mall.</p>
               <p>Were many persons passing by? - There were persons passing by, a few, when first he spoke to me; it was so light that one could discern, but it was not moon-light, nor was it a bad night.</p>
               <p>How far off does the centinel stand? - It was some way before we came to the centinel, and I in the course of conversation inclined down to the left.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030034"/>How far was you from the centinel, when he first laid hold of you? - I dare say farther than the length of this court.</p>
               <p>You did not turn about to go to the centinel at all? - No, for till he seized me, I had no ideal what he meant.</p>
               <p>Then you must have passed some centinel? - I do not, remember we passed any centinel; I believe there is not one between the Spring-garden gate and Carleton house.</p>
               <p>When he laid hold of you, you was within the distance of being heard by the centinel? - I was as much afraid of being heard as he was; when he made use of the word attempt; I was afraid of confederates; I was afraid it was a laid scheme.</p>
               <p>There were no arms produced by the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the fear that you had was that there might be other confederates? - My fear was of my character.</p>
               <p>You thought there might be other people concerned? - I did not know.</p>
               <p>The man did not know where you lived? - No; he told me the last time that he knew where I was to be found, but I do not know that he did; I lived then in Lancaster-court, and I go often down to Westminster, and therefore could not avoid him.</p>
               <p>Going the next day with the five guineas was a voluntary act of your own? - Going with that was in consequence of the advantage I had given him, by giving him the first money, because I thought to have got rid of him by that.</p>
               <p>But you might have called out? - I was afraid of confederates.</p>
               <p>But the soldier, the centinel, could not be a confederate? - I feared, that if I had called out he might have confederates, who might accuse me to the soldiers.</p>

               <p>Court. You did not know him then? -</p>
               <p>I did not; I suspected that it was Mr. Dawson, the person I wanted, but I was not certain. I took his wife down stairs into another room, and asked her why she said he was not her husband, and then I discovered that he was Dawson. I then took him down stairs into the bed-room, and searched the bureau, and there I found these three punches and a watch-case (producing the punches); I delivered the watch-case to the Assay Master.</p>
               <p>(It was produced by the Assay Master.)</p>
               <p>Clarke. This is the same I found; there is a piece put on one of the punches; I believe it had been broke, and that was put on to preserve it; he acknowledged the room to be his, and he put on his wig and clothes in it.</p>
               <p>Was the bureau locked? - It was.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the key? - I cannot say; either the wife or him; there was no one else in the room.</p>

               <p>I am the senior Assay Master of the Goldsmiths company; I have assayed the watch-case; it is eight penny weights worse than standard; it is marked with a Lion, a Leopard's Head, and the letter B, which is the mark we use. The B is the mark for the year.</p>
               <p>What do you call the Lion? - A Lion Passant. These marks are in imitation of our's, but are not the real marks.</p>
               <p>Would they pass with persons that are not conversant with the company's marks? - I believe they might. I struck the marks with the punches found in the possession of the prisoner, on a piece of silver. The witness produced it, and a watch-case, with the real marks of the company, which were compared by the jury.]</p>

               <p>On Wednesday night, the 22d of April, at about half after ten o'clock, a man came to me, and said, Scott, I am come from the King's printer, Mr. Strahan, and want you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030039"/> to stick up some bills to-morrow morning; you stick up bills for him? - I said, yes; he said I must stick some round the 'Change, and one at Wood-street, where war was to be proclaimed, and asked what he must give me; I said, how many was there? he said, only a dozen; I said I would not charge Mr. Strahan any thing for that; he said, he desired I should be paid, and asked if five shilling, would do; I said it was too much; he said no, and gave it me; he said it was not a thing that happened every day. I stuck one up at Wood-street, nine about the 'Change, and put one in my pocket. At eight in the morning I went afterwards to Justice Girdler to make affidavit of a fire that had happened, and told Justice Girdler what I had done; I gave him one, and he kept it, and has it now, I believe. I went into the Golden Cross, opposite, and

               <p>How were they carried to him? - By any of the servants; but we never print any declarations or proclamations like that; we print them in a different manner and style; there is a very Large King's arms on the top, in the first place.</p>
               <p>Was the difference so great, that he having been accustomed to Mr. Strahan's must have known it? - I cannot say that; I believe a person that reads it must know it to be forged.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - I have seen him before, not to be particularly acquainted; the landlord drank with us; and as he had a shilling's worth, I desired my shilling's worth to be brought; it was, and in came Lindall, the waiter, and his mistress; the deceased was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>What are the two prisoners? - Lindall is the <rs id="t17780603-69-deflabel333" type="occupation">waiter</rs>

He said he should not be turned out, for Mr. Lefevre was rather in liquor, and he would send a man home with him; they directly both replied he should be turned out, and got up to turn him out. The landlord went out first, and the waiter went and seized his master; his master said, will you turn me out of my own house? and he had a struggle with his master. Then the woman went behind her husband, and laid hold of the deceased, and pulled him out of the box, and he fell with his head against the door of the bar, against the hinge or somewhere there abouts.</p>
               <p>Was he so drunk, that he fell down as a dead weight, on her pulling him out of the box? - No; he was as able to walk as I am now. I being a stranger, thought the man ill-used, and interfered; the waiter said he would serve every one of us so; on that, the waiter quitted his master, and dragged Mr. Lefevre along the floor, and threw him down the steps into the street. There are, I believe, three stone steps, and a wooden one. I never saw him move after the first fall.</p>
               <p>Was he on his legs when he threw him down, or did he drag him along the floor and roll him down? - He rolled him down, I never saw him stir any more. The waiter came back directly and laid hold of the soldier that was in the house and threw him out; he said he would throw me out; I said he should not, if he did he must take the consequence, 'I would strike him; I said I would not be thrown out, I would go out, and I went out, and they flapped the door, and bolted it. I got a coach, and took the deceased home; he lived in Shoreditch; I carried him up stairs and undressed him; I never saw him stir! I went home, and heard no more of it for three or four days.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - No; I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>How was the soldier? - Very sober; else he would have fared the same fate.</p>
               <p>Was the landlord sober? - He was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>You say the deceased could walk? - Yes; I saw him walk about the room just before.</p>
               <p>Was the deceased desired by the landlady to go out? - He was not desired; she said turn him out! he made no answer at all; she insisted upon his being thrown out.</p>
               <p>He made no resistance? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose she was strong enough to drag him out of the box and throw him down? - She certainly was, for I saw her do it. There was nobody in the tap-room at the time, but myself, the soldier, and their own servants.</p>
               <p>He never got his legs again; the waiter drew him along the floor through the passage, and rolled him down the steps? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030041"/>Did you follow him to the door? - Yes, to the passage door; he threw him out of the other door; I interposed, and he shoved me on one side.</p>
               <p>I wonder as you was shoved out of the way and ill-used; you did not knock the fellow down? - I did not like to make any disturbance.</p>
