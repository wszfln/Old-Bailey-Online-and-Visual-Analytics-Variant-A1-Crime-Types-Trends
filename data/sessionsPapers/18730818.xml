                  </hi>. I am a tailor and army clothier, carrying on business, in partnership with my son, at 35, Savile Row—I know the prisoner Austin Bidwell by the name of Warren, and Macdonnell by the name of Swift—I recollect their calling upon me in April, I believe about the 18th, with another person, to order some clothes—it is my practice, when persons call to order clothes, to ask them to sign a book, which I produce—the two prisoners signed theirs, Austin Bidwell as F. A. Warren, and Macdonnell as Edward R. Swift, both of 21, Enfield Road, Haggerstone; the third person, I believe, did not sign, I don't recollect him; he was introduced by the name of Siebert—I made them a considerable quautity of clothes—on the 4th of May the same two prisoners called again in a cab,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180006"/>
               <p>and I think with a third party, but that I won't swear—they tried on the clothes I had made for them—we entered into conversation, and I under<lb/>stood them to say they were going to visit Ireland; they did not say when; they had a eab at the door, with luggage on it, and they said they were in a hurry to catch the train; I understood that they were going to Birming<lb/>ham first, then to Liverpool, and from Liverpool to Ireland—in the course of conversation Austin Bidwell said he had more money than he thought it prudent to leave at his lodging or hotel—I said "Is it of any amount?"—he said "Yes, it is some amount"—I think he said about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that being the case, I declined to take charge of it, and said "I should recommend you to deposit it with some bank; my banker's is close at hand"—he said "We have very little time to spare, we are in a hurry to get a train"—I said "It will not take you long; I can take you down there"—I then accompanied him to the Western Branch of the Bank of England, where I kept an account—I saw Mr. Fenwick, the sub-manager—Mr. Pimm was the manager at that time, he was then absent—I introduced Austin Bidwell to Mr. Fenwick, describing him as an American gentleman and a customer of mine, and that he had a certain sum of money that he wished to deposit—I think I mentioned his name as Warren—he was alone with me—the signature-book was then brought for him to write his name and address—I think Mr. Fenwick asked how he was to be described, and he said as an agent, I think—he handed the money to Mr. Fenwick—I think I was present when he signed the book—Mr. Fenwick gave him a cheque<lb/>book—he said that more money would be remitted to him in the course of a week, I think 1,000<hi rend="italic">I.</hi>, and how should he manage, should it come through me—Mr. Fenwick replied that there was no occasion for that now, as he had opened the account there was no occasion to trouble me—we then returned to Savile Row, and the three parties left in the cab; at all events, Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell did—I fancy I saw them afterwards two or three times at our place of business—I sent the clothes to the address they gave—the first order went to Enfield Road, Haggerstone.</p>

A. Warren, 21, Enfield Road, Haggerstone"—there is no date put—I cannot tell you when that signature was written—the first time he came he was in company with Macdonnell; I won't swear that there was anyone else at that time, or on 4th May, but I fancy there was; yes, I think there was—there was more than one person with him when he came on 4th May, and when we came back from the bank there was more than one person waiting for him—when I was examined before I don't think I mentioned any other person but Swift as waiting for him—I don't think I suggested to him to put the money in my bank—he wanted to leave it with me, and I suggested that I should not like to have so much money left with me, and he had better put it into the bank—I introduced the name of the banker to him—I told him that the bank was in Burlington Gardens, close by, and then he said he would go with me to the bank—the principal part of the money he handed over was bank notes—he gave the same name at the bank that he had given to me—I had seen him more than once before the 4th May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now, and was in May last year, the sub agent of the Bank of England at the Western Branch in Burlington Gardens—Mr. Green was a customer of oars at that time—I recollect his coming to the Bank on 4th May with a strange person; it was the prisoner Austin Bidwell—he was introduced by Mr. Green as Mr. Warren, an American gentleman, who had a considerable amount of money which he wanted taken care of—I inquired of Austin Bidwell his name, and he said "Warren"—the signature-book was produced, this is it, and he wrote this "F. A. Warren"—I asked him to write his name in full, and he then wrote "Frederick Albert Warren"—they are both here—he gave his address "Golden Cross Hotel"—he wrote that himself—I asked him how I should describe him; he did not give me an answer exactly at once; he then gave me to under<lb/>stand that he was over here on business—I can't remember his exact words—he said he had acted more as an agent for others than for himself—I said "Then shall I describe you as a commission agent?" and he said "Yes"—I entered his description in our ledger—he opened the account with a sum of 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him a cheque-book—the numbers in it were Q R 16, 501 to 16, 550, to bearer—this credit-slip was made out at the time; I wrote it in his presence—I said a pass-book should be prepared for him, and be ready when he called—I believe he afterwards called for it—he said he should have more money to pay in, and he asked me if it must come through Mr. Green—I told him that was not necessary—after that I did not transact much business with him myself—I remember seeing him on 17th January this year, at the Bank, in the agent's room—Colonel Francis, the agent and manager, was there at the time—after a little conversation about various incidental matters, he threw down this bill of Rothschild's for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the agent's table, and said "There, I suppose that is good enough paper for you"—he spoke on that occasion about his business, about sleeping cars; he said that he hoped to see the sleeping-cars introduced shortly abroad, so that our English tourists might use them in going to the Exhibition at Vienna—he also stated that he had the choice of three different factories at Birmingham, and that he was going there at once, and he hoped to commence business by the 1st February—he mentioned also a patent break, and also a signal light for placing in front of the engines—when he put down the bill, he asked to have it discounted—Colonel Fraser acceded to his request—that was a genuine bill, and was subsequently paid—his account continued at the Bank until 1st March—I think his pass<lb/>book was sent to him once before that; we never received it back—when it was sent to him it contained all the paid cheques up to the date of making up the pass-book, as is our custom—we have some credit-slips here made</p>

               <p>out in his handwriting, between May and August, 1872—it is the practice for a customer to sign when he receives a cheque-book—Warren received two cheque-books; he received the second on 3rd January—that was one hundred cheques, payable to order, Nos. Q Q 82, 801 to 82, 900—I have the cheque signature-book here, with his signature, "F. A. Warren" on both occasions, 4th May, 1872, and 3rd January, 1873—we put down the letters and numbers of the cheque in the book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MCINTYRE</hi>. When he was first introduced to me he mentioned his address as the Golden Cross Hotel as well as wrote it—I have that book here—these are my initials, to certify that I saw him write it—I did not make inquiries at the Golden Cross—I wrote out the first credit-slip; it is amongst these—it is all my writing—"Bank of England notes, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., coin 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drafts, cheques, &amp;c., 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that was one cheque on the Continental Bank for 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the amount he paid in on that day—I next received money from him on 13th May—I did not myself see him write these credit slips—they are paid in over the counter in the ordinary way of business—I am speaking to them from the knowledge I have of his handwriting, from seeing him write his signature in the book—I saw him write in the stamped cheque-book on the same occasion, on 4th May—this second column is not for the address; it is in case it is given to some other person than has an account—I was not present when these credit-slips were handed in with the accounts—I can't exactly say whether I saw him in June last year—I do not recollect his speaking to me in June about closing his account at our bank; I don't recollect it at all—to the best of my belief he did not; I am not aware that he ever spoke to me on that subject—I will swear that he did not speak to me about closing his account during last year, nor did I advise him not to close it—I never remember his speaking to me about closing it—it is such a common thing for persons to say that when their balance is low, but I don't remember it at all—his balance was low at the end of May—I did not see him write this other signature in our signature-book—the Golden Cross is the only address he gave us—I did not give him the pass-book myself—I am not sure that it is known exactly who gave it to him—the first time it was sent on by post to Birmingham—I did not send it; it was sent by the pass<lb/>book clerk.</p>

               <p>down in my room—in the course of conversation he told me generally what he had come over to England for; he said that he had come over to introduce sundry American inventions, first and foremost among which was the sleeping oars, and some other inventions, but that was the principal one—he also spoke about a steam break, and I asked him some particulars about it which he declined to tell me, as it was a secret—he said he hoped to have the cars running on the line between Paris and Vienna, so that all the visitors at the forthcoming Exhibition might make use of them, and that no country in future would be able to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> without them; that he hoped afterwards to introduce a Company for the same purpose into England, and that then he hoped to have a good account at the Branch—but I understood him to say that at that time he was simply wishing to introduce them on this foreign line, from Paris to Vienna—he said he was going to work at Birmingham—I don't think anything more was said about Birmingham at that time; that was the substance of the conversation—he told me that he came from America, and there was no doubt of it—the sleeping ears are American cars—I undertook to take charge of the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Portuguese bonds for him, and filled up one of our forms and he signed it in my presence—this is it—it is simply a request to hold, it is an office voucher for us, he signed it in my presence: "London, 3rd September, 1872. The cashiers of the Bank receive and hold the undermentioned securities amounting to 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of F. A. Warren.

Three of the acceptances on three of the bills are the same as three in the batch of 7th December; they purport to be the same acceptors—those bills were discounted and the account credited with the amount—they were presented when they became due on 31st March, 3rd April, and 14th April, and were returned as forged—on 22nd January, I recieved from Birmingham this registered letter and memo<lb/>randum of bills, dates, and amounts—I do not undertake to say that the letter is in Warren's writing—I do not think it is his signature, but I should say that it is an imitation of it—I took it at the time as Warren's signature, having no suspicion—the endorsement on the eight bills, is, I should say, an imitation of his, there are certain little characteristics wanting—I took them at the time as his endorsement, and they were discounted and Warren's account was credited with the amount.

I have been the manager of a bank about thirteen years—I was in the Army before that—I was sub-agent for a bank at Leeds, agent at Hull, and afterwards at the Western Branch—I entered on my duties at the Western Branch on 3rd March, 1872—I was sub-agent and agent to the Bank of England—I succeeded Mr. Pimm—I did not go over the accounts with him; I bad a sub-manager, who could give me all the information—we have the addresses of every customer in our books—my attention was called to Warren's account at the close of August, on my return from leave on the 29th—I did not go through the account—an ordinary drawing account would not be allowed to be over<lb/>drawn, and it would not matter where his address was—the only address I had was the Golden Cross Hotel—he was simply described in the ledger as a commission agent, at that address—that is in the ledger—I did not make inquiries at the Golden Cross Hotel about him—the account commenced with a payment of 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the way that has been described—I have only a list of bills and the account—a great portion of the account was withdrawn on my return in August; the balance must have been under 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of August; it was about 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid in on the 26th and 27th August 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—the account stood at 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 3rd September—page 155 of the depositions shows both sides of the account—on 3rd September he brought 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Portuguese Bonds—I did not then make inquiries as to</p>

               <p>his address—he gave me no address at Birmingham, except "Post Office, Birmingham"—the Portuguese Bonds were sold, and we placed the amount to his credit on 14th September—he drew out upon that account by a cheque to Jay Cook of 3,030<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which you will see in the account on the 14th—it must hare been the old cheque-book—I discounted these bills on 29th November—they were dated 31st October, and were Suse and Sibbeth's; two bills of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell whether it was the 26th or 29th when he asked me to discount them; I am doubtful whether it was on the 26th or 29th I saw him—I cannot recollect if I discounted the bills the same day I saw him—I did tell him I would make inquiries about them—I did so, at my head office only—the balance in his favour then was 1, 658<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the two bills I discounted are here—they were payable in London—I did not make inquiries at the place in the City where they were payable; that would not be usual—I cannot say what I led him to believe—from what they said at my head office in answer to my inquiries I discounted the bills—I am not aware if I saw him between the 29th November and the 23rd December—I received on 30th December a letter of the 28th, containing some bills—all his bills received before 21st January were genuine, and paid at maturity—I wrote to him at the Post Office, Birming<lb/>ham at his request, and only there—the bills were acknowledged—the Bank of England has a branch at Birmingham—the first letter I received from Warren was the one containing the batch of bills which were discounted on 30th December—I had no letter from him between 28th December and 21st January, 1873, nor before 28th December—the letter of 21st January did not strike me as being different from that of 28th December—it is somewhat different—there, is a general similarity between all the letters after the 21st January, which, without suspicion being excited, would not attract attention—I believed all the' letters to be in the handwriting of Warren—I cannot say when I changed my opinion, but it was after a process of study—I do not know anything about Mr. Chabot; I have only seen him to speak to him quite lately—I do not know that the documents were submitted to him—I see that the letter of 21st January is much more cramped—the signature is larger than the body of the letter—it appears to be written with the same ink—with my present knowledge I would not say that the letter is in the handwriting of Warren—I do not say that the signature was written at the same time—I think the signature is Warren's—the colour of the ink is very much like the colour of the ink in the writing; it looks pretty much the same colour—the signature is not a stiff writing; I think it is quite as free a signature as those in the other letters; look at the two "r's"—I don't know that it was after the last examination that I changed my opinion as to these other letters being in Warren's hand<lb/>writing; I don't know when the last examination was about handwriting—I don't know that it was when I found he was not in this country at the time these letters were written from Birmingham that I changed my opinion—I did not learn that for a considerable time—it may have been so; first of all I thought they were his writing, and afterwards I thought not—I did afterwards find from inquiry that he was out of the country at the time those letters bear date—I also compared the writing—it may possibly have been one thing that made me change my opinion; I don't think that was altogether the reason that made me change my opinion in the first instance; very likely that induced me to make further comparison of the letters—the indorsements on the bills after 21st January are much more like his</p>

               <p>signature than a great many of his writings that I have seen—I think they are not his writing—I believe the indorsements on these three bills that came in the letter of 21st January are in Warren's writing—I don't know whether these signatures have been submitted to Mr. Chabot—these indorsements have all the little peculiarities of his signature—I don't think they are suffer than the signature to his letter of 28th December; I think they are written freely—there are several peculiarities, and one is in the stroke of the "f" and the crossing in the stroke of the "f"; he never joins the crossing of the stroke of the "f" to the crossing—I have had that peculiarity pointed out to me; not by Mr. Chabot—it was not my own discovery in the first instance—when he was with me on 17th January he certainly looked very ill—I don't think he was ever at the bank after that day, I never saw him—the stamp of the London and Westminster Bank on the bill which is the subject of this indictment, is about the same as on the genuine bill we had—I don't think it is exactly like the other bills we had of theirs, there is a peculiarity in the stamp; here is a "B in the word bank not finished, that is a peculiarity that might easily have escaped in finishing the stamp—I noticed it at the time—I made inquiries to this extent, that all the bills for a very considerable period were shown at head<lb/>quarters previously to being discounted; I either took or sent them to the head-office to see whether I should discount them before they were dis<lb/>counted—I was discounting to a very great extent, from 21st January to 28th February upwards of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for a man whose only address was "Post-office, Birmingham"—we have not many of those sort of things in our bank—the bills came in very sharp indeed after the 21st January—all these bills were submitted to head-quarters, and his address also; the bills were of a very first-rate class, and I suppose stood upon their own merits—from 14th May up to the end of December everything I did for him, including discounting bills, was 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but in this one month, from 21st January to 28th February, I did bills to the amount of upwards of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made no inquiries at Birmingham and caused none to be made—the cheques commence on 19th February, the pass-book left the bank on 17th February—our post-book shows that it was dispatched on that day, it was sent by post to "Post-office, Birmingham"—I don't know whether that was in answer to any communication; I don't find any written request among his letters; it is not unusual to send a man's pass-book periodically—that address had always found him—I have no memorandum showing under what circum<lb/>stances I sent it—the ledger has a mark in it on 17th February which shows it was sent; my chief clerk informed me that it was sent on 17th February—he is not here—it is usual to put a sort of mark in the ledger, the date up to which the account is made when the pass-book is sent—it would be in the post-book, the letter clerk would enter it in his post-book as dispatched—there would be no account of the circumstances under which it was sent; the request may have been a verbal one, but I don't know anything of it, I find nothing in writing about it, I have searched to see—I have produced all the papers that purport to come from Warren, they have been produced here to-day—I did not myself take the bills of Blydenstein over to their office on 28th February—they went down by a clerk who goes to the City; he generally goes about 1.30 or so—those cheques that were crossed would be paid through a banker in the regular way, and the others over the counter; those for 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are both crossed.</p>

I am sub-country manager of the London and Westminster Bank, at the head office in Lothbury—I am the sub<lb/>manager of the country office that includes foreign bills; everything that is not London—this bill, purporting to be drawn by Streeter &amp; Ca, of Valparaiso, upon and accepted by the London and Westminster Bank, is a forgery so far as the acceptance is concerned—I never saw Mr. Streeter's signature; I know nothing of any such transaction—the signature to it, "H. F. Billinghurst," is not my writing; it is a bad imitation of it—this is not the signature of Mr. Nichols, it is an imitation of it—the stamp is an imitation of our stamp—it stops at the words "man. "and "secret," that was the same with our stamp at one time; the block under the stamp was failing just at the end; it was not done on purpose, the stamp itself has the completion of "bank" and "manager," and so on, but the block underneath, upon which it is stamped, gave way at one time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a genuine bill accepted by us, this is my signature, it has the same defects of the stamp—here are other bills purporting to be acceptances of the London and Westminster Bank, they are all forgeries—none of the supposed drawers have accounts with us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver at Birmingham—I drive one of the cabs allowed to go into the premises of the London and North Western Railway—on or about the 20th of February, I had George Bidwell in my cab, and I saw Hills also the same day—I remember the last witness speaking to me—I took George Bidwell from the Queen's Hotel to the post<lb/>office—I pulled up at the door, and he told me to get off my box—I got down, and he handed me a large letter, and told me to register it, and any<lb/>thing more to pay I was to pay it—it was stamped—I went and registered it, and I brought out the receipt to him, he folded it up very small, and tore it up in very small pieces—there was nothing extra to pay upon the letter, the stamps were sufficient—I then drove him back to the Queen's Yard, opposite the Queen's Hotel, and he jumped out—he did not pay me; he said he would send my fare out—he went and joined Hills, and they stood talking about a minute, perhaps—Bidwell turned round and looked at me, and went into the hotel, and Hills turned for the Railway Station, and presently one of the boots of the hotel brought me my fare out.</p>

               <p>House—I believe I heard the latter part of his evidence, I was out at the door when he was called into the witness-box—we talked it over previous to hearing of any forgery—we talked about the way that Mr. Bidwell did his business—we went down once in the mail, but there were several people with us; we might have had one word, but I don't remember anything about it—that was before the examination—I have been shown a sketch—Morley might have seen it too, but not in my presence—a gentleman from London showed it to me, but I can't say who he was—he might have been a detective—that was about three weeks or a fortnight before I went to the Mansion House—I have not seen the sketch since—the person who got into my cab came out of the Queen's Hotel, and directed me to drive to the post-office—that is about 150 yards—he sat in the cab while I went into the post-office—I handed him the register receipt, and while I stood waiting for orders he was tearing up the receipt—he tore it up openly before me—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bits out of the cab, and one piece was left on the cab, it was rather wet, and he knocked it off with his umbrella or stick—there was none left in the cab—I never saw him again till I saw him at the Mansion House—I was up twice, I think, before I saw Bidwell—I came up after<lb/>wards and saw him—I have been in the same situation as cab-driver for ten years—sometimes I carry ten persons a day, perhaps twenty, perhaps five; it is very uncertain—the letter I registered was for America.</p>

The Queen's Hotel is under the same roof as the station—the yard is in front of the hotel—when I drove Bidwell down there I saw Hills standing at the entrance to the station, about eight or nine yards from where he alighted from the cab—he was waiting under the arch leading to the booking-office—when Bidwell joined him they stood still about a minute, talking, and then Hills went to the station and Bidwell went into the hotel—Hills walked directly away from me—that was the only time that I saw him—I saw him for a minute and a half or two minutes—it was not raining then, but it had been—there were very few people about—if Bidwell had paid me my fare I should not have noticed the other man—I was looking after Bidwell—I believe I was up at the Mansion House first in March—it was the beginning of March—I know at that time that Hills was in custody—I went to the Mansion House to see him, but I was not examined until after Bidwell was in custody—I identified Hills—I told my friend Morley so—I did not tell anyone else—we talked it over previous to knowing anything about it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted.</hi>) I am a bill broker at Amster<lb/>dam—I recognise George Bidwell—I knew him by the name of H. E. Gilbert—I knew Messrs Citroen and Zonen at Amsterdam, gold manufac<lb/>turers, they work up gold—early in November, 1872, I learnt from them that a stranger would probably call upon me, and a day or two later Mr. Gilbert called upon me—a commissionaire from the hotel came with him—he gave me the name of Gilbert, and said he had some bills in his possession which he had brought with him from Frankfort, which he wished to discount—I declined to discount them—he inquired whether he could obtain any long bills in Amsterdam or Germany—I said it was very difficult to obtain</p>

               <p>anything of the sort, as that sort of bill was very dear in Amsterdam—I told him that there were some bills on Hamburg in the market the day before, and possibly he might obtain them—he gave me an order to buy bills to the amount of about 20,000 guilders, and I was to only buy them from good houses—I asked him subsequently what he was, and he said he had some business connected with the railway works—I bought some bills for him, and the following day he called and paid me in Dutch bank notes—the day on which he paid for the first bills he gave another order to buy further bills to the same amount or rather more—those were bought and paid for in the same way—a day or two after he bought the bills there was a change in the currency, and a day or two later he came to me to sell those bills for him again—he said he had made a mistake and wished to get rid of them again—I said he would have to put up with a loss—when I went on Change I learnt the alteration in the currency and found there would be such a great loss in selling the bills that I would not do it without further orders—I explained that to him and he told me to sell the bills, that it did not matter to him, he had made such large profits on bill trans<lb/>actions in Frankfort that he could well afford to stand the loss, and he in<lb/>tended to buy something else by which he could recoup himself—the loss was from 500 to 600 guilders, about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—with the proceeds of those resold Hamburg bills, he instructed me to buy some fresh bills on London—he wrote the particulars on paper for me—I wrote the "F. A. Warren" at the bottom, because the "W" in "Warren" in the body of the paper was not plain enough for me to read, and I wrote it again myself—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. three months, to the order of F.

He left after he gave that order—I suggested the name of Blyden<lb/>stein and the Amsterdam Bank, because it was easy to get bills there—I bought these four bills for him. (<hi rend="italic">One was drawn by Philipps, Sohne, on the Bank of Belgium and Holland for</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">two for</hi> 500 <hi rend="italic">of Suse and Sibeth and another for</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">of the Amsterdam Bank, on the Bank of Belgium and Holland.</hi>) There was a bill of Cohen on Allard, but that was paid—I delivered those bills to George Bidwell—he paid for those with the proceeds of the Hamburg bills and there was a balance which he paid in Dutch bank notes—I saw George Bidwell four or five, or perhaps six, times—I did not see him after the transactions I have referred to—I received a letter on the 22nd of November from him, but that was before he left Amsterdam, before the last interview; when I saw him he referred to that letter—it was signed H. E. Gilbert. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that he could not buy any more bills before Thursday or Friday, but would call on Thursday or Friday, at</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">p. m.</hi>) I saw Gilbert after I received that letter—he inquired whether I had received the letter—I did not receive any bills enclosed in that letter—I had those bills which George Bidwell had brought with him in my pos<lb/>session at the time—I afterwards received other letters from him from London—I received this letter of the 20th November, containing 860 guilders in Dutch bank notes.

(<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd October</hi>, 1872.)

Baring—I had stood by my clerk and seen him put a mark on each of them—I took a list of them—I put the numbers for collection on each document—I took a description myself of each document, and of the mark put on it—I have brought that memorandum with me, and hand it in—I compared the documents with the memorandum afterwards, to see that the clerk had accurately taken down the mark—I have not seen the original list here, Messrs. Baring will tell you about that—I sent the list to them with the documents; I kept a press copy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I handed the bills one by one to the clerk, and saw him make the marks.</p>

Horton—I have no personal knowledge of that; no one else drew on that account—the entry is in Mr. Hartland's writing—we gave him in payment two drafts on Paris to his order, one for 50,000 francs, another for 22,000 francs, both drawn on Messrs. Meyer and Piesse, of Paris, and French bank notes for 28,000 francs—on 6th January a cheque of Horton's for 1, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid over the counter in these twelve 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the account was first opened I gave a cheque-book to Horton containing twenty-four cheques; and on 11th January a fresh cheque-book was delivered to him containing forty-eight cheques; I don't think he signed for them—on 16th January 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out by a cheque of Horton's in one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in money—these are the Nos. that appear in the books—I have only the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note here, there are two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. missing; these are a portion of the notes given in payment of that cheque—I produce a credit slip of 18th January for 3, 304<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the greater part of it is in Horton's writing; it con<lb/>sisted of two cheques on the Western Branch of the Bank of England, one for 1, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 1, 704<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it does not state by whom they were drawn—on 21st January 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in bank notes on a cheque of Horton's, that cheque has been put into the pass-book and returned in the ordinary manner—I cannot state the exact date when the pass-book was last given up—we have not got the pass-book, we have some of the later cheques in our possession, but not this cheque, the papers and vouchers</p>

J. Horton," and the initials especially—it is "January 22nd, 1872, C. J. Horton, cheques 3,716<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., C. J.

Warren"—I knew the prisoner Hills by the name of Edwin Noyes—I first saw him at the bank, he was introduced to me there by Horton, I should say about 18th January—he introduced him as his clerk—he said he was to be treated as his confidential clerk; that is to say, we were to treat him exactly as we should himself, in his absence—I asked if Noyes was to be allowed to sign cheques—he gave a direct negative to that, "by no means," or words to that effect—I understood him to say that he was going down into the country, I think to Birmingham—he did not say what for—I do not remember his saying at any time what his business was—I don't think I saw him after he introduced Noyes—I would not like to say that I did not see him the next day or very soon after, but I don't think I did; I may have done so, but I don't think I did—after<lb/>wards we did business with Noyes, only in the way of cashing cheques and paying in money as a clerk—I received this letter, signed E.

I believe Noyes did on that day buy some German money, it had to be obtained—this is the receipt for it, it was 2,000 thalers: "25th January, 1873.

Gentlemen,—Please enclose amount in an envelope. E. Noyes for C. J. H."—I think a cheque for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was enclosed, and I believe I declined to send the money—I afterwards saw Noyes at the bank, and said that in sending money by a strange messenger it would be necessary in future to give fuller directions, and that his letter was rather vague; he said that he should desire me to obey the instructions in his letters, and trust the persons he sent, that the person he sent could be trusted, and it would be all right—my opinion is that another letter was sent, upon which we acted, and sent the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this letter is also in Noyes's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "February 14th. Gentlemen,—Please place the amount of enclosed cheque in an envelope, and direct it to 'C. J. Horton, Room 6, Terminus Hotel, London Bridge, 'and deliver it to bearer. Yours truly, E.

J. Horton. Cheque 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. E. Noyes."—That is in Noyes's writing, in my opinion, but I did not see it written—when Horton went away all the transactions were with Noyes as his clerk—this is the cheque for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it appears to be made payable to "C. J. Heorton," but it is endorsed "C. J. Horton"—it was presented at the Bank of England, and they wrote on it "Endorsement irregular," and returned it to us—we then sent on this debit-slip for Noyes to sign: "Continental Bank, 21st February, 1873. Debit account of C. J. Horton, Esq., 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Cheque returned; endorsement irregular"—That is signed "E. Noyes"—we received back that cheque on the 24th endorsed "C. J.

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), payable to C. J. Mitchell or order, is dated 21st February, but I cannot say if that is the cheque because we have no mark on it—that cheque was paid in to Horton's account, but I cannot say that it was paid in on that day—those two cheques make up the amount—the other cheque was, for 177<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., signed by Jay Cooke, McCulloch &amp; Co. on Williams, Deacon &amp; Co.—those two cheques have passed through the account, and they make up the exact amount of the credit-slip—on 27th February I received this letter: "Gentlemen,—Please place the amount of the enclosed cheque in an envelope, and deliver it to the bearer, directed to 'C.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MCINTYRE</hi>. I am the person who handed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 25, 702, and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 29, 480, across the counter—Mr. Horton came with no introduction to us, but he mentioned Bowles Brothers, and their failure—I do not know that it was so much of a failure as being in a dislocated condition—we made inquiries, but I did not do so personally—the address given to us was Charing Cross Hotel, he wrote it down, and I have got it here—this is the book I made Horton sign, to get a specimen of his signature—I did not make inquiries at the Charing Cross Hotel—at the time he signed this book he paid in some money, and signed a credit-slip, that was on December 2nd—I believe this credit-slip of 30th December to be his writing—I don't think I saw him write it—I saw Noyes first about 18th January, but I cannot fix the date—I do not think I saw the credit-slip of 18th January written—I know nothing about these cheques for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the entries are by Mr. Hartland—there is also one on 18th January for 3, 304<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was, I believe, the last time I saw Horton—he did not hand me the credit-slip, that was on the day he introduced Noyes, but it was not received by me—the next credit-slip I received after the 18th was on the 21st or 22nd—I believe I received the credit-slip of the 22nd; I cannot say from whom, but I presume it was from Horton, though I cannot say that I saw him after the 18th—I did not, I believe, see any part of it written—the "Credit C. J. Horton" is written, and it is signed "C. J. H."—there is certainly a slight difference in the name between that and the signature-book—I do not think I should refuse it as a signa-ture—we always find some slight difference in signatures, but it appears to me practically to be the same—I should say that these initials correspond exactly—they correspond with the capital letters—the amount is 335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is, I think, much more like the signature in the book than</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180039"/>
               <p>the slip is, but yet it in dissimilar in some respects—I cannot tell you in whose writing the figures or date are in this credit-slip of 22nd January—the word "Jan. "is sufficiently like to be the same, but the figures do not appear to be so cramped—the figures and the date, I think, appear to be written with the same ink—from that time all the credit-slips were drawn up by Noyes, but I am not sure that there are not some signed by Horton—the letter of 13th February is signed "E. Noyes for C. J. H."—I think the body of this slip of 30th January is Horton's, but the total is Mr. Hartland's—it is not at all like the signature-book, but still it may be Horton's, it is written so carelessly—I saw Horton write in the signature-book, and I think I saw him write some credit-slips, but I cannot tell you in all how many times I saw him write—the credit-slip of 11th January was filled up in the office, and it is probable I saw it done, it is like the signa-ture-book—the entries in our books where I find Warren's name are chiefly, and I believe all, by myself—I do not think the cheque of 20th February for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the mistake in the endorsement, went through the clearing-house, I think it was presented by ourselves—it is credited and debited on the same day, and we got it back from the bank at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. Horton opened the account with us on 2nd December—I am not quite sure on what day he introduced Noyes to me; it was somewhere about the 17th or 18th—between 2nd December and 17th or 18th January all the money that was paid in to the credit of Horton was paid in by himself—I principally received it; on seven-eighths of the occasions, on nearly all the occasions—I don't think there was anyone with him—I am not sure that he never sent a messenger; I should not like to say that; he may have done so; but on the major portion of the occasions he came himself—I have an idea that there was a credit-slip of Noyes on 20th January, but I am not sure—the first signature of Noyes here is that of 25th January, about the German money—on that same day here is a credit-slip signed with Horton's initials—it may be that the first documeut I received bearing Noyes's signature was on 25th January—it appears that he made payments in with the initials "C. J. H."—I treated him on every occasion as Horton's clerk—I had no particular reason for asking Horton whether Noyes was to sign cheques—I have known cases where confidential clerks have to sign cheques; it is not at all out of the ordinary course of business; but when I asked him he said "By no means," or words to that effect—between 25th January and 1st March Noyes was there nearly every day, either to pay in money on Horton's account or to draw it out—I am not sure that on one occasion he did not bring a porter with him; on one or two occasions he might have been there with a porter from the hotel where he was staying—he has sent individuals to the bank with communi-cations from himself—I received a letter from him by a messenger on three or four occasions—they appeared to me to be very ordinary persons, and persons that ought not to have such communications entrusted to them—they appeared to be messengers from the hotel—I never asked Horton what his business was; he appeared to us to be an American gentleman—I don't know that he represented himself as being anything, but that he had simply closed his account with one bank and desired to open it with another—nothing whatever was said about agency business—we did not open the account with him contemplating such a large amount of business; it was on the understanding that it was to be a deposit account, and then, observing his intimate connection with the Bank of England, we asked no</p>

               <p>a message from George Bid well while I was there by a cabman; in con<lb/>sequence of that I met George Bid well at the Marble Arch at 6—I took a cab, and Jules Meiuner and I went together part of the way—I took the bag containing money with me, besides the dressing bag—we did not go in the same cab to the Marble Arch, we changed cabs, because George Bidwell had told me to do so in his note—I have not got the note, it was destroyed—I ultimately met George Bidwell at the Marble Arch—I noticed that he was clean shaved then; it made a very great change in his appear<lb/>ance—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Nothing, some friend of his had been doing something and he did not wish his own name to be mentioned"—we then took another cab and drove to Euston Square—we did not go straight there, we drove first up the Bayswater Road and then to Euaton Square—I got out of the cab and left Bidwell in, to go to Drummond's Hotel—he asked me to go to the Victoria and Euston Hotels, to see if there were any telegrams for him—he sent me to ask for them, and I was to take them to him at Drummond's Hotel, that is close to Euston Square—I got one telegram, but it was one I had sent him myself from St Leonard's—I found him at Drummond's Hotel, and he toid me he was going straight away to America—he told me to go back to Fenton's and bring all the luggage up—I gave him the bag with the money, and went down to Fenton's, and took the luggage to the Euston Station—I left the luggage there and went to Drummond's Hotel, and there I found Meunier, my landlord, with the bag whioh I had been originally carrying, and which I had given to George Bidwell—George Bidwell was not there—we were about to follow in the train—when I got to the station to go off, I was arrested by the police—during my ac<lb/>quaintance with George Bidwell, he made no statement to me as to who or what he was—he told me he had an income of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—on two occasions I went to 17, St. James's Place, to see Macdonnell—George Bidwell went with me—I saw Ellen Franklin examined at the Mansion House—I did not know her before at all—I remember on one occasion going to Baker &amp; Crisp's shop in Regent Street, to buy a silk dress<lb/>George Bidwell was away at Calais that day—he told me afterwards that I had been seen in Baker &amp; Crisp's that day—I asked him who had seen me, and he said a friend of his who had seen me with him occasionally—I asked George Bidwell to have his photograph taken—he consented, but it was a very wet day and he could not have it taken—it was not taken.</p>

I first saw Austin Bidwell last August—the last time I saw him was about a week or a fortnight before Christmas—I was living at 87, Upper Gloucester Place then—I have been living with some friends since—I gave information to the prosecution—I have not received any money from the prosecution, and I have not been promised any.</p>

I can't give you the day of the month when I first made the acquaintance of George Bidwell—during the whole time I knew him he always wore a waxed moustache, Napoleon style—he had no beard as he has now, nor any imperial or whiskers, nothing but a moustache—his hair was the same as it is now, I believe—I packed the large trunk some time before we went to Hastings, at Upper Gloucester Place—I did not see it at Hastings at all—the last time I saw it was when it was put into the train at Charing Cross—it was quite full when I finished packing it—I did not look it, and I don't remember being present when it</p>

The first day that I saw Noyes was on Christimas Day—he dined with us—there were five of us to dinner—Noyes and the three other prisoners, and two young ladies came after—I believe Macdonnell introduced Noyes to me, but I am not sure—he introduced him as Mr. Howe—I am quite sure of that—I scarcely remember who intro<lb/>duced him to me when I went into the room—I have seen Noyes about half-a-dozen times in all—I dined with him once or twice afterwards—I cant say how many times I have seen him—I saw him once at our apartments, Upper Gloucester Place and Ford's Hotel—I never saw him at St. James's Place—I was about an hour at St. James Place on each occasion—I went with George Bidwell, and saw Macdonnell there—all the time that we have dined together they seemed to treat Noyes as a visitor, as a guest—and he called once or twice to see us, as a visitor—it was said that he had lately come f-om Liverpool—that was on Christmas Day—I had no particular conver<lb/>sation with him myself, it was general conversation—nothing was said to Noyes that I know of about my travels with Bidwell.</p>

I made the acquaintance of the prisoner Edwin Noyes Hills on 1st Februrary last—he afterwards took rooms at No. 7, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, the drawing room floor, at 2 guineas per week—he told me his name was Edwin Hall, and he was a native of Newark, in the United States of America—he told me he was inventing a machine for milking cows—I lodged with him there until the 1st of March—our weekly expenses were about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. including the 2 guineas rent—he made me several presents—one was a sealskin jacket—on 13th February Macdonnell called and left his name, and on the 14th he came and dined with us—Hills addresed him as "Colonel" and Macdonnell addressed him as <hi rend="italic">"Ed.</hi>"—I think Macdonnell called five or sixtimes, during the month—they appeared on very intimate terms with each other—Hills did not call him any other name, and Colonel Macdonnell—I heard the name of Bradley used—Noyes told me when he spoke of his friend I should always know that he meant Mr. Bradley—I did not know who George was at that time—I never knew Macdonnell as George, only as Mr. Bradley—I remember one morning Hills telling me he was going to Birmingham, but what day I don't know—he always dined at home with me from 5.30 to 6.30, and sometimes at 8.30—8 o'clock—he said when he went to Bir<lb/>mingham that he would telegraph if he did not return in time for dinner—I did receive a telegram that day—I can't say that that is the one—I can't tell which one I received at the time he went to Birmingham—I did not have one from Birmingham—I had one from Rugby—I received these three telegrams at different times—I received a telegram on the day he went away—when he said he would telegraph he always telegraphed—he came home to dinner on the evening of the day he said—he said he was going to Bir<lb/>mingham</p>

Can't come home until between 7 and 8.")—I subsequently received a telegram which I have not here, which has been lost—I showed that telegram to Hills on his return in the evening—I don't know what has become of it—I gave it to the solicitors—I said to Hills, "You telegraphed from Rugby," he said, "I know I did"—he showed me on the map in Bradshaw, where Rugby was, and Birmingham too, and the distance between them—I remember Hills being out on 24th February<lb/>there were two trunks in his room; one was kept locked, and the other un<lb/>locked—I opened the largest one, the one that was usually kept locked—I suppose he had put something in there that I was not to see—I had the key—I found in it some American bonds, in an envelope—I had not seen that envelope before—I had seen Hills looking at the bonds on the Sunday before, and he told me to go out of the room—he did not show them to me—when I found them I took them down to Mr. and Mrs. White, the land<lb/>lord and landlady, and showed them to them—I took them out of the envelope—there were several; I don't know how many, I did not count them; it was a roll—I put them back into the box, locked it, and put the key back—Hills came in afterwards, and George Bidwell a little time after<lb/>wards; they remained a short time, and then went out together, taking the bonds with them—Hills returned in the evening, and I saw him seal up the bonds—he brought in these two seals, and this paper to roll them up in—he sealed them with these two little seals, and fastened the paper with crystal cement, which I got from Mrs. White at his request—I did not see the address put on—towards the end of the month I thought Hills was very uneasy in his manner—on 1st March he went out between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning—he said he would return early; that meant about 2 o'clock—he never returned—Macdonnell called from 5.30 to 5. 45 in the evening, and said he had come to take Mr. Franklin's luggage away (we were passing as Mr. and Mrs. Franklin); he first said he had very bad news for me, that Mr. Franklin would not be home for a week or two, but he would let me know when he was coming home—he left me a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he wanted to take away the box that was already packed; that was the largest one; the one that was usually looked—I allowed him to take it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he went away, in a cab—he said he would come on the following Sunday or Monday—he did not; I have never seen him since—I remember being with Hills on one occasion at the shop of Messrs. Baker &amp; Crisp, in Regent Street; he pointed to a lady there, and told me it was Mrs. Bradley, and that she was staying with his friend George—it was Miss Vernon; she did not see me—Hills said he did not want her to see him because she though the was out of town.</p>

I am a single woman and live at Pimlico—in December last I was employed at the Turkish Divan in the Haymarket—I used to be there of an evening—whilst I was there in December I made the acquaintance of the prisoners Maodonnell and Austin Bidwell, and I recognise Noyes—I knew Austin Bidwell as Theodore Bingham, and Macdonnell as George Macdonnell—I never knew Hills'name—the three used to come to the Turkish Divan in the evening—I supposed they were friends, they came together—Bingham said that Macdonnell was his doctor—I knew that Bingham was an American—Macdonnell said that Hills was a genius, that he had come over here to invent something—they used to come to the Divan sometimes two or three times a week, and sometimes not for a week—sometimes they stayed away a little while—I became on friendly terms with Austin Bidwell—I remember his going to Paris—I saw him off by the train at the Charing Cross Railway Station—that was in January I think, I don't remember the date—I saw him take his ticket; he told me that he was going to Paris on business, not what particular business—he was away two or three days—I saw him on his return, at the Turkish Divan, his face was strapped up, he had met with an accident; he had a small piece of plaster on his forehead—he said there had been an accident on the line by the mail train, that two persons were killed and he only got injured—I think he was alone when he told me this, but I don't remember; it was at the end of January as near as I can remember; that was the last time I saw him—he did not say anything about going away—after that I saw Macdonnell and Hills, they used to come to the Divan sometimes—I asked them about Austin Bidwell—I generally spoke to Macdonnell—he said that he was very ill, suffering from the accident—he also said he was suffering from a shot wound, and he would have to have the ball extracted from his side—he said that he was going to extract it—I always called Austin Bidwell by the name of <hi rend="italic">Dorey</hi>—I afterwards received two or three letters from <hi rend="italic">Dorey</hi>—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think Noyes brought it me, I am not sure, I am almost certain it was Noyes—I never saw Austia Bidwell write, and never saw him after receiving that letter—after he left I never received any letter signed Dorey from anyone except Hills or Macdonnell—one of them brought me that letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My dear Daisey, I will be unable to see you, I am sorry to say, until I change my quarters, which I hope will be on Monday, and I shall do so almost only because I can see you.

                  <hi rend="italic">Hombourg, 22nd October</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">from George Bidwell, requesting to be informed whether Hills liad yet called for his letters, and desiring letters for himself or brother to be forwarded to Hotel de Angleterre, Frankfort-on-the-Main.</hi>) Up to that time one telegram had arrived for Mr. Hills, I think—I forwarded twelve or thirteen letters in answer to this letter, the one for Hills was among them—I registered the packet, and sent it on to Hombourg to the address given; they were principally American letters—I remember seeing Macdonnell at the hotel before George Bidwell came back—he called a few days after I had sent the packet, and thanked me for having sent it, saying that he had heard from Mr. Bidwell, that he had received the letters safely, and he had come to pay the postage, which he did—I had sent the letters on 25th October, and Macdonnell called on 4th November, and paid me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. postage—he said I was to keep any letters that might come, as Mr. Bidwell expected to be soon in London, and I should see him—Macdonnell called more than once after that for letters—he said that George Bidwell was abroad travelling—towards the middle or end of November George Bidwell himself came—he asked if there were any letters or parcels for him, and if Mr. Hills had been, he had been expecting him some time, and he gave me another note addressed to him, which I was to keep and give to Hills should he call at any time—he also told me that he was going to live out of town, and would I receive any letters or parcels that might come for him, and he would call occasionally for them—he thanked me for having forwarded letters to him—he was aware that Macdonnell had called and paid the postage, he referred to that—I remember seeing Hills at the hotel in December, he gave his name Edward Noyes Hills, and asked if I had any letters for him—I had never seen him before—I asked him if he was Mr. Bid well's friend who had been expected in London for some time—he said "Yes," and I gave him a letter Mr. Bidwell had given me; and when he called a second time I gave him one or two American letters which had come by post—he opened the letter Bidwell had left and read it—he wished to know if I would receive letters for him and he would call for them, as when he left home he meant to stay at our hotel, but had changed his plans, and was going to stay out of town with a friend, and I agreed to do so, it was not customary, but he being a friend of Mr. Bidwell's I would—he called twice only—I had seen Austin Bidwell at our hotel when George stayed there at the latter end of August, he used to come every day—he only came when his brother was staying there—on 6th March George Bid<lb/>well came and had breakfast, after which he went to a dressing-room, and after that he brought his things to the office, and asked me to take charge of them—he said he would call later in the day for them—he left a coat and bag, and one or two other small things—he had not slept at the hotel—he came about 8, and left at 11—he never came again, but about 2 o'clock a cabman brought me this letter, which I assume to be in George Bidwell's writing: "Mr. Nelson. Dear Sir,—Please deliver to the bearer my coat, bundle, and anything you have for me; I will settle when I come in again. George Bidwell"—I gave the things to the cabman, taking his name and number—the bill is still owing.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a private hotel at 17, St James's Place—I know Macdonnell by the name of Captain Macdonnell—he took some rooms at my hotel from 6th February to 3rd March; a sitting-room and bedroom adjoining, on the ground floor—my landlord is Mr. Walter Coulson, the surgeon—I did not see Macdonnell till the day before he left—I saw George Bidwell at my hotel several times—I don't know what he came for—he generally went into Captain Macdonnell's rooms—on 3rd March Macdonnell left, and took his luggage with him—he said he was going to Paris—I saw him about 11 o'clock; he left about 1 o'clock—the day after he left I went into his bedroom; it had not been let in the meantime—I found there some newspapers and blotting-paper, and a piece of paper with some printed impressions on it—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read something about these forgeries in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> on the</p>

               <p>Monday, the day Macdonnell left, and I sent for the police that night—when I found these papers I gave them up to Smith, the City officer, also this copy of the City Directory, which Macdonnell left behind. (<hi rend="italic">This had several pages torn out which contained the names and addresses of wood engraven, amongst others, Straker</hi>, 16, <hi rend="italic">Ivy Lane, and Cheshire</hi>, 42, <hi rend="italic">Paternoster Row, and others.</hi>) Macdonnell had been occupying the room from 6th February to 3rd March—no one else was in the habit of going into it, except the servants, to clean. (<hi rend="italic">The pieces of blotting paper, four in number, had upon them, "E 2, New York, Feb. F. E. T. Y., Co., Deposit Co.</hi>, 140, <hi rend="italic">Broadway, New York. Russian Bank.

                  </hi>. I am manager of Miss Green's private hotel<lb/>it is our practice not to take persons into the house without an introduction—I remember Macdonnell coming there, he gave me the introduction of Dr. Coulson—he engaged a bedroom and sitting-room on the ground floor—the bedroom window looked into St. James's Place—I have seen the prisoner whom I now know as George Bidwell there—he first came on the 7th of February—I only knew him by the name of "George"—Macdonnell used to call him "George"—the first day Macdonnell was there he said he would like to have the fires as large as they could be made—he said he felt cold, chilly, he came from a hot country, from South America—it was his only complaint when he said the fire was not large enough, he would like to have a larger fire—George Bidwell was there on the 10th of February—I procured a "Continental Guide" for him—Macdonnell asked me if I had got a small wooden box, about a foot long, or a little more—George Bidwell was present—they said they wanted to send something to India, and they gave me a little machine and a cloak to wrap the machine in—I can't tell what sort of a machine it was—I had a box made by a boxmaker to put it in—the boxmaker fastened it up, and I gave it back to Macdonnell fastened up, all ready—after Macdonnell had been with us a day or two, he said "Tell the servants before they enter to knock first loud, and enter when I say 'Come in ‘"—he stayed with us till the 3rd March—George Bidwell used to come there nearly every day about 8 o'clock in the morning—he might come earlier or later than 8—he generally used to ring the front door bell, and some of the servants or myself opened the door—I noticed also that Macdonnell opened the door once himself—he used to open the door in his shirt sleeves, because the bedroom was near the front door—I observed George Bidwell come in sometimes without ringing the door bell—I heard him knocking at Macdonnell's window with a stick or umbrella—Macdonnell came out and was going to open the door, but I was first—George Bidwell used to be there nearly all the part of the forenoon, and he used to go</p>

I have within half an hour arrived here from Scotland. I received certain informa<lb/>tion from Gibson, Craig &amp; Co., of Edinburgh, writers to the signet, and in consequence of that I watched the house No. 22, Cumberland Street, Edin<lb/>burgh, on Wednesday last, the 2nd April instant, from about twenty-five minutes past 10 o'clock in the morning. It is a private house. The prisoner came out of the house to the door, looked round and went back again, and remained in about twenty minutes, and then he came out, and from his appearance I suspected he was George Bidwell. I watched him and saw where he went. He posted a letter in a pillar-box, and then he went to a stationer's shop, and then to a baker's shop. When standing at the door he looked around and came out and went around the corner, and in about twenty yards he set off to run as hard as he could run. I ran after him, he ran into a blacksmith's shop, from which he turned back and passed me. I</p>

               <p>took no notice of him as he did so; he walked on a little and then started to run again. He then ran down Drummond Place and Scotland Street; he went through Scotland Street lane, and over the Church railings, jumped over several stone walls, one after the other. I followed him, and went through a private house into Scotland Street again. I got round to the street by another way, and was in the street as soon as he. I ran him to Duncan Street, Stockbridge, in which he came to a standstill, and could not run any further. He made several thrusts at me with a stick which he had in his hand. I took out of my pocket a small baton and held it out as if it were a pistol, and told him ‘to stand and be a gentleman, and give me his hand; to be a brother and not a coward. 'I got hold of his hand and held him. (I called him a 'brother' because I fancied he gave me a Masonic sign.) I got assistance and drove him in a cab to Messrs. Gibson, Craig &amp; Co.'s office. I said 'You are George Bidwell; you are wanted for the forgery on the Bank of England. 'He spoke some foreign language, and I don't know what he said. I understood him to say that he was not a Fenian. I said 'I know that; I was not looking for any Fenians. 'When I got him to the office I asked him if he could give any account of him<lb/>self, and why he ran over those private grounds and stone walls? and he would not give me any answer. A few minutes afterwards he said he was subject to giddiness in the head, and took to those fits of running off. I asked him what I might call him, and he said 'You may call me James, if you like. 'He would give no answers to any questions after that He spoken very broken English, like a Frenchman. I gave him a book to read. He said either his father or mother belonged to France, and the other to Germany. He said he had been in Paris. I told him there was an old friend of his doing five years there just now. I bound up his leg, which was cut and bleeding. He was then handed over to the police of Edinburgh, and I had nothing more to do with him. The stationer's shop was kept by Mr. Anderson, into which I saw him go. I did not search him or the lodgings. I only watched the lodgings.—<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

Noyes—I have gone through this account of the various purchases; it is correct—I have also an account of how the bonds were paid for, in a tabulated form, but it is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MCINTYRE</hi>. I knew Austin Bidwell by the name of Warren; he made three purchases of bonds in May, and once in August, and twice in September; no, I think it was only once in September, but I saw him twice in September—there was not a purchase on 14th September; he paid for bonds on 13th—there was only one purchase in September 25,000—the purchase was made on the 13th; he had part on the 13th, and the rest on the 14th—he left the Portuguese bonds with me to sell, fixing a reserve price, and as I could not get that price I returned them to him—American bonds are purchased by Americans to a large extent; we put American bonds on the market to a large amount; 75,000,000 of dollars in the course of a year by our house alone—the transaction on 9th January was not with Austin Bidwell, but with Noyes—I had no transaction with Austin Bidwell after September, to my recollection, personally.</p>

We sold some bonds on 9th January—I did not notice who it was to particularly, but I had no transaction with any<lb/>body but Noyes, that I recollect—I am not certain that I saw Noyes and had transactions with him on the 9th, or not; the only time I speak with certainty to Noyes was on the 25th I think; all the subsequent transactions were with Noyes, and those I speak to with certainty—on one occasion he was going to refer to Horton, and I said "I thought you were Horton," and then he said he was Morton's clerk—I looked upon him as Horton's clerk, acting for Horton—I speak to Austin Bidwell as Warren; he came to me at all times in the day—he said they were going to have an office in the Poultry—there was nothing unusual to attact my attention in any way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and printer, at 16, Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row—I know the firm of Nelson &amp; Co., printers, by name—I did not know them till I was at the Mansion House—I know now that Mr. Chaloner is a partner in that firm—I knew the prisoner George Bid well by the name of Brooks—about 18th December he called and said he was recommended by Nelson's—he brought two copper plates with blank bill forms upon them and asked me if I worked from copper plate—I told him yes, and he told me that he was recommended from Nelson's, and he asked me what I would do him 500 for—one of the plates had the figure "1," and the other had the word "First"—he wanted the figure "1" transferred to the plate that had the word "First," and the other he wanted transferred to the other plate—I told him I could do it, and he asked me what I would do 500 copies for, and I told him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I said I could not get them done before Christmas—he said if I could get them done he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra, and I said I would try—after he gave me instructions, he asked me to explain, that he might know that I understood his instructions—I did so, and he said "Very well, that will do"—the plates were left with me—on that occasion I had merely to transfer the different figures—I made up the stone from the plates and printed from the stone—some of those forms were ready the day before Christmas Day—I went out of town the morning before, and on my return I found that some of the forms had been delivered—I afterwards saw him and printed some forms with the word "Second," and some with the figure "2"—the forms had scrolls on them—he did not bring any scrolls at that time—the scrolls were engraved upon the plates—he came again at the end of December or the beginning of January—the order he gave then was merely to add some<lb/>thing to the plate and print a few more—on one occasion I engraved for him on slips of copper some names of places—some of the names were engraved on the bill plates themselves, names of several countries, Hong<lb/>kong, Cairo, Bombay, Valparaiso, Yokohama, and Alexandria—they were ordered at different times—some plates we made use of for several bills—I put some of those names into some of the bill forms—I also engraved on slips of copper the names of the Union Bank of London and the London</p>

               <p>and Westminster Bank, and I also printed the names of the banks on the body of some of the bills—I remember on one occasion his bringing two plates with scrolls on them—these are the scrolls (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are for making the ornamental part across the bill—I can't say what date he brought those—he brought four, but I tried to make use of two—I told him I would try what I could do with them—I transferred them to wood and found they were too black, and afterwards, instead of using those scrolls, he selected two patterns out of my pattern-book—I engraved the scrolls he selected on a separate piece of copper and transferred them to the bills—I engraved two bill plates for bill forms for him also, and printed bills from those plates, and inthe centre of the scroll on the bill forms I printed certain names—H. C. Streeter and T. Perkins were printed on the bills printed from the plates that he brought me—and the names, D. R. Howell and Juan Perez were printed in the scroll of the bills which I printed from the plates that I had made—in printing Juan Perez at first, I spelt the name wrong, "Jaun" instead of "Juan"—the prisoner was very cross about it, and I of course said I would alter the name and print them over again—I altered it and printed forms with the name properly spelt—the last time I saw him was about the 22nd or 23rd of February—I should say I saw him on an average about twice a week from the 18th December to that date—he said he was getting up samples for bills of exchange—he came on 22nd or 23rd February, and took all the forms away except these four blocks of the scrolls which I had not used—he took away everything else—he asked to look at some of the forms I had printed on the stone, and he wished me to show him the way to take them off the stone, and I got one of my apprentices to show him—the bill form on the stone was entirely effaced—that is done with snake stone—I told him afterwards that if he offered me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I could not produce him another bill from that stone without retrans<lb/>ferring it—he said that would do—he did not say why he wished the stone erased—these bills are all on forms printed by me—I can't say positively that this one of "Oppenheim &amp; Co. "is mine, but I am pretty well sure because of the name; all the others I am certain of.</p>

Nelson"—I afterwards found it and gave it up—I asked his address, he said he was staying at Brighton—I find endorsed on all these bills (<hi rend="italic">Including the one charged in the indictment</hi>) an impression of the German stamp which I cut for George Bidwell—I do not understand German—the stamp on this bill (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on Blydenstein, dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>) appears to bear exactly the same device in the corner as the one I printed for George Bidwell, with a little difference in the colour, but it is not filled up on one of my forms—the device is identical with that on the bill brought to us to copy the print from.</p>

I am an engraver and wood cutter, at 21, Paternoster Row, of the firm of Carter &amp; Dalton—I saw George Bidwell during last November, and on 4th December he called and showed me two pieces of paper with scrolls printed on them—"Rayner &amp; Co. "was on one—on 7th December I got an order from him for the words "London and Westminster Bank," and some Dutch lettering—on the 9th he gave me an order for lettering "Hamburg Banking Co."—I should recognise the impression from my stamp if I saw it—this bill was taken from one of my blocks with a piece cut off the end—(<hi rend="italic">This was the bill indicted upon</hi>)—they have cut away part of the word "bank," and left only "London &amp; Westminster B."—part of the "A" remains to imitate a full stop—on 17th December I got an order for an acceptance "Messrs. Smith, Payne &amp; Smith"—there was another on the 16th—this is the impression—this is a proof taken from the block before I gave it up to George Bidwell—from time to time he gave me pieces of paper to copy from—the prisoner com<lb/>municated with me on slips of paper when he came, sometimes with a pencil and sometimes with a pen—these are the original copies given by the prisoner for me to engrave from—they were torn up by the prisoner and thrown on the floor and afterwards found—after this case began, we looked and found those pieces—there is one written in German, <hi rend="italic">"Ich will bald mehr haben</hi>"—that is a copy for some of the work done—he told me to read the German letters one by one to prevent a mistake—he wrote in</p>

C. Streeter" which appears in both documents, in fact the whole of the front of the bill and the signature, and I have no doubt whatever that the endorsement is Austin Bidwell's writing—these eight other bills, alleged to be forged, are in the same writing, Macdonnell's, both the signatures and the bodies—Streeter is supposed to be the drawer of all of them, and the endorsement is Macdonnell's writing—this letter, dated "Londres, 19th November, 1872," purports to be signed by Warren, but I do not recognise it and give no opinion about it—this bill, dated 19th November, 1872, is in Macdonnell's writing; I say nothingabout the signature—I have seen all these letters produced by Helen Vernon, but they do not all contain the admitted writing of George Bidwell—the endorsement "H.

I have not had the assistance of any other expert in handwriting in examining these documents—I never had the assistance of another expert in my life—Mr. Netherclift never assisted me in his life—when I have been called to prove the handwriting of a person he has not, as a rule, been called on the other side to prove it is not—that is very seldom indeed the case, and only in difficult cases, I mean in the matter of a mere signature, when perhaps it will be a mere matter of opinion—I can't say that I have ever seen these persons write, I base my judgment upon having examined certain documents which have been proved by the witnesses to be in the handwriting of Austin Bid well—I have examined the admitted handwriting till I have become fully acquainted with it, and then I compare that with the handwriting in dispute—I saw the signature in the signature book and a number of other signatures—the whole of this letter of 28th December is undoubtedly in Austin Bidwell's handwriting—the body of the letter of 21st January, addressed to Colonel Francis, is in George Bidwell's writing, without doubt—the signature is Austin's—it is very possible that it was written with the same ink—I can't say that it was not—I should say it had been written afterwards, and blotted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180081"/>
               <p>some little time after—it is my opinion it was nearly dry when it was blotted, it may have been written tea minutes after or immediately after<lb/>wards—it might be written by a fresh dip of ink, and fifty other things might be—the signature is quite in the right place, where you would expect it to be if the man had written the whole of the letter, the words "Yours very truly" rise one beyond the other, but the signature, "F. A. Warren," is quite straight, so it does not look like the same hand—I should Bay the signature was written with rather a free hand—I say that the bodies of these cheques are in the handwriting of George Bidwell, and the signature is Austin's—they are very excellent signatures, written in a manner so as to be sure not to be returned, and all written at one sitting, in my opinion—they would infallibly be received at the Bank, I should say—signatures might be traced so that the forms of the letters would be the same, but the tracing would have the appearance of the tracing at the back of some of the forged bills—a lame, crawling line—I don't know in whose writing the initials F. A. W. is, to the cheques altered from order to bearer—in my opinion they are not Austin Bidwell's—there is only the word "Bear" on the cheque of 27th February—I don't know whose writing that is, nor the initials, but I don't think they are Austin's—there is another cheque on the 27th, with the letter "B" and part of the letter "E," and the final "er"—I believe those letters are in George Bidwell's writing; it seems to me they are written by the same person who wrote the body of the cheque, but trifles like these I have put on one side—I don't know in whose writing the two names "C. J. Horton" and "C. J. Heorton" are—I don't recognise Austin Bidwell's hand in them; who wrote them I can't tell—the endorsements "F. A. Warren" on some of the bills are written by Austin, and some are not—I have seen 140 bills; most of them, if not all, have the signa<lb/>tures of Warren on the back—some of them I believe to be in Austin's writing, and in a large majority I can't recognise the signatures—I can't tell you how many of the signatures are his in my opinion—I say that Streeter's bill, the subject of this indictment, is certainly not a tracing—it is a very fair signature, a signature that would be sure to be honoured—the signatures "Horton" to the cheques on the Continental Bank have been all written at one time, and are the careful signatures of Austin—comparing them with the signatures on the credit-notes and other signatures, I say they are written by the same person—in this respect they are not like them; one is a very careful signature and the other is a careless signature—I have com<lb/>pared them with the more careful signatures—I am prepared to say that in my opinion the signatures to the cheques are in the writing of Austin; to the best of my belief they are—I can't distinguish them from his genuine signatures; there is only this difference, they seem to be written with particular care—they are particularly good signatures, so far that they have given me a great deal of trouble—if you select these two, there is the very worst signature of "Horton" and one of the very best—if they had been put before me to compare, I should hesitate to give an opinion, and say they were not written by one person—here are two signatures that are written by one person; that is credit-slip "Austin Bidwell," 24, and credit "Austin Bidwell," 30—if those signatures had been put before me, and I were asked whether they were written by one and the same person (mind, I know that they are), I should say I would give no opinion—if I were pressed, I should say I have come to no opinion—I can't give an opinion unless I form one—I only give opinions when I feel convinced, and that would be a case in</p>

He tells you that any statement which I can make to you is not evidence, and can be received by you only with very great caution; I do not attempt to deny that; but, nevertheless, I think that my statement will be so supported by the testimony which the prosecution has elicited that it will merit at least a very careful consideration at your hands. I can easily conceive that in my case it will be very difficult indeed to make any defence whatever; but, as I believe that no person is in a position to give so accurate and so faithful an account of this whole</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180087"/>
               <p>business as I am, I propose to show to you that in the case of one prisoner at least, if I cannot show it by direct evidence, it is certainly worthy of con<lb/>siderable attention—I mean my proposition which refers to the pro<lb/>bability of his entire innocence in the actual fraud. My only reason for making this statement is that the truth may be known in regard to him, for I am perfectly well aware that every word I am saying to you now cuts from under my feet any hope that I might have entertained for myself. The idea of the prosecution, which they have endeavoured to enforce on your convictions, is that the original intention with which Austin Bid well, George Bidwell, and myself came over to this country was to perpetrate this fraud on the Bank of England. I think if that idea could be entertained, it would argue for us a knowledge and a prescience something more than men of ordinary ability and attainments could pretend to. It would suppose that we were perfectly acquainted with the mode of doing business in England, that we knew some person or other who had an account with the Bank of England, that we could by some well-devised plan get sufficiently into the confidence of that person to obtain from him an introduction to the Bank of England, and that all the other minor details, which have been explained so fully in the course of this investigation, would all work together for our benefit, would all turn out precisely as we desired, and that, in fact, nothing at all would interfere to prevent the carrying out of the fraud. When we first came to England it was certainly with no such intention. Mr. Green, of Savile Row, has told you that the opening of the account with the Western Branch of the Bank of England was an entire accident, and so it was. That was done on the 4th of May, and on the 28th of May we three left England. We left England without the slightest intention of returning. We were to have gone to South America by Rio as far as San Francisco, and thence back to Rio. Circumstances occurred in Rio to induce us to change our minds, and we came back. There is no doubt at all the intention was to close the account with the Bank of England, because it was of no use. But when we came back to England it was of considerable use and advan<lb/>tage to us to cash any documents that might come in our possession. We went from England to the Continent, and our intention while on the Continent was to do certain business between Vienna and Frankfort-on-the-Main. Circumstances then arose while we were at Vienna to prevent that business. In the meantime I was taken very seriously ill, and returned to England for the benefit of medical advice. While on my way to England I arrived at Amsterdam, and there I purchased from a banker named Moses Ezekiel a bill upon London. The prosecution has found out, apparently, every cir<lb/>cumstance connected with this case, and have, no doubt, found out that. I also had another bill, drawn by Baron Schey of Vienna on London, and that bill I cashed myself. I went to Waring with it, and I saw the manner of doing business, which differed entirely from the manner in which it is transacted in America; the bill from Moses Ezekiel was drawn on the London and Westminster Bank, and was negotiated for me at the Alexandra Hotel. As soon as I saw how business was transacted, I sent a telegram from the station next adjoining the Alexandra Hotel to a person in Holland, and I stated in that telegram that I had made a great discovery. That telegram, I daresay, was also found, but, as it would tend to show that fraud possibly could not have been contemplated so early as the prose<lb/>cution claim, it has not been brought forward. That was the first moment at which anything of the kind entered my mind. In America,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180088"/>
               <p>when bills are presented at a bank for discount, when acceptances are presented, it is the custom to send the acceptances round to the persons accepting to be what is technically called "initialed," in order that their validity and genuineness may be certified. I found that was not the case here, and the result of that discovery is that I am standing before you to-day. I went over to Amsterdam after that, and there telegraphed to another person to join me at once. He met me in Amsterdam, and we came to London, where we were afterwards joined by George Bidwell. Mr. Pinto, from Amsterdam, has told you that George Bidwell purchased bills drawn from Amsterdam upon Hamburg, which bills a day or two afterwards were sold back again, and others, drawn upon London, purchased with the proceeds. That was done in pursuance of my directions, and the bills so obtained were afterwards discounted by F. A. Warren. The matter went on in that way for some time until the 11th or 12th November. Austin Bidwell went over to Paris to buy the bill on Messrs. Rothschild which has been so much commented upon, that for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. During his voyage or journey to Paris he met with a very severe railroad accident, in which one man certainly was killed outright, and I think two or three more, and Austin Bidwell had probably as narrow an escape from instant death and being smashed to pieces as any man ever had. On arriving in London he was in such a condition that it was almost impossible for him to move. He was helped from the station to the hotel where I was then stopping, and visited by a physician (Dr. Coulson), who told him he was in very great danger of being paralyzed for life, that his spine was affected. On the 17th of January, when Austin Bidwell took that bill to the Bank, I went with him as far as the door, and afterwards helped him back to my quarters. I think on the following day Dr. Coulson saw him, and Austin Bidwell then told him it was his intention to leave England immediately. The doctor replied that if he intended to travel he must do so at once, or he might not be able to do so at all. The evidence goes to show that up to this time every preparation had beea made for the contemplated fraud. The 18th of January was a Saturday, and after the doctor's interview with Austin Bid<lb/>well, who was then in my room, he told me that it was his intention to utterly withdraw from anything connected with this or any other similar matter. You can easily conceive that up to this time a great deal of money had been thrown away in continually transferring and re-transferring the papers. The idea of losing that money and having no return for it at all did not please me very much; but as Austin Bidwell said he would leave, was determined to leave, and did leave, I could only let him go, and he went But for all that, I thought that I would not make myself a victim; at all events I should carry it on, and in that determination I was joined by another person, who will tell you the same thing. On Dr. Coulson's advice Austin Bidwell decided to travel immediately, and he left with me two cheques—one drawn upon the Western Branch of the Bank of England and the other on Hartland and Co.—to obtain the balance of his account from both banks and invest the proceeds in United States bonds, which were to be forwarded to him in Paris. These cheques were in the first place drawn for the full amount. I thought it very likely that he might be induced to change his mind, and I had other cheques prepared, leaving a small balance on both accounts. These two cheques were cashed, and the proceeds left in my hands. The first forged bill as sent down to Birmingham on the 21st of January. Mr. Chabot has told you that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180089"/>
               <p>it is his opinion that the endorsement "F. A. Warren" on the bills was in the handwriting of Warren. It was not. No one knows that better than I do, for I know all about it My hand was the one that put those endorsements on. Mr. Chabot also says the cheques by which the moneys were drawn from the two banks were in Austin Bid well's hand<lb/>writing, and were all signed at one sitting. Several of them were signed at one sitting, I quite agree with Mr. Chabot, but not by Austin Bid well. I can refer you in particular to the cheque which went to the Western Branch of the Bank of England, in which the name of Horton was mis<lb/>spelt. It is admitted that Austin Bid well was then on the way to Havaunah. Mr. Chabot does not state positively that these cheques were signed by Horton; the Continental Bank was perfectly well satisfied that they were sjgned by Horton, and I think the expert in that bank was quite as able to judge as Mr. Chabot whether the signatures were genuine. Now, then, I come to the accident on the Northern Railroad of France. When Austin Bidwell arrived at my quarters in England his first statement to me was this: "<hi rend="italic">Mac</hi>, I have had a most frightful escape from instant death, to be an escape, as perhaps any man has ever experienced. "He went on to elabo<lb/>rate his sentiments during the accident, and wound up by saying that such was the deep impression made on his mind iu those few moments of peril that he should certainly have nothing to do with anything not only affecting his personal convenience and his liberty and happiness, as far as that goes, but also place in jeopardy, according to the view from which he looked at it then, his eternal happiness. I think, Gentlemen of the Jury, that this is not at all a far-fetched statement, and is probably one that will commend itself to your attention as being worthy of a great deal of consideration—namely, that a man of his age could not have so absolutely and entirely for<lb/>gotten the sentiments implanted in him in youth as to be indifferent to such a warning. For myself, I am willing to confess that, probably from not having gone through that experience myself, I gave the matter but little attention, in fact, I laughed at it and laughed at him; but all I could say could not change his mind, and on the following Monday he left England. Now, as to the money which remained in his hands, he asked me to invest it for him in American bonds, about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In the meantime the first batch of forged bills had been presented, and part of the proceeds invested in United States bonds, through the medium of Messrs. Jay Cooke &amp; Co. When I went to Paris on the 28th I took those bonds with me. I met Austin there, to whom, by the way, a night or two before, I had sent 10,000 dollars, and when I went over I took the balance to him. Those 10,000 dollars he deposited for safe keeping with the American Agency. I went with him there to take them out, and while there I told him I had certain moneys that I was about to give him as soon as I could settle my affairs in London. It was useless to have money entirely idle, and I myself requested him to buy that very bill which has not been used but has been presented in evidence here. I wanted him to buy it on the ground of having already had some sort of acquaintance with these people, and he could do it better than I could. At that time I am bound to state that he had the most entire confidence that what I told him was true and exactly as I represented it to him, and, accordingly, he bought the bill In the course of our opera<lb/>tions on the Continent between Vienna and Frankfort last autumn, there was a good amount of money left uncollected, and Austin's visit to Frank<lb/>fort primarily was to collect that money. When he left Paris with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180090"/>
               <p>intention of going to Frankfort, I myself requested him to sell those bonds, without telling him that it was part of any fraud, for of a fraud at that time he had no conception whatever. I requested him to sell those bonds, and the balance that was due by him to me on a settle<lb/>ment I asked him to forward either by bill on London or New York. The balance was between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the manner in which he remitted that sum to me was in a bill from Baron Bethman for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on the Russian Bank of Foreign Trade. When I returned to London I sent him a telegram, which has been produced here, asking him to buy certain small sighted bills; and I think, if all the papers in my trunk had been examined, one letter would have been found in which he stated he did not know to what I referred. When Austin Bidwell left England the evidence shows pretty clearly that he left everything in confusion as far as this business is concerned, and in a state of unreadiness. When the first bills were sent in to the bank the intention only was to recoup the loss on the money transactions and then clear out. But when the facility with which they were received and discounted was considered, it was determined to carry the thing further, and in order to do so it was necessary to get up bills, printing done, and stamps made, and there was very little time to do it in; it had to be in a hurry—at once. Mr. Giffard asked in his address to you what was the object of the account. The object was very plain. I do not propose to insult your understandings, gentlemen, by saying that a fraud was not contemplated at one time, but you may, perhaps, be inclined to believe that such a statement as I am now making is made only with one motive. Does it redound to my advantage, does it help to clear me at all, or do I state anything to you intrinsically improbable? I think not I have no doubt Mr. Giffard has had a great deal of experience in this sort of business, and I daresay he will believe me when I say that men engaged in illegitimate transactions do not place very much confidence in each other, or any more than they are absolutely bound to do; and if there was an intention, in spite of the withdrawal of one party, still to carry out the original scheme, it is not likely that party, after having entirely withdrawn, should be intrusted with any confidence concerning the scheme. He asks who were benefited by it; and if he sifts the matter to the bottom I think it could be very easily explained; but who was intended to be benefited by it, is another question. Mr. Giffard, in his opening address, said it was the belief of the prosecution that Austin Bidwell was on his way to Mexico. If that were their belief, I can only say it is well founded. He then referred to the package of bonds sent to New York addressed to Austin Biron Bidwell, care of the Safety Deposit Co. Of course it is very difficult to prove any such statement as this. Notwithstanding, it is the simple truth that that package never was intended for Austin Bidwell; and, if you think that is hardly the case, I might ask, if it was really intended for him why was it not sent to Vera Cruz, where he was going, instead of to New York, 1, 800 miles away from Vera Cruz. The printing and engraving of these bills were nearly all done after the 25th <hi rend="italic">of</hi> January. When Mr. Chabot was called at the Mansion House, he was very careful not to give any opinion as to the cheques and bills that were sent after he became aware that Austin Bidwell was not in England at the time, and it was only upon coming hero, after being in possession of all the circumstances, that he then gave it as his opinion that those bills were not signed by Austin Bidwell. Of course I do not presume to impugn Mr. Chabot. I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180091"/>
               <p>no doubt whatever that his testimony is perfectly conscientious, but with such aids to help his decision, is it at all extraordinary that his testimony should have been precisely what it was yesterday. Since Mr. Chabot first took upon himself the profession of an expert, busi<lb/>ness of this kind, like that of every other, has made very great strides. It has become, as one of the newspapers said, an art I mean fraud of this description, and, although a very wretched, unhappy, miserable, and con<lb/>temptible art, it may be to a certain extent called an art nevertheless. Mr. Chabot would induce you to believe that these cheques were left signed by Austin Bidwell I am unwilling to allow that statement to be left as it was by Mr. Chabot on your minds when you come to meditate on your verdict. My only object is to make as much reparation as can be done to a person who, in spite of Mr. Giffard's statement as to its improbability, has been deceived and imposed upon, and has had his confidence violated. If I am successful in pressing that view of the case upon you, I shall have obtained all I can possibly ask for. If I am not successful, I gan only regret it; but I ask, when you go to consider your verdict, to bear in mind the statement I have made; to consider whether there is anything intrin<lb/>sically improbable in it, and to say whether it is at all likely that I would stand up here and, through any other motive than the one I have men<lb/>tioned, make observations which must necessarily be most prejudicial to myself. That is all, gentlemen, I have to say to you."

I said yes, and she then told me to go to Greenwich and draw her pension, which I have done"—I asked her if she knew the name and address of the woman she spoke of, and she said "No," but she thought some of the letters she had had from her bore the Dartmouth post-mark, but they were not signed—I read the warrant to her, and she made no reply—she said she had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sometimes 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for doing it.</p>

I am a seaman belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Sir Robert Pttl—l</hi> was present on that afternoon, 28th June, about 3 o'clock, when the prisoner produced a bottle of rum and handed it to Doyle, who refused to return the bottle—after that there was a fight between Ryan and the prisoner, but they shook hands, and Ryan, O'Brien, and Welch all turned into one bunk, and Knight and me and the prisoner and Doyle remained—the prisoner sat on the same side of the forecastle as I did, and Knight and Doyle on the opposite side—after that the prisoner sat down beside me, and said a few words, I cannot say what, and Doyle threw a small piece of meat at him, and hit him on some part of his face, and said he would make him <hi rend="italic">loom</hi> before he had been a week out—about four or five minutes after that, the prisoner jumped from his seat beside me, drew a knife from his body, and stabed Doyle three or four times in his neck and three or four times in his breast—Doyle then jumped up to his feet and knocked the prisoner down, and then fell on his hands and feet a little bit from the prisoner—Knight went to Doyle, took him in his arms, put his hand on the wound, and held it till the prisoner recovered and got to his feet and made another rush—I can't say whether he intended it for Knight or for Doyle, but he tabbed Knight in the arm—I left, the forecastle, and sung out "Look out, he has got a knife"—Ryan turned out of his bunk, held up his finger, and said "What are you going to do with that knife?"—I said to the second</p>

               <p>officer, "Come on, they are murdering here"—I did not go back till the man was dead, and did not see the prisoner knocked down—at the time they were fighting, Doyle stepped in between them and said "Separate," and that he would have no fighting; he made them shake hands—I am quite sure Doyle made no rush at him before he was stabbed; he was sitting when he was stabbed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> the deceased by the neck with his I left hand, and stabbed him in the breast with his right, and after that the deceased rose up and knocked the prisoner down—he went a yard or yard and a half to knock him down—he did not walk that distance, the prisoner was close to him—there was a struggle and a tussle before he knocked the prisoner down—he rose up and clutched the prisoner—he did not strike the prisoner at all, he pushed him down; there was no blow—it was after the prisoner went down that the deceased went down on his knees—I saw the deceased after he was stripped; there were two wounds, but one was very slight—I a ways found the prisoner a good-tempered man, but I had never seen him till this time—I had drank with him twice—I cannot say what <hi rend="italic">"loom"</hi> means; an officer on board ship, when he wants you to go aloft, makes You <hi rend="italic">"loom"</hi> bnt one able-bodied sailor cannot"<hi rend="italic">loom</hi>" another able<lb/>bodied sailor—I had drank some beer with them, but was not the worse for it.</p>

I am a seaman, and belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Sir Robert Peel</hi>—on 28th June, when she was leaving Shad well basin for sea, seven or eight of us were on the forecastle about 3 p. m., and after the rum had been produced by the prisoner to Doyle, there was a quarrel between me and the prisoner, and we struck three or four blows—I understand that Doyle endeavoured to separate us, but I do not know, as I was the worse for drink—we shook hands, and then three of us went to the same bunk—I was in my bunk a short time, and heard a man sing out "Patsey Doyle is killed"—I saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand, and asked him what he was going to do with it, he made no answer—I got a billet of wood, and rushed in, and told him to put down the knife; he said "No," and then me and Michael O'Brien and another man rushed in and knocked him down; he struggled very hard to keep the knife, but it was got from him and given to the second mate, who stood outside the forecastle and told us to fetch him out—we dragged the prisoner out, and gave him into the second mate's and carpenter's charge, who took him aft and made him fast to the main mast, and in a short time the Thames Police came on board.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional police surgeon, of 171, East India Road—on 28th June I saw the deceased at the dead-house in Poplar—there was a punctured wound an inch long immediately over the cartilage of the fifth rib, two inches inside the nipple; it divided the cartilage, and went completely through the heart, puncturing both ventricles, and the septum also—that would account for death, and this knife fitted into the wound—there was also a small wound at the side, which was quite superficial, it was just through the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my opinion a stab like that would cause instant death—I think it probable that a man might jump up afterwards—it is a most vital part; in fact, the man was killed immediately it entered his heart—the prisoner was depressed when I saw him—he had lost a large quantity of blood—I attended to him.</p>

I live at 57, Northampton Street, Clerkenwell—on Sunday, 27th July, about 1. 45, I and the deceased and Gregory took a pair<lb/>oared boat from May's Yard, Hammersmith, and went down the river towards Putney—it was a pair-oared outrigged gig—I have been in those boats before; it is a very narrow boat, with iron rullocks extending from each side, for two to row and one to steer; there is room for a coxswain, and each of the two men has an oar—we went down the river about 100 yards past the soap works; I was steering—the soap works is not quite half a mile from the bridge; the tide was running down—Vint was rowing stroke, and Gregory bow; we were on the Surrey shore, about 20 yards from the bank—when we had got about 100 yards below the soap works, we were met by a steamer—we passed that steamer, and turned our head to the swell of the steamer—I told the rowers to lay their oars on the water, which they did, and they remained still—we had just commenced to paddle again, when we were met by another steamer; that was between 80 and 100 yards from the first—we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> the same as we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> when the first steamer passed us, but the swell was so great that it seemed impossible for the boat to live in it—I have not the least idea of the speed at which either of the steamers were going; the last boat seemed to be going faster than the first—I said to Gregory, "Look out, we shall have to swim for it" and he jumped overboard, and Vint jumped after him almost directly—the water came over on each side into the boat, and seemed to swallow the boat—it was the only boat just at that particular spot; there was one nearer shore, and when I was swamped I turned round and saw them with their boat in their hands; they had been swamped and had got ashore—our boat filled, but I stopped in it; it would not sink with my weight—it was 3 feet below the surface of the river—I was kneeling in the boat, she was out of sight in the part where I was kneeling; the bow end—we looked round for Vint, but could not see him—we were picked up by a skiff—I have been in the habit of going on the river for four or five years—I belonged to a club four years—the steamboat did not slacken speed when it was passing.</p>

I am a sign writer, and live at 17, Graham Street, City Road—I was with Bull and Vint in this boat on Sunday, 27th July—I did not notice the first steamer that passed us a great deal, I had my back to her, rowing; I did as our coxswain ordered, laid on—when the second steamer came by I did the same, but the swell from the second steamer swamped us—I have been accustomed to the river these six years—I belong to two rowing clubs, the river was very shallow, almost down tide—I could not judge of the speed at which the steamer was going that swamped us, I did not see the least alteration in its speed—when I found the water come to my waist, I thought we had better swim; a boat like that would go from under us if it sank, and we should have had to swim—I had to kneel in the water, it was up to my waist, and I got into the water and swam—I believe the deceased did the same as I did, but I was the first to go, and of course I could not see—I daresay the gunwale of our boat was 8 inches out of the water—I have been in the same boat before, at least there are three of the same build, and I have been in one of the three, I can't say it was the same boat—the swell from the second steamer was such as I have never seen before—I saw one other boat swamped oh the same shore as us, and the skiff that picked me up had to go ashore to bale her out before we could start rowing—the boat that was swamped at the same time as us was a pair oar, something of the same description, but I don't think quite so light—I can't say how near it was to us when it was swamped, I only saw it empty and the water being baled out—the skiff that picked me up was a safer boat than ours—I daresay it would hold five persons, an ordinary pleasure skiff. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I account for there being more swell than usual by the water being very shallow, and the two steamers were closer together than usual—I had been out in shallow water before, but the two steamers being so close together, the one swell counteracted the other and so caused the rough water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Marshall Street, Golden Square—on Sunday morning, 27th July, I was on the river between Putney and Hammersmith, rowing up in a small boat, an out-rigged gig, a sculling boat for holding one person—shortly before I reached the Crab Tree, I observed two steamers coming up, following me; I was close in the Surrey shore, rowing up, keeping out of the tide; the two steamers passed me at rather a rapid pace, and when they had passed, the water was very rough indeed, rougher than I had ever seen it before—I had much difficulty in preventing myself being swamped, I hardly know how I did, I pulled across the tide somehow—I took a quantity of water into my boat, but not sufficient to sink me—I have been accustomed to go on the river for these eight years—I did not notice whether the second steamer was much more crowded than the first—I pulled close into the Middlesex shore opposite the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180109"/>
               <p>Crab Tree—I then looked towards the part from which I had just come, and I saw the deceased and his two companions in a small two-pair outrigged gig, in this very rough water, and saw the water pouring in over the side—I heard Gregory say in rather a loud tone of voice, "We shall have to swim for it"—I shouted out to them, "Can you all swim, "I received no answer, and I judged that they could, but I palled towards them as fast as I could, on account of the rough state of the water—it may have been a minute before I reached them, Gregory had then reached the shore—Bell remained in the boat, which was under the water, and the deceased was drowned—I could not attempt to save him, because I could not see him; I only saw his hat floating on the water, I noticed that the steamers were going fast, too fast for the crowded state of the river; I don't know that I can give you an idea of the pace, it may have been about six or seven miles an hour, I don't think it was faster; it was not full speed, because the water was dead low, and they cannot go at full speed at dead low water—I have no doubt it must have been what they call half speed, the space between the two steamboats was over 50 yards and less than 100, I should say—I saw two or three boats on the Surrey side emptying the water out caused by the two steamers—I saw two skiffs emptying water—I could not judge how many passengers there were on board the steamer.</p>

               <p>—I went to Beauchamp, and be came to the station and charged the prisoner with endeavouring to obtain 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him by representing the ring to be gold, and 18 carats—the prisoner then said he had not offered it for 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it was not gold, and he never represented it to be gold—the ring has never been out of my custody since, and I am certain it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>, B. M. I am a surgeon, of 31, Ludgate Hill I have attended the deceased since August, 1871; she died on 2nd July this year—I have frequently seen marks of violence on her head, arms, and neck—I attended her for shortness of breath, that was her principal oom<lb/>plaint; she was in general ill health—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of her body, and found bruises on her left breast, left shoulder, and left hand, an abrasion on her left shin, and a bruise on her right hip—the bruises were not severe; the abrasion on the left shin was the worst, the skin was torn off—I opened her body; disease of the right lung was the primary cause of deith, and there was disease of the liver, with jaundice—that was not con<lb/>nected with the disease of the lungs—I have not the least doubt that treatment such as I have hearoj would accelerate her death, diseased as she was; it was hastened by ill usage.</p>

She died from absolute exhaustion, <hi rend="italic">asthemia</hi>—the right lung was totally disorganised, and I should imagine that the heart was very weak—there was regular want of power, and in such a state she would require to be kept perfectly quiet, and to be attended carefully, and not to have any hardships or knocking about, whioh would be certain to expedite death by aggravating the disease, by calling on the diseased organs to do more than they would have to do, and by shocking the nervous system—I have cautioned the prisoner two or three times, and told him that if he ill used his wife in the way he did he would get into a scrape, but he was generally so drunk that I don't think he understood me.</p>

I live at 10, Back Hill, Hatton Garden, and am the prisoner's daughter—on the morning of 30th May, about 8 o'clock, I was in my bedroom with my little cousin, Margaret Ross, twelve years old—I sent her down stairs—I could not see my father at the time, but he was on the stairs, and she was playing towards him—I saw her bend forward, and thought she was going to jump on my father's back—I did not see what he did, but I heard her cry out "Annie, Annie!"—I went towards her, and saw my father as though he was fighting or pushing away something from im, and making a horrible noise with his mouth—I did not see anything in his hand—I caught the child and pressed her to me, and saw blood on my arm—I called my mother and caught my father by the neck, and pushed him down the stairs—he had been drinking a little, and did not seem right in his mind—he had been in bed all night—I think this might ave been an accident; he has been such a kind disposition all his life—he is a cabinet-maker by trade; he was very fond of the child and she of him; she loves him—she has been to see him in prison and kissed him there—she would go to him now—(<hi rend="italic">The child was brought into Court and readily went to the prisoner and kissed him</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Princes Street, Haggerstone, and am a labourer in the service of the St. Katherine's Dock Company—on 19th June I was at work on the fifth floor of "D "warehouse with two other men, Orange and Brown—the prisoner was delivery foreman—about 2 o'clock he took me down to "D "warehouse, on the second floor—he took me through "H" room into "F" room—he took me in the corner, and told me to load up four small parcels standing against the wall—I put them on to the truck, and Orange and Brown trucked them into "H" room—I afterwards went into "H" room—they were bales of hide pieces—I saw the prisoner standing at the loophole—there was a van beneath—I did not see the four bales taken off the truck—I was told to load up some more bales—I did not see the bales afterwards—I then had further instructions from the prisoner to load up some more bales, but whether bales of hide or bales of gunny I am not certain—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> truck-man took them to the loophole—the prisoner ordered me to go into "F" room again, and load up some more bales from the corne; they were hide pieces—Orange and Brown trucked them to the loophole—the prisoner then told me to load up some more bales, which were gunny this time—they were standing opposite the loophole—the prisoner then told me to load up some more bales, and I went up into "F" room and loaded up one or two more bales of hide pieces—the prisoner did not then say anything to me about a small bale—I loaded up some more bales of gunny after that—he then told Orange to load up a small bale which stood behind a box in "H" room—it was then loaded up, trucked to the loophole, and lowered to Mr. Maynard, who stood at that time in the van—all the gunny that I loaded came from the "F" room to the loophole, and all the hide pieces, with the exception of the small bale I have spoken of, came from the corner of "F" room—the distance from the "H" loophole to the corner in "F" room I should say is thirty yards<lb/>after we had finished the delivery the prisoner told me to go up again to the fifth floor, where I saw him again soon after—he called me on one side as soon as I entered the door, and said to me "Round tree"—I said "Yes Sir"—he said "I think Mr. Nicholas has found out about some hide pieces being in the van, if he should say anything to you about it would you say that you have made a mistake. I can easily get you out of it, or make it all right with you; I can easily get you out of it by saying it was my mis<lb/>take in not telling you where they were"—I said "All right, Sir"—he said "Will you tell Orange and Brown the same?—I walked towards the men, who were at work, and he followed me and walked up to them—I said "You can tell them yourself'—he then told them similar to what he told me—I then went to work again on the fifth floor—I soon after saw Mr. Nicholas, the warehouse keeper, and the prisoner together—Mr. Nicholas said to me "Do you know what you are doing?"and I said "Loading up some bales of gunny I believe, Sir"—he said "Are you sure of that?"—I said "Yes, Sir"—he said "Will you give me your name and address, please?"—I said "Yes, Sir," and he took it down—then he took me across the yard, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180125"/>
               <p>said "Do you think that these are boles of gunny?"—I said "Well, I am sure I don't know, Sir, for I never see any of them packed; I have not worked here very long. I know they are all packed on the second floor; they might be hide pieces and gunny together for what I know"—after that I was sent up to my work—the bales that he showed me were those that I had just been loading; they were not in the van but in the yard—I was called down again after that to see Mr. Nicholas; Mr. Cox was there, and the prisoner was present—Mr. Cox, I believe, is the superinten<lb/>dent—Mr. Nicholas said "Here is the young man that loaded them up"—Cox then asked me where I loaded them from, and I told him—he said "What made you go into that room?"—I said "Knowing there were some small bales there; Mr. Maynard called out for a small sized bale, I suppose to make the load up or make them lie right, or something, and I went in there because they would be small"—then I took him up stairs and showed him where I loaded them from—when the bales were being loaded up I saw that they were hide pieces, but I told that lie to Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Cox to get the prisoner out of trouble as I thought—the following morning I told the exact story as it really happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told a lie—I have been in the employ of the St. Katharine's Docks Company since the 9th January, this last time—I am an off man, paid off every night—I am merely a labourer, and have been off sometimes during that period—I told the lie, thinking that by getting the prisoner out of trouble, I should stand a better chance of work, as my work rests with the foreman—I may have used the word "parcels" to-day and before the Magistrate for "bales"—they were like the other bales—both the prisoner and the truck-man told me to load up more bales—it is impossible sometimes to tell who gives a particular order, for there is a great deal of hurry in loading these things, and we have to do it very quickly—there are perhaps 50 or 60 bales of gunny or hide in each room at a time, and sometimes three or four jobs going on at once—the prisoner was not giving directions for three or four different jobs at the same time on the same floor—he was doing at least two jobs at the same time—he told Orange once, in my presence, to go and load up some more bales of hide pieces, and I believe I said that before the Magistrate—there might be three or four men working together, and the foreman might tell one man to tell another to do so and so—I had not the least idea there was anything wrong—I had no occasion to think so—mistakes might occur, but I never knew of such a mistake as that—the whole thing present to my mind was that he had 'made a mistake, and that it would be settled in a short time—what I told Mr. Nicholas, that I had never seen any bales packed, was quite true—hides smell very bad—there is no such smell about gunny—if packed side by side, the gunny might partake of the bad smell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the delivery foreman is delivering, he ought to be at the loophole—they were all one delivery—some were from "H" room—he never left the loophole—I did not know the difference between hide and gunny, and acted as I did to screen the prisoner.</p>

I found two, as I thought, out of 200 applications. I have obtained distinctions which few schoolmasters can lay claim to, and I have been debarred from carrying out my agreements for want of reasonable time. All I wanted was an equitable settlement I gave them every opportunity of inquiring into my circumstances.

               <p>the prisoner was on her—she had not been ill some time before this—she always kept to her business—she went to her work till Tuesday, and died on Sunday—I don't think she was as well as she had been, but she did not keep her bed—this was on the 19th of July—she complained of pain in the top of her head and in her throat—there was no beating or ill-treatment after that—she was ailing, and on Tuesday evening she came home and went up to bed, and never got up again—a medical man was sent for on Thursday night.</p>

The servant called me on 19th July, and I found the prisoner kneeling on the deceased in the passage—he had his bands pressing, her throat and squeezing her—I rushed up and pulled him from her, and asked him what he meant by it—he said "It is a nice thing, after going out to work hard all day, and coming home in this state. I am glad it has come to what it has; and as you have seen what you have here, it is quite sufficient for you"—I assisted the servant to lift the deceased up stairs, where she remained sometime very much exhausted—the servant fetched some cold water in a cup, which she drank a portion of—I sent for a cab, and the deceased was taken to the station—the prisoner asked for his hat and coat, and then he ran up stairs—I went after him and searched the bedroom, but he was not there—I heard his voice some time afterwards, in a garret—he said "It is no use you standing there, I shan't come, I will fight till I die first"—I sent to the station for assistance, and then we forced the door, and the prisoner stood on the stairs, with some<lb/>thing like a club in his hands, and said he would kill the first man that came up—we called out to him, and he dropped the weapon and came down—we took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of Essex Road—on Friday morn<lb/>ing, a little after 12 o'clock, I was sent for to the prisoner's house and found the deceased in a very exhausted state—she complained of pains in her throat, back, and side, and put her hand in various places, but she was in such a low state that I could not examine her with safety—I prescribed for her, as I thought she was suffering from pleurisy—I prescribed beef tea, but no stimulants—she died en 3rd August—I believe the primary course of death was pleurisy, accelerated undoubtedly by what I found after death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Tuesday, two days after<lb/>wards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180142"/>
               <p>and found the body very much emaciated, and on the left side, from the arm up to the ninth rib, were several severe bruises, extending from the outside of the nipple backwards to the spine—on the right side I found very much more severe bruises, so much so that the skin was separated from the parts beneath, and was puffy and doughey to the touch, and there was a recent scratch on the shoulder blade—on the point of each shoulder I found ecchymosis, but more particularly on one shoulder—there were considerable bruises on her throat, but it being warm weather decomposi<lb/>tion might have begun, and I should expect it to begin sooner after an injury—I can't say whether they were finger marks, they were darker in some places than others, but it was almost one mass of bruises—if the bruises on the ribs were produced by a man's fist I should expect the ribs to be fractured—the back was one mass of bruises, from ene side to the other—I should think it more likely to have been done with a stick—the bruises on the right side were very much more severe than the left, more especially from the fourth rib to the ninth, where the skin separated from the muscles—the heart was a little soft, but healthy, and the internal organs generally were healthy, except one of the kidneys which was a little diseased, but that had nothing to do with death—there was inflammation of the pleura, and under the part corresponding to the more severe blows there were adhesion which were easily broken down and therefore recent—I found con<lb/>siderable effusion in the chest, of serum coloured with blood, arising from the inflammation of the pleura—she died from pleurisy in a very weakened constitution, and accelerated by this treatment—I believe such treatment would cause pleurisy, but it might also arise from other causes; anyhow, such treatment as I saw the signs of, would accelerate death—she would, I think, have been much less likely to die of pleurisy if she had not had that treatment—she was a very weak, thin woman, and more liable to disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If I had examined the lungs and observed the extensive inflammation of the pleura, having heard nothing of the ill-treatment, and not having seen the external bruises, I should have said that the inflamed state of the pleura was sufficient to account for death, and that she died from pleurisy—when pleurisy is produced by violence you generally find a rib fractured—adhesions of the pleura to the chest are frequent after active inflammation of the pleura—I do not think the pleurisy was of long standing—I have heard that from 19th July to the Tuesday week following she was not confined to the house—I was called in after midnight on Thursday—if a violent attack of pleurisy had set in on the previous Tuesday it might arrive at a crisis which would cause death on the follow<lb/>ing Sunday—we had unexampled hot weather at the time I made the examination—the state of the atmosphere, and the length of time after death, sometimes causes extraordinary appearances on the outside; but not being satisfied, I went on Monday morning to examine the body, and found the bruises there—they were in places where I should not expect to find cadaverous marks, on account of the gravitation of the blood—the left side, from the collar bone down almost to the ninth rib, appeared to be entirely discoloured; there were some very small places, not the width of this pen, which were not discoloured—it is a fact that marks supposed to have been given by a stick have really been produced by the pressure of the folds, if the body has been enveloped in clothes and sheets—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180143"/>
               <p>patches were dark blue on the right side, or you might call it purple and reddish in other places; they were more or less continuous on the left side, and went round almost to the spine—I have made many <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations; I know mistakes have been made in <hi rend="italic">cadaveric</hi> appearances, bruises have been mistaken for natural appearances sometimes, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, so much so that it is necessary to be extremely cautious not to be led into error—the <hi rend="italic">cadaveric</hi> appearances are produced by the cooling of the body; it is the fact that when after death the capillaries have lost their contractibility, that livid appearance is produced, and although the skin is pale, it becomes covered with patohes of a bluish or slatish colour, diffusing themselves over the greater part of the trunk and limbs—from what I heard and saw I think the appearances were the result of bruises; if it was uniform I should expect gravitation had something to do with it—I saw the body ten hours after death—I did not examine the surface of the body during life, but not being satisfied I went ten or twelve hours after death to make inquiries—most terrible mistakes have been made with respect to bruises—it is one of the characteristics of these patches that they are excessive, but in this case the bruises had nothing to do with gravitation—a person suffering from pleurisy Could not have gone to her daily work from the 19th to the next Tuesday week, it must have come on, since it was almost at its zenith when I saw her, or I should say that it had then existed several days, or there could not have been the ad hesion—I believe it came on before the Tuesday, because there were ad<lb/>hesions which could not have formed rapidly—if she had had pleurisy and gone about her work she would have suffered from shortness of breath and inflammatory action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The bruises on the right side were—worse than the left, the skin was separated from the muscles, which was not consistent with <hi rend="italic">cadaveric</hi> appearances to that extent—days must have elapsed before that, it could not occur in 48 hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any doubt now that what you saw was the result of bruises inflicted during life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt, certainly, those on the right side, I have not the slightest doubt about them—if the injuries had been inflicted a fortnight before, the bruises would still remain longer than a fortnight—I did not see her body while she was alive, but I did ten hours after death; there were then appearances of bruises which might have been a fortnight old, and there was a recent scratch on the shoulder, but that might be accidental—pleurisy may be the result of a blow or a Cold, and it is quite as likely that you may take cold in summer as well as winter, and cold, undoubtedly, will bring on pleurisy, especially if a person is weak, as she was, and standing about on the cold flags; she could have had pleurisy and gone about her work, but ft would not be to any extent—slight pleurisy will sometimes get worse without any assimilating cause, especially if the person moves about—squeezing the throat would not have any tendency to cause pleurisy, but kneeling on a person would, there must be some injury held in the throat, the attack must have existed some days.</p>

I live at 6, Arlington Square, and am a solicitor's clerk—I for many years knew a gentleman named Cooper, a solicitor—I have some knowledge of the prisoner; he used to call at the office occasionally, and do work for Mr. Cooper—Mr. Cooper died at my residence on 24th June, 1871—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 2nd July, 1873—it is in the prisoner's writing.</p>

Prepare for the worst. I will write you further to-morrow. "They were old ladies, therefore I did not say your nephew is dead, and they received a letter on the 26th—I have no doubt the telegram produced is the first I sent them after he was dead, and here is a letter from them acknowledging mine—I proved the will on 3rd July—that was about as soon as I could have proved it—I produce a rough draft of the will made by Mr. Cooper—the whole of it is in his writing, with the exception of a few alterations<lb/>he was very negligent in his way of doing these things—the prisoner was never clerk to Mr. Cooper or to me—he used to call there for processes for service, and he was dismissed by Mr. Cooper for various transactions—some</p>

               <p>three or four years before Mr. Cooper's death he forbad the prisoner to come near the office, and he applied to me for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as due from Mr. Cooper to him—Mrs. Armstrong is my mother-in-law—on proving the will leave was reserved to ray co-executor and he renounced—he received no money from me—the attesting witnesses were Charles Leech and Jane Bellamy, servants of mine, one still resides with me and the other is in a situation somewhere by Kingsland—I think Leech was about 16 or 17 years of age—Mr. Cooper died very suddenly, in a fit—the medical man who was there when I returned was Dr. Johnson, of 8, Arlington Square, next door to me—no inquest was held—I did not enter his death in a newspaper—I believe about two hours and a half elapsed between the seizure and the death—they sent for several medical men, but the gentle<lb/>man next door arrived, and the others were stopped—(<hi rend="italic">The register of death was here read</hi>)—I was absent when the medical man was there—I went down to see the aunts not very long after the funeral; I no doubt told them what was left them—I cannot tell whether I advanced one of them 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—I had to administer to Mrs. Lally's will as well as being executor to Mr. Cooper; I may have done so—I remember Mr. Henry Thomas Colea, I recollect that he died; he was no relation of mine—I was not benefited under his will; I was joint executor with another for the purpose of carrying on certain Chancery suits for him—my wife and my son did not receive considerable legacies under the will—I think he left them 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, but the estate was insolvent and there was not sufficient to pay the liabilities—the costs were deducted—I know that the prisoner wrote some scandalous letters to the aunts; they informed me of it—the first, as far as I can recollect, was October the 14th—these letters pro<lb/>duced appear to be in my writing; (<hi rend="italic">Dated 2nd and 3rd July, October</hi> 30, 2<hi rend="italic">nd December, and 3rd December t</hi> 1871). Mr. Cooper's insolvency was before I knew him—I have no idea what he paid in the pound—I never resided with a Madame de Vine, in Newman Street, Oxford Street—there was never such an insinuation as my being indicted for keeping an im<lb/>proper house—I never went by any other ñame than Levien—I daresay my brothers, when I have been a boy, have called me "Joe"—I am not at all surprised to hear that the prisoner applied to the Home Office in this matter after his threat to me, when he came and demanded 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he may also have applied to the Coroner; he may also have applied to the Attorney<lb/>General; nothing surprises me—my co-executor was one of Mr. Cooper's clerks, to whom he left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was Mr. Cooper's managing clerk—I had not done any business with Mr. Cooper for many years—I had no office with him in Lincoln's Inn Fields—he lived in my house eight or ten years formerly, then he lived with his mother, and after his mother's death he returned—I think for twenty-six years he was not three days absent from my house—my co-executor was prevented from acting with me partly by his suffering from gout—he renounced the executorship; he never called at my house in his life.</p>

On 30th July, I was at the Middlesex police-station—about 10. 30 I saw the three prisoners pass with a horse—Dawson was riding it, Errington walking close by its side, and Junex was about two yards in advance, on the foot path—I spoke to a constable and they were brought back—I asked Dawson where he had the horse from—he said he had not seen it—I asked the other two, and they said they knew nothing about it—I charged them—Dawson said he had never seen the horse, Errington said he met Dawson with the horse between Romford and Brentford that morning, and Junex said he met them near London Bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, belonging to the ship <hi rend="italic">Hudson</hi>—on 7th August she was lying in Shad well Basin—the prisoner was also a seaman—the deceased, Swan, came on deck that night between 12 and 1 o'clock—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on on deck—he bad a knife in his hand—he said "I come to see fair play, because I heard some of you are going to double-bank <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, and two or more are going to get on one"—Williams is <hi rend="italic">Bob's</hi> right name—the fight was between Williams and Watson and the boatswain—the prisoner said that if anyone interfered he would put his knife into him—one of them said "What have you got to do with it?"—the prisoner said "I like to see fair play; I have struck a blow already for you once"—the prisoner struck Williams two or three blows with a belaying pin—the deceased went towards the prisoner with his knife, and raised his hand—the prisoner struck him three or four blows with the belaying pin and broke his knife, and then the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was quiet between the deceased and the prisoner, but the other fight went on between Watson and Williams—Watson began to fight with the deceased, and after, that the deceased went to the prisoner, and the prisoner and him got fighting, not with their fists: the prisoner had a belaying pin, the deceased had nothing in his hand at that time—he struck him several times, and the deceased threw the prisoner down on the deck—they both went down—when they rose up the deceased said "Oh, Lord! I am stabbed," and fell to the deck—just before they both fell, I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand, as well as the belaying pin; the knife was in his right and the belaying pin in his left hand—I saw him stab the deceased in his left side, and the deceased fell after he was stabbed—he was bleeding—the prisoner then stood over him, and struck him twice across his head with the belaying pin while he was on the ground, and then threw the knife on to the quay—the vessel was lying close to the quay—the deceased was taken to the hospital—a policeman came on board, and the prisoner was taken to the station—I suppose he could have got away before that, there was nothing to stop him—neither the deceased nor the prisoner were tipsy—I don't know what they were fighting about—it was an American ship—the deceased was a man of colour, like myself, and so was Watson.</p>

On Sunday morning, 20th July, about 1. 15, I went to the prisoner's house and found the deceased dead—I found a wound which I took to be lacerated, but it might be incised, an inch and a half long in her private parts, and on the opposite extremity of the orifice, a slight abrasion—I attribute death partly to the hemorrhage and partly to the-shock to the womb from a blow of some kind, which was not in a healthy state before—there was also fatty degeneration of the heart, liver, and (kidneys, which would render death from a shock more likely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no appearance in the heart, liver, or kidneys, sufficient to cause death if there had been no wound—I did not attend her in her confinement, and could not form any opinion whether there had been flooding at that time—if there had been no recent flooding, such a blow as this would not induce it—if this broken piece of the sieve had penetrated her, there would be blood on it—I think the sieve cracked here, and that this sharp edge caused the wound—I cannot tell that it was in that position, but that was my impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>. Why would there be no blood on that part? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be a thin portion of the clothing between, and this being stiffer, it would produce it by pressing against the bone—the dress was covered with blood, and there were plenty of holes in it—she might have fallen on the sieve with her clothes round it—the crinoline was covered with blood—I examined it carefully, but could not find anything to account for the wound.</p>

I was in the bar of the public-house—there were half-crowns, two-shilling pieces, shillings, and sixpences in the till—I put two florins in the till—I marked both florins first, and then shut the till up—the prisoner sub<lb/>sequently came into the bar a few minutes after the half hour—he was left in the bar alone for about an hour—At 10. 30 I examined the till; the prisoner was then in the bar—I found one of the two florins that I had marked was missing; this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I had emptied the tills, with the exception of a shilling in each till, which we leave in every two hours—after doing so, I spoke to my master; he was then going out—next morning, Sunday, Mr. Whale came into the bar with Inspector Turk—my</p>

               <p>master said to the prisoner, "George, I want to speak to you," and called him up stairs into the sitting-room—he asked him if he had any marked money about him, and he said not that he was aware of—he then asked him if he had any objection to let him see what he had—he said No, he had no objection—the four of us then went up into his bedroom—the prisoner had a box there, and he unlocked it and took out a purse containing some silver and a half-sovereign, amounting to something over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that money was examined, but we did not find the marked florin amongst it—Inspector Turk asked him if he had any more money—he said "No"—afterwards we went to his cupboard, where his clothes were hanging up, and took some money from his pocket; five two-shilling pieces—he said he had forgotten that he had that—the cupboard was not locked, nor the bedroom door—another young man, the second barman, slept in his bedroom, but he was not in the bar on that Saturday between 9.30 and 10. 30—the Inspector examined the five florins, and found the one produced—I identified it as the one I marked—the prisoner said, if it was marked, I must have put it there—after some little talk, he said he had borrowed the money in his pocket from his brother the Sunday previous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at Noa. 106 and 108, High Street, Clapham, and have a large number of persons in my employ, and have several carts to go rounds, under the charge of men in my service—Gurr had been in my employ four or five years, or more, and his wages were 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his duties were to go out with a cart—his round was Tooting and beyond Wandsworth—he had to collect orders, to enter them in a book, and deliver them in the afternoon, and come back to the shop—he did not see the orders executed—he gave the particulars in the shop—he was also supplied with butters, lard; and eggs as surplus stock, to supply what might be wanted at the moment—he was not allowed to go elsewhere, except his round—he resided at 3, Bellamy Street, Balham, and had no right in that street—I had occasion, some six or seven months ago, to give an order with respect to refreshments going to their own houses—no man was to go off his round under any circumstances—if they required refreshment, they were to drive home and take their dinner or tea hour, and if the horse required refreshment, they were to bring it home and place it in the stable—they were not to call at their own homes—they could buy goods in the shop under certain circumstances, but, would have to pay for them, or have them booked in the regular way—I use a waste-book, a jour<lb/>nal, a small rough ledger, into which every small account is posted, and an ordinary ledger—if a man in Gurr's position had purchased a ham, or any article of that sort, it would have gone into the waste-book, and from that into the rough ledger—it would have been booked to him in the rough ledger—about the 10th of May I had a communication made to me, and in consequence of that, I had an interview with a man named Spearing, who resides next door to Gurr's, in Bellamy Street, Balham, in consequence of which I communicated with the police, when a room was hired three doors from Gurr's, in the same street, and two detectives, Mellish and Panther, were instructed to attend there—on the 31st of May my attention was called to something in reference to Gurr—I gave him into custody—it was Saturday night—I paid him myself when he was given into custody—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180184"/>
               <p>then went down to his house, 3, Bellamy Street, which was searched—I saw the whole of the things found, at the station, afterwards—they were my property, to the best of my belief—I had a customer of the name Delay, who lived at Tooting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I employ from 40 to 50 hands altogether—I should say there are from 20 to 25 or 30 in the shop—about a dozen I should think would be authorised to supply goods to anyone who asked, or to one of my own men—Jolly is not a shopman—I had a man named Judd, but he died I think, at Christmas—it is possible that he died since the 30th May, and he may have been in the shop on the 28th May—I am only speaking from memory—I am not very dear on that point—I should not object to the men having goods if they paid for them, or they were properly booked—if a ham were ordered and the person ordering it did not want it after all, it would be the duty of the man to bring it back—if such a thing had happened with Mr. Delay the prisoner's book should prove it—I do not look after such a matter myself—I know of no such errors as things being en<lb/>tered to the wrong person—I have twelve or thirteen carts for the delivery of goods to customers—it might happen that a man taking out one of these carts would be ill, and his place would be supplied by someone else—I have no doubt it may have occurred towards the end of May, probably it was so—I prosecuted one of my men for embezzlement about May, I believe shortly before this time in question—I do not remember discovering any other peculations in my establishment—I had not had confidence in the prisoner quite up to this time—I had always had confidence in the prisoner—I had no proof to the contrary—many of the goods found in the house were such as any grocer would sell—it is my belief that my men generally as a rule dealt with me for grocery, and they pay for what they have—that is understood—I have looked in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and find no entry of a ham either taken out, or returned, and no grocery of the description on the 24th or 30th—if a ham had been ordered by Mr. Delay, and not wanted, it would have been the man's course of business to have brought it back—it ought to have been given credit for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the employ of Mr. Wright—Gurr was a fellow-servant—about 28th May he asked me for a ham for Mr. Delay, who was a customer—I wrapped the ham in paper and wrote on it "Delay, Esq., 11 1/2 lbs. at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb."—I saw a ham afterwards which had been found in the prisoner's house—this piece of paper is what I wrapped it in—there is my writing on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have sent hams to Mr. Delay before, and I always do them up in paper—I believe it was on or about the 28th May this occurred; it was about the time of the races—I had often served Gurr with things before—it often happens that goods are returned—the ham would be charged in the waste-book first—it would be entered in the order-book by the man who took the order, and then copied into the day-book—Gurr might have had some provisions for himself about that time, but if he did they were paid for—I was always paid for all goods that he had—I have no doubt he had some goods at the end of May.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). I watched Gurr's house from the early part of May—on 28th May, about 9 o'clock a. m., I saw him drive up with another man—I made notes at the time—I was at Rose Cottage, a few doors from his house—he took some oranges from the cart, stopped eight minutes, and drove away—he drove up again at 1. 8 o'clock, took a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Bellamy Street is about a mile and a quarter from Mr. Wright's shop—it is a thoroughfare, and runs parallel with the main road—Rose Cottage is a detached house, about five or six doors from the end of the street, and on the same side as Gurr's house—there are only two houses in between—there are steps up to the front door of Rose Cottage—the window was open at times—I was sitting close to the window, but the people passing in the street could not see me, because there were curtains—they were open knitted curtains—I could not see Gurr's door from the window, nor the gate—I could not see anyone going in and out of that gate—I could see the roadway—I took the direction he went in—I could see him going in the direction of the gate—I saw him going into the house once—that was on 31st May at 9. 10 a. m.—I was in the road—he took in some stout—there was no concealment in his taking in the things—he generally came about 9 o'clock in the morning first.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On all these occasions I could see that the cart drove up opposite the house, and things were taken from the cart, and he returned without the things—the distance between the cart and the front door of his house is about 7 yards, the distance of the path and the forecourt.</p>

Izzard has been in my employment some time—it was his duty to go the Clapham Common round with the cart to get orders, enter those orders in his book, and when he returned to hand the book in and assist at the counter—it was part of his duty to go out and deliver goods, except the other man was ill, and then he would take his place—he resided next door but one to Gurr—his wages were 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—if he wanted goods for his own consumption, I should haw allowed him to have them on his paying cash or having them entered against him—I received a communication—Panther and Mellish watched his house from next door—on 31st May I had some information from the police, and Izzard was taken into custody—before I gave him into custody I said "What have you taken into your house this morning?"—he said he had taken nothing—I said "What did you take in the day before and the days previously"—he said he had taken in bottles of milk—I said "Probably you have taken in bottles of milk, but parcels?"—he said if he had taken in any parcels they were paid for—I afterwards went to his house in Bellamy Street with the police, and saw a variety of articles found there—I found two parcels, one of which I speak to, containing sugar, tea, and cocoa, of the value of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found two bottles of stout, and a variety of bottles containing sauces, and five packets of different kinds of grocery—I saw 32 empty condensed milk cans found in the dust-bin—I had given instructions to the men with respect to refreshments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Izzard had been in my service nearly 10 years, and up to this time I have had no complaint to make against him—I communicated to all the men who went out with horses and carts, and I am sure this man was there—the price of the tins of milk full is 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; they are of no value at all empty—the value of all the other things that were found will be under 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he wanted goods he would order them of any of the shop<lb/>men, and there are twelve or fourteen—if he paid for them at the time, they would not be booked; it would not appear what he had had, but only so much money received.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). Mellish and myself watched the premises of Izzard in Bellamy Street, from the 23rd May till he was given into custody—Mellish took notes at the time—I saw Izzard in his cart on the 23rd, 24th, 26th, and 27th—I saw him take things from his cart into the house; they appeared like parcels of grocery—on the 28th he drove up with the cart at 12 20—he took a small parcel from a basket, and put it in another basket,</p>

               <p>and took it into the house; came to ask to the cart, took two bottles, one wrapped in white tissue paper, into the house, and back to his cart, let down the tail board, and took out a square box of plants in pots—that was all I saw that day—on the 29th he drove up at, 7. 37 in the morning—he did not deliver anything there—he came again at 1. 36, took three parcels from the cart, one rather large, in brown paper, and two black bottles—he put them in a basket, and put them in—I saw him again in the afternoon, but he did not take anything in then—on the 30th he drove up at 1. 54, foot a basket containing several small parcels, and two black bottles and a large brown paper bag full of Something—I saw him on the 31st about 2. 40—he took into the house two black bottles, one large dark brown paper parcel, a light paper bag, and a deal box—on the evening of that day, a communication was made to Mr. Wright, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of J. C. &amp; T. Field, of Upper Marsh, Lambeth, wax bleachers—we have another business in the name Cowan &amp; Co., in Moorgate Street—at the time he Was taken, Ralph had been in our employ as a labourer about six years, at Upper Marsh—I did hot know any of the other prisoners—in April this year, three blocks of yellow wax were shown to me by my foreman, Brockwell—in the preceding January, I had executed an order for Messrs. Clark, for shipment of ten tons of wax of a particular kind; the blocks were white and of a special shape—in executing these orders there was necessarily a surplus—that order would be executed at Upper Marsh, and such surplus blocks as remained would be kept on the premises to be worked up again in the next quantity—ten tons of yellow wax were supplied to Messrs. Clark, and I had no complaint of any deficiency—I caused inquiries to be</p>

               <p>made in April, and came in communication with King, who carries on business in Union Street, Southwark; and about the same time I saw some wax in a bag at my premises at Moorgate Street, broken up—I put two of the blocks together, and am prepared to swear that it was my make and my property—it was not in a state in which I should have sold it—I commu<lb/>nicated with the police at Scotland Yard, and obtained the services of Sergeant Croome—I went with him on 18th April to King's premises, and asked him to show me about 3 cwt. of wax; he showed me both white and yellow wax, and I took samples of it on a subsequent occasion—I can swear to 3 cwt. of wax as our manufacture, but I cannot swear we had not sold it, although the white wax I can swear was stolen—the yellow wax was finished, but the white wax was unfinished—King showed me two blocks, about 25 lbs. each, of unfinished wax, besides the 3 cwt. of yellow—I suppose the yellow to be mine as well—in consequence of what King said, I went to Jewell's premises in Gibson Street, Waterloo Road—he is a marine store dealer—I had a prolonged conversation with him, in conse<lb/>quence of which I went, on Friday afternoon, to Mrs. Castle's premises, a marine store dealer's, of Union Street, Lambeth Walk, about ten minutes walk from Jewell's—I said "My name is Field, and this is Sergeant Croome of the Detective Force; I have come here in consequence of what I have been told by Mr. Jewell, who tells me that on various occasions he has purchased wax of your son, the wax so purchased is my property, and has been stolen from me, and I have called to ask you what account you can give me of it" (I ought to have mentioned that in the first instance I had asked for George Castle, but his mother said that he was not at home)—she said "I know nothing about the wax; I never had any on my premises, and I am sure my son has not, I don't even know what beeswax looks like; does it look like grease or tallow?"—I said "When will your son return"—she said that it was uncertain, as he was frequently away for days together, and it was quite possible he was in Yorkshire—I said I wished very much to see him—she said "I promise that he shall call on you directly he returns, and if I hear from him before he returns, I will let you know where he is"—I had brought some papers from Jewell's, and I said "I have his receipts which Jewell holds, which he says are in your son's handwriting, for money received for beeswax; is that your son's writing?"—she said "It is like it"—she said "You may, if you please, search the house;" 'that her son in addition to helping her in the business did business on his own account—I then left—next day I went again, but I, had received four other pieces of paper from Jewell—I am not sure whether I had seen Jewell before I went to Castle's house again, but it is quite likely—I merely inquired whether George Castle was there, but did not find him—that was Saturday—I saw Jewell on the Monday, and gave him some information about George Castle, and on that Monday evening George Castle came to me at my office in Lambeth Marsh—I said "Mr. Jewell has given your name to me as the seller of a large quantity of wax"—he said "I have sold wax to Jewell on many occasions, and I can give the receipts of the parties from whom I purchased it"—I asked him where the receipts were—he said "At my house"—I said "I am willing to go with you and see them at once"—I walked with him to his house, and a search was made—two pieces of paper were shown to me—one was a receipt in the name of Howe, of Clapham Road, and another in the name of Woolf, but no address—a statement was made that Woolf resided in the neighbourhood</p>

               <p>of Spitalfields—I called Castle's attention to the fact that both the receipts related to sales in 1872, and said "Surely the blocks of wax I have seen were not manufactured till 1873, and therefore these receipts can by no possibility apply to them"—he said "I have many other receipts, but they are probably at my mother's house, from where I have only just removed"—this was at his private house, two or three minutes' walk from his mother's—he said "I have made no recent sale to Jewell"—I then went with him to his mother's house, and searched there, but no receipts were found—I then went back to his house—Croome took the particulars of the two receipts, and we left—Castle said "I will call on you on Wednesday"—he did come on the Wednesday, and said "I have been endeavouring to find the parties whose receipts I have shown you, bat I have been unsuccessful"—I told him that Croome had been trying to find Howe, and no such person could be found in the neighbourhood—I don't remember that he made any remark to that—he said he was in the habit of doing business with persons whose names and addresses he did not know—he said "I have bought wax from such parties, and I shall, no doubt, come across them in the course of business shortly, and will get their names and addresses and let you have them, and I will call upon you again next Monday"—I said "Castle, this is an attempt to throw dust in our eyes, and you may call again if you please"—that was Wednesday evening, 23rd April—I saw nothing more of him till the 3rd June, when he was in custody—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts handed to me by Jewell, which I showed to Mrs. Castle, some of them have no dates—they show a total of 5 cwt. 3 qrs. 2 lbs.—the prices are; 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10 1/2 d., and 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—the yellow wax I saw at King's was worth from 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and the white wax from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—I afterwards went to the premises of Johnson &amp; Co., Bishopsgate Street, and saw seven blocks of white wax, representing 2 cwt.—I indentified it as my manufacture—four blocks were saleable and in a finished condition, and three blocks; were unfinished—I afterwards went to Mr. Edwards, the doll maker, in Waterloo Road—he showed me some papers, and I showed him a sample of wax—I did not see any of my wax there; it had been used—I received a communication from a person named Rumble, which I communi<lb/>cated to Croome with certain instructions, and he came back to me and brought two pieces <hi rend="italic">of</hi> yellow wax, each weighing six or seven pounds, which I identified—it was in an unfinished state and not as it would be sold—it was worth about 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—about the same time I received information from a person named Gadsden, and went to the place of Mr. Williams, 108, Minories, where I saw the witness Addis—I had a conversation with him, in eousequence of which I went to Howe's shop in Cambridge Heath Road, on 28th April—Croome spoke first; he said "I was here a day or two since, purchasing wax, and on my return I found that you charged me less than you should have charged"—Howe rectified the amount, and Croome paid him some money—Croome then said "This is Mr. Field, and he has come about the wax that I purchased"—I said "I am Mr. Field, of Lambeth. I have been robbed of this wax to a very large extent, and this is an officer from Scotland Yard who purchased some wax from you that I know to be mine, in a state in which it would not be sold, I must ask you to tell me from whom you bought it"—he said "I bought it from a man, whose name I do not know, from a traveller who comes round to me every Thursday, and with whom I have done business for some time"—I said "You must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180190"/>
               <p>know his name and address"—he said "I know neither"—I said "Do you buy goods without getting a bill or receipt?"—he said "No, no doubt I have one somewhere"—he searched, and produced a bill from which the printed head had been torn off, and the writing was so obscure that it could not be deciphered whether it was wax or not—I said that he had made a mistake in giving me that—I still pressed him for the name and address—he said he would ask the man when he called again—on 30th April I called again, leaving Thursday between—I said to Howe "I have called again about that wax, and hope you are in a position to give me the address of the person of whom you bought it"—he said "Yes," and he gave me a receipt in the name of Haywood on one of his own bill-heads—I said "This is no address"—he said "The seller declines to give his address"—I then produced some samples I received from Mr. Gadsden, and said "I am informed you have offered wax to this sample, for sale to the amount of 2 cwt."—he said "I have not'—he was asked that question several times, and repeated the same answer—I can't say whether the samples I showed him were my manu<lb/>facture, because they Were so small—Croome mentioned Castle's name amongst several others, as persons from whom he might have bought the wax—he said "No," to 'every name that was mentioned, including Castle—Ralph's name was not mentioned—on Tuesday, 3rd June", my manager, ‘Mr. Walker, brought Witham to me—I made no inducement to Witham, but I had offered a reward by placards—I did not promise not to prosecute him.</p>

               <p>but Howe possessed only yellow wax and no bleached wax, to my knowledge—I identify the wax Howe had by its peculiar appearance, and it also fitted into my tins—I swear to my own manufacture; it is my positive and absolute oath—the samples are about as big as walnuts; they are for the purpose of tradesmen judging of the quality—I declined to identify these samples on account of their smallness—samples are generally double that size, you seldom see a piece so small as this—Mr. Gadsden gave this to me—Howe had no idea that Croome was a detective till I said so—Hove was not open in his answers, quite the reverse—he represented the invoice of some oil as the invoice of wax—he said that the man had been there on Thursday and given the name of Haywood, and refused his address—he keeps am oil and colour shop, not a marine store dealer's—I should not have sold this wax in this state; it is competent to anybody to buy, but we don't sell goods in am unfinished state—I do not say that nobody ought to have bought it—I have always denied that—James King has bought a good deal, and Jewell also—John Edwards purchased a large quantity of my wax from King—the is not present—80 lbs. of my wax was purchased by Mr. Sundell, but it was not found there; he had none left—Sundell and Edwards purchased pieces in a finished state—I told Howe that unless he told me how he came in possession of my property I must find out for myself—he knew at that time that Croome was a detective—MESSRS. Johnson are a highly respectable firm—I buy wax largely for the purpose of making up, and I may purchase wax in the market—I very seldom buy wax of my own unfinished—Rumble is my witness—he has been paid money by me in the course of this case—I can't tell you how much—none of it has passed through my hands—he is a painter—I heard it stated at the Police Court that he is a convicted thief—I have given Sergeant Croome money to be expended amongst the witnesses for their travelling expenses to the different Mice Courts—I believe any direct money paid has been paid by our foreman, Thomas Brock well—I saw no wax in Howe's shop—I have heard that it was in the window, exposed for sale, and sold over the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Field's foreman, at Tipper Marsh, where the wax bleaching goes on—Ralph was a labourer there—I remember a package being brought from the City premises—I found in it three blocks of yellow wax, similar to those I had manufactured for Clark &amp; Sons in January—I identified a portion of it as sample blocks of that manufacture the remainder of it consisted of oblong blocks of yellow wax in pieces, which I also identify as Messrs. Field's manufacture—I went to King's premises, and saw two blocks of semi-refined wax there, which I identified as Messrs. Field's—it was wax which is not sold by itself, except for the purpose of being mixed with other wax—I also saw, in King's bedroom, about 2 cwt. of refined yellow wax, which I identify as our manufacture—I then went to the landing, and saw four boxes of refined yellow wax, bleached</p>

               <p>and finished, in condition for sale, which I identified as Mr. Fields manu<lb/>facture—I also found a bag there with two sorts of wax in it, mixed up in pieces—that was our manufacture also—I sent to Messrs. Johnson &amp; Sons' some wax of Mr. Field's manufacture, and noticed that two blocks of it were not finished for sale—as to the second lot supplied to Clark, 10 tons of it were made in earthenware vessels—I identify it by the shape of the vessels in which it is made—the former parcel was made in tin vessels—Rumble was ultimately brought to me—his name was mentioned, and I remember his coming to the premises about 24th or 25th April—nine men were brought out altogether, and Ralph amongst them—Humble pointed out Ralph the moment he saw him—on 30th May I went to Messrs. Middleton's premises in St. George's-in-the-East, and was shown some wax there—I had with me a portion of wax that Croome gave me, which had been purchased at Howe's—part of what I saw at Middleton's was in an unfinished state—a portion of that which Croome gave me was unfinished, and both were part and parcel of the same material.</p>

I saw some wax in pieces, in a bag, at King's; some of them were as large as the palm of your hand, some larger, and some smaller—I can't say whose manufacture this piece produced is, because it is in such a dirty condition—I don't know that I could recognise it if it was clean, but if it was white wax, and a little larger, I could; if the pieces were clean, it is very likely I might pick out a great portion of them—I think I could recognise this piece without any difficulty, because no one manufactures it in the same way as we do—I know it by the beautiful was in which it is got up; our wax is, I believe, got up better than anyone else's—I don't think it is more difficult to identify white wax than yellow, if you give me a piece of the proper size.</p>
