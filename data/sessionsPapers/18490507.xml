On the night of 2d April I went to a public-house opposite the Victoria Theatre, and saw the prisoner—I asked him where his barge was—he said he had not got one—I said, "Are not you at work for Mr. Smith"—he said, "Yes," and Mr. Smith had sent him for some sacks—he showed me the order, and I directed him to the place, but he said he was not going that night—I left him in the New-cut—next morning I went on board my barge, and found him in the cabin—I asked if he was not going for the sacks—he said he did not like to go, because he had spent the money—he gave me the key of the barge, and told me to give it to Mr. Smith—I did so.</p>

                  </hi> I am a constable. Mason was an overlooker in the tea department at Nicholson's wharf. On Saturday, 21st April, about two o'clock, I was on the wharf and saw Mason come out of the warehouse—I followed him into the Queen's Head public-house, which adjoins the premises—I went in and saw him there, sitting on the settle, close to Batishall—I staid there about five minutes and then left—I saw Mason come out and go into the warehouse—he came out again, and I asked him who the man was that I had seen in the parlour at Howard's (the Queen's Head) with him—he said that it was only a man that his brother <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> knew—I asked if he had any tea about him—he said, "No"—I felt in his apron and there found 3lbs. of tea in the pocket—I said he had better come and see Mr. Besley, one of the part<lb/>ners—he said that if I would let him go he would give me a sovereign; that he had a wife who was nearly dead, and a large family; that he would give me anything if I would let him go—I then sent for Mr. Besley and went to the Queen's Head and looked where the two prisoners had been sitting, and found a small quantity of tea on the settle, and a little on the ground where they had been sitting—I afterwards went after Batishall; I found him in Botolph-lane, with a bundle in his hand—I asked if he had any tea about him—he said, "No"—I examined the bundle and found that it contained 4 or 5lbs. of tea—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes elapsed between my seeing the prisoners together and finding the tea on Batishall—when I stopped Mason he was turning up the gateway to go into Thames-street, which would have brought him into Botolph-lane; it would not take him to the Queen's Head.</p>

On Saturday evening, 21st April, I was alone in my shop—you enter the shop from a door in the passage—about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, a man came into the shop and asked for a watch—I requested him to close the door, which he had left open; he did so—I thought he wanted a watch that had been left to be repaired, and asked him what name it was in—he said, "I want to purchase a watch"—I asked him what price, and he said he was not particular—I showed him two lever watches, and afterwards a third—I said I would recommend him either of the two, which would last</p>

On 28th April, about four o'clock in the morning, I was in Dean-street, Westminster, and met Seymour—she asked me to go home with her—I said, "No"—she said, "Yes, you must go home with me"—I said, "No, I will not"—she said, "Yes, you must" I said, "If I do go I can only give you sixpence"—she said, "Oh, never mind, that is plenty of money"—I accompanied her to a house in St. Ann-street—we went up-stairs to a bed-room, and she said, "You must give. me the money"—I gave her the sixpence—she called in the prisoner Taylor, and said I must give her some money to get some drink—I said I had already given what I promised her—I gave Seymour 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more, and she then called in Bishop, and said, "Here</p>

Howel James, in Dorsetshire; that suited me very well—I left because he was making an alteration in his establishment—on this night I had been to Astley's Theatre, and had afterwards sat some time with a friend, a servant in place, in a coffee-shop near Astley's—I went there about twelve o'clock, and staid an hour or an hour and a half I think—after I left there I walked with him as far as Charing-cross, and then round Trafalgar-square for about a quarter of an hour, talking—he left me to go home a little after two; he lived at Charing-cross—I then went down Parliament-street, and walked through Dean-street, and came as far as Buckingham Palace through York-street—I wandered about there because I could not get into my lodgings; I thought I was locked out—I do not know what time it was I met the prisoner, I had no watch; it might have been four; I was walking about till then—I was not in the habit of walking about till that time—I have been out all night three or four nights since I have slept in Kinnerton-street—I have lived at Mr. Bacon's, in Humphrey's-yard more than a month—I lodged with him before I left my situation, when Colonel Higginson was in town—while I was there I did sometimes come home at three or four in the morning, and lie in bed till twelve in the day; and I have lain in bed later—sometimes I got up at seven—I was seldom home before twelve—I was doing nothing to get my living—I was in Colonel Higginson's employment a short time while I lodged there, and I continued to lodge there afterwards—I have not got a place since.</p>

                  </hi> I am lighterman, and job for my uncle, John Riley, of Lower Thames-street. On Tuesday evening, 24th April, between nine and ten o'clock, I was on Nicholson's Wharf <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>, which is a pier projecting from the wharf, and saw M'Clarens and Midcjleton there—I first saw them <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> away in a boat from Cox's Quay, which is the second wharf above Nicholson's, nearer the bridge—I watched them, and saw them <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> alongside Mr. Riley's punt, the <hi rend="italic">Oak</hi>, which was afloat off Nicholson's Wharf, and had sugar in it—they made fast their boat to the <hi rend="italic">Oak</hi>, got out of it on to the <hi rend="italic">Oak</hi>, and walked over her to another barge which was lying alongside of her—they got out of her into a French vessel, which was lying along the wharf, and stopped there several minutes, while the Thames police-galley was passing</p>

               <p>along—I saw no more of them that night—next morning, on coming to Legal Quay, I saw my uncle, and, in consequence of what took place between us, we went to find Draddy's house out; it is in Rosemary-lane—I saw a cart coming down Rosemary-lane with three bags of sugar in it—I saw the bags that were left in the punt next day, and they were like those in the cart—after I left the cart I met the police and my uncle in the lane, went to Draddy's house, and saw him in the shop; it is a greengrocer's and chandler's—they sell everything, I believe—I said to Draddy, "I wish to speak to you"—he said, "Oh, it is all right, the police have been here"—I said, "Have they?"—he said, "You had better come again by-and-by, I can't talk to you now"—I then returned to a house in the lane, where my uncle and the police were—that was between one and two o'clock—I went again to Draddy between seven and eight in the evening, and asked him if I might step backwards—he said, "Stop a minute," and went and said something to his wife, which I could not hear—he then said, "Yes, you may step backwards"—I walked into the parlour, saw Mrs. Draddy sitting there, and I said <hi rend="italic">to</hi> her, "You have had a curious <hi rend="italic">start</hi> to-day"—she said, "Yes, I have indeed"—I said, "I hear the police have been here?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I came to let you know that the police had information"—she said, "Yes; but you were too late"—she said the police had been there and wanted to search the house, but she refused as they had not got a search-warrant; that one of the officers went into the cellar, but she did not mind that, because she knew there was nothing there—she said had they had a warrant she should not have known what to have done—I said, "Why, were the three bags here, then?"—she said, "Yes, they were all lying together," and her and her daughter had had a rare job to wash the sugar away down the sink-hole—I said, "What did you do with the rush part of the bags?"—she said she burnt them—I asked what she did with the under part (there is a matted part underneath)—she said her daughter carried them out of the shop underneath her shawl, and she should not have known what to have done if it had not been for a good tub of water that was in the yard—she said there was sugar in the bags, at least I said to her, "Did you have the three bags of sugar here when the officers came in?" and she saidr "Yes"—she said she bought the sugar—she did not say what she gave for it, but said it was a great loss to her to have to lose between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to have to wash it away in that manner down the sink-hole—she did not mention who she got the sugar from—I said, "Why did you buy so much sugar of them?" and she said she would not again—there was a cask of sugar in the shop, and I saw some on the table which she was pounding up with a hammer; it was moist sugar, but in little lumps—she said that it was all that remained out of the three bags—she asked me to have a drop of gin, which I had in a little water, and mixed up some of the sugar with it—I then went away and called the officers—I saw the lug-boat on the Friday that I had seen M'Clarcns and Middleton in on the Tuesday night—it was then lying at the Tunnel-pier—I knew it again; there is not another boat like it oh the river.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-police inspector</hi>) On Wednesday afternoon, 25th of April, I went to Draddy's house, between three and four o'clock—I measured the length of the court which leads from Chamber's-street into Rosemary-lane—it is about sixty or sixty-five yards—Draddy's shop-door is at the corner of the court, in Rosemary-lane—there are two other doors in the court leading to Draddy's house—three doors altogether—the first door in the court is about five yards from Rosemary-lane, and the second about the same distance; the front door is in the lane itself—I went into the shop and walked into the back-room where he was—I told him I wanted to speak to him, and walked up-stairs followed by him and his wife—I said to him, "Draddy, have you had any sugar offered to-day or last night?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you bought any?"—he said, "No, except a quarter of a cwt, I had of a Mr. Wood," and I think he said "yesterday"—his wife said, "It is not likely he would have bought any, for if he had he would not be as he now is (meaning that he was sober), for he would have bad a drop on the strength of it"—I then asked if he had any objection to allow me to search his house—his wife said, "Are you going to look for anything else besides sugar?"—I said, "No"—and she said, "You may look"—I then went over the upper part of the house, and on going down into the back parlour, where I had left inspector Jones, he said in their presence, "Why, they have been burning the sugar bags; see, here is some of it," and he produced a portion; I do not know where he took it from, he had it in his hand—I then looked in the grate, and found a portion of burnt sugar bags which I now produce, with some sugar still on it—I then went into a back wash-house adjoining that room, and I saw sugar spilled over the flooring, and the yard adjoining was very wet, as though it had been recently washed down—I then went into the room again and saw a large cask with about one and a half or two cwt. of sugar in it—it was dry sugar—I took a sample of it—there were three kinds of sugar in it, placed one on the top of the other—I asked Draddy if any of that sugar was what he had from Mr. Wood; he said, "No"—I then left—I went again between eight and nine the same night—I had had some information from the witness John Riley—I asked Draddy if he had any objection to show me the bill of parcels for the sugar he had had from Mr. Wood—he said, "No, certainly not," and he produced a bill of parcels—I then took another sample of sugar from the same cask, and near the cask I saw a brown paper bag containing sugar—I took a sample from that—I asked whether it was any portion of the sugar he had had from Mr. Wood—he said, "No"—I then asked where he had got the sugar from, and he said, "That is putting it too close"—his wife said, "We sometimes buy ten pounds of sugar or so of the labourers"—he told her to hold her tongue and not to say too much—I then went away—next day I went again, and told him I was not satisfied concerning the burnt sugar bags; that I must apprehend him for receiving three bags of sugar knowing them to be stolen—he said, "Where are they? ah! where are they?"—I afterwards went to Mr. Wood—I have been to the place with the witness Stokes; he showed me Draddy's house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector.</hi>) I went to Draddy's house on Wednesday afternoon, the 25th April, at half-past four o'clock—I saw Draddy and told him I wished to speak to him; that I was an inspector of police, and I had come to search his house for three bags of sugar which had been stolen the night previous—he said he had got no sugar there but what was his own—I asked him to allow me to search the cellar—he said that he did not know that he should—I asked him a second time, and he said, "You may go in the cellar"—I took Shayne with me, and a small boy with a light, but found nothing there—I then went into the back room—it smelt as if there had been afire—I found four pieces of mat bagging on the back part of the stove—two pieces are partly burnt, and a great quantity of water had been <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> on the fire, and the fire was nearly put out—there was water left behind on the hobs and under the grate—I put my fingers into the water and tasted it; it was quite sweet and sugary—I afterwards went into the yard, it had been well washed with water—I put my fingers into it close to the sink between the stones, and it tasted of sugar—I was with Bridges when Mrs. Draddy was taken on 2d May—Bridges told her he came to arrest her for being con<lb/>cerned in the sugar that had been brought to the house—she said she was not prepared to go; it was a hard case that she should suffer for what had been brought there.</p>

Druce—I took it at different times from 200, Regent-street by the prisoner's 'persuasion—I first saw the prisoner about a week after I went to live at Messrs Druce's—I met him at the Blue Posts in King-street, Regent-street, which is kept by Wright—he had a van with him with the name of Wilcoxon on it—he asked how I liked my situation, and if I could get anything away—I said I would see—he did not say what he would do with it—an evening or two afterwards I went to his cousin's, for some physic, at No. 13, Gloucester-street—the prisoner was there, he asked me if I could get anything away, as he was in want of money—I said I would, and accord<lb/>ingly I took fifty yards of tarbaret to his lodging at 3, Bateman-row, Curtain-road—it was in a brown paper parcel—I delivered the parcel to Mrs. Inwards, the prisoner's landlady—I took afterwards two pieces of silk and worsted damask, tied up in canvass; I gave them to Mrs. Inwards—I got some money from the prisoner on account of the goods, and previous to that I had received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him—he knew the goods came from Regent-street—I told him I had brought down to his place two pieces of silk and worsted damask—this piece of crimson silk damask I took about the beginning of October—I took it to the prisoner's cousin at 13, Gloucester-street—I saw both the prisoner and his cousin there—the prisoner untied it, looked at it, and said it was very good—he asked his cousin to let it remain there till the morning, when he would take it away in the van; and with his cousin's permission, the prisoner put it under the bed till the morning—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his cousin asked me if I could get some carpet to cover his room—I told him I would see, as he had given me some physic, and let the silk remain—I took eleven yards of carpet and a hearth-rug, which I sent by the parcels delivery; but I had put Gilbert-street on it instead of Gloucester-street, and I went, and they had not received it—I went to the parcels delivery, and altered the direction, and it was sent—when I called there the prisoner was there—his cousin said it was too good; and the prisoner said, "Let it remain till the morning, and I will take it away in the van"—the prisoner rolled up the carpet, and put it under the bed—the next Sunday I saw the prisoner again, and we went to the elder Armeut's—we asked him if he had got any money for the goods—I did not hear what Arment said—I afterwards took some other carpet to the prisoner's cousin's, as the Brussels carpet would not do, and at the time I was there the prisoner came—he said the Brussels carpet was sold for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for him, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his cousin—I asked if he had any money for the crimson silk—he said no, but he would have shortly—I saw him afterwards at a public-house, and he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I afterwards let him have this buff and the yellow silk—I put them in the back of the van; he came and took them.</p>

On Saturday night, 28th April, shortly after twelve o'clock, Sarah Rivers was brought to me—she was insensible, and in a fainting condition—her dress was saturated with blood, and she was bleed<lb/>ing from several wounds—there was one very large wound, about five inches long and more than two inches deep on the upper part of the shoulder, the bone was exposed—whatever she had been struck with must have struck against the bone—there were ten or a dozen wounds round the same arm, and in the ribs and side of the body—they were not very severe wounds—such a knife as this produced would have caused such wounds, I should attri<lb/>bute the bending to its striking against the bone—it was not a wound that would affect life—there was also a slight wound, or rather scratch, across the right breast.</p>

I was called in about a quarter past nine o'clock, on the evening of the 14th April, and found two women and, I think, the prisoner lifting the deceased from the floor—she was perfectly insensible, and died within a quarter of an hour—there was no evidence of blows externally, but there was evidence of blood having flowed from the private parts—it was not then flowing, but the body was saturated—on Monday, the 16th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, on the Coroner's warrant—it then appeared that the blood had come from the uterine organs—I found there was a contused wound on each side—it might have been caused by a kick, or striking by some blunt instrument—I think it must have been done by a single blow; and it was that blow which had created the bleeding—I think that death was caused by pulmonary congestion, which a blow over the organs of the heart, about the lower part of the chest, would be likely to occasion—the heart itself was dis<lb/>eased, but not to a large extent—I think that the woman being subject to spasms, and being senseless when they were on, as it was stated before the Coroner, is a symptom of the diseased condition of the heart, nothing more—that does not at all alter my opinion as to the effect of the blows—when I first went into the room the prisoner said, "I will not deceive you, Sir: we have had some words, and I have struck my wife"—he said he had struck her a blow on the side.</p>

                  </hi> I am sexton for the time being of St. Matthias District Church, Bethnal-green. It has a district belonging to it—it is a new Church, and has been formed into a district under the Ecclesiastical Commissioners—the Rev. Joseph Brown is the minister—it is my duty to attend at the Church, to clean it, and see that the things are in proper order—I went in on Friday evening 20th of April, at five o'clock, and left at a quarter-past seven; I then left it safe, and in its usual state—I was called up by the police about half-past two, went to the Church with them, applied the key to the door, and it opened in the usual way; we went into the Church and found that an entrance had been effected by a window which had been forced open, and it appeared as if persons had been in the Church—we found that an upright gas burner near the window, which bad been forced open, had been removed, and we found another upright one, which had been fixed with screws to the pews, had also been removed—I also found that two money-boxes, which were fixed with screws, had been broken open; one was partly demolished, and lying on the floor—we afterwards found that another gas burner, which had been suspended from the gallery, had been removed and taken away, and four glass globes had been removed from their places; two remained in the Church, and the other two were broken—I have since seen the pipes and one of the gas pillars.</p>

I remember the night of 23d April—I did not observe anything unpleasant about him before that—he had made threats to me about three nights before, he said he could soon strangle me by pinching my throat—we were on friendly terms that night, and went to bed together—we had no quarrel during the night—I got up next morning at seven, and when I had half my clothes on, and he too, he put his left arm round my neck, pulled me down on one knee, and held a shoemaker's knife in his right hand, and stabbed my throat—I</p>

               <p>did not see the knife in his hand at the time; it was covered with a cloth—I received a cut about eight inches long on my throat, and as I was saving my throat I got two of my fingers cut against the knife, it was done after the stab and before the cut—I hallooed "Murder!" and endeavoured to get to the door as fast as I could—I heard him say, "I have done for you now," that was after the stab and cut, and before I went out of the room—my niece bound up the wounds for me until the surgeon came—I had locked the door myself when we went to bed—I got it open by turning the key after I was cut.</p>

On 24th April, I was fetched to 4, New Church-street, and found Mrs. Webb sitting on a chair in the back-room ground-floor surrounded by several people, with a covering over her neck, saturated with blood—I found a wound on the right side of the throat, extending from the collar-bone obliquely downwards, about four inches long—if it had not been arrested by the collar-bone it would have been very deep; if it had been a little higher up it would have divided the carotid artery and been fatal—it was a dangerous wound from the subsequent bleeding, and might have been done with such a knife as this—I have no knowledge of the prisoner except what I saw at the police-court—my con<lb/>viction is that he is insane; I merely judge from his appearance and manner, which is that of an insane man, from his peculiar irritable way and his rest<lb/>lessness; he is incapable of standing still—I do not say such symptoms may not be assumed.</p>

D., April 25, two pieces of linen, 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" that memorandum would not pass between me and him; they were given out to him for the express purpose of cutting out—this book was entirely under his care; it is the book in which he enters the work he gives to the people; it was not between me and him; it is all in his writing; it was kept in his own cutting-room, on my premises—here is the entry of the delivery of the goods to him—I have not looked to see whether he has charged himself the right price for these articles—he has entered them to himself on 25th April, and they were not delivered to him till the 26th—he had no opportunity of entering these after I charged him—if my servants ask me I should let them have goods at cost price—if these had been regularly booked they would have passed through my warehouse—this is the book in which they are entered to him—on previous occasions what has been entered on one side to him, he has accounted for on the other—he has not entered anything on the other side here, but in another book he makes an entry of these two pieces to himself—in the book in which he should have discharged himself he has not—on Thursday, the 26th, these goods were delivered to him, and on the Tuesday following I gave him into custody—he had several days to have entered them—this is the cutting-up book—here is "April 26, eighty yards of Irish. E. B."—the entry is Prior's—the prisoner has signed it that he has received it from him for the purpose of cutting up—he had no time for cutting it out; it was only given him in the morning, and at two o'clock the girl fetched it away—his wages were 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the woman with whom he lived earned a good deal from my premises—she manufactured stocks—she had work out in a different name—fifty yards of linen would require 500 yards of calico to make up into shirts—I thought it was a large quantity, and requested to look—we have had entries since he was in custody—if he had not accounted we should have detected it when we came to see whether these two books tallied—if my suspicion had not been excited he might have returned these and made them up—he was not allowed to pay the workpeople; he gave them checks, and sent them down for pay—he had told me on the Monday previous to the 26th that he could neither get the hands nor the calico at the price, which excited my suspicion when he wanted the goods—it was his own act to get this linen; he must have asked for it—he came to me and told me he wanted some linens at that price.</p>

On 4th May I counted the number of pieces of seating at eight o'clock in the morning; there were eighteen—the prisoner came there a little before nine—none of the seating had been re<lb/>moved—he agreed to buy some feathers—I had to go up stairs to pack the feathers up—I left the prisoner on the ground-floor where the horsehair seat<lb/>ing was—he said he was going across for change for a sovereign—I did not see him go—I was up about five minutes—I packed the feathers, brought them down, and delivered them into his cart—he paid me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—his boy was in the cart, which stood just on the edge of the pavement, op<lb/>posite the door—immediately after that, I counted the horsehair seating again; and there were only seventeen—the piece that was missing weighed about 30lbs.—there were 39 1/2 yards—no one has been on the premises but me and him—about a week before that the prisoner said to me, "You do a large trade in seatings"—I said, "We do"—he said, "You sent out a large lot yesterday"—I said, "Yes, and we have got a fresh lot in"—the one that was missing was one of the fresh lot—I left the door open—my back was scarcely turned a minute—I had no conversation at the cart.</p>

On Friday, 4th May, from information, I went to the Castle public-house, Fore-street, with Mr. Jones—we placed ourselves in a position to watch Mr. Jones's warehouse door from about eight in the morning—I saw a horse and cart drive up about a quarter before nine o'clock—the prisoner and a little boy were with it—the prisoner got out and rang a bell—he was answered from inside—he went in—(from eight till a quarter to nine, no one else had gone to the warehouse door)—he had a great coat on, and a loose bag in his hand—in three or four minutes afterwards I saw him come out alone, and the great coat was wrapped round a parcel, which appeared to be heavy, which he was carrying with both hands—he lifted it into the cart, and went back into the warehouse again—I saw the back of the little boy in the cart—after the prisoner returned into the warehouse, he came out again, alone, in about two minutes—he crossed the road to where I was concealed—he had one of his fingers in his waistcoat pocket—he returned to the warehouse, waited there about two minutes more, and then came out with the porter, who had a bag on his head, which, to the best of my belief, was the bag the prisoner had carried in—there were some deals in the cart, and a large flock bed—after the prisoner put something in, it seemed to drop down into the cart—I could not see that; he threw in great-coat and all—I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and followed the cart along various streets for two hours, or two hours and a half—it got to Whitechapel Church—during this time he removed some deals from the cart, and left them at Mr. Wild's, in the Curtain-road, and a small parcel in a handkerchief—at Whitechapel Church he took up another man, and drove down Back-church-lane, to Rose<lb/>mary-lane—I saw him whipping his horse—he had looked back previous to that—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was about forty yards from him—we lost sight of him in Rose<lb/>mary-lane for about two minutes, as it was blocked up—when we got to the Minories we saw the cart, with the boy in it, standing opposite Mr. Catch<lb/>pole's—the prisoner and his friend were gone—we stood and watched the cart about half an hour—the prisoner did not return—the boy drove the cart to Little Moorfields—the prisoner came to it there—I went up to him, told him I was a police-officer, and he must consider himself in custody for stealing a roll of horse-hair seating that morning from Jones and Son's—he said he knew nothing about any horse-hair—I asked where he went when he left his cart—he said with a friend of his to have a glass of stout—I took him to the station—I found on him two sovereigns and five pence—I found the feathers in the cart, and this little book with memorandums in it—I did not take the boy, he was too young; I rode to Chelsea with him and searched his father's house.</p>

                  </hi> I am the prosecutor's wife, and am servant to Ant-weiler. On 23d April my husband was locked out—I called to him out of the window to come in—Antweiler had locked the door, and had the key in his pocket—my husband went into No. 49, and came into the house—I was then in the dining-room—Fieg, Koenig, and Antweiler were in the room—Keyser and Van Der Deyl had been in the room a little time previous, bat they had gone out—when my husband came in, Antweiler and Fieg came up to him and attacked him—the table had been laid for six persons—Antweiler took a black-handled knife from the table, which be thrust at my husband's bead; they threw him on the ground—Fieg trod on his chest, and tore the hair out of his head—Antweiler just cut my husband, and the blood came out—I tore the knife out of his hands, and threw it on the table—I then got confused—I saw Antweiler take something out of his pocket, but I do not know what it was—I saw my husband on the ground—Koenig, and the prisoners threw him down; while he was down, Koenig did not do anything to him, but Fieg trod on his chest, lifted up his heel, and stamped upon him.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. Tonnes was brought there between two and three o'clock on 23d April—he was in a state of collapse; he had four wounds on the head, two punctured wounds, one incised, and the other partly lacerated—the punctured and incised wounds might have been given by such an instrument as this white-handled knife, or dagger, but not the lacerated wounds—the punctured wounds could not have been given by a table-knife; they were too small; about a quarter of an inch long—the incised wound was about an inch long; the lacerated wound might be given by a fall, or from something sharp—it might have been done by the point of a table-knife, or by a kick—the wounds were dangerous; he remained in the hospital nine days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been long a medical gentleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been in practice about nine years; I have been four years in the hospital, and have been house-surgeon and dressing pupil about two years and a half—the wounds on the top of the head were about a quarter of an inch deep—it is more than one-eighth of an inch to the bone—I will under<lb/>take to say it was a quarter of an inch on the top of the head—the bone is</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 209). On Saturday evening, 7th April, I was on duty in Church-court, Richmond, and coming into the street towards Messrs. Bryant and Fields, I saw the prisoner standing near the pillar under the front of the shop—there was a good deal of property outside the shop for sale, and among other articles a piece of huckaback—I saw the prisoner stoop down and take up the huckaback and endeavour to conceal it under her shawl—she entirely lifted it from the place it rested upon, and got it into her own possession—she covered it partly with her shawl, and turned round hastily into a public thoroughfare; when she had got several yards she looked round, and saw me—she immediately turned back again; and said, "Oh, I was going inside to ask the price of it"—her back was turned to the shop, and she was going away from it—she had got between six and seven yards from the place—I stopped her, and called Mr. Field; he came to the door, I related the circumstance to him—he seemed inclined to think, in consequence of her respectability, that she did take it up for that purpose—she resisted violently, and I called him to assist me—she broke away from me once, but I caught her by the dress again—she refused to give her name or address—I made inquiry, went to her lodging, and found a great quantity of property there, and also at another lodging—I found a quantity of ribbon, in her box, at Mrs. Peters', which I produce.</p>

On 3d April I was in the employ<lb/>ment of Mr. Hussey, of Red Lion-street, St. Saviour's—the prisoners and another brother, Matthew, were in his employment also, and were discharged at eleven o'clock that day—George is only nine years old—they came to the workshop that afternoon, between two and three—William and Matthew were the worse for liquor—William came up to me, and said, "You think you have got my job"—I was at work on a small ring—that was not his job at all—I told him I had not, and if he thought so, to go to Mr. Hussey and see whether I had or not—on that he asked me to fight—I told him I did not get my living by fighting—he then caught hold of a hammer, and said he would sink it into my head—I put up the Ting and the tongs, which I had in my hand, to ward off the blow—he took the hammer and knocked the ring and tongs out of my hand, and immediately on that Matthew seized hold of me—we got into a scuffle, and fell on the forge together—George seized hold of this piece of iron, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) which we use as a candlestick, and William called out to him to strike the b—over the head, and he struck me over the head, and caused a wound—I fell to the ground, was stupified, and Matthew</p>

               <p>kicked me all over the body—Allen came to my assistance, and took Matthew off me—I was taken to the hospital, had my wounds dressed, went home, and was confined to my bed-more than a fortnight—I suffered particularly from the blow on my head—it was a scalp wound—the skin was broken, and is so now.</p>

                  </hi> I am in Mr. Hussey's service—I was in the shop on 3d April, and saw the prisoners and Matthew Hall come in—William seized Han non by the waistcoat, and took up this hammer and threatened to drive it through the front of his skull, and Matthew said, "Hit him, you b—, hit him"—they went scuffling round to the forge, pushed Hannon on the top of it with his face downwards on the top of the fire—I then went and assisted him, and pulled them back off the forge—the two others were standing at the side—Harmon's head was covered with blood—I did not see how that was occasioned.</p>

                  </hi> I am publishing clerk at the <hi rend="italic">Watchman</hi> office. The prisoner occasionally brought advertisements to that paper, and we allowed him 20 per cent, upon them—we gave him that before we received the money—he was not authorized to receive money—I have told him several times that he was never to get any money—he has never paid over these sums.</p>

O. U.'s of his at a time—I did not always pay him beforehand—sometimes he brought advertisements at the beginning of the week, and Thursday was the pay-day—he never mentioned these matters to me—Mr. Gawtress, the editor, is not here, but he told the prisoner in my presence that he was not to collect any money.</p>
