The Prisoner lodged in the next room to me in Mr. Walker's house, about four nights; when she was going away from her lodging, she asked me leave to go into my room for a handkerchief, and then she robbed me of these things and money. I found her in London with my stockings and shift on; I pressed her to confess, but she would not own any thing, but before the Justice she owned the taking of the goods and money.</p>

Yes, he said; said, I, Did you ever see this leathern purse? Yes, he said, and he believed there were about 17 guineas in it.

               <p>Wright. Yes. When I asked him about the Rings, he said he had none, till he saw the Prisoner, and she said she had given him a three pound twelve shilling piece to take twenty six shillings and four pence out of, which was owing for things the Prisoner had in pawn. She said he weighed the piece against another piece, and said it was a thirty six shilling piece, and that he said it was very pretty money, and said, have you got any more of them; and she said she had another.

             . I have known the Prisoner about 3 years, and she was then a very honest person. On saturday the 17th of August last she came to me, and said she was come from her place, and was going to Nottingham in the waggon; and staid with me till Monday. I was obliged to go out on Monday, and when I came home she was gone, and I missed all those things. I went to the Ram Inn in Smithfield, and could hear nothing of her. I followed the Nottingham waggon to Highgate, thinking she might be in it, but she was not. And as I came back by Sir John Oldcastle's, I found her there hearkening to the musick, with my gown, and several of my thing on. I asked her if she would go with me, and she said she would. I asked after my things, and she said some she had pawned, and some were sold, and some she had on her back.</p>

Between three and four, says I, Mary, you are a fine servant to stay here all this afternoon (for she said she was a servant, and lived next door to Dr. Bamber .) She said she waited for the Bow coach. Some time after that I told her so again, and then she said all the family were in the country. I drank the last of our beer, and handed the tankard to Mary, the maid of the house; this was about 8 o'clock, and at that time the Prisoner said to Mary, the maid draw me a tankard of beer, and the maid of the house went to draw it in a pewter tankard, the Prisoner made reply, Why do you draw it in a pewter tankard? I and my fellow servants can drink out of a silver tankard as well as those men: the maid of the house said, a pewter tankard was as good as a silver one; the Prisoner said, she would have a silver tankard, and I saw the maid bring the silver tankard up full, and set it down upon a little table in the room, and the Prisoner took the tankard off the table, and said, she would go into the little room by the bar; and the maid of the house followed her the room, and came back to us. I said, Mary, there is a tankard of beer that she has had, which shall have to pay for, if you do not take care of it ; she went into the room the Prisoner went into , and said, Lord, Mr. Fell, there is no body there , and the candle is blown out; said I, what is the tankard? she said, I cannot tell; said I the candle and see; she took the candle and looked , and the tankard was gone, and no body there : presently Mrs. Cross came down, and she said to me, for God's sake go and look after the tankard; said I, what can I do? I cannot do any thing in it, but she desired I would. I knew the Prisoner used to go sometimes to a place where she had an acquaintance, and I intended to go there; but I thought as I went along, I would call at two or three pawnbrokers to try if I could hear any thing of it: I happened to go into a pawnbroker's in Houndsditch, and said, there was a silver tankard lost from the Angel in Whitechapel, and asked if they had seen such a tankard, marked R.C.S. the man seemed in a surprise; said I, you need not be in a surprise, for I have got the Prisoner, though I had not, but I said so, because I saw him in a surprise: said I, let me see the tankard, there's nothing at all in that; so he took the tankard out of a drawer from under the counter, and shewed it me: I said it was Mr. Cross's tankard: he said, the person that brought it to him was an honest girl, for he had known her a great while, and told me that I must look after the Prisoner: I said, as I had seen the tankard, I would not trouble myself about it, for they should find out the Prisoner; and in about an hour they found the Prisoner and brought her to the pawnbroker's shop.</p>

            . Jeffs and Martin came to me, and we agreed to go out to get what we could come at, we tried at several houses, and could not do any thing; then we came to a house in Dove Court, by Leather Lane. The Prisoner had a hanger under his coat, and he bid Jeffs not be afraid, and swore the first man that came to oppose them he would cut his head off: there was a latch to the door, and Jeffs turned the latch, opened the door, and went into the house about ten o'Clock at night, and brought something out in his apron, and began to run; Martin said, what do you run for? or something to that effect. He brought out a pair of sheets, and a pair of ribbed stockings.</p>

               <p>Bye . He might be half the length of the Court off.

             lived over my head. On Monday night the 28th of July, they came home about eleven o'Clock at night; I did not see them bring any thing in then, but they went out again, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, and she came in with a bundle, and he had a kettle and something in it that rattled. They left these things in his apartment, and went out again, and the third time they came in with some sheets and other things, and then the clock struck twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bring a candle in with them then?</p>
               <p>Crockett. No, she left a candle in the window the second time they were there. About five o'Clock they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they carry these things with them?</p>
               <p>Crockett. No, but they were carried out of the house. I got up about seven o'Clock, and saw that the window shutters had been cut open, so that I could put my hand in between the two window shutters, (I made a complaint to the neighbours of it; for Watland always desired us or some of the neighbours to give an eye to his windows whenever we went by, when he was out of town) one pane of glass was broke, and the window shutter bedaubed with mud. The neighbours would have had me have taken out a warrant, but I did not care to do it till the Prosecutor came home. Jones went to Rag Fair to buy a bit of Salmon, and somebody who knew that I was going after him, bid him not come up the Lane; so when he saw me, he threw the Salmon away, and put the dish under his arm, and run away. I found under the head of the Prisoner's bed a large spike nail, a chissel, and this bunch of keys, [some of them were pick lock keys] I sent to Watland, but could not find out where he was. In about three weeks his wife came to town, and Jones confessed at Mr. Unwin's house that he broke Watland's house open about 12 o'Clock at night, but that he never should have done it if he had not been in liquor, and he owned the taking all these things.</p>

I had intelligence that Jones used to make it his constant practice to go to St. Paul's to pick pockets; so I went into the middle isle of the church, and saw the Prisoner pass by me: I did not rightly know him, but he saw the Prosecutor, and so turned back again into the Isle; I took hold of him and pulled him back, said I, is your name

            . I am a Constable upon the Keys, about 11 or 12 at noon, I saw the Prisoner lurking about a hogshead of tobacco, at Butolph's wharf ; I watched him, and saw him take some tobacco out of the hogshead: I followed him, and took him; he said it was a very small matter, and hoped I would forgive him; I said I would not, if it was never so little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hartley. He is a foreigner that works upon the Keys; he is not a ticket porter. He has been a porter about a year.</p>

I desired to look into his trunk, he refused it at first, but I told him if he would not open it, I would have it opened; then he, with reluctancy, opened it, and this piece of Scotch cloth was in it; he asked pardon, and said it was mine.

               <p>Prisoner. This piece of cloth lay some time in the cellar, and as I was brushing my clothes I was called up, and when I went down again I found this piece of cloth in my trunk, it might fall down into it by accident.

I got into the same track, and rode after him, and did design to ride over him, but he turned out of the way, (I suppose he was surprised to hear somebody so near him) and my horse rode before him: I could not immediately stop my horse; so soon as I would I turned my horse, and rode after him again, and he turned his horse against Mr. Stevenson's. I caught hold of his right hand, and we both came down together. Upon this Mr. Stevenson and I secured him; he asked what we wanted with him; I said there was a hue and cry after him, and if he had done any thing amiss he must answer for it, and he should. He struggled a little, and desired us to let him go; I told him I could not; he said, then I am a dead man. I said, how do you know that? He said it was the first robbery that ever he committed. I said it was too soon now, so Mr. Stevenson and I led him, he went between us, I laid hold of his left arm, and Mr. Stevenson of his right. In leading him along the road, he begged for mercy, and said he had robbed two women of a small trifle; I think he said of about 18 d. or 2 s. and some half-pence, and two gold rings, and desired us to let him go. We carried him up to them, and Mrs. Taylor said, I thank you, Sir, that is the man that robbed us. We went to the White-hart, and had a pot of beer, and desired the women to let me know where I might call upon them. The Prisoner had a pistol in his pocket loaded with shot. I think he had about three shillings in silver and some brass. I asked where the rings were, he said he had put them into his pocket. I desired him to sit down, and told him if he would not sit down, I would tie him. So I searched his breeches for the rings, but could not find them. He said there were holes in his pockets, and they might get into the lining, so I unbuttoned the knees of his breeches and they dropped out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gilbert. (the Headborough) Blunt was 3 times at my house to bring me the warrant, but I was not at home. Mr. Mansell sent me a letter, and said he heard there was a warrant out against him from Mr. Blunt, and he said he would come to me, and he did come to me, and desired I would execute the warrant. Mr. Mansell is a man of a very good character, and I was sorry he should fall into such hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character in the neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. His character from all the gentlemen that ever I was in company with is that of an honest young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would steal old razors and old books ?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. I believe he is as innocent of it as I am myself .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Blunt ?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. I have lived two years over against him , and his character is such, that if he could take any advantage he would, and I believe he would serve me the same. if he had an opportunity .</p>
               <p>Mr. Cope . I never knew a man of a better character in my life than Mr. Mansell , and that was the reason of my being his bail . Blunt said it might have been made up, if it had not been Mr. Mansell's fault.</p>

               <p>Field. It is in Shoreditch .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the Prisoner took them?</p>
               <p>Field. Because there was no body there but her husband and herself. She called her husband to kiss her, and then she stopped the money into his hand. She said, my dear , buss me; and he said he did not want any of her bussing</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the buckles in your pocket when you went into the room?</p>
               <p>Field . I am sure I had them in my pocket when I gave her the half pence to buy the liquor. I cannot say but I fell asleep, for I was a little vexed in my mind .</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think the buckles were taken from you when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Field. I don't know but they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Field. I knew her by seeing her in the street, but I never was in her room before .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for then?</p>
               <p>Field. Because she pulled me down the alley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met her in Shoreditch with a bloody apron and handkerchief. She had been fighting, and I advised her to go home, but she went with me to my lodging. We had two or three drams, and I fell down to sleep, but whether she had the buckles with her, or whether she was awake or asleep I can't tell .</p>
               <p>Q. What is her master?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He keeps a lodging house for all sorts of people. <rs id="t17450911-17-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

Mr. Blayer said, Mr. Carne here is but very little paper left, here are but thirteen bundles; I said to the Prisoner, you had better confess the fact; and he said, he had sold between four and five hundred weight to one; I have three hundred, three quarters, eleven pound and a half , which he had sold to Mr. Ninn . When the Prisoner worked for me, he always behaved very well. I paid him a guinea a week, and when he worked piece work, I have paid him 25 or 30 l. a week.

The next morning I went to the Justice's clerk to get a warrant for her, but I could not find her, she kept out of the way and I have not seen her since till about three weeks ago, when I was watching some goods for the landlord, I saw her go by, and took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner at the house that you was in?</p>
               <p>Grayley. Yes, I found out who she was, and I went to her mother's, and her mother told me she had not been at home all night, and said, she was a sad creature.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When did you miss your watch?</p>
               <p>Grayley. I missed it immediately, and took hold of your gown directly .</p>
               <p>Q. How can you be sure she is the person?</p>
               <p>Grayley. I saw her face very plain in Buttermilk Alley.</p>

               <p>Sparks. Only in publick company, in the publick room. The Prosecutor went out first, and in eight or ten minutes, as near as I can guess, the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110013"/> soner went out after him: I wondered that he was gone, so went to look for him in the yard, but he was not there: as I was going to shut up the windows, he came and gave me a blow cross the back with his cane; said I, what is that for, Mr. Grayley! and then I heard a noise about the watch, and that he had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he declare when he came back that he had lost his watch?</p>
               <p>Sparks. When he struck me cross the back he did not say any thing about the watch, but pushed into the house directly, and then the company were all gone except his wife and another.</p>
               <p>Grayley . Did not I ask you what the woman's name was?</p>

I am one of the Headborough's of the parish of Christ Church, where this fact was committed; and very often we are disturbed by people in that passage, and I do say it is impossible to swear to the face of a person in that place, for there is never a lamp in it. I would do the fair thing by every body, and that is the reason of my speaking in this affair.</p>
               <p>Sparks. It is a dark ugly place, and it is difficult to distinguish a person's face there; and if there is a lamp in the day, it is knocked down in the night. <rs id="t17450911-20-verdict101" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am a watchman of St. Martin's in the Fields; on Saturday was seven-night, there happened a little quarrel against my stand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110014"/> at last there was watch called; I went, there was the Prisoner and this gentlewoman [Thompson] he had hold of her hand I think, and she had hold of him, and I think she had his wig in her hand: she was for charging him, for assaulting her, and putting his hand against her belly: and he charged me with her for taking his ht. I strove to get him into the watch-house, but he was very resolute, and they did not to go into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What he or she ?</p>
               <p>Prior. He was very willing to go, but she was not; and madam Thompson delivered the Prisoner's hat into my hand, but the wig was thrown into the street, and they wanted to make their escapes.</p>
               <p>Q. What the women?</p>
               <p>Prior. Yes , the women. The young lad finding they were gone, run after them again, and overtook them, and laid hold of them again, and called for my assistance to lay hold of them again, and I carried them back to the watch *. They never talked of losing these things at first, but when they were retaken, then they talked of this robbery and losing these things; then we carried them to the Round-house.</p>
               <p> * It is very strange that the constable nor any other of the Watchmen would appear; and it is to be hoped the character of this Watchman will be enquired into by the Gentlemen of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered you to carry them to the Round house?</p>
               <p>Prior. They had liberty to go home to their beds, and the boy was confined.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to be set at liberty, and the boy confined?</p>
               <p>Prior. Because they brought friends.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the boy to be committed?</p>
               <p>Prior. Why they swore very hard and very positive, and the boy had nothing to say for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q What Business are you?</p>
               <p>Bolley. I am a <rs id="t17450911-22-viclabel111" type="occupation">Jeweller</rs>

After that they stopped my mouth with a handkerchief, and picked my pocket, and swore if I offered to cry out they would murder me (they are all, my Lord, supposed to be of the Black Boy alley crow, for they have been dispersed since the alley has been take up.) Then they dragged me into a house in Moses an Aaron alley, and there they stripped me of the rest of my money, which was about 8 s. my jewels, and the things which I had about me. I have got one pair of ear rings by the means of a person who gave me instructions where to find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them here?</p>
               <p>Bolley. No, the pawnbroker has them in her custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say the Prisoner has any of your jewels ?</p>
               <p>Bolley . No, but she was in company with the other women , both in the street and in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Ask him whether he ever saw my face before ?</p>
               <p>Q. Pray recollect how you came to know her face again ?</p>
               <p>Bolley . I was exactly against a lamp, and this particular person [the Prisoner] and 2 more, I could swear to. I am positive by the sight I had of her by the lamp, that she is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since she was taken up?</p>
               <p>Bolley. It is a good while since, but she was taken in the same alley by one of the thieftakers, who I employed to do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were three poor creatures before, besides myself, who were taken up upon this account, one of them can give you an account that she heard the Prosecutor say, he knew where they were in pawn.</p>

               <p>Thornton. I went into a house called the Hayfield , in the back lane by Rag Fair, and called for a pint of beer and a pipe, and smoaked my pipe of tobacco. This

After that she sat down opposite against me in a little box; then Jane Johnson came in and sat by her, and they persuaded me to have a quartern of - I can't think of the name, rosa solis, no; it is not rosa solis, it is some Irish name I think; - usqucbaugh, ay, that is the name of it. Afterwards they persuaded me to go to a little room where this Winifred Ward lay. We all three went and sat down upon the bed side together, and then we had another quartern of the same liquor .

               <p>Q. How long after she was gone, was it before you missed it?</p>
               <p>Thornton. It was immediately after. So I run after her, but I could not find her.</p>

But they came to the pump to drink, which is in our ward, and then Warner and I took them and carried them to the watch-house.

               <p>Smith. I cannot say that: I lost twenty one hats out of my shop; I missed them about a quarter of an hour after I got up. I went to some pawnbrokers to desire them to stop them if any were brought to them, and in about half an hour's time a messenger came from Mr. Edwards a pawnbroker, to let me know he had stopped a hat, and desired to know if it was mine. I went to Mr. Edwards's, and there was the Prisoner James; I said to him, young man, did you bring this hat to the pawnbroker's? he said, yes; I asked him, how he came by it? he said, he made a purchase of it; I asked him, where? he said, in Smithfield; I asked him, who he bought it of? he said, of a drover; that he held it upon a stick, and asked, who would buy a hat? and he bought it; I asked him if he wanted a hat this morning? he said, yes; then said I, how came you to pawn it? I told him, I did not like that way of proceeding, and that I would charge him, if he did not give a better account how he came by it. I went with him into Mr. Edwards's room, and he said, he would tell me the truth; he said he went to sleep in a hay loft, and a man came and pulled him by the arm, and desired he would pawn it for two shillings.</p>

He came home about 4 or 5 o'clock, and says to her, Bet, this is the best half guinea I ever laid out in my life, for I have been to ask counsel (for she had bound him over for assaulting her) and I am not afraid that you can hurt me or my bail; for he was bailed out of the Gatehouse , and that bred a sort of a quarrel between them, and he took all the wet linen that was in the washing tub, and bundled them up in a bundle, and would not let her have them; so they quarrelled for a considerable time. There were three women of our trade came to the Prisoner's house in the evening, and the Prisoner and his wife were pretty sociable, and he sent for me to drink with them. About 11 o' clock after the company was gone, I was in the stoke hole, and they were standing looking at me; As they were standing looking at me, he said, Bet, let me have a buss, and make all up, for said he, it is a sad thing we should be always quarrelling and differing; and, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110023"/> he said, he went to buss her, and she put his hand away from her, but he took a buss from her partly by force, and he had a buss. She said, Tommy, I can hardly buss you, for I cannot love you. He stood in a pause: well, Bet, said he, if it is so that you can never value me nor respect me, it is the best way for us to separate: there is a 30 l. bond you carried to your father, I have received 15 l. and there is 15 l. coming to me, only let me have that 15 l. and I will resign the trade up to you, and go and travel the country as a journeyman, and take my chance; and I will give you a bond never to trouble you, and you shall give me a bond never to trouble me. Then said she, I will agree to it, and I will take the business into my own hand. Then said he, I will tie you up from one thing, that you shall not employ

Then he fell a dancing and capering, and said, then it is all off if you will employ him, and fell a singing directly. After that they had some punch, he went out and ordered it. They said there was 18 d. worth, and he drank to me in the stoke hole, and they had no words after that. Said he, Morgan, I have got some pipes that were burnt slack before, and I would have these burnt harder; and he brought me 4 pieces of a coach wheel to burn them harder. Then he came and said, come up and drink your punch, and he stoked down for me, for he said, you are quite hot. I said, I am quite wearied out, I will go to bed. He said, I will stay a little longer, for I love my fire to be out before I go to bed; but I being quite tired went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you hear when it was that the woman was murdered?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No, I lay in the garret, I went and left him singing; for I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Morgan. About twelve o'clock, and lay till between eight and nine the next morning. When I got up I came down stairs, and he complained for want of pipes to serve his customers. I went to open this kiln of pipes to let them cool, and in the mean time the woman at the Cock and Bottle came over and said our bing is full of foul pipes and will not hold any more. I said I will go and take them away; and there being some company, I staid about an hour, and I said it is a strange thing they should not get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your master in the morning?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No, I never saw him after I left off burning.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your master told you he wanted pipes for his customers, when was that, over night, or in the morning?</p>
               <p>Morgan. It was over night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out in the morning?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I believe it was about nine o'clock, and I staid there till between two and three o' clock expecting their coming down. Then I bored a hole in the wall of their chamber and looked through, and saw no sheet upon the bed. I bored another hole, which directed me to the middle of the room, and then I saw a puddle of blood in the middle of the room. Seeing that, I pushed the door a little to look farther in, and I saw two naked legs lying on the floor on the farther side of the bed. I run down stairs to this gentlewoman [Mrs. Moody] and said, for God's sake come up, there is murder in the house, for Morgan has killed himself; she went up and looked upon her as she lay, and thought that he was murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body naked?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Yes; the body was naked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lay at the side of the bed, or under the bed?</p>
               <p>Morgan. At the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to think it was him that was murdered?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I judged it to be him because there was no cap on; and I thought he had made away with himself. Then several women came up stairs. What do you talk, said they, of his being murdered? it is she that is murdered. And they said to somebody, do you go down and take care of the doors, and call some of the neighbours, and when some of the substantial neighbours came, I was secured, and sent to the Gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you find the deceased in?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110024"/>Morgan. In a room up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the shop?</p>
               <p>Morgan. It is up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was a little in liquor, and you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Yes, I was a little in liquor, and that was the reason I went to bed so soon.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you see in what condition the body was?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I saw the body, but I did not see any wound upon it, for I run down stairs to call the neighbours; and I never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>[The Coroner said there was a matter of 20 wounds on the body, and 3 of them were mortal.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise or any strugling during the whole night?</p>

            . On Tuesday about 3 o' clock in the afternoon, this man [the evidence] came to me, and said, that he was frightened. I said, what have you seen? He said, he had looked through the key hole, and had seen some blood in the room. So I went to call some of the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Moody. It was about three o'clock in the afternoon on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she lay then?</p>
               <p>Moody. She lay on the floor on her right side, with her face towards the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she naked?</p>
               <p>Moody. Her shift was pulled up to her neck, and she was bare headed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any wounds upon her body that you observed?</p>
               <p>Moody. Yes, I observed several.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any account where the wounds were?</p>
               <p>Moody. I believe she had three on the side of her belly, six along her throat, and she had a great many behind her ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any other wounds?</p>
               <p>Moody. Yes; but I did not take any particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in the night?</p>
               <p>Moody. Yes; I am sure I heard her cry out murder .</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do it more than once?</p>
               <p>Moody. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Moody. The watch called two o'clock, and a quarter before that she was crying something about justice.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you hear every thing that was said or done in the house?</p>
               <p>Moody. Pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear further?</p>
               <p>Moody. I heard a sort of a groaning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you pretty conversant with them?</p>
               <p>Moody. I was very often with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they agree well, or how did they live?</p>
               <p>Moody. They were always falling out, and she crying murder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That woman knows no more of me than the farthest woman in this court. Did you ever know any neighbour that could give me an ill word about abusing my wife?</p>

            , Surgeon. On Wednesday the 21st of August about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I saw the body of the deceased lie prostrate on her back upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are a surgeon, I desire you would give an account of the wounds?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I will give you the best account I can, and I don't doubt but I shall give your Lordship and the Jury satisfaction. I viewed the body and found there had been an attempt to cut her throat, the common teguments and the skin appearing about one inch over the windpipe. There was one wound upon each hand, by which I imagined she had attempted to save herself. Those wounds were on the back of her hands to the bone, as deep as they could be, but about two inches long each. There was a wound under the left ear, and I observed by her defending her throat so well, that the wound by the ear must be given underhanded by a sort of a job, and by my probe I found it to be four inches and an half in depth; and I judged that wound to be given obliquely, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110025"/> to have divided the jugular artery, and must have been the cause of her death; for it is a very large vessel (her shift was as bloody, as if it had been dipped in blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those wounds given by?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I suppose by some sharp instrument; upon examining the body I found three punctured wounds, one on the left breast, which must have reached the heart, and a portion of the lungs about two inches deep and half an inch broad; I believe it penetrated into the heart, and touched a portion of the lungs; as near as I could judge by my probe it was about two inches deep: there was another wound much in the same angle below that, of the same breadth; which, upon examining with my probe, I judged to be of the same depth, and I believe touched the lower part of the heart, and penetrated into the heart itself: on the side of the belly I saw another wound much of the same breadth, into which I introduced my probe, which is about five inches and an half long, up to the head of it, but that lower wound I do not take to be mortal, though it was so deep, for it went superficially and sideways, but I do not think the intestines were wounded, but the other three wounds I apprehend to be mortal; I am sure they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other wounds?</p>
               <p>Ellis. There were several slighter wounds, but I did not examine them: upon observing the wound at the bottom of the breast, I proposed opening the body several times to the Jury, but they thought it needless, they were so well satisfied. There was a stream of blood that run from the body, which was coagulated: a stream, as if a person had been killing an ox, and must have come from the heart, and was the occasion of her death.</p>

               <p>Adams. About the head. She persuaded me to write a letter to Mr. Walker, to let him know of the blows upon her breasts. I said , Mr. Morgan, I wonder you should abuse your wife so; he said, he was too good for he: I believe the blackness on her breasts was occasioned by a blow; I believe the blackness was as broad as my hand; after this he promised to be easy. I was tired of staying they had so many quarrels; if she could not eat (for she was not well) he was angry with her for that,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110026"/> and followed her with a hammer in his right hand, to the fore part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hammer was it?</p>
               <p>Adams. An iron hammer, I believe the head weighed two pounds; and he had a knife in his left hand, but I cannot tell what sort of a knife it was: I do not know but it might be the knife he was eating his dinner with. He said, he had a good mind to hit her with the hammer. I went away from the house, because there were such continual debates.</p>

About 9 o' clock on the Monday night, my wife and the deceased were together; I was standing in my bar, next door but one to the Prisoner's house in Bedford Bury, said I, Mrs. Morgan, how do you do? she said, but very indifferent: she told me, the Prisoner had taken all her linen out of the wash; but that, he asked her first whether she would clear his bail, and she said, I will tell you another time; that he sell a dancing and capering, and she was afraid he would kill her, I never saw her any more after that.</p>

               <p>James Lane. I am lighterman to Mr. Harris; he had a lighter of corn at his own wharf, at Pickel Herring stairs, there were four sacks filled with oats; these are Mr. Harris's sacks, there were two sacks missing, and I take these to be two of the four.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the sacks?</p>
               <p>Lane. They were filled with black oats, and there are black oats in the inside of them now. These two sacks contain eight bushels.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the search warrant?</p>
               <p>Phillips. The 30th of August.</p>
               <p>Robert Harris. These are my sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they filled with oats?</p>
               <p>Harris. They were filled with black Devonshire oats; and I believe these oats which are left in them, are part of those oats. On the 19th of August, Mr. Smith was searching for some of his sacks, and he found these sacks of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these oats worth?</p>
               <p>Harris. They were currently sold at that time for 13 s. a quarter.</p>

               <p>- Fellows. I bought a quartern of oats of the Prisoner much about this time, and gave him 10 s. for the quartern, they were old oats. I asked him whether he came by them honestly, he said, he had a great many coasters, who left corn with him to sell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You bought them of me for 10 s. it is true, and I gave 10 s. for them to the man's servant; you had them at the same price that I had them.</p>

               <p>Smith. Yes, he did; he said, he bought them of my man Bob, but I had no such servant; I asked him whether I should bring that servant, and he said, there was no occasion for it.</p>

               <p>Q. How are they made?</p>
               <p>Wood. They are made in what they call a stask.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with the stask?</p>
               <p>Wood. The stask is filled with whiting.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the whiting wet or dry?</p>
               <p>Wood. It is partly wet and partly dry. It is made into a paste, and then put into the flask. This flask opens as a book may do, and has a spout to it. Then they make a sort of an impression upon the paste with a good shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. After they have got an impression upon the paste, what do they do with the good shillings?</p>
               <p>Wood. They shake them out: they give the flask a knock, and out drop all the good shillings. Then they make a sort of a gutter to let the liquor in; and then they pour the metal into the flask, and when the metal is cold, they turn the bad shillings out.</p>
               <p>Q. What do they do then?</p>
               <p>Wood. They file them to take the metal off that hangs upon the edges, to make them smooth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen this done more than once?</p>
               <p>Wood. I cannot tell how often I have seen them do it; but I have seen them do it several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any particular day when you saw them do this?</p>
               <p>Wood. I saw him do it upon last Whitson Monday. And about a fortnight or three weeks before I saw her do it, that was the last time I saw her do it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were made on Whitson Monday?</p>
               <p>Wood. There were twenty four of them made then.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took out seven of these shillings, one of which you put off to the bar keeper, and the other Mrs. Lemmon stopped herself; were these some of the same?</p>
               <p>Wood. These were some of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do to them?</p>
               <p>Wood. She scowered them.</p>
               <p>Q. So his business was to cast them, and her business was to make them fit for sale?</p>
               <p>Wood. That was just as they agreed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they boiled in any thing?</p>
               <p>Wood. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they boiled in?</p>
               <p>Wood. They were boiled in allom water.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you used to make some of them?</p>
               <p>Wood. I never did any thing, but only assisted in putting them off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do afterwards?</p>
               <p>Wood. When I was in New-Prison I desired them to make every thing safe, and they came and told me every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with the materials?</p>
               <p>Wood. They used to put them into a close stool, or any other private place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they use to put them into a chair?</p>
               <p>Wood. Yes, this is the chair they used to put them into. [There was a two armed chair produced with a false bottom, that let down like a flap.]</p>
               <p>On Wednesday night when I saw Mr. North, I thought it better than to lie in goal, to make a confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Mr. North where the things were?</p>
               <p>Wood. I told him they were in a chair with a false bottom; and that there were some drawers with oil and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what other account did you give to Mr. North?</p>

               <p>Lemmon. I verily believe it is; I cannot swear positively to it; for I gave it several gentlemen there that looked at it, and then I gave it to the constable.

            's being taken up, Justice Poulson sent me a letter, upon which I waited on him: When I came there, I saw Mrs. Wood, who I have known a great while, on account of her putting off counterfeit money. As I have known the Prisoners at the bar several years on the same account, I have often desired them to make a discovery of their accomplices, but they never would.

Then she said that Mr. Lloyd and Mrs. Lloyd, the Prisoners at the bar, for she [Mrs. Lloyd] went many years by the name of Moody, both of them coined; and that if I went to their lodging at a barber's shop in Purpool Lane , I should certainly meet with them, and I went there accordingly.</p>

               <p>North. I went there the next day, but Mrs. Wood said she believed I should not find any thing, for she had given them a caution to put them out of the way. But she said if I found any thing it would be in a chair with a false bottom. I went there with two men, one of which was a constable: It was some time before I found out the chair with the false bottom; but at last I found that this false bottom let down with a sort of a hinge; but there was nothing to be found there. I searched the other parts of the room, and found nothing; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110033"/> in some private drawers there were several little parcels of tape, sealing wax, and divers other sorts of goods; but I did not see any thing relating to what they were charged with.

Then I went to Justice Poulson's, and Deborah fell in a passion, and said to the evidence Wood, What! have you served me so? you have got the start of me now. And Deborah asked me whether Wood had informed against her son and daughter for making of money; I said, no; then, she said, I will. She said to me, Mr. North, you have often desired me to make a discovery of the persons-concerned with me in coining, which I have always refused to do.

               <p>Blackmore. Yes, when it is not due we put it into one of the columns of the party's book who keeps cash with us; and when it becomes due it is entered into another column as cash.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with the bill then?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. We put a number to it that we may know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number of this bill?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. It is Z 199.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer in the Bank ?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner one?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with the bill after that?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. It is put into a particular drawer that is kept for these bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deposit this bill into that drawer upon the account of the Bank?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. I cannot say that, for sometimes I am not the last in the office, and the last person in the office generally does that. I put it into a drawer in order to be put into the other drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner a key to that drawer?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you all keys to it?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard any thing of this being missing?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. About a week or ten days I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110038"/>Q. Then it was not you that discovered it?</p>

            . Look upon that bill, and see whether you know it or not?</p>
               <p>Greenough. I know it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner ever produce that bill to you?</p>
               <p>Greenough. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what happened upon that occasion?</p>
               <p>Greenough. On the 30th of May the Prisoner delivered that bill into my hand. When he delivered the bill to me, I said, Mr. Scruton , this bill is not due. He said it is a customary thing among us to oblige one another to pay a bill before it is due, if we want cash. He said he received it from a friend, and that his friend was going out of town. I knew it was a customary thing, and then I looked to see if it was regularly endorsed. I found it was not endorsed by his friend, so I desired he would order his friend to endorse it; he said his friend was gone to the tavern to drink a glass of wine, and he would endorse it for him; so I said he might witness the bill for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the words he wrote upon the bill?</p>
               <p>Greenough. Witness R. Scruton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him write it?</p>
               <p>Greenough. He turned his back to me and wrote it. I cannot say I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, is that Scruton's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Greenough. This I take to be Scruton's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not there some words wrote over Mr. Sheppard's name?</p>

               <p>Greenough. Yes, the words are received the contents.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the Prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Greenough . I do believe it to be so .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Greenough. I cancelled the bill, and gave him a ticket to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was Mr. Sawbridge's bill?</p>
               <p>Greenough. No, I did not.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Scruton the Prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Collyer. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Collyer, you applied to him, and told him there was a Bank Sola bill that was missing, did not you?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I can't tell exactly, but I believe it was between the 15th and 20th of June last; I was informed by one of my brother officers that there was a suspicion of indirect practices in the Prisoner, and I found 20 l. missing in a person's account. I told him of it, and said it was his business to place it to account, or he would suffer by it; he said he had a friend who was out of town, but he would be in town in two or three days, and then he would replace it, but that person never came.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say in excuse of himself?</p>
               <p>Collyer. He said he had made a mistake in that bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say that his friend was out of town, and would be in town in two or three days, and when he came to town he would bring the money and place it to the proper account?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110039"/>Collyer. He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have gone off, could not he?</p>
               <p>Collyer. He might have gone off indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not he have gone off with two thousand pounds of the Bank's, if he would?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not he have gone off with a thousand pounds?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have gone off with five hundred?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I believe he might have gone off with five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if he had had a mind he might have wronged the Bank of more?</p>
               <p>Collyer. Yes, to be sure, in that time he might have had an opportunity of doing more mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tender the money to you?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have received the money of him before this transaction?</p>
               <p>Collyer. Yes, to be sure I should, not knowing of any fraud.</p>

               <p>Q. What security did he give?</p>
               <p>Collyer. He gave a thousand pounds security.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are an officer of the Bank, would you have compounded this fraud?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No, indeed I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take it to be a fraud?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No indeed, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think he was an honest man?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I always look upon a man to be honest, till he proves a rogue.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, whether a person may not take out a bill, and make use of it upon occasion?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No, Sir, I have not known it done these 36 years.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man of substance was to make use of a note of 20 l. should you take him to be a felon?</p>
               <p>Collyer. That I must leave to the Directors of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this thing, did you think he would have committed a felony?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I cannot tell what to say to that, for it is impossible to find a man guilty of a thing, 'till the fact is proved upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you reckon that a person who makes a mistake ought to be deemed a felon?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I cannot see how that can well be.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sawbridge. Will you tell us how you came to find out, that you had not credit given you for it by the Bank.</p>
               <p>Sawbridge. I had credit given me for it by the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collyer. How long was it before you found it out that the note was missing?</p>
               <p>Collyer. It was full a fortnight after he had received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner deny that he had the twenty pounds?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No, he said he had it, and that he would make it good.</p>
               <p>[Mr. Collyer said, the Prisoner had a good character before this.]</p>
               <p>The Council on each side having gone through the examination of the witnesses, the Council for the Prisoner insisted on a point of law, relating to the meaning and construction of the word imbezzle, and that the Prisoner did not come within the intent and meaning of the act of parliament; which being fully argued on each side, it was the opinion of the Court that the Prisoner was within the intent and meaning of the said act.</p>
