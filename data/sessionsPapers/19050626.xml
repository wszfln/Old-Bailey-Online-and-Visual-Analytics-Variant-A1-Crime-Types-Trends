This is a bad half-crown"—I had brought the coin with me—he took it out of my hand and said that it was not his, but it belonged to a young man in the crowd which was standing on the opposite side of the road—this conversation took place in the street—Wilde then went up to the crowd, taking the half-crown, and said, "Floyd, give me the change back; this is a bad half-crown"—Floyd said, "You won't have the change, because you have got the half-crown"—Wilde then gave me back the half-crown and said, "Floyd will not give the change back"—I did not know Floyd—I said to him, "You will not give me the change?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Then I will fetch a Wiseman and have you locked up," to which he said nothing—I went</p>

I had 2s. 5d. change and he had the cigarettes"—I then took him to Wilde's house, 6, Hat<lb/>field Street—on charging Wilde he said, in Floyd's presence, "Floyd was showing the half-crown and saying, "What a good made one for a bad one.' He then gave it to me to get a packet of Woodbines. I went to Wallace's and got a packet, and came back to Floyd and gave him the cigarettes and change. He gave me back the cigarettes, but kept the change"—on being searched, on Floyd was found 1s. 6d. in silver and Is. bronze, and on Wilde 1/2 d. bronze and three Woodbine cigarettes—they were taken to the station and charged; they made no reply—this is the coin I received from Wallace (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which I marked at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 20, South Moulton Street—I have known the prisoner for some years as a daughter of a client of mine, and for three or four years I have known her well—she called upon me for some information in reference to some office she wanted to go to at the Royal Courts—she said she was with a Countess, but I could never get from her the relationship; she considered herself to be an adopted daughter—the Countess's name is Galve; I think she is a Russian—the prisoner called upon me again—I do not know the date; that was in relation to some business—the Countess became a client of mine and I was consulted upon various matters—the Countess from time to time borrowed small sums of money from me which at first were repaid—she went away three times, leaving the prisoner here—the first occasion was in 1902—she made no arrangement as to the sup<lb/>port of the prisoner while she was away—on account of the prisoner having no money, I supplied her with funds, and when the Countess returned to England she repaid me the money—the same thing happened in the follow<lb/>ing year, but not to any great extent—in 1904 she again went away, leaving the prisoner unprovided for, and I made considerable advances then—I think the Countess left in August and I continued to make advances until April last—I had written to the Countess, pointing out the position the prisoner was placed in, and pressing that she should forward funds—I think she sent one £5 note to the prisoner—my friendship with the prisoner became closer, and ultimately became intimate—I gave the prisoner to understand a long time ago that the relationship should end, but I brought it more to a head in the latter part of April in a conversation—on April 22nd I wrote to her, telling her to keep away from the office, and after that day I gave instructions at the office with regard to her, and told my clerks that I could not advance any more money to her, and could not see her if she called—I had had some discussions with my wife with regard to Miss Doughty; they were hardly differences—on April 22nd I wrote: "Keep away from the office to-day for goodness'</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe the prisoner was extremely fond of me—I did not expect anybody to do me an injury, more particularly the prisoner—I do not know if a letter was found on her—<hi rend="italic">A statement by the prisoner, dated April</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th, was then read</hi>): "I have been in my heart a good woman, but Fate has always followed me up relentlessly. I have never willingly harmed a creature, and I seldom pass a beggar even if it is my last copper, and I have been so happy lately, but, as I told my husband, I was afraid of this Easter"—I do not know if she referred to me as her husband—when she wrote to me she addressed me as "Dear Mr. Swan"; when in the office she called me "Mr. Swan" or one of my Christian names—"as Fate always gave me then an unexpected disaster, and he said he would be extra nice with me when it was over"—she said Easter always seemed to be an unlucky time for her, I had not said I would be extra nice to her—I did not comfort her; I daresay I said, "Don't be so full of fancies"—"I never dreamed the blow would come from him. I knew him from <hi rend="italic">young</hi>, and always thought he was a nice, kind man; he was in 1901 and 1902. I had strange expressions and was practically friendless, and he helped me with business all he could"—I did help her in business—"When he made advances to me I reminded him he had a wife to be thought of. He took in, hand and told me it was worse than having none; he only had not had a separation for the sake of the children, but they slept in different parts of the house, and were not on speaking terms, only compulsory.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190506260008"/>
               <p>I thought what a dreadful woman she must be for such a kind man. I gave him my sympathy, and in return was glad of someone to tell my troubles to, but I insisted on keeping the friendship platonic. He was kindness and patience itself. He took me out or waited any time for me "—I have been to the theatre with her and to, lunches—"and then when I was left alone by a lady who had promised to make me rich and do everything for (but as I found afterwards she only did this to make me borrow thousands altogether for her), and then left me in the <hi rend="italic">lurch</hi> when payment became due. He then saw that I was provided for, and at last I came to lean on him for every little thing"—I do not know if she came to lean on me, and that I was practically her only support, but I did what I could—I saw her father a few weeks ago—"and also I gave into him partly out of gratitude"—I presume she yielded to me—I had connection with her—"We have been man and we 3 since. I regarded him as my husband, and I was his little wife, and he gave me his confidence, which was withheld in his house?, and in time I grew very fond of him, which has deepened and deepened. I know he loved me. He has told me it was his only happiness when we were out together. He has made tea for me every evening unless we had tea out, and nursed me afterwards in his arm-chair, and only last Tuesday, the 18th, he gave up a Masonic dinner to dine with me"—I believe we were on terms of the greatest intimacy, and that she was very much attached to me—"I told him to dine with his friends, but he said he would much rather with his little girl, and we would have an extra <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, and we were so happy that evening. He has always sworn I was his only wife in the true sense of the word. I know he loved me, or he could not have done all he has, and he always gave the strongest proofs of his love and affection. He told me always about the hell Mrs. Swan led in his house, etc. He has always seemed afraid of her, and yet after all the love he had shown me I had not a doubt he would stand by me for ever, when Mrs. Swan, who I have heard has often made a fuss about me and him, either watched or discovered we were together Thurs<lb/>day evening"—my wife did not find us in the office together—my wife had known for some time that I was very friendly with the prisoner—there was unpleasantness, but I do not admit everything in this statement—"his manliness seemed to desert him. Ho had told me he had given the clerk a holiday last Saturday that I might spend the day entirely with him. Yet he not only disparages me to her, but says he will re<lb/>nounce me. This after he has taught me to love him, and I know he was so fond of me. He did not mean it, though, for he wrote me a letter to help him and keep away for a day or two. I did not get that letter in time and went to the office. I was surprised to see the son there, but when my husband came in he asked me to kiss him, which I did. He told me he had sent the letter with money and I had better go, when Mrs. Swan rushed in. And when she said how he had disparaged me I was broken-hearted, although he denied it"—my wife came in while the prisoner was there, and told the prisoner that I had said some<lb/>thing disparaging—that did not seem to upset her—my wife rather exaggerated what I had said, and I modified it—"I went away sticking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190506260009"/>
               <p>up for him, but how I suffered! In reply to a note he said he would try and see me, and then somehow they prevailed on him to renounce me. I do not know whether he meant it or was only pretending, but I could neither eat nor sleep, and was half mad. I could not get to see him alone, and at last was so strung that I told her all in short. He was the only person I had left to love, and whose own love I was so sure of. He had just been arranging to do such a lot of things for my future, and has now not only to give me up but has left me destitute after paying everything for me, and all this came on me so suddenly and unexpectedly. I know I am mad and broken-hearted; I am going to meet my Master. I have heard she is leading him a worse his than ever, and going to spoil his prospects and his uncle"—I think that refers to an uncle of mine—"I think I will rid him of her before I go, and as he has treated another man's daughter so will it fall on his own. I have often had something in me urging me to do things contrary to commonsense. Now I have something urging, urging, urging what to do, yet Another voice is saying, "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will repay. Yet I know the other force will conquer; it always does. I have only been so long because my strength gives out. I have had no physical strength for five or six years. This dose not seem legible, but I cannot write otherwise now. He loved me and taught me to love him, and has made such promises. I have thought I have suffered before, but never like this; but it will soon be over. When I was about fifteen a man said to me he could wish I had not those eyes; they were more likely to be a curse than a blessing. I could not then understand, but now I know he was right. I have tried so hard always to be a good woman, but there is always fate, fate, fate. This time I will go and see who or what it is. I had destroyed all the letters he wrote me to "My dear Florence,' etc."—Florence is her Christian name, and years ago I wrote like that—" before going abroad. I did this en<lb/>tirely for his sake, and afterwards he thought it safer to write otherwise, as any letters were so often seen. In those letters he said he would make me as happy as he wished, etc."—on the Tuesday when she called she did not seem to be upset, by the way she spoke to my wife—when she was alone with me she seemed to be perfectly calm and seemed to be doing what she could to lower me in the eyes of my wife—she tried to make the breach wider—I think she asked to see me alone—on April 28th I do not think she asked to see me alone—she evidently had not heard what I had said to my son—I was not conscious then that she was anxious to have an interview with me alone—I was anxious that the acquaintance should come to an end—I do not know if she was equally anxious to see me—I do not think that she had given me the slightest indication that she acquiesced in giving me up—I think on the Tuesday I told her that after what she had said to my wife I should not have any more to do with her, and I heard no more of her till the Friday morning—when she first fired at me nobody had seized her—at the second shot either I or somebody else had seized her—I cannot say for certain whether when the second shot was fired I had hold of her hand or not—it is impossible for me to say if the other person or myself grasping her interrex with the guidance</p>

Swan and his son were brought in—Mr. Swan, senior, was suffering from two bullet wounds, one in his chest and one in his leg—on examining him 1 found the wound in his chest was between the fourth and fifth ribs, and these was an abrasion in his right armpit and a bruise on the inner side of his right arm; there was no point of exit of the bullet—he had a wound on the inner side of his right leg, about two inches below the knee—there was no point of exit of the bullet found there—he was examined with the X-rays, and shadows of both bullets were seen—the wound in the leg was very much shattered as well as the bone—he was operated upon about 4 o'clock that afternoon and a bullet was removed from his side about half an inch below the skin—it must have struck a rib and run round—that bullet was not fractured at all—his leg was operated upon and portions of a bullet and portions of the bone were removed—the leg was broken—he made a practically uninter<lb/>rupted recovery, and was discharged from the hospital on June 5th with his leg in a plaster splint, in which it is now—the younger Swan was more seriously injured and was in a state of collapse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners of the firm of Cogs well &amp; Harrison, Ltd., 141, New Bond Street, gun makers—on April 54th the prisoner came into the shop and asked to see some revolvers—she said she was going to America and wanted it for her own protection——I said it would be necessary to comply with the Act and to have a license, and next day she returned and gave me the money to get a license and waited while it was being procured—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the revolver—she also bought fifty cartridges similar to this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—she paid £3</p>

               <p>for the revolver and asked where she could try it—I said she could try it at a range, and that she was not to do so within fifty feet of the highway—she came a third time and obtained a ticket to have some practice at our range at Victoria—she seemed quite calm and rational; I should not have sold her the revolver otherwise.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29a, Gillingham Street, Pimlico, and am an instructor at Messrs. Cogswell &amp; Harrison's range at Victoria—on April 27th the prisoner came, bringing a revolver and car<lb/>tridges, and had a shooting lesson for about forty-five minutes, firing twenty to twenty-five shots—first of all I placed her at about twenty yards and she was firing at a four-inch bull—she asked me if it would be more deadly at a closer range, and of course I said it would—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the revolver; the recoil from it is considerable for a lady—the tendency would be, when it is fired, for it to come up, so I think I told her to aim a little low.</p>

I am the medical officer of Holloway prison, and have had the prisoner under my observation since May 1st; she came in on April 28th—when I first saw her, her condition was described to me as being exactly the same as when she came in—she was depressed and dazed, and her general bodily condition was bad—she was very excit<lb/>able and refused food—she said she wanted to die, and when the time came for her to go to the Police Court she was not in a fit state—I fed her on several occasions, and she has got a good deal better in general condition—I cannot say if at the time of this occurrence she was insane, but I do not think she is insane now—it would be natural for her to be in an excited condition under the events which have been related.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Secretary's Office of the General Post Office—in consequence of information that had come to my knowledge I made inquiries as to the non-delivery of letters that had passed through the St. John's Wood Office—I made up a packet identical in shape and size to this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and addressed it to "Mr. J. Hamilton, care of Mrs. Bush, 21, Townsend Road, St. John's Wood, N.W.'*—I put in it one sovereign, one half-sovereign, one half-crown, two separate shillings, a sixpence, and two penny stamps—this is the sixpence that I put in (Produced)—I marked it with a die "S.R.," and before I put it in the packet I noticed it was a bent one as this one is—it was also discoloured, but the discoloration has disappeared with friction—I posted the packet at 3.30 p.m. at the General Post Office, and in the ordinary course it would arrive at the St. John's Wood Post Office just before 8.30 p.m., where the prisoner's duties were—about 11 p.m. the same day I was shown this sixpence—on June 16th I saw the prisoner at the Post Office, Clifton Road, Maida Vale—after telling him who I was I said, "Last night you took out for delivery a packet ad<lb/>dressed to Mr. J. Hamilton, care of Mrs. Bush, 21, Townsend Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. You did not deliver it. Have you any explana<lb/>tion to offer?"—he said, "I beg to state that before going out on my</p>

               <p>delivery I put the packet in my bag. The bag has a hole in it, I lost the packet. I looked for it in the Townsend Road, but could not find it I went back along the road and looked for it"—I then said, "After completing your delivery you went to your father's house and from there to the Ordnance Arms, where you changed this sixpence," and I produced this sixpence to him, and said, "I identify this coin as one which I en<lb/>closed yesterday in the packet I addressed to Mr. Hamilton. The packet contained coins to the value of £1 15s. and two penny stamps, and they all bear my private mark"—he said, "I went there and changed a six<lb/>pence. I never had the other money. I am willing to be searched, and my house as well. I lost the packet"—I said, "You were seen to change this sixpence, and it was placed in the cash register. No other sixpence was placed in the register before it was examined, and after the one you changed was placed there"—he said, "The sixpence I changed was mine. You can search me and my house"—I gave instruct<lb/>tions that the prisoner's bag should be taken from his house, and later in the day I saw him at the General Post Office, and, showing him the bag, said, "When you went to the address of the packet after you had finished your delivery, you said you had lost the packet through the hole in this bag. Had it been there long?"—he said, "Yes, some time; my keys wore it, "meaning the keys he took out—I said, "You knew it was there when you say you put the packet in?"—he said, "Yes, but I did not think it was big enough to let anything through"—this packet was at the time in the corner of the bag, and I said, "There is a packet in the bag now. Would that drop through the hole?"—he said, "No, it is too large"—I said, "It is identical in shape and size with the one you had last night"—he said, "I thought that was smaller"—the hole was not nearly large enough to let the packet through.</p>

                  </hi> (313 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>) I am attached to the General Post Office—in consequence of instructions received I kept the prisoner under observa<lb/>tion on this evening, and saw him go to the Ordnance Arms, and then saw him leave again—after he left I examined the cash register in which I found this sixpence, which is marked "S. R."—I identified it, as I knew the mark—I was with Davis, and I know where he was standing in the public-house, and I also know the bar in which the prisoner was standing—Davis could see from one bar to the other—the counter is twenty inches wide, and the partition comes over nine inches of it, which leaves eleven inches for anybody to look over—I found the sixpence ten minutes after the prisoner had paid it.</p>

What have you got in that parcel?" he said, "Paint brushes, sir"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "I got them from 11, Edward Place"—I said, "Have you an invoice for them?"—he replied, "I have an invoice"—I said, "For this?"—he said, "No, for a parcel I received yesterday from the same place"—I said, "Does the gentleman there know that you have these things?"—he said, "Yes, he gave them to me. I very often have goods from him"—he then produced an invoice which is signed, "A. W. Green, Cash, "and it is apparently on Mr. Boecker's billhead and made out to Mr. W. Taylor, being for a list of goods at various prices amounting altogether to £1 13s. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he made a rambling statement as to the day of the invoice and I said to him, "Your answer does not seem very satisfactory to me; I shall have to take you back to 11, Edward Place"—he said, "Very good, sir, I will come"—I took him back to Edward Place, where we went into No. 11—I said to him, "Which is the man who let you have these goods?" and he pointed out Green, a clerk in the employment of Mr. Boecker—I said to Green, "What about this parcel?"—he said, "That is all right; I let him have them"—I said, "Is it all right? What about the invoice?"—he said, "I am going to forward the invoice later on, because I am busy"—I said, "Is this with your master's knowledge?" and he said, "Well, the <hi rend="italic">guv'nor</hi> is away now having lunch"—I said, "But as regards these things, does he know that you let him have these?"—he said, "Well, I do let anybody have goods when they come in in the absence of the master, also the manager"—I said, "Does he know that he has had these, or that this man deals here?"—he said, "Yes, he knows he deals here. I will go and fetch the master"—I said, "About how long will he be?"—he said,</p>

"Well, I can wait; I have got plenty of time, I do not think you had better go"—he afterwards made an excuse that he wanted to take a letter to post—I said, "You must not go away; you must wait and give an answer as regards the goods"—I said to Ben<lb/>jamin, "What is in the parcel?"—Green was going to give me the in<lb/>formation when I said, "No, I want this man to tell me what is in the parcel"—Benjamin said, "I do not know what is in the parcel"—I said, "Do you usually have a parcel of goods and you do not know what is in it?"—he said, "Well, I asked him to let me have a parcel of about £2"—I said, "Do not you know the number or the quantity of the goods?"—he said, "No, I only know they are paint brushes"—I then waited for Mr. Boecker—in the presence of the prisoners when he arrived he said that Green had no authority whatever to let this man have the goods, and also that he did not know Benjamin—I took them both into custody, and took them to the station—they were charged with stealing and re<lb/>ceiving these brushes, to which they made no answer—when searched,. on Benjamin, amongst a number of other papers, were found these four invoices (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—one of them is made out to "A. E. Green"—he said he traded under the name of "William Taylor"—in Green's drawer where he was employed was found this blank book of invoices, which can be bought off a stall—there is no name on them (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—these are three of Mr. Boecker's invoices (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cycle maker—on June 13th, about 10.30 p.m., I was in Rosoman Street, Clerkenwell—I had just locked my shop up and walked across the road and stood against the wall to see if my light was properly out—while standing there the prisoner came up and pulled at my watch, breaking it off the chain—I pulled it back out of his hand, and he put his hand in another of my pockets, and said, "What have you got <hi rend="italic">here?"</hi>—I pushed him away when he went down to the ground—he got up and punched me on the chest, and I punched him back again the best I could—nobody came to my assistance; there were not many people about—we as good as had a fight, and I said, "Hold up," and went across the road—he followed me, and would not let me go—he was alone—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) with the broken part of the chain—I have known him about the place with other fellows—I have never spoken to him—he is all right when he is sober, but when he is drunk he gets quarrel-some—I think he was drunk on this night—I was not much hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He came over and caught me in a drunken sort of way—I cannot swear whether he intended to steal my watch, or whether it was only a drunken <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—it is a pretty bright street and people were about—there was a man standing close to us, but he was frightened to come up as a witness—this is not a busy street on a holiday time; it was Whit-Tuesday evening—the fight only lasted a few minutes and we separated—as he was coming back at me again the policeman came up—he did not come back and ask me what I had been fighting for—I told the policeman the prisoner came at me and tried to take my watch—nothing was taken from me by him—I have never had a drink with him.</p>

               <p>the Commercial Road, going eastwards—I had passed the corner of a road where, I think, there is a factory, and was in the bend of the road which takes the form of an "S"—there is a gas light about twenty yards away, but I do not think there is one at the corner—as I was going to step off the pavement to go across the carriage way I heard something behind me, and felt that I had been grappled on both sides of the neck, not on the wind pipe, but on the transverse vertebrae, and I knew at once that I would fall—I turned my head to the right, feeling the pressure more, and my blood flew to the brain, but I was able to see in profile the head of the man who was holding me and that he was a tall man, and was drawing me backwards with his hands on both sides of my neck—another man was in front of me—my frock coat, which was buttoned, was opened—I shouted and struck out, and I believe I struck the man in front of me—I heard a voice that seemed to come from one side of me, evidently addressed to the man who was holding me from behind, say, "You clumsy b—choke him; don't you see he is strong t"—I presume I was trying to kick out with my feet at the man in front—I felt the grip on my neck closed—I became unconscious—by gripping the side of the neck you stop the supply of blood to the brain, and fall within about ten seconds from the time it is closed—when I recovered con<lb/>sciousness I found myself lying on the pavement, with my top hat driven over my nose, and smashed like a concertina—it was a new hat, and stiff, and must have required considerable pressure to do it; my clothes were all torn, and I missed my umbrella, which was silk, and had a silver top, mounted with a stone, and cost over £12—the stone was green and brown, and is only to be got usually in small pieces, but this was a large piece—it was of the crysolite series—the silver top had my monogram on it—I have had it perhaps twenty years—I also lost an 18-carat gold Albert chain, except one link, which seems to have been cut, and my watch at the end of the chain, also two silver cigar holders, a diamond scarf pin, and a silver and gold cigar case—the watch was valuable; fortunately I had not my gold watch on at the time—the scarf pin was worth about £25; it had a seal stone and my initials—the detective has it—that was the only thing that was picked up; it has a screw on the end to prevent the pin being pulled out readily, and they had to tear the whole thing right through, and force the nut behind—on regaining con<lb/>sciousness I found a man standing over me trying to revive me—he asked me whether I had been hurt, and told me he was the coffee stall keeper; he helped me up, and to his coffee stall, a short distance away—I felt ill, and had to be carried, but in about an hour I was able to walk, and was taken to the police station in West India Dock Road, where I gave a description of one of my assailants—I subsequently attended at the police station, and identified the prisoner from nine or ten other men, three of whom were similar in appearance—that was the same day that I was before the Magistrate, Thursday, June 8th—it is the prisoner who held me from behind—I live miles further east, but my cab horse had broken down at Albert Square, and I was walking to the next cab rank—I am a stranger to the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>acids, and plated with them—the following day we made another search, when I found in a vase in the sitting room on a little side shelf six shillings and three florins—one of the shillings is dated 1873, and has slight signs of plaster of Paris upon it—the coins are very well cleaned—on the way to the station in the cab the female prisoner said, "If I do not get bail I do not know what I shall do with the home; I have no friends that will look after it"—I said, "Perhaps your husband's friends will take charge of it"—she said, "He is not my husband; I may as well tell you, as it is bound to come out. I shall get Russell to look after it"—Russell is someone who moved them.</p>

I am a chemist, of 9, Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush—Arthur Courtney has been to my shop as a customer—on one occasion Jones accompanied him—the first time the name is in my book is on April 18th—he has had various pick-me-ups and many things, and a pennyworth of nitrate of silver—he signed himself as Jones—he handed me this card (<hi rend="italic">Jones's card</hi>) when he came alone—I have sold him cyanide of potassium on two occasions—he specially asked for it to be 98 per cent strength—the usual strength is 40 per cent., as used in photography—I last supplied him on April 25th with a four-ounce bottle—I never went to 226, Uxbridge Road, to make enquiries, because I was single handed and could not get away—in the first place he showed me a bottle, and asked for that strength—I would know the bottle again—when Jones and Courtney were there together I believe they asked me for another bottle of cyanide of potassium of that strength.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary to the Duke of West<lb/>minster, and live at 33, Upper Grosvenor Street—Chapman was formerly a night watchman at Grosvenor House, and I discharged him on Novem<lb/>ber 25th for misconduct—in front of No. 33, Upper Grosvenor Street, there is a courtyard in front of the carriage drive—in and beside the carriage entrance there are two doors for pedestrians—once you are in the courtyard you can get On to the staircase, but you cannot get into the lumber rooms, as they are looked from the inside—the outer door which leads into the courtyard is locked, I should think, about 10 p.m.—a person who had an acquaintance with the locality like Chapman had could get in and conceal himself before the door was locked; he could stop on the landing by the lumber rooms—it is almost between the houses; it is part of No. 33—to gain access to No. 33 a person would have to descend a disused staircase and turn off to the left down to the basement which goes right down into the house; the whole of Grosvenor House was then open to him—he would not then have to come into the courtyard again to get access.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector C.</hi>) On May 30th I received information of this robbery of jewellery from Grosvenor House, and I made enquiries—in consequence of a communication I received from Levin, Chapman, about 11p.m. on June 13th, was brought to Vine Street police station by a con<lb/>stable—after his identification the following morning he made a state<lb/>ment to me which I took down in writing, and he signed it—in conse<lb/>quence of information received in that way, I went down to Cambridge on June 11th, and, with Chief Constable Holland, went to 17, Priory Road, which is a small house—I there saw White's wife and had a conversation with her, but I cannot say whether White heard it; he was in the next room—she called him and he came from the kitchen—I told him who I was, and said, pointing to the chief constable, "I think you know who this is"—I said, "I want the parcel of jewellery that Chapman left here about a fortnight ago"—he hesitated and did not appear to make any answer—I then cautioned him, and showed him the written statement signed by Chapman—he said, "He did bring some things here, but he took them away again"—he then hesitated and seemed to be prevaricating and I said, "I do not believe by your manner that you are telling me the truth"—his wife thereupon said, "For God's sake tell the truth"—he did not answer to that—I said, "Give me all the things at once"—he said, "I have not got them here" I said, "Where are they I" and he again made no reply—his wife said, "Do tell them"—he said, "They are not here; they are about two miles away. I got afraid of having them in the house, and buried them in a field along the Newmarket Road"—I told him I should re<lb/>quire him to accompany me and point out the spot—we got a cab out-side, and I again cautioned him, as he appeared to hesitate—I told him to dress himself, as he was partly undressed, being a tailor, and we went to the door—he then said, "I will tell you the truth. He left them here, and I saw the case in the paper and got frightened and buried them. I will show you where they are"—with the chief constable we got into</p>

               <p>the cab, and he directed it through different streets into the Newmarket Road, and along the Newmarket Road we stopped at a gateway leading into a couple of fields divided by a thick hedge—we got out and went into the field, proceeding along the hedge for about sixty yards, where he pointed to a spot, underneath which he said they were—I dug down and found all the missing jewellery, except some broken pieces of a brooch which were handed to me by Levin—they were wrapped up in this piece of wadding and this piece of brown paper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—this rope of pearls was wrapped in this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which made one of six that we found there all marked with a coronet and the letter "W."—the jewellery comprised a rope of pearls, twelve diamond brooches, a diamond hair ornament, a gold chain bracelet, and a gold muff chain—one brooch alone is worth £400 or £500—I took White to the Cambridge police station, where I put down in writing the result of the interview, which he signed—I wrote down this correction at his dictation, "I meant by him taking them away that he did take them away, but he brought them back again, and I was going to add that when you told me you did not believe I was telling the truth"—he then went on to say, "He (Chapman) was on the Newmarket Road when I was out in the morning, and when I got home my wife asked me if I had seen anybody; neither she nor me had seen him till that time. It was one of my children that saw him, and I sent my child out about half-past 2 to look for him. The child came back and said he had gone, and about 4 p.m. he came himself to the back of the house, and sent one of my children in to tell me he wanted to see me. I went to the front door and asked him in, but he would not come in, as he said he had someone to meet, and was afraid he should miss him; he asked me to go to the top of the street with him, where he walked. I went up there in about half-an-hour's time and saw him there and asked him what he was doing there; he told me he had walked down from London. I asked him to come in and have a cup of tea, when he showed me a piece of broken brooch with two leaves broken off, and he also produced a tobacco pouch which he opened and was full of jewellery. I asked him where he got them from, and he said, "That is all right. Ask no questions.' He then came down to my house and had tea and took some of the jewellery from the tobacco pouch which he again showed to me, and put it back again, and he and I went out into the town and returned home about 11.30 p.m. when he said he would not walk to London that night, and I invited him to sleep at my house, which he said he would do. Before he went to bed he handed me the whole of the jewellery which he had, and asked me to mind it. I told him I would, and put it on the mantelpiece in the room where he slept, which was the kitchen. I got up at 6 a.m., and he got up and had breakfast, and after that he went, leaving the jewellery for me to mind. He said nothing whatever about when he would come again for it. On the day after he left I saw an account in the papers, the" Ex<lb/>press," about the robbery at the Duke of Westminster's, and as there were some pocket-handkerchiefs with a coronet and 'W' on it, I surmised that the jewellery he left might be from there, and, wanting to get rid</p>

               <p>of them out of the house, I went and buried them"—I took that state<lb/>ment down in writing in my pocket book and read it over to him, and he signed it—he had given me to understand before that he had known Chapman as a native of Cambridge—the wife told me that they knew him quite well—I took him to Vine Street police station, where the two prisoners were put together and charged with the robbery and receiv<lb/>ing—White said, "I wish to state that when I received the jewels I did not know they were stolen"—Chapman said, in White's presence, "Mrs. White begged of me to bring them back again"—White said, "Was that in my presence or my absence?" and Chapman said, "In your absence, of course"—this is Chapman's tobacco pouch, found on him Winn arrested (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but I cannot say whether it is the one White spoke of—I got some pieces of broken brooch at Cambridge, where they had been sold at a shop, and also three little pieces sold in Wandsworth Road, London.</p>

She was alone when I went there, and I showed her the rest of the jewellery and asked her to hide it for me, telling her where I had got it from. She begged of me to take it back again, but I could not see my way clear to do so, otherwise I would have started that same night and walked the whole of the way back, as I then realised the enormity of my crime, and thought of the effect on my aged parents, should it be<lb/>come known to them. Mr. White arrived home soon after 9.30 p.m., and, having left the jewellery in the keeping of Mrs. White, I explained to him that I had been tramping the country in search of work. When I handed the jewellery to Mrs. White she wrapped them up in some cotton wool and placed them in a box which she tied up in brown paper, which she implored me to allow her to send back. I told her I could not possibly send them back, as they would see that they came from Cam-bridge, and suspicion would then fall on me, as they knew at Grosvenor House that I come from Cambridge. I slept there that night and started off for London in the morning, and before leaving Mrs. White I told her that I should eventually call for them and find some means of restoring them to the Duchess, and it was only on these conditions that she retained them"—when White came to me from the kitchen he appeared to be somewhat frightened and nervous; he did not give me a straight-forward answer; he appeared to be confused—I should not have thought it was a difficult position for him—he seemed to make up his mind to</p>

Provided you do not enter an appearance and in order to help you and save expense, I will get the <hi rend="italic">guv'nor</hi> to give you a letter and accept £1 a month. How will that suit you?"—he said, "I never intended to enter an appearance. I do not want to add to the original debt; I only want time to pay"—he had not entered an appearance at that time, but I did not know it then—he said, "The papers are in my solicitors' hands, but I will wire them not to enter an appearance. If they have, I will instruct them to withdraw"—on that occasion the safe was never opened and the books were never got out; in fact, we never went into the office where the books were kept—it is absolutely untrue that any sum of £18 17s. 10d. was mentioned or agreed upon—there was only one sum mentioned, and that was £29 14s. 6d.—I had not then instructed a solicitor, as I wanted to keep the expense down—on April 26th, one day prior to the date of judgment, I found he had entered an appearance of which we had received no notice—I then issued the Order 14 myself and took out a summons under it—I instructed a solicitor—I made an affidavit on April 28th, which was filed on May 9th [<hi rend="italic">Stating that the witness was authorised by the plaintiff to make the affidavit; that the prisoner ad<lb/>mitted the</hi> £29 14s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be due and owing to the plaintiff, and informed the plaintiff's son in his presence on April</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1905, <hi rend="italic">that he did not intend to enter an appearance; and that he had no defence, but only wanted time</hi>]—April 20th is a clerical error; it should be April 21st—the prisoner then swore an affidavit on May 13th, which was filed on May 16th—[<hi rend="italic">Par.</hi> 3] "On the 21st of April, 1905, I saw the said Charles William Lees, who acted on behalf of the plaintiff, and we examined the said accounts, and he agreed also that I was indebted to the plaintiff in the said sum of £18 17s. 10d. only"—we never went out of the front room to see the accounts at all—[<hi rend="italic">Par.</hi> 5]: "I did not admit to the said Charles William Lees that the said sum of £29 14s. 6d. was due and owing to the plaintiff, nor did I inform the plaintiffs son in the presence of the said Charles William Lees on the 20th day of April, 1905, that I did not intend to enter an appearance, and that I only required time to pay.

I gave the job to the prisoner"—that is why the Jury stopped it—I have been working for Mr. Ford a little over two months—he trade in the same line as Mr. Winskell—I kept the books, of which I have had years' experience—my next employment to a solicitor's clerk was a time keeper and book keeper to a builder some twelve months ago—the solicitor I was with was Mr. E. A. Newman, and he lived in my own house in Wimbledon and had offices at Walbrook—I was convicted at this Court and got twelve months for conspiracy to defraud on April 20th, 1903—the Recorder said he hoped I should get honest employment when I came out, and I have ever since.</p>

I am a fishmonger in the employ of John Arnold, and reside at 146, Brook Street, Ratcliff—about 1 p.m. on Saturday, May 27th, I was outside my shop when I saw a gentleman lying flat on the ground with Carey, whom I know, holding his throat, and Barry holding his leg—after it was done Bromley came up and gave the barber a handkerchief to wipe the gentleman's face—I only Raw two men robbing the prosecutor—I did not see them take anything from his pocket, nor did I see Carey take anything with him—I did not see a bunch of keys—at the police station I picked out Carey and Barry from about a dozen men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am prisoner's wife, and live at 27, Greenacres Street, Limehouse—my occupation is selling old clothes—between 2.30 and 3 p.m. on May 2nd I came home and saw my husband standing on the opposite side of the road—when I got in he followed me—he asked me where I had been and I said, "I do not know where I have been to"—he said, "That is no answer. You are drunk. I will make you tell me where you have been. I will put you through it"—he then <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> me with his fist, and held me against the wall and kicked me all about the body—he was not drunk then—he is a labourer on the canal—this is my marriage certificate (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I have got two little girls, one eight years old and the other nine—I was married fifteen years ago—I have had eleven children altogether, of which I have only three left—on the Wednesday morning I washed and dressed the children for school—he kept the doors fastened and put things against them so that I should not go out—he then <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> me the same way again and kicked me—I screamed, and holloaed "Murder," and my landlady called out from downstairs, "I will not have this going on in my place"—my husband holloaed out, "Keep down out of my place. If anyone comes in this place I will chop them down"—</p>

               <p>about 5 p.m. that day I went to the hospital, when my leg was bandaged up, and a plaster was put on my back—on Saturday morning I was getting worse, so I said to my husband, "I shall have to go to the hospital, "and he said, "I don't care where you go. I have got more feeling for a dog than I have got for you"—I then went to the hospital—I have still got my leg bandaged—he has been away ever since—he was locked up on May 6th, the same day that I went into the infirmary—the first day after he had been remanded and was on bail he came to see me—I said, "You know what you <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with me, and that is what has brought me here," and he said, "Never mind; what I have done I can suffer for"—he was out for a fortnight on bail and he came two or three times—he came one Sunday and wanted me to come out—I was in bed, and was still very bad, and I said, "I cannot come out"—he said, "When do you expect to get up?"—I said, "I do not know; I cannot tell you"—he said, "When you come out, if you come up against me, I mean to do for you. I will put your <hi rend="italic">light bang</hi> out"—I left the hospital this Monday.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner in Commercial Road, and am medical officer for the parish—from informa<lb/>tion that I received I went about 7 p.m. on Saturday, May 2nd, to 27, Greenacre Road, where I saw Sarah Grimes in a state of extreme nervous, prostration and fear—she complained that she had been knocked about—I examined her, and found a contused wound over her right eye, a bruise on her right buttock about as large as the back of my hand; a bruise in the right lumbar region about the size of two of my fingers; two bruises, on the outer part of her right thigh; an extensive bruise on the lower part of her right leg, half-way up the leg down to the ankle, and some swelling in the centre of it, with some slight inflammation of some of the veins—"he was lying on a mattress, and suffered a good deal of pain on movement—this condition might have been produced by kooks or by some blunt instrument—to have caused the bruise on the lower part of the leg she must have been repeatedly kicked—I thought she was quite bad enough to send her to the infirmary—I should not think she would be quite right yet as regards the bruise on the lower part of her leg; I have not examined her since.</p>

Murder!"—about 11 a.m. the next day I heard more screams, so I called up the stairs that I could not have her screaming in the place, and I should have to get a constable—the prisoner told me to mind my own business—at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. that day Mrs. Grimes showed me her leg, and I advised her to go to the hospital.</p>

The trucks are run into our goods station at Nine Elms—I tallied out the contents of the trucks into the barge—the packages were shot out of the truck straight into the barge which was lying alongside the wharf—this delivery order was made out by the railway company and sent to me—I checked the marks on the bales as they came out of the trucks—the man who gave this receipt was F. Seaman—he was not called as a witness at the Police Court, although he was there—he is Messrs. Page &amp; East's foreman at the wharf—I am prepared to say that I saw every one of those 228 bales put into the barge—these figures "228" on this yellow form are Seaman's—I believe it was mid-day when I delivered these over—the delivery might have taken about 2 or 2 1/2 hours—the bales varied in size—I cannot say the weight of them—some might weigh 1 1/4 cwt. or 1 1/2 cwt., and some more—the weight would not come under my notice—I think they all weighed over a hundredweight each—they were all put on board the barge, covered over with a tarpaulin sheet which was nailed down—after they were tallied into the barge my business with them was finished—I saw Messrs. Page's people nail down the tarpaulin—the nails were put in close and tight—nothing could have been taken from under the tarpaulin except by tearing up some of the nails and disarranging the tarpaulin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman's apprentice—on March 11th I had orders to look after the barge <hi rend="italic">Sarah</hi> at Bull Wharf—I got to the wharf between 9 and 9.30 p.m.—she was lying along the wharf one barge off—when I got there I saw two men sitting on the head sheets—I cannot say what they were like—one was tall and the other was short—I cannot say how they were dressed, but they had dark clothes—one had a "P. and O." hat on; that is a cap with a peak to it—I called out to them, "Who are you?"—they did not answer for the first half-dozen times; at last they called out, "Halloa"—I said, "What are you doing there?"—there was no answer—I went on to Southwark Bridge to see whether the men were stopping on the barge, when I see a boat row away from the barge straight across the river with two men in it—I could not see anything in the boat—this was about 9.30 p.m.—it was dark—I went to get a boat to go to the barge—I could not get across from the wharf without one, as there was 3 or 4 ft. of mud—I got to the barge between 11 and 12, and stayed on board all night till 1 o'clock midday—I came back to the barge on Sunday night about 7.30, and remained on board all night till 5 a.m.—I told Charles Coombs about the two men on Monday morning about 7 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HALL</hi>. I have been with Hymans for a year and nine months—on March 13th I had no idea there was any stolen rubber on the market—I have had a fair experience of rubber—at the time I first saw the rubber in the van I had no reason to suspect anything wrong—I have known the Castles for years, but have never traded with them—I believe they do a very large business in the same line as ourselves—they are not necessarily trade rivals—I know a man called Woolf Paros—I have known him for four or five years—he is a waste rubber merchant—I do not know that he is one of the sharpest and smartest judges of rubber in the trade—our telephone number is 112, East—I do not know Paros' telephone number from memory—I did not ring him up on the telephone on Monday, March 13th, about 10 a.m.—I swear that—I had no communication with him that morning—I have possibly rung him up during the last three months once or twice; no more—I have never rung him up on the telephone in connection with this matter—I cannot say if at 3.30 on the Monday afternoon, March 13th, I connected in my mind the alleged visit of Moss to Castle with the sale of the rubber—I may have done—it was about a fortnight after March 13th that Helden first called on me—I have no recollection of the date—I never saw an advertisement toll as to the stolen rubber (<hi rend="italic">Bill produced</hi>)—my attention was never drawn to that—my firm is pretty well known—if I had seen the bill on March

               <p>28th I should not necessarily have associated it in my mind with this suspicious rubber I had seen on March 13th—the nearest police station to my office is in the East India Dock Road, about 300 or 400 yards away—I do not pass it every day—when Helden called on me he did not pro<lb/>duce one of these bills—it was not so long as six weeks after March 13th that I first saw Helden—I may have heard about the Castles being arrested—Paros did not tell me—when Helden came I do not remember that he mentioned anything about the Castles—he took a statement from me in writing—I believe I knew on the morning he came that the Castles had been arrested, but I did not tell him anything about Moss going into their yard—I believe I saw Paros once between March 13th and my giving my evidence at the Police Court—I have been to this place several times—I may have been there a week before May 19th—I cannot swear to that—I have known Paros for years; it may be lour and a half—it has not come to my knowledge that anyone has ventured to suggest that I knew anything about this stolen rubber—the police never suggested it—people do get occasionally charged with receiving stolen property when they are innocent—I had the misfortune to be charged with receiving stolen property a good many years ago, but I was acquitted—I was not the man that was wanted—it was not stolen property at all—it was at Peterborough fourteen years ago—I have dealt in various things since for a living at 40, Burdett Road—I do not know that I had a good many goods there and did not pay for them—I know a firm called Norris &amp; Co., of Juniper Street—I forget if I got £20 worth of leather from them and did not pay for it—it is some time ago—it never occurred to me—I have an uncle named Edward Israel—he buys scrap leather—he is six or seven years older than I—I do not know that he might be mistaken for me, but it is very likely—I know a Mr. Clarke, of Old Gravel Lane, Wapping—I do a big trade with him now—I have never given him a cheque that has been dishonoured—that I swear—I saw him the other day near Wapping station—he asked me what I was doing down there—he is a thoroughly respectable man—I did not tell him that I was down at Wapping police station trying to put the Castles away—I was not going down there trying to put them away, most decidedly not—I told him I had just come from Wapping police station and that they had sent for me to identify them—I know a Mr. W. Smith, a wholesale merchant, of 2, Crown Street, Portsmouth—I have no recollection that on August 28th, 1897, he sold me leather and a saddle valued between £30 and £40, and that I have never paid him—I do not know if he save so that he would be right, I do not remember it—I know a Mr. Godwin, of Glamis Road, Shadwell—I do not remember giving his carman half-a-sovereign to make some weights a little better for me—I was not sent for by Mr. Godwin and turned out of the place and told never to come there again—I have a wife named Sarah—she does not carry on business—there is a County Court judgment of August 7th, 1901, for £30; one of December 3rd, 1901, for £11 6s. 6d.; one of October 12th, 1903, for £14 11s. 10d.; all against a lady, named Sarah Israel and myself, trading as E.

               <p>if there are other judgments against me—I saw Detective Gale before I saw Helden—I did not tell him I knew anything about this matter—I met him at the Eastern Hotel where I have lunch sometimes—he did not speak to me about stolen rubber—he may have called at the wharf when I was not there—I did not see him—he knew my address pretty well—the first day I went to the Police Court I gave evidence—I was not in attend<lb/>ance there on any day prior—I believe I was served with a subpoena to attend—I believe it was the day before the trial or the morning of the trial—a telegram was sent to me—between May 13th and May 19th I went to Paros to offer him some rubber strips—Paros never showed me this bill—Helden one day came into my office and said to me that he had an idea that I knew the names of the prisoners, so I said, "If you think so, I am very pleased you think so."—he said, "I insist upon your telling me those names"—he said, "I know the names, and so do you"—"Very well," I said, "if you insist upon me telling you the names, you put the names down yourself, and I will put the names down and we will both turn them over, and if they correspond one with the other, they must be right"—I did not tell him right away the names—they did agree—I did not toss up a coin—there was nothing said about that at the Police Court—this conversation may have taken place at Helden's first visit to me or the second; I cannot swear to that—it may not have been the first thing he said; he may have said something else—it does not look to me as if Gale had told him I had denied any knowledge of these men—I have said I never mentioned a word to Gale—I had never told Helden I did not know the names; I was never asked the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am being asked about things which occurred some weeks ago—Helden was the first police officer who saw me—I never saw Gale—my clerk Laing was present when he saw me—the first time at the office, there was Laing, Helden and another police officer there—I do not know his name—as nearly as I can remember they came in and said there was some rubber stolen, did I know anything about it? I said, "Yes," and told them the facts of the case from the start—I told them exactly what I saw, and all about it—at that time I did not mention the name of the Mosses or the Castles—Laing did not in my presence mention the names, so far as I recollect—something was taken down in writing by the sergeant on that occasion—the second occasion that he came may have been a week or less after—he came with the same officer as before—Laing was in the office—there was nothing taken down the second time—he came to see if I could give him any more informa<lb/>tion—Helden saw me again about a week before I gave evidence—that was again at my office—I may have met Gale since March 13th at a place of refreshment—I saw him almost every day at the Eastern Hotel—I did not talk to him about this case—I can only remember Paros as having had one address since I first knew him—I do not keep a record of the people I communicate with on the telephone—I do not know of many people who stop outside police stations and read the notices—I do not know anything about the poster—I am not the principal of my firm; Mr. Hyman is—I have never seen a circular appertaining to this</p>

He was wearing a peak cap on the Saturday and the Monday, and also on May 13th—on May 13th I went to Wapping police station with Israel—I went into the identification first—I should think there were thirteen or fifteen men there—they were ordinary working men—I did not notice whether any were wearing peak caps except Moss—I was not looking out for a man with a peak cap, I was looking out for the face—there was nothing remarkable about his dress in general—he called on the Saturday between 11 and 12—he spoke to Mr. Hyman or Mr. Israel; I am not sure which it was—there was a sample of beeswax left, I think—I do not know what has become of it—there was, I think, no entry made of his call, but I have not looked to see—on the Monday he came straight into the office and spoke to Mr. Israel, as far as I remember—he had the sample of rubber in his hand—I do not think I ever told Mr. Israel that he had called on the Saturday—I did not mention any name to Mr. Israel—I did not know any name—I heard an address given to Mr. Israel; I think it was Matson Street—I think that was on the Monday morning—I do not think I have said this before—I first heard the name of Moss when the police mentioned it—that was some time afterwards—it was mentioned by Sergeant Helden—I think it was when he and Israel were together—I cannot remember how he came to mention it—in the course of question<lb/>ing he must have mentioned the name of Moss—I had no conversation with Israel about the matter before the police came—I first heard of the</p>

Hyman in the office—I do not think I said anything about it to Mr. Israel, or he to me—I afterwards heard of the Castles' arrest—I knew their firm—their arrest did not interest me particularly—I connected in my mind the arrest of the Castles with the visit of the man on the Monday morning—I do not think I mentioned that to Mr. Israel—Mr. Israel never told me that he had been to the Old Kent Road, but I know I beard it mentioned in the office—it was some time after—I believe it was one of the Hymans who mentioned it, but not to me—that is the first time I heard any mention of the Old Kent Road address—no such address and no name of Moss was given in my hearing on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary to the Kensington Rubber Company, of Silchester Road, Notting Hill—on Tuesday, March 14th, about midday, a van of Lavington's drew up at our place and Rosenberg came with it—Paros came about an hour afterwards—I did not know him before—before Paros arrived several sacks were brought in—I do not remember how many—I knew that some rubber was coming—I think Mr. Rath told me—he is our manager—the eight sacks were brought in and I saw the contents, which were raw rubber—the total weight of the eight sacks was 1,554 1/2 lbs. gross, that is with the sacks—the bags were afterwards weighed and found to be 43 lbs., bringing the weight down to 1,511 1/2 lbs. net., that is 13 cwts. 1 qr. 27 lbs. exactly—there were marks on the sacks, but I did not notice what they were—the rubber was bought by us and not brought for any other purpose—it was very wet, dirty, and offensive smelling; it seemed to be full of water—after Mr. Rath examined it I had orders to take about 100 lbs. and check it over, as it was washed, to see what it lost in the washing—about March 23rd Sergeant Helden came to our premises and the rubber was handed over to him—it was what we had received from Paros.</p>

I went to the Kensington Rubber Company in July, 1904—Paros has had dealings with the firm since about April or May, 1904—the company was registered on September 26th, 1904—Paros had been a seller to the company and was a constant visitor—it was Paros' own van which brought the stuff from Paros as a rule, of which Rosenberg was the carman—the appearance of the rubber is entirely changed by the treatment at our works—it is taken and cut up by hand and then placed in boiling water for some time to soften it; it is then placed between two rollers, one of which runs faster than the other, which tear the rubber to shreds and if it is any good it will come out the other side in a long sheet—we make it up into tyres and compound it with other materials—Paros had sold us raw rubber before this under the description of "raw rubber"—I cannot say at what price—the price of raw rubber is higher than scrap rubber, but there are various grades of raw rubber and scrap rubber which approach each other very closely in price—some of the better grades of raw rubber are worth from 3s. 6d. to 48. 6d. a lb.—scrap rubber would vary in value from 2 1/2 d. to 2s. 6d. a lb.—some of Paros' rubber was treated at our works and in that condition handed over to Sergeant Helden about March 23rd—the sacks in which the rubber was, and which were handed to the</p>

               <p>he first of all sold me some covers, hose pipes and toy rubber; that is waste rubber—after that he fetched me some brown paper and took from it two samples of rubber—it was unmanufactured rubber—he asked me if I wanted to buy that rubber—I said, "What kind of rubber?"—he said, "That is a good kind of rubber"—I said, "I do not know if it is good or not; will it float in water?"—"Certainly," he said—"Well," I said, "I should like to see if it will float"—a glass of water was brought and I cut a little piece and put it in the water, and I saw that it floated—I told him that as it floated my price would be 1s. a pound—he said, "No, it is worth more"—I said, "I will give 1s. 1d."—the father then came in and I saw he had two pieces of the same rubber in an envelope—the father and son talked together in the corner—I did not know what they were saying—then young Castle said to his father, "Mr. Paros offers for the rubber 1s. per lb."—the father laughed and said, "The rubber is worth 2s. a lb. or more. Do you call yourself a rubber merchant if you offer for that rubber 1s. a lb.?"—I told him that as floating rubber it was worth from 1s. to 1s. 1d. to me"—he said, "No, you cannot have it under 2s. a lb."—I said, "I do not know if it is worth 2s.; if you like to give me a sample I have got a man who will tell me what the rubber is worth"—he said, "All right; cut a sample from both the pieces and to-morrow morning when you call for the other goods that you have bought you can tell me if you will have this"——I cut two pieces off the two samples—this sample is the kind of rubber, but both the pieces I cut were very much thicker and bigger, and of a different shape—I asked the elder Castle what quantity he had got, and he said he had got a big bag, between 2 and 3 cwts.—the son said, "No, I think it will be a lot more"—I went away with the two samples to the Kensington Rubber Company, Silchester Road, Notting Hill—I showed the two samples to Mr. Rath at the Kensington Company—I arranged for one of Messrs. Lavington's vans to go to Commercial Road the next morning—Knighton, the driver, came to my place about 8 o'clock—I went with Rosenberg in the van to Castle's place—we got there about 8.30—the van waited outside while I went in—I saw Arthur Henry Castle—he said, "You have got your van"—I said, "Yes, I have got my van outside"—he said, "What price do you offer for the rubber of which you had a sample last night?"—I said, "I will give you 1s. 6d."—he said, "Wait a second; I will go in the office"—he came out and said, "All right, you can have it; pull your van in"—we pulled the van in and the elder Castle came out—he said, "Weigh in first the hose pipes"—the waste stuff was weighed first and then there were put on eight bags, but I did not see what was in them; it was called floating rubber—the weights were noted down at the time—the floating rubber in the bags weighed 13 cwts. 1qr. 22 lbs. net—in addition to that there was the hosing, covers and other rubber—the hosing was loaded first; then the eight bags were put in the middle and then the other things put on—I then went to the office, where young Castle made out the invoice which came to £126 11s.—when I saw there was such a big quantity of floating</p>

Castle"—I took the goods home, leaving the waste rubber there, but the floating rubber was taken to the Kensington Rubber Company—I looked at the rubber as it was taken out of the bags—it was in very big lumps and very wet and dirty—it was all of the same class as the sample—I sold the rubber on the sample the night before—on the same day, Tuesday, I telephoned from the Kensington Company's place to Mr. Mason, of Manchester—the next day, Wednesday, the 16th, I saw the elder Castle, and another man in the street—Castle said to me, "Can you come to-morrow morning to my place? We have got another parcel of rubber"—I said, "Yes, I can call upon you to-morrow morning"—I went next morning and bought waste rubber, such as toy, red, tyres, goloshes, black, hosing, and then young Castle said to me, "We have got another four bags of floating rubber"—I said, "I do not want it; I cannot do with it. The man who I sold the eight bags to is grumbling that it has got too much water and too much dirt in it"—he took me into the office—I saw the father there—the son came out of the inner office and said, "You have got the four bags already on the vans"—"I said, I do not want it; I have not got a market for it"—the lather said, "All right, you can have it a penny cheaper. Take it"—I said, "I will have the rubber, but if I am not able to sell it I shall bring it back and you will return me the money"—they agreed to that—this is the invoice for it, 6 cwts., 3 qrs. 19 lbs. at 1s. 5d., and then there are a lot of other items, coming altogether to £71 16s. 9d.; there was an allowance for bags, 16s. 6d., making the net amount £71 0s. 3d.—a cheque was drawn for this and I signed it—it has been paid—I took the rubber to my place, where it was seen by Mr. Mason—I sold it to him at 2s. a lb.—it was sent to Salford—I saw the police on March 18th—I had a conversation with them—I did not see the Castles between that time and the following Wednesday—I have a telephone at my place—on Wednesday, the 22nd, Sergeant Helden came—I spoke on the telephone to young Castle—Helden heard what I said and what he said—I said to young Castle,</p>

Can you meet me anywhere? but it is not safe for you to come here or me to your place"—Paros said, "Well, what do you want?"—Castle said, "I want to arrange everything in order"—Paros said, "Where shall I come to? the White Swan, Commercial Road; that is near to your place"—Castle said, "No, that is too near"—Paros said, "Where then?"—Castle said, "The Three Nuns at Aldgate, in the bar-room down the passage; what time will you be there?"—Paros said, "11 o'clock"—Castle said, "That is too late; make it earlier"—Paros said, "All right, half-past ten"—during that time Castle was speaking to someone else; I do not know who that was—the same day I went to Castles' place and saw Castle, senior; he was with his other son, William—said to him that his son had been arrested for stealing and receiving £600 worth of india-rubber—he turned round to his son William and said, "They have pinched Arthur," and to me he said, "Arrested Arthur? you cannot do that; he is my son, and only works for me. Why, he knows nothing about any rubber; we have not got any, and <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> had any for some months now; come into the office"—I went into the office with him—I said to him, "Have you bought any raw india-rubber during</p>

Gale had been here. How do you account for this entry 'Sold to Paros'?"—he said, "That was only inner tubes and best rubber for solution"—I said, "Was there any raw rubber among that lot?"—to said, 'Well, there might have been 1 cwt."—I said, 'Not more?"—he said, "Perhaps 2 cwts."—I said, "Or more?"—his son said, 'Or less," and then Castle said, 'It was all inner tubes, the best floating rubber; it would be an impossibility for me to say how much raw rubber there was or was not"—he said he had bought some from Nash, of Brentford, and had been saving it up for a month or six weeks—I searched the book and found this entry, "Bought 20 lbs. from Nash, of Brentford," on March 21st, 1905, but failed to find any entry during the previous month or six weeks of the purchase of any raw rubber—he said, "Well, it came during the last six weeks"—on March 23rd I arrested Castle, senior, outside the Police Court at 10.45 a.m., where he had come to see his son, who was being brought up—I said to him, "I shall arrest you for being concerned with you son in stealing and receiving £600 worth of rubber"—he said, "I am here waiting for you"—when charged he said, "I am perfectly innocent of this charge."</p>

I called on Paros on March 18th and left this police notice as to the stolen rubber with him; it refers to twenty-two bales and mentions marks and the qualities of the rubber: Birgin, which should be Virgin, Matagrossa and Manga Beira—he did not understand what it meant and I told him it was pure rubber—he said he had not bought any—he asked me what the weight would be, and I said about 30 cwts.—that was of the twenty-two bales—I did not see Mrs. Paros at all—I next saw Paros on March 21st, the same day as I went to the Ken<lb/>sington Rubber Company—I went to the company between 3 and 4 p.m—I was shown eight bags, but not then—there were old marks upon them—they were really composed of old bags that had been cut up and then sewn together again—I saw Mr. Tomlinson and Mr. Rath there and afterwards went to Paros'—I told him that I had traced rubber to him through the Kensington Rubber Company—I did not take a statement from him on that day—I only saw him on that day about 10 p.m. or it might have been after 10—it was at his shop—he did not go to the station that night—the next morning I had a conversation with him—I did not make a note of it at the time—no statement of his was put into writing until he came to the police station; that was about 7 p.m. on the 22nd—I took the statement partly, but the whole of it was made in my presence [<hi rend="italic">Paros' statement was then read</hi>]—in that statement there is nothing about a further purchase on the 16th—Paros mentioned that Mrs. Paros had had a conversation with Castle, junior, on the Sunday, as she said, and she was then sent for—about a week after I found out that he had sold raw rubber to Mr. Mason—we had not received verbal information from anybody that Paros had received more rubber than he acknowledged, but in a book at Castles' I found an entry as to rubber sold on March 15th—it is not entered to Paros—that is the information upon which I questioned Paros on the 27th; he then produced the invoice for that.</p>

I live at 57, William Street, Stratford, and am foreman to Arthur Castle—I have been with him for four and a half years—all rubber which comes to his premises is sorted by sorters into bags and then stacked—the bags are tabbed with the grade of rubber—I have occasionally found in the rubber that comes pieces of raw rubber, never any large quantity—the Commercial Road entrance is where the rubber comes in and goes out—if by chance it goes to the rag depart<lb/>ment at the back it is brought round, but it is hardly possible for it to go there—I indistinctly remember Monday, March 13th—I was at work in the usual way then, because I have never been absent—no large con<lb/>signmen t of raw rubber could have arrived on that day without my know<lb/>ing it—I see everything that comes in—no such quantity as a ton or thereabouts ever arrived—when rubber goes out of our premises it is weighed, and the purchaser stands by the weighing machine—the buyer always makes a slit in the bag to see what the contents are—I do not remember Paros taking away two loads on March 14th and 16th—it is an every-day occurrence, loads going away—I was there when the police came on the 22nd and searched for rubber—I should think we had</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cattle dealer, carrying on business at Bingham, Norfolk—I and the prisoner were married in 1890 and lived together in London and elsewhere until July, 1904—our marriage was not a very happy one all the time—finally she left me in July, and I did not see her again until the morning of May 30th—between the time of her leaving and my seeing her again I had some written communication from her; one when she was in Paris—I knew that she was living at 6, North Terrace, Kensington, with a niece of hers of about twenty-five—</p>

I have not seen you for a long time"—she said, "You had better take yourself off"—I then saw a revolver come by her side in her right hand—I stepped back and was going to close the door when she fired, the bullet catching me in my leg just about my knee—I stepped back very nearly a yard; I was at the bottom of the stairs with the door open—I recognised her voice and saw her face, and she saw mine—I was going to lock the door when I found there was not a key—my wife still kept upstairs and I held the door—I looked round to see if there was any other way where she could come in and I went and fastened the area door to keep her from coming in that way—then after she heard me moving about she went to a window which, I think, was on the first or second floor, and I heard her blow a policeman's whistle—I heard a cab come up and I recognised my wife's voice saying, "Go for a policeman"—a policeman came up a few minutes afterwards—I went up the area step when I heard the cab come up and met a policeman, to whom I made a complaint—he went to the front door and went in and got the revolver—he asked me to come with him—I did not see the re<lb/>volver until we got to the police station—I did not go to the hospital, the doctor came to the station—I did not see my wife brought out in custody, but I saw her at the station rather more than a quarter of an hour after-wards, when she was charged with shooting me—my wound is now healed and I am quite well again; I was not ill at all.</p>

I am living with my aunt, the prisoner, at 6, North Terrace—previous to this she had been ill for some days, and I was sleeping in her room—on this night I went upstairs to get her some eau de Cologne—I heard some one opening the window downstairs, and I went and told my aunt—we went downstairs, she taking her revolver—when we got into the hall she said, "You take the whistle and call for help while I protect myself"—I went upstairs and whistled out of my bedroom window—I attracted the attention of a cabman, who brought a policeman—before I had gone upstairs that night I had fastened the area door—the gate had not been opened for some days, and I think it was locked, but I cannot say—the next morning I saw the window was opened at the top—I did not see any marks on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Greenslade &amp; Co., 7, Philpot Lane, tea and coffee merchants—we first commenced transactions with the prisoner in January last; he then desired goods upon credit—we declined to give him credit—he purchased £25 worth of tea, which he paid for on delivery by cheque, which was honoured, and the goods were delivered in the Mile End Road—he again asked us for credit, having taken premises in Aldgate Avenue, of which he said he had a lease—we asked him for the name of the landlord that we might en<lb/>quire if he had received satisfactory references—he promised to supply references, but the next day we received this letter from 197, Mile End Road, dated January 21st, 1905, from him [<hi rend="italic">Stating that he could not do business on the lines referred to by the witness's firm, and objected to their audacity in asking for the references they had asked for</hi>]—we heard from him again on April 13th or 14th on the telephone—he said he was very sorry he had written us that letter; that he had been unable to obtain any tea equal to that which we had supplied him with in January, and asked if we would supply him for cash—we agreed to that, and promised to send a traveller—the place of business was closed when our traveler called, and he left a card on April 15th—the next morning the prisoner telephoned to me, ordering tea to the value of £34 or £35, for which he paid on delivery by a cheque which was met—the following Tuesday, April 18th, he telephoned that he wanted some coffee, as the Passover was coming on, and stating that he would call the following morning and select some—the next morning, April 19th, he called, and, having selected some coffee, he said he wanted some more tea—he ordered coffee to the value of £30 and tea to the value of £70 at the same time, and to be de<lb/>livered on Saturday, April 22nd—I saw the goods taken to be delivered at Aldgate Avenue—then he told me that he had received unexpectedly some coffee from the country and would not require ours—I deducted the value of the coffee from the invoice, and he then wrote me a cheque for £70 Us., and the goods were delivered—I would not have left the goods without the cheque, which I took to the Bank on the Saturday before Easter, thinking the money was there to meet it—the following Tuesday the prisoner called at our premises about 11.30 a.m. and said he</p>

               <p>had been very busy in the meanwhile and wanted some more tea—he said he had collected that morning £70 out of a larger sum of £150 that be would collect, and he then ordered tea to the value of about £300—I booked the order—we did not deliver the tea, because we had a telegram about 2 o'clock that the £70 cheque was unpaid—I went down to Ald<lb/>gate Avenue at once and saw the prisoner in his office with two other men—he came out to me in the street—I told him that we had been ad<lb/>vised that the cheque was unpaid—he said, "Impossible. I have never had such a thing happen in all my business"—I said, "You had better come with me to your bank and find out what is the matter"—he said, "I am engaged just now; I will meet you at your office at 3,30"—it was then about 3 o'clock—having considered the matter for a moment, I went to the Capital and Counties Bank in Commercial Road and saw the manager—whilst I was there I saw the door close, and a moment, afterwards, when I went outside, I saw the prisoner running away—he tamed down a side street and disappeared into a passage or a house, I could not tell which—I saw him again the following Friday, April 28th—he said he could not pay the money at his office—I had been trying to find him in the interim, but could not—I went to his office several times when it was closed—on the 28th he said he had not any money, and that he would try and see if he could borrow some—we have never been paid for those goods—this is the cheque for £70 11s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a produce merchant at 155, Fenchurch Street—I did business with Schneider in February last—the terms at the beginning were cash against the delivery order, and afterwards half cash and half in fourteen days—I have had about twenty transactions with him—early in April a cheque for £20 came back—at that time about £40 was owing, and he received goods against a cheque, which made it over £60—I talked to him about the cheque, and he said he would pay in money; he wanted more goods and said he would pay me in the course of a day or two, so I went round several times to see him, but could not, and I would not do any more business unless I had cash or a noted cheque—he telephoned to say his brother was on the way to my place with the money—on April 20th I left for the Continent, leaving certain instructions—I came back from Italy on May 6th—I have not been paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The amount of the twenty transactions was about £260—they were not satisfactory, because the prisoner did not keep to his agreement—about £200 was paid—his father is a grocer at 405, Turner Street, Commercial Road—I did not know him till I went to him about his son's debt, because the son mentioned so many times about his father—I was accompanied by Mr. McMeakin, the manager of Albers &amp; Co.—I asked the father if he would be responsible for his son's debt—I did not directly ask him to pay it—I did not say, "I shall prosecute your son unless you pay his debt"—I went to obtain a settlement—he said he could not be responsible for his son's debt—McMeakin or I did mention a Police Court—the prisoner's father did not order us both out of the place—I knew the prisoner was going to be married—I had known it for several weeks past—I believed the prisoner was a respectable man, and our firm was willing to go on, provided the business was conducted in a proper</p>

               <p>different customers' accounts—one of the accounts was Newman's—I cannot point out from memory which were the particular items I passed—there were entries in the Day Book which were read out to me, which I did not find in the Ledger, but I signified to Coleman that they were there when they were not—there was another method by which credits were entered in the Sold Ledger which did not appear in the Cash Book, and which, in fact, had never been paid—I think that was a joint idea between Jenn and myself—it followed on the other fraud—one stopped when the other commenced—the items were fictitious—in Newman's account (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on January 21st, 1905, there is a payment of £3 1s. 9d. in my writing—it was only my duty to make entries in the Ledger in Jenn's absence—someone had to do it, but in the ordinary way it was certainly not my duty—it was my duty" to make this entry—I am prepared to say that Jenn was not absent on that date—it is a fictitious entry—there is no such sum entered in the Cash Book and, as far as I know, no such sum was ever paid, but the figures would be the amount we had omitted to charge him and which was required to settle the ac<lb/>count up to that date—it had been entered in the debit side of the Sold Ledger, but omitted from the invoices sent to him—the goods repre<lb/>sented by that amount would appear on the debit side—he had not been invited to pay for them, although he had had the goods—looking at the entry of February 25th for £23 4s. 4d., I say the same with regard to that—it is another fictitious entry of the same kind made by me—I made both of them by arrangement with Jenn—the remuneration I got for doing this was a quarter of the total sum—the customer had half of the total and Jenn and I had the other half between us, so in this case, which was about £36, I got £9, and the customer would get goods to the value of £18, and Israel &amp; Joel would get nothing—I got my money through Jenn in small sums from time to time—I had not direct dealings with the customer myself—I only knew Newman's name; that is all—on April 12th the system was discovered by M. Sidford, and the same day before my arrest I made a confession—this book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was then before me and I pointed out these two items in Newman's account—I did not point out items which had been omitted on the debit side and which ought to have been there—Mr. Sidford went through the debit side himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the service of Mr. Sidford, whose special business it was to guard the interests of Israel and Joel—it did not occur to me that when it was found there was something wrong to which I had been a party, that it would be a good thing for me if I could put as much as I could upon other people—Coleman was another clerk in Mr. Sidford's office—when I gave my account less than a month ago I said that other clerks were in it besides Jenn, but only as regards some other accounts, not as regards this one—I was acting with a clerk named Gorman, but he simply knew of the transactions—he only knew of Marsh's account, which was disposed of last time—I have only spoken to Newman once; I cannot remember when; it may have been the very early part of this year—I simply said good-morning to him—I expect there are a good many people who have been to Covent Garden in the morning who I have said good</p>

               <p>morning to—I am not working for anybody now; I am in custody—I heard Gorman deny my statement—I do not know if he is still in the em<lb/>ployment—I said before, "The clerk Gorman received some of the proceeds of this fraud; we can identify one another's ticks, as different people make their ticks in different ways," and, "Gorman assisted in the frauds in Marsh's case, but had nothing to do with omissions from the Ledger, but simply knew what we were doing, therefore he had to stand in with the money"—I objected to giving Gorman's name—what I said was true; he was called as a witness and denied my statement on oath—I did not suggest that there was anything between Gorman and myself with regard to Newman's case—I have practical knowledge of the inner working of the business—the only people I know of who were authorised to receive the money were the cashiers—when I first went there Mr. John Israel was cashier in one place, and Mr. Michael Israel in the other—they were the sons—Mr. John gave it up, and an outside man took his place—I knew nobody else except the new man who received money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an incorporated accountant, practising g at New Court, Carey Street—since January, 1902, I have had charge of Israel and Joel's book-keeping—it is a large business—some years previous to that I was in the office of another accountant who had charge of the books—I am thoroughly acquainted with their system of book-keeping—Clara butt described the system correctly—before I gave evidence for the first time on April 26th I prepared copies of the Ledger accounts showing what the alleged falsifications were—among others, I prepared Exhibit 3, relating to Newman's account—it shows in black ink the credit entries in the ledger for which I find entries in the cash book and counterfoil receipts—for the two credit entries in red ink I find no entry in the cash book and no counterfoil receipts; those amount to £36 6s. 1d.—since New-man's arrest a number of documents have been produced; among them I find no invoice or receipt for those two items—among these documents there are none relating to 1905 at all, although there is, in fact, a genuine</p>

               <p>payment for which I find the counterfoil receipt and an entry in the cash books on March 30th—it is for £19 17s. 3d.—there was not even a receipt found for that—among, the documents put in at the Police Court there was a certified copy of Newman's banking account from September 21st, 1904, until May 6th—looking at Exhibit 3, the first payment is on October 20th, which is a cheque for £22 8s. 6d.—I found an entry in the cash book, but I do not know about a receipt—turning to the banking account for October 21st, I find Newman's account debited with that exact sum—the next genuine item of November 18th is only for empties for which there is a receipt, then the next one is December 15th, which is a cheque for £5 3s. 6d.—I cannot recollect if I found a receipt for that among the documents handed in—I find that amount in the banking account on December 16th—I now come to the fictitious entries of January 21st and February 25th; there are no receipts and no entry in the banking account at all—then I come to the next genuine entry, £19 17s. 3d. on March 30th—I find that in the banking account under the date of March 31st—I find on the second page of Exhibit 3 that there were a number of sale notes which had corresponding entries in the Day Book, but that no entries of those entries to Newman's account were made in the Ledger—they are shown in red ink—they were goods entered in the Day Book as supplied, but omitted from the Sold Ledger, and I find corresponding sale notes from which the Day Book would be made up—assuming that they were correct, it would show he had had the goods, but when the Sold Ledger was made up he is not charged with them—in making up this page of my account, what I have done is that where there is a fraudulent omission I have put in the genuine item in red ink and the fraudulent one in black ink—I have the Sale Book for the genuine items; they have been paid—the goods entered in black ink are the only ones which have been paid for on those dates—the goods with which he has not been charged, but which are debited in the ledger are marked in red ink—the total amount of the false entries is £36 6s. 1d., the amount of the omissions is £106 5s. 10d., the total being £142 11s. 11d.</p>

I do not know the handwriting of all the people who give receipts—the counterfoil may be made up of cash only, or of cash and empties—if goods are paid for by cash the money could not be intercepted, as the things a man buys must be entered up—if he paid cash it would not be put in the Ledger at all—it would be in the cash column of the Day Book—it could not be inter<lb/>cepted without its being known in the office and to me—I remember swearing an information on April 19th—some items in Exhibit 3 are for small accounts—on March 19th there were two hampers of broccoli, £2 5s., £2 14s. for cucumbers, and 4s. 6d. for two bag tops—that is turnip tops—goods are purchased every day, but three days in the week are market days, when they are specially busy—if a man had received money paid by a customer and put it in his own pocket and entered the credit for that amount, it would appear as though the money had been paid on that day, but that would be a cash sale, and the ticket would have to be extended, which is not done—we check the items in the Rough Ledger—the auditor would not have discovered that these entries were fictitious, because they were put in behind us, and after we had checked the ledger to a point—the checking was done by one of my clerks, who would know the method; the auditor was taken in—if he had any idea that Clarabutt was dishonest he would have gone back and checked it again, but, being ticked, he assumed it was all right.</p>

He is all right"—I understood he meant that Wacher would dispose of anything he could—I did not know Wacher before—I said to Barnes, "Tell him to go to the Mulberry Tree, Mulberry Street, Commercial Road"—I said I would follow—he went after Wacher and I went to the Mulberry Tree—I went inside and saw the prisoners, the cart being outside, unattended—up to that time I had said nothing about sending a telegram—Barnes said, "Can you find a buyer?"—I said, "I know a buyer from the West End; he has got a stable and I will go and send a wire away to the stable"—Wacher heard that—he did not say anything—Barnes said, "Come along and wire away," and I said I would—Barnes and I went to the Eastbourne Street Post Office and I asked him to wait while I sent the wire to the stable—I sent a wire to Chief Inspector Fox, of New Scotland Yard—this telegram (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is in my writing—I returned to the Mulberry Tree with Barnes and said to both of them, "The buyer will be here very shortly"—the police came about twenty minutes afterwards and took us all into custody.</p>

I answered no questions whatever, was therefore put into a cell until next morning and charged. The statement being read out, I contradicted it, but no notice was taken, sir. This statement that is supposed to have been written by me is a downright falsehood. It is a statement not very cleverly made by the witness Horsehair and his confederates. I therefore say that I contradict all statements supposed to have been written by me unless they are signed with my signature. Sir, I am not at all surprised at Horsehair Michaels having bad intention towards me, as he told me he would do me a turn some day at which I took no notice of at the time being.

I am divisional surgeon, and on June 5th I was called to Clapham police station about 6.15 p.m., where I saw Joel—he was In rather an exhausted state and suffering considerable pain—he appeared to have been engaged in a serious struggle—I examined him and found on his head, behind his right ear, a big swelling—in my opinion such an injury could have been caused by a kick or a blow of some sort—I put him on the sick list, where he is still—I think he will be likely to resume duty in a day or two, but you can never tell in</p>

               <p>and the man who had called "Jack" said, "Let it go," and a shot was fired from the opposite side by one of the six or seven—there were four shots altogether, the second bringing John to the ground—we all ran across the road at them, and my husband caught one—one of them then pointed a revolver at his face and I screamed—my husband then got behind the lamp post for protection—the man then shot and hit the lamp post, cutting my husband's face and grazing his coat at the shoulder—the men then ran away and the policeman came up—the prisoner ran away with the others.</p>

I live at 6, Granby Street, Bethnal Green, and I walk out with the prisoner—on the evening of May 27th I went out with him between 9.30 and 10 up Shoreditch—we went into the Lord Nelson, the White Hart and the Van Tromp—from the Van Tromp we went home to 6, Granby Street—on getting home I found at the door my mother and father, the prisoner's mother, Mr. Maney, Nell Kemp, and Mr. and Mrs. Welsh—Mr. and Mrs. Welsh were quarrelling and the prisoner tried to stop it and persuaded them to go in—we got to Granby Street between five and ten minutes past 12; I did not notice the exact time—from the time I had been out with him he had never been out of my sight I do not know where Ducal Street is—we were not in any street where shots were fired.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 15, Sarah Street, Tidal Basin—about 11.40 p.m. on May 26th I was in Sarah Street—I was quite sober—the prisoner, who was with two or three other men, came up and hit me on the side of my face—he then got hold of my throat and they threw me to the ground and rifled my pockets—the prisoner put his handker<lb/>chief over my mouth to prevent my calling out—there was 4s. 3d. in money in my pocket, which they took, and some loose tobacco—a constable then came up—I saw the prisoner again next morning at 4 a.m. and identified him from eight other men—there was one other coloured man there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the inspector that the man who robbed me was a man of colour—I was a little confused when I identified him because I had just been <hi rend="italic">woke</hi> up out of bed—the police station is about thirty or forty yards from where I was in bed—I hesitated about half a minute; I would not tie myself to a minute; I hesitated a minute or two till I was sure of my man—I knew the prisoner before, and when he assaulted me I asked him what I had done to him—I told the police sergeant that—they never asked me at the Police Court about that—the prisoner was in front of me when he caught me by the throat—I do not know whether he came up from the front of me—I never knew his name, but I had pre<lb/>viously seen him in a football club at the Old Britannia.</p>

               <p>

               <p>all three men fell together—I started to run directly they ran—I did not see the prisoner's face when he started to run—there are a good many black men in the neighbourhood—I have not taken particular notice whether a good many of them wear white handkerchiefs—one black man is not like another—Sarah Street is about 500 yards from the police station—the street where this assault occurred was lit by incandescent light—I was about fifty feet away when I first saw them—I ran about 200 yards after them, when I lost sight of them—their backs were turned towards me during that time—when I fetched the prosecutor at 4 a.m. to identify the prisoner he seemed flurried—I cannot say how long he hesitated before identifying the prisoner—it may have been two minutes or just over a minute, or three minutes, as I said at the Police Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had seen the prisoner about twenty minutes before the assault—I passed him in Victoria Dock Road with another man—he lives in the neighbourhood, some distance from where I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 128, Caistor Park Road, and am a gas stoker—I had been out of employment about six weeks before May 30th and am still—previously I had been in regular employment—the prisoner's wife is my sister—on May 30th, about 11.45 p.m., I was passing the prisoner's house, quite sober—I saw my sister outside—I spoke to her—in consequence of what she said I knocked at the door—the prisoner opened the door—I said, "What's the matter now, Charlie?" as we were walking through the passage, he showed me a baker's bill and said, "This is all right again, <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> it?"—I said, "Charlie, don't be a fool; let Emily in—we talked in a perfectly friendly way—he started talking about this 4s. baker's bill again—I said, "Let her in; if I had come to pick a row with you, Charlie, I should have had one on Saturday night when I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the row"—he said, "I suppose I thought your blood was boiling the same as mine," and I thought he was going to the door to let her in, but he shut the kitchen door and went to the drawer, got a hammer, and hit me with it—I felt blood on my head—I had been sitting in a chair—he was about a yard and a half from the drawer before he went and opened it—I was sitting with my back to him, leaning towards the table—I know he struck me twice, but I be<lb/>came unconscious—I came to my senses and was going towards the street door when he put his foot behind me, and shoved me in the road—my head was bleeding—I went to a police constable and gave information</p>

Why can't you let her come in? My blood boiled when you banged her on Saturday. Don't let her be out there. Don't be so foolish"—with that the prisoner got the hammer and dealt the blow—there had been a wrangle and a struggle before, but my husband would not allow me to come down—after I left the kitchen I looked through the kitchen window and saw the prisoner deal another blow and I undid the door and handed the baby to a boy, and I was called away—the prisoner said we would have to clear out after I had given evidence—I heard him say it to his wife, as I swore his life away—we owed three weeks' rent.</p>

I am a retired scale maker, and live at Laurie Grove, New Cross—the deceased was my brother; he was fifty-six years old—my father died on December 9th, 1902—up to that time my brother had a remittance of £2 a week from him—he used to go out with a barrow with fruit, and then with an organ, but not for twelve months before my father's death—he has always been bad with rheu<lb/>matism—on my father's death my brother became entitled to £1,000 in Indian Consols and £180 in notes—he was very bad on his feet with rheumatism—he very often went away to the infirmary—he had not got a club foot—I last saw him about twelve months back, when he lived at Florence Road—he was then in bed, and was wheeled about in a bath chair—the prisoner was with him then—they had been living together for about twelve months when he came into his legacy—I cannot say if they had been living together before that—I saw my brother's body at the infirmary.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190506260148"/>
               <p>and take them to the station for me, and I will get them when I come down. Please will you take the dear little kitten and keep it for me? Give my love to all at home. Hope you are quite well. God knows how I shall get on if I cannot come down on Monday. I shall be up at Greenwich Police Court on Tuesday, the 6th. This is all this time. From yours, broken hearted, Hannah Holland."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been working for the couple since last Sep<lb/>tember—they never quarrelled when I was there—I was there every morning, <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> Wednesdays, when I sometimes did not go—only two rooms downstairs are occupied—the deceased could not get upstairs—there was not very much work to do—I helped in the charring because of the deceased's habits—they both drank very heavily indeed—on the Friday she looked as if she had not been to bed all night—I did not see the deceased on Friday at all—I cannot say if the prisoner was responsible for her actions on the Friday—she asked me to come on the Saturday morning; she was <hi rend="italic">muddly</hi> then—I never saw her use a poker—I cannot say if she was likely to use one—I have seen them quarrel, but never seen blows struck—I have found things broken in the morning, but they have always said it was an accident—their craving for drink was so strong that one day I was sent out to pawn sheets for half-a-crown—I did not go into the bedroom with the sovereign which I got in change for the 30s. order—when the deceased said the business would be settled to-morrow, he meant that money would be put into the bank for them to draw—the pot of ale and the quartern of whisky was not consumed while I was there—my husband was not there that day—the deceased had very dirty habits, and was a very trying man—I know it, because I used to do the washing—the things were in a dreadful condition—when the prisoner was out of drink there was not a better woman—the deceased never allowed her out; I think she loved him in her way—in his aggra<lb/>vating ways she may have struck him—he would never allow her to go away—she had to fill his pipe or do something—I think he drank more than she did—on Saturday morning she was agitated—when I left on the Friday I did not think anything was going to happen—I thought she was going to lie down—I know the step from the scullery—it is a pretty big drop—I daresay it is 16 inches high—there is a sink there and a brick wall—whenever I saw a mark on the deceased's forehead he always said he had had a fall—I do not think he said that because the woman had done it—I thought it was always the truth when he said it—I have not seen the deceased fall down when he was intoxicated, but he was very tottery on his feet—when they were in drink it would be a very wretched and miserable life for the prisoner—I thought she was married to him—I know that they were in receipt of this money from the deceased's father, and I know now that the prisoner will not have any of it, but I did not know it before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I should think the deceased had last been able to walk across the road about a month before his death—when I say he was ag<lb/>gravating I was referring to his dirty habits, and he was always demanding her to be in his sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of la, Blissit Street, Greenwich, but I do not sleep there—my hours are from 8.30 a.m. to 10 p.m.—I have heard sounds coming from No. 1, where the prisoner lived with the deceased—I have heard rowing and upsettings and similar noises and bangs against the wall adjoining my place—it is the bedroom which is next to my place, and there is a 9-inch wall between them—on Wednesday, May 24th, I heard nothing until night time, when I was about to close, when I went to my door and stayed outside their bedroom window and heard the prisoner delivering blows or smacks to the de<lb/>ceased, who, I presume, was lying on the bed—I saw the shadow of her hand upon the blind coming down—I could also see the figure which was that of a woman—I heard the prisoner say, "Now who is the best?" on the delivery of each smack, and the deceased would answer, "You are, Han<lb/>nah! you are!"—when I saw the shadow of the arm come down I heard each smack—I should say there were ten or a dozen blows dealt in that manner and the same question put and the same answer, the prisoner giving a volley of abusive language—about three or four minutes after-wards I heard a smashing of glass and china, I believe in the same room, and I saw the prisoner come to the door, look each way into the street, but I did not hear any more that night—I then started closing—I had to pass their place to go home—my puppy dog ran into their front room under the table, and I passed the prisoner, who was on the doorstep and went under the table on my hands and knees to fetch him out—I said "Good-night" to her, but she did not reply, and I went home—I did not notice anything about her appearance—on Thursday, the 25th, I heard nothing of any account, but on Friday, the 26th, the rows commenced about dinner time at 1 or 1.30. and continued to 5 or 5.30—each row would last ten or fifteen minutes—I frequently heard the deceased say, "Oh! Hannah, don't!" and on one or two occasions, "For God's sake, don't!"—between 5 and 5.30 I heard something drop which sounded something like fire irons—I cannot say if it was—everything went quiet from that time until 9 p.m., when the prisoner came to my door and spoke to my boy—she spoke soberly enough—there was nothing to sug<lb/>gest that she was under the influence of drink—she gave my boy a bottle of ginger beer, and I did not see any more of her—I closed in the usual way and went home—I remember seeing a postman that night, and he passed a remark to me—I next saw the prisoner on the Saturday morning, about 9, standing on her doorstep with a walking-out coat on and no hat—she did not speak to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the Friday the original row commenced about 1 or 1.30, but it was nothing of any account until 3—I have not the slightest animosity against the prisoner—I have borrowed money from the deceased, but the prisoner has not asked me to repay it—I have a clear recollection of what took place—it was on the Wednesday that the dog ran into the prisoner's house—I am absolutely certain it was on the Wednesday night—I saw quite clearly what took place by the shadows on the blind—I did not only see the shadow of the arm; I saw the figure as well—I distinctly saw the action and the hand—I did not see</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190506260150"/>
               <p>a poker in it—there was nothing in the hand—I should certainly have seen it if there had been—I did not think the prisoner was doing the deceased any bodily harm—I did not place any importance on the rows, because they have been rowing ever since they came, and I have grown used to them—I think they drank far more than they ought to, and were more often than not the worse for drink—I do not suppose that I went into the house more than half a dozen times—I know nothing of the deceased's dirty habits—I did not interfere, because the police, I believe, already knew the rows were continued there every night after I had shut my shop, therefore, I did not deem it my duty to interfere—I did not think the man was being killed—if I had I should have interfered—two months previously I went and interfered, and got abused and told to mind my own business—when the fire irons dropped I did not think it was more than an ordinary row—it is possible that they were in a drunken condition and fell against the tongs—it is not a large room, and if the fire-tongs or poker had been set up against the chair or wall they could have knocked them down and caused the sound that I heard—the bed is large, and if anybody were intoxicated I think they would have a job to get past it without knocking anything down which was standing up—I did not hear a blow on the deceased's head with a poker—when I saw the prisoner on the doorstep she appeared sober to me—she frequently stood on the doorstep—I got my dog out from the kitchen, not the bedroom—I heard the deceased man speak then—it was about 10.20 p.m.—the deceased called, "Come on, Hannah"—he was not unconscious then—I was not frightened to go in—when I saw the prisoner outside the house I did not see blood or any<lb/>thing on her hands; she had got them behind her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I went in two months ago, not being used to the noises at that time, I saw the prisoner at the door and the deceased was in the bedroom—I said to the prisoner, "Is everything all right?"—she said, "Of course everything is all right; mind your own business"—when I saw the shadows on the blind, the blows seemed to fall on the deceased's chest or head, assuming that he was on the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner practis<lb/>ing at Greenwich—about 10 a.m. on May 27th I was called to 1, Blissit Street—the door was opened, but not by the prisoner, and I was shown into a bedroom—I saw a man lying dead on the bed—he had several cuts and bruises on his face—I asked the prisoner how long he had been dead, and she said, "He kissed me at either a quarter or 20 minutes to 6 and then died"—I asked her who inflicted the wounds—she said, "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it"—I asked her what with, and, pointing, I think, to her left hand which had three rings, she said, "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with these rings"—I asked her when she had done it, and she said on Tuesday night—she was more or less under the influence of drink, and seemed to me to have been drinking for some time before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a medical practitioner for nearly ten years, and six years at Greenwich—I have had a considerable amount of experience in dealing with persons of this class—the deceased's wounds were contused and somewhat lacerated—they may have been caused by falling or by a blunt instrument or by rings—I did not count them, but I believe there were two or three serious ones—I do not know if the deceased had a club foot—there was a considerable amount of dried blood round the wounds, which, in my opinion, showed that they had been caused some little time before, I think before the Friday night—some of the bruises may have been caused on the Friday night, but I think the wounds were caused before that—I cannot say if it was as far back as the Tuesday or Wednesday—I made a careful examination of them and in my opinion the wounds were not all caused at the same time—I think that one of the serious wounds might have been caused by a fall against a sink—the deceased would fall very heavily, because he seemed to be a cripple—a fall against a table would also cause one of the serious wounds—I did not make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I have never found a man who has been drinking for some years with healthy organs—if there was blood in the deceased's stomach it could have been caused by the state of his liver—the deceased's death might have been caused by a thrust from a poker, but it is improbable; or it may have been caused by falling on broken glass—the most fatal wounds were one over the frontal bone and one over the nose—I got to the house at 10.15 a.m.—I do not think blows from a clenched fist would have caused death apart from the serious wounds which might have been caused by a fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 3, Bemerton Street, Caledonian Road—on May 14th, at 11.30 p.m., I was in the London Road—I arrived at the Obelisk at the other side of the water—Jones came up to me and said, "Johnny, how are you getting on?"—I said, "Very well; I thought I might have seen you at dinner time"—I knew him—I walked out of my way 100 yards to walk with him—we were talking nice and civilly and as friends, and all at once he put his hands round my neck while Hewson, who came up, put his hands into my trouser pocket and took out 5s.—Hewson punched me right and left and Jones said, "You go home"—the man who was with me, Bristling, I left there; I walked away to Bemerton Street—I did not go for the police, because I was half dazed and quite surprised—I walked to King's Cross, which is about three miles away—next morning I saw Hewson smoking a cigarette on the kerb—he looked at me and I explained to a policeman what the case was—I knew Hewson before—the policeman told me to go to Kennington Road police station, where they directed me to go to Stone's End, where they sent a policeman out with me to where the robbery was committed—they then sent me to Kennington Road station, and afterwards appre<lb/>hended both the prisoners—when they accosted me I was behaving in a perfectly orderly manner—I am perfectly sure that it was Hewson who rifled my pocket, and that Jones held me so that I could not move—since New Year's day I have been a carman, and at the present time I hold a good character.</p>

               <p>occurred was the Alfred's Head—I stayed there until turning-out time—Jones did not interfere with a fight which I was having; he got in between me and Hewson afterwards and said, "Now you go home"—it was not because I was drunk that he suggested that I should go home; he did not want me to get at Hewson—I was quite sober—I had been in about three public-houses between 1 and 3, and about the same number between 6 and 11—after the assault I must have passed a great many police officers—all the public-houses close at 11 p.m. as far as I know—Jones stopped Hewson from punching me—Hewson and I were not fighting after we had been in the public-house—I had not got my coat off, and several people were not standing round; there were several people round about the public-house—Jones did not come through the crowd and push Hewson one way and me another—I have been in a lunatic asylum once, but I am now almost as sensible as an educated gentleman—I hold up to the proper thing; anything cowardly I put down—I was doing a sentence of eighteen months, and was transferred from the prison to the asylum—I was very violent to a warder; I was not then in my right senses—I was undergoing three years' penal servitude—that is not the last time I have been under detention—I broke Harvey &amp; Thompson's shop window, but I did not intend to steal—I was taken to the South London Sessions and was sentenced to eighteen months' hard labour—I served ten months and eight in an asylum—Bristling is not here to-day; I went and saw him, but I went with the detective; I could not find him.</p>

I do not know a man named Bennett at all; I should like to see the man"—he was then taken to Kennington Lane police station, and on the way said, "This is what comes of being with such people"—at the station he was detained—Bennett came in and Hewson said, "I know that man now; what does Jones say about it?"—I ex<lb/>plained to him what Jones had previously said, and Hewson said, "I am not going to be <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> into this for him; it is quite true I <hi rend="italic">went down</hi> the man for 3d. and gave it to Harry, and he said he would give it back I was drunk and had none of the money.

You know I would not do you any harm. I never robbed you. It was the other man, and you know I tried to pall you away."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot dealer, of 157, Whitechapel Road, and several other branches, and I live at 156, Waterloo Road—in Novem<lb/>ber, 1903, I opened a new branch at 88, High Street, Deptford, and engaged the prisoner as manager at 30s. a week free rent, and gas—he is a married man, and lived on the premises with his wife—with the excep<lb/>tion of a by outside he was the only man—during the busy time on Saturdays, about 4 or 5 p.m., I had an extra man—between November, 1903, and November, 1904, there were the following difference on stock-takings: on January 5th there was a difference of 6s. on stock of £411; on April 12th, there was a difference of 5s. on stock of £453; on August 11th there was a difference of £9 10s. on stock of £475; and on November 29th there was a difference of £1 10s. on stock of £467—we usually have a guarantee of some kind with a manager, end the pri<lb/>soner arranged that he would pay me 5s. a week as a guarantee fund for any shortage in stock—these small deficiencies were made up out of the guarantee fund—the prisoner had on ordinary stock bock and a sales</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190506260156"/>
               <p>were correct—he said, "I have gone all through them a second time and found them perfectly correct"—we went through the stock a second time, with exactly the same result—I sent for the manager of one of my other businesses and said to the prisoner, "I will give the shop in charge of somebody else"—I dismissed him summarily—he said, "I have no place to go to," and I said, "You cannot stop here under these conditions"—he asked for no salary—"Well," he said, "I will go and try and find someone to take my furniture away as soon as possible"—he came back after a little while and said he would fetch his furniture at 7—I com<lb/>municated with the police, and when he returned about 7.30 I asked him in the presence of the police officer if he could account for the deficiency in the stock—he said, "I cannot account for it at all, only that I have lost five pairs of boots from the outside"—I said, "Were the goods correct to invoice?"—he said, "Yes"—I then gave him into custody—I have looked through all these railway receipts (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and where "Mayhew" appears it is either in the prisoner's or his wife's writing.
