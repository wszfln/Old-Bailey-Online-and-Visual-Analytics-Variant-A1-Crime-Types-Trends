               <p>William Brown thus depos'd: I having two Guineas to pay for Excise, I ty'd it up in a Silk Handkerchief, and sent it by my Daughter Ann Brown, a Child about 10 Years old.

A Fellow being afterward, seen in such a Jacket, (which was distinguishable by three odd Buttons) he was apprehended, and upon Examination it appear'd that he was the Prisoner's Brother, and that not himself but the Prisoner had that Jacket on when the Girl lost the Money. By his Directions we found the Prisoner at the House of

            , the Cherry-Tree in Golden-Lane. This is the Handkerchief that I ty'd the Money in when I gave it to the Girl, and this same Handkerchief I found about the Prisoner's Neck when he was taken. He confess'd that he met with it near Bishopsgate, and from thence immediately ran through Devonshire-Square into Still-Alley, and there untying it, he found two Guineas in it. He is a Fellow of an ill Character, and has not been long out of New-Prison.</p>

             thus depos'd: As I was cleaning Shoos in the Street near Bishopsgate, about Nine in the Morning, I saw the Prisoner pass by me, turn the Lappet of his Jacket aside, thrust a colour'd Handkerchief into his Breeches Pocket, and run down Hounsditch; and presently after I heard the Child Ann Brown crying for the Loss of her Money. Ann Brown deposed, that she lost the Money under Bishopsgate.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence: As I was going along Bishopsgate-street, over against the Church, I happen'd to see this Handkerchief lying upon the Ground; so I took it up, and holding it in my Hand, Who has lost a Handkerchief? says I. Whereupon a Gentlewoman that sells Apples cry'd Halves. But when I open'd it, and found two Guineas in it, 'Tis all your own, young Man, says he, and much good may't do you. If the Gentlewoman was here, she'd say the same thing herself. As for my being in New-Prison, it was for no Harm, for I never did an ill thing in my Life: 'Twas only for Face-making, (that is) getting of Bastard Children. <rs id="t17250513-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

But afterwards he confess'd that he wrenched aside the Shutters of Walker's Shop, and pull'd them out with a Hook. They were carry'd before the Justice: Their Confession was drawn up, and Sperry was going to sign it; but Harvey pull'd him away, with a G - D - ye for a Fool!

Then I went to the Mint to see for this Whore, and there I understood that she was removed to fresh Quarters in Drury-Lane. The Prisoner was afterwards taken at the Swan in Leadenhall-Street . He confess'd he had pawn'd the two Mugs and six Spoons at the White Hart and Anchor in Barbican, where they were found. The Tumbler and the other three Spoon he presented to Madam.

             was my Lodger, and the Prisoner having some Acquaintance with her, came to see her now and then; and so it fell out that she came one Day when I was attending the Child; and the Child was a little cross vixen Thing, and it had befoul'd itself lamentationly: So, says the Prisoner to me, Mother Benson, says she, you look as if you was very weary and sleepy: I would have you go and take a Nap, and lay the Child by you, and I will wash its Things the while. And so I went; but when I waked, and found that this wicked Jade was gone, and my Cloaths were gone too, it put me into a strange Confirmation, for I never respected she would a' served me so. The next Witness deposed to this Effect: My Name is Mary Lee; and tho' I say it, there is never a Woman in the Parish that takes more Care for an Honest Livelihood than myself. I turn my Hand to any Thing to get a Penny: Sometimes I sell Things in Leadenhall Market; and sometimes I do an odd Char at one House, and sometimes at another. We Market-Women are up early and late, and work hard for what we have. We stand all Weathers, and go thro' thick and thin. It is well known, that I was never the Woman that spared my Carcass; and if I spend three Farthings now and then, it is nothing but what is my own. I get it honestly, and I do not care who knows it; for if it was not for something to cheer the Spirits between whiles, and keep out the Wet and Cold; alackaday! it would never do: We should never be able to hold it; we should never go thro' stich with it, so as to keep Body and Soul together. But as for this Jenny Johnson the Prisoner, she coming sometimes for a Quartern to the same Shops that I made use of, we now and then had a Dish of Chat together, and so we became pretty well acquainted; whereof she came to see me two or three Times; and of all the Times in the World, she happened to come that Day as my Landlady lost her Things. Now after that, she comes to me at a certain Place, and there we had two or three Quarterns of such simple Stuff as we poor Souls are glad to drink. And from thence we went to another Friend's House, and there truly she would needs treat me with a Quartern of right French Brandy; whereof I wondred at it, because we had had but a very indifferent Market that Day. Oh! says she, I do not want for money; I have got above a Crown in my Pocket; and so we went to another Friend's House, and another, and another to that; and so by way of Discourse about this, and that, and t'other; and a Talking about my Landlady, and how she lost her Things, and all that; Why, says Jenny, says she, as for your Landlady's three Mobs and a Handkerchief, I sold them all for a Shilling.

             thus deposed: I live in the Meuse: I had been in the Temple to receive a little Money, and afterwards staid there drinking till One or Two in the Morning; at which time, being pretty well in for it, I came away; and as I was going along the Strand, I overtook three Soldiers. They jostled me as I pass'd by them; but I went forward without saying any Thing to them: And soon after I met the Prisoner. My Dear, says she, will you give me a Pint?

I called for a Pint of Wine; but before we had drunk it, I happened to put my Hand into my Pocket, and miss'd Half of a Guinea and some Silver. She ran down Stairs a-cross the Way, and I after her: But presently the three Soldiers came up to her Assistance. She cry'd to them, Kill the Dog, kill him. So they all drew their Bayonets, and forced me up again the Wall. Gentlemen, I hope (says I) you will not be so honourable as to kill me.</p>

             thus deposed: As I was coming by the Bottom of S. Martin's-Lane, (the Night was very dark) I heard a Slap o' the Face given, and somebody say, You have pick'd my Pocket you Bitch of Half a Guinea. Coming nearer, I discovered three Soldiers, with their Bayonets drawn, and pointed at the Prosecutor, who was forced up to the Wall. I called the Watch, and the Soldiers ran off. But the Woman endeavouring to get away too, ran against a Coach that stood in the Street, and so was taken.</p>
               <p>The Constable deposed, That when the Prisoner and Prosecutor were brought to the Watch-House, they were both confoundedly drunk. She said, if She had any more about her than 4 s. 6 d. she knew nothing of it; but in searching her Pocket, I found Half a Guinea and more Silver. The Prisoner thus made her Defence: The Prosecutor took hold of me in the Strand, and would make me go to the Tavern. I was very unwilling; but he would not let me alone, and so I went. We had three Pints of Wine. He gave me Money to lie with me, but no Gold that I know of. It is possible indeed that Half a Guinea might slip in among the Silver; but I saw none. And because I refused to comply with what he required, be charged me with picking his Pocket, which I was surprized at. However, he paid his Reckoning, went down before me, and waited at Door; and as I came out, You Bitch, says he, give me my Half Guinea. I ran away, and two or three Soldiers came up; but I knew nothing of them, for I never saw them before. The Jury <rs id="t17250513-20-verdict98" type="verdictDescription">

             thus deposed: The Prisoner was a Lodger. I lost the Goods on the Wednesday, and on the Saturday following I distributed printed Advertisements to the Goldsmiths, and Pawnbrokers. The Goods were very remarkable, exactly described, and a Reward of 20 s. offer'd. I carried one of these Bills myself to White, a Pawnbroker, in Baldwin's Gardens, who positively denied that he had any such Goods in his House; but going thither again with a Search-Warrant on the Monday following, he presently confessed that he had the Plate, and deliver'd it up; but yet in the Afternoon, he sent his Servant to demand the Reward promis'd in the Advertisement. <rs id="t17250513-22-verdict107" type="verdictDescription">

However, I came jogging after as well as I could; and about Ten o' Clock came to <placeName id="t17250513-27-crimeloc132">Holloway</placeName>

It was a Star-light Night, and I saw 'em pretty plainly, especially Tom. who had a dirty white Wastecoat: They rode towards London, and swore that I was a dead Man if I offer'd to follow them. I walk'd along as well as I could in my Boots, and enquired of some Waggoners that I met, if they saw such Men upon such a Mare? But they told me, No. I called at the Queen's-Head at Holloway, but could hear nothing of 'em; from thence I made shift to get to Mr. Grimsted's, at the Angel and Gown in Islington, where I told 'em how I was robbed, and described the Prisoners and the Mare to them; and not long after, the Boy of the House going to the Door, saw two Men coming along agreeable to my Description, and came and told us. The Prisoners stopt, hung the Mare at the Door, and came in; I would have had Mr. Grimsted have secured them; but he was unwilling to do it at that time; and so being glad that I had found the Mare again, I got upon her, and rode home, without taking any farther Notice of 'em. I am positive that Tom. was one of the Men that robb'd me, but cannot be certain that Will. was the other.</p>

             thus deposed: Between 10 and 11, Davison came to my House, told the Company that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172505130004"/> was robb'd, and described the Persons. Whether he was disordered with the Fright, or the Vexation of being robb'd, or with walking in his Boots from the Place where he lost his Money, which is about a quarter of a Mile from my House, or whether he had been drinking too much, I cannot tell; but certain it is, that not only I, but all that were in my House took him to be fuddled, and that his Mare had only thrown him, and so ran away But in less than a quarter of an Hour after, my Boy comes in and says, Here's two such Men come to the Door. with such a Mare. We went to the Door, and as soon as we saw 'em, we were of the Boy's Mind, for they answer'd the Description that Davison had given of 'em; one of them in particular was in a white dirty Wastecoat. Davison presently said, These are the Men, and this is the Mare. But then we thought that it was only a Drunken Frolick, because if these Men had taken the Mare from him, they would hardly have stopt at a House so near where the Fact was committed. Davison seeing we gave but little Credit to his Account, he got upon the Mare, and rid homewards, and the Prisoners never offer'd to prevent him. I then ask'd 'em where they got the Mare? They said, they found her astray in White Conduit-Feilds, and were going to carry her to Rolf's Pound: Upon farther Enquiry, I found that they did not come the direct Road to the Pound, but went round a Byeway, thro' Mr. Sibban's (the Cow-keeper's) Ground, which is 4 or 5 times farther about than the right Way. This made me begin to suspect'em; for I thought this was the Reason that none of the Carriers that Davison met on the Road, had seen these two Men upon the Mare; and that tho' he walk'd in his Boots, yet he came to my House sooner than they that rid it; and so I sent for a Constable. The Deposition of this Witness was corroborated by

             (the Boy) thus deposed: As I was shutting up the Windows, I saw the Prisoners coming along, one upon the Mare, and the other walking a foot. It It being the last Day of April, I ask'd 'em if they were going a Maying already? And as they came a little nigher, I thought they and the Beast were agreeable to Davison's Account of 'em; and so I ask'd 'em, where they were going with that Mare? Upon which one 'em said, Let's go and see if it's Grimsted's Mare; but the other answer'd, D - ye what need ye mind what he says? They made a little Stop, and I ran in and call'd my Master.</p>

             thus made a Defence for himself and his Brother: I and my Brother were in Union Court, opposite to S. Andrew's Church in Holborn, at half an Hour past Ten. From thence we were going to my Mother's, who lives at Lower Hollaway; and by the way, in White-Conduit-Feilds, we saw this Mare saddled, and her Bridle thrown over her Head, and ty'd to a Stile. I was afraid some Rogues had been robbing thereabouts, and so had left her there; but, says my Brothers, Don't be afraid, we'll take the Mare to Town; but we won't go the Road-way, and then we shall be in no Danger of meeting any body. So my Brother got up, and I walked behind him, till we came thro' Sibban's Ground to the Angel and Crown Ale-house. The Boy was at the Door, and ask'd whose Mare that was? And we said, we could not tell; and so he call'd several People out of the House, and one of 'em said to Davison, Is this your Mare? And he said it was. Why then, said I, I am very glad of it. Whereupon, one Mr. Kemp being there, D - this Fellow, (says Mr. Kemp) he's got drunk, and pretends that he has been robb'd, to impose upon People's Charity, and get some Money by it.</p>

            , at the Queen's-Head in Holloway, deposed, that between Nine and Ten, or there-abouts, Davison called at their House, and asked if two Men were lately come in there? for he said he had been robbed of a Mare and two Guineas. The Court, in summing up the Evidence to the Jury, observed, that it was highly improbable that Davison should tie his Mare to a Stile, and walk in his Boots at that Time of Night, so far as to the Angel and Crown, and there describe two Men, that, according to the Evidence given, it was impossible for him to have seen any where that Day, but near the Place where he said he was robbed; because it was proved that he had been out of Town ever since the Morning: And then the Prisoners came to that very House in less than a Quarter of an Hour after Davison. And tho' Davison walked it in his Boots, yet, as the Prisoners came a Bye-Way that was further about, and came but a Foot-Pace neither, (for one of them walked by the Mare's Side) it is no Wonder that Davison got there a little before them.

Thomas Bowen thus deposed: About Ten o' Clock on Monday Night, I was got confounded drunk, and was riding along Drury-Lane, and at the Corner of Russel-street I met the Prisoner and another Woman. How do you do, my Dear? says she; Won't you give us a Pint? With all my Heart, says I; and so we went to the <placeName id="t17250513-54-crimeloc265">Half-Moon Tavern</placeName>

I hung my Horse at the Door, went up Stairs with them, and call'd for a Bottle of Wine We sat down together, the Prisoner on my Right Hand, and the other Woman on the Left. They began to talk about Country Affairs; I told them I came out of Essex, and they pretended to be well acquainted that way, and grew very familiar with me. The Prisoner thrust her Hand into my Breeches, and the other Woman unbutton'd my Cloaths; and then I began to think that I was got into ill Company, and so I got up and felt for my Money, but could not find it. I charged them with it; but they deny'd it. However, they gave me good Words; but I not being satisfy'd with that, they quickly came to bad ones. But at last, to make me easy, they said they'd help me to my Money again, if I'd pay the Reckoning, and give them the odd Guinea. I offer'd them a Crown, and they agreed to it, upon Condition that I would take my Money again without telling it over; and so I did, and then went away together to a Gin-Shop in Newtoner's-Lane; and when we came there, the Prisoner bade me look upon my Money, and see if it was right. So I took it out of my Pocket to tell it, and she dash'd it all out of my Hand, and then they pick'd it up betwixt 'em, and swore I should never have any of it again. I made a great Uproar, and sent for a Constables. The other Woman ran away, but I secured the Prisoner; and upon Search, we found six of the seven Guineas in a Pail in the Yard. The Prisoner thus made her Defence: I accidentally went to light a Candle at the Gin-Shop, and there the Prosecutor was quarrelling with a Woman. The Woman got away, and thereupon he charged me with being concerned with her. The Jury <rs id="t17250513-54-verdict266" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>The Prisoner, in the Morning before his Tryal came on, dispersed about the Court a considerable Numbers of printed Lists of the Felons that he had apprehended, which concluded in these Words; In regard therefore of the Numbers above Convicted, some that have yet escaped Justice are endeavouring to take away the Life of the said Jonathan Wilde, This extraordinary Proceeding gave Occasion to the King's Counsel to observe, That such Practices were unwarrantable, and not to be suffer'd in any Court of Justice: That this was apparently intended to take off the Credit of the King's Witnesses, and to prepossess and influence the Jury. But as he believed them to be Men of Integrity, he was under no Apprehensions that it would have such an Effect: Nor, on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172505130006"/> contrary, could he suppose that they would give any other than a conscientious Verdict, according to Evidence, tho' the indirect Management of the Prisoner was far from making his Cause appear favourable. That it was impossible that a Man that has carry'd on a Trade of Felony for so many Years past; a Man that has bred up and erected a Corporation of Felons; a Man, whose constant known Practice has been to procure Goods that have been lost in any Part of the Town; that it was impossible that such a Man should not have it in his Power to detect those Felons: And yet that there was good Reason to believe, that (to the great Scandal of publick Justice) he has on the contrary terrify'd many from Reformation, and prevented them from making such Discoveries as might have been of Public Advantage. That if a strict Enquiry was to be made after the Motives of his apprehending those Criminals named in his List, we should find that they were private Interest, old Grudges, or fresh Quarrels, and not the least Regard to Justice and his Country, &amp;c. The Prisoner pray'd that the Witnesses against him might be examin'd apart; which the Court granted.</p>

             thus deposed: In January last I went to see Mrs. Johnston, who then lived at the Prisoner's House: Her Husband brought me over from Ireland; upon which Account I wanted to speak with her. I found her at home, and we drank a Quartern of Holland's Gin together. By and by in comes Mrs. Murphy with a Pair of Brocaded Shoos and Clogs, and makes a Present of them to Mrs. Wilde. The Prisoner was in Company. We drank two or three Quarterns more, and then I and Mrs. Murphy got up to go away together. The Prisoner ask'd me which way I was going? I told him to my Lodgings at the Seven Dials. I suppose you go Holborn Way, says he. We answer'd, Yes. Why then, says he, I'll tell ye what; - There's an old Blind Bitch that sells fine Flanders Lace just by Holborn-Bridge; her Daughter is as blind as herself; and if ye call there, you may speak with a Box of Lace, (that is, steal a Box) - I'll go along with ye, and shew ye the Door. So the Prisoner and I and Murphy went together, till we came within Sight of the Door: He pointed and shew'd us which it was, and said he would wait for us, and bring us off, if any Disturbance should happen. Murphy and I went to, and turn'd over a great deal of Lace, but could see none that would please us, not a Piece that was broad enough, and fine enough, for it was our Business to be very nice and difficult. At last, the old Woman stept up Stairs to fetch another Piece: And as People of our Profession are seldom guilty of losing an Opportunity, I made use of this. I took a Tin Box of Lace, gave it to Mrs. Murphy, and she hid it under her Cloak. The old Woman came down with another Box, and shew'd us several Pieces, for which she asked 6 s. a Yard. We offer'd her 4 s. and not being likely to agree about the Price, we came way, and found the Prisoner waiting where we left him. We told him what Success we had had, and so went back with him to his House. There we open'd the Box, and found Eleven Pieces in it. He ask'd us if we would have ready Money, or stay till an Advertisement came out. Stock being pretty low with us at that time, we chose the first, and so he gave us three Guineas and four Broad Pieces. I took for my Share three Guineas and a Crown, and Mrs. Murphy had the rest. I can't afford to give you any more, (says he); for tho' I have got some Influence over her, by helping her to Goods two or three times before, yet I know her to be a stingey hard-mouth'd old Bitch, and I shan't get above Ten Guineas out of her.

             deposed the same; and Katharine Stetham Corroborated that Part of their Depositions which related to their being in her Shop, and added, that she miss'd the Lace in about half an Hour after they were gone. The Evidence was full and positive against the Prisoner. But here his Counsel (who waited in readiness if any Point of Law should arise) stood up, and beg'd Leave to declare it as their Opinion, that the Defendant, according to the Evidence given against him, could not be guilty of the Indictment; and their Reason for it was, that the Indictment sets forth, That HE did privately steal this Lace [IN] the Shop; when it was certain that he did not enter the Shop: That he might indeed be guilty of a simple Felony, in being Accessary before the Fact, or in Receiving the Goods after; but could not be guilty of the Capital Offence, except (according to the Act) it had been inserted in the Indictment, that He did Assist, Here or Command. The Court, in summing up the Evidence, observed to the Jury, that in Felonies, Burglaries, and Robberies on the Highway, every Accessary before the Fact is a Principal; he that stands by, or watches at a Distance, being as guilty, and as liable to the same Punishment, as the very Man that enters the House, or steals the Money or Goods. But as it was not remembered that there had yet been any Precedent, of the like Construction being put upon Indictments of this Nature, it remained as a Matter of Doubt; and therefore, in such Cases, it was most eligible to incline to the Side of Mercy.</p>

             was upon the following Clause in an Act passed in the 4th Year of the Reign of his present Majesty; which was read in Court, viz.</p>
               <p>'' And whereas there are several Persons who have secret '' Acquaintance with Felons, and who makes it their Business '' to help Persons to their stoln Goods, and by that means '' gain Money from them, which is divided between them and '' the Felons, whereby they greatly encourage such Offenders: '' Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That 
'' where ever any Person taken Money or Reward, directly 
'' or indirectly, under Pretence or upon Account of helping '' any Person or Persons to any stoln Goods or Chattels, 
'' every such Person so taking Money or Reward as aforesaid, '' (unless such Person do apprehend, or cause to be apprehended, '' such Felon who stole the same, and cause such 
'' Felon to be brought to his Tryal for the same, and give '' Evidence against him) shall be guilty of Felony, and suffer '' the Pains and Penalties of Felony, according to the 
'' Nature of the Felony committed in stealing such Goods, 
'' and in such and the same Manner as if such Offender had '' himself stole such Goods and Chattels, in the Manner and '' with such Circumstances as the same were stoln.''</p>
               <p>Katharine Stetham thus deposed: On the 22d of January, between Three and Four in the Afternoon, a Man and Woman came into my Shop, under a Pretence of buying some Lace: They were so very difficult, that I had none below that would please them; and so, leaving my Daughter in the Shop, I slept up Stairs, and brought down another Box. We could not agree about the Price, and so they went away together; and in about half an Hour after I miss'd a Tin Box of Lace, that I valu'd at 50 l. The same Night, and the next, I went to Jonathan Wilde's House; but not meeting with him, I advertised the Lace that I had lost, with a Reward of 15 Guineas, and no Questions ask'd. But hearing nothing of it, I went to Jonathan's House again, and then met with him: He desired me to give him a Description of the Persons that I suspected, which I did as near as I could; and then he told me that he'd make Enquiry, and bade me call again in two or three days. I did so; and then he said, that he had heard something of my Lace, and expected to know more of the Matter in a little time. I came to him again on that day that he was apprehended, (I think 'twas the 15th of February.) I told him, that tho' I had advertised but 15 Guineas Reward yet I'd give 20 or 25 rathe than not have my Goods. Don't be in such a Hurry, says her I don't know but I may help you to it for less; and if I can, I will. The Persons that have it, are gone out of Town, I shall set them to quarrelling about it, and then I shall get it: the cheaper. On the 10th of March, he sent me word, that if I would come to him in Newgate, and bring 10 Guineas in my Pocket, he could help me to my Lace. I went: He desired me to call a Porter; but I not knowing where to find one, he sent a Person who brought one that appeared to be a Ticket-Porter. The Prisoner gave me a Letter, which he said was sent him as a Direction where to go for the Lace; but I could not read, and so I deliver'd it to the Porter. Then he desired me to give the Porter Ten Guineas, or else (he said) the Persons that had the Lace would not deliver it. I gave the Porter the Money; he went away, and in a little time return'd, and brought me a Box that was seal'd up, but not the same that was lost. I open'd it, and found all my Lace but one Piece. Now, Mr. Wilde, (says I) what must you have for your Trouble? Not a Farthing, says he, not a Farthing for me. I don't do these things for Worldly Interest, but only for the Good of poor People that have met with Misfortunes. As for the Piece of Lace that is missing, I hope to get it for you e'er be long; and I don't know but that I may help you not only to your Money again, but to the Thief too; and if I can, much good may't do you. And as you're a good Woman and a Widow, and a Christian, I desire nothing of you but your Prayers, and for them I shall be thankful. I have a great many Enemies, and God knows what may be the Consequence of this Imprisonment.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said nothing in his Defence, but that he had Convicted a great Number of Criminals; only he desired that Murphy and Kelly might be called in again, which was granted. Then (this Indictment being laid for helping Kat. Stretham to Goods that had been stole from her by Persons UNKNOWN) he pray'd, that Murphy might be ask'd who stole the Lace? In expectation, that she would unwarily swear, that herself and Kelly were the Persons; (for tho' such Evidence was given in the former Tryal, the Law could take no Notice of it in this, except it had been sworn over again.) But the Court inform'd him, that as Murphy was an Evidence upon Oath, nobody could require her to answer any Questions to accuse herself. Then he pray'd the Court would ask her, if he (the Prisoner) stole the Lace? To which she answer'd, No; but he was concern'd with those that did steal it, and he received it after it was stolen. From hence the Counsel for the Prisoner beg'd Leave to observe, That as Murphy had sworn that the Prisoner was guilty of Felony, they presum'd that the Act upon which he was now indicted, was never intended to affect him, or any other Felon, but only such Persons that were not Felons themselves, but hold a Correspondence with Felons. For as there were old Laws in Force for the Punishment of Felons, it would have been altogether unnecessary that a new Law should be made to the same Purpose, - that is, to no Purpose at all - That the very Preamble to that Clause of the Act upon which the Prisoner is indicted, intimates, by a plain Distinction, that Felons are not in that Place intended. The Words are thus: '' Whereas '' there are several Persons who have secret Acquaintance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172505130007"/> '' with Felons and who make it their Business to '' help Persons to their Stoln Goods, and by that means '' gain Money from them, which is divided between THEM '' and the FELONS.'' - That by a Proviso in the said Clause, it could not be supposed that felons were there intended, without making Contradictions and Inconsistencies in the Act itself. For the Words are, '' Unless such Person doth apprehend, '' or cause to be apprehended, such Felon who stole '' the same, and cause such Felon to be brought to a Tryal '' for the same, and give Evidence against him.'' Suppose now that there was but one Person concern'd in such a Case; can it be thought that ever the Legislature intended that this Person should apprehend himself, bring himself to Tryal, give Evidence against himself, convict himself, and hang himself? No, certainly. To this the Counsel for the Crown reply'd to the following Effect, That it was no Absurdity or Contradiction to say, that that Act was intended to affect Felons, even in a Case where there was but one Felon concern'd: For that a Man's being a Felon, did not any way hinder him from discovering his Accomplices, if he had any; and if he had none, but committed the Offence by himself, it would be impossible to try him for taking Money upon Account of restoring Goods that were stolen, till he was first convicted of stealing those Goods: And this first Conviction would then be sufficient. There would be no Necessity for trying him for the other Offence, for if&gt; he was found guilty, it would make no Alteration in his Punishment: But that this was not the Case of the Prisosoner: That it was evident that he had Accomplices, and had not discover'd them. The Court farther observ'd, that Felons were so far from being excepted in that Act, that it was principally intended against them; for it particularly mentions, '' Those that make it their Business to help People to '' stolen Goods.'' And it was certain, that such Persons must be Receivers of stolen Goods, knowing them to be stolen, and such are Felons. That the Case of the Prisoner came within almost every Circumstance of the Act; it being evident that he was a Person that had secret Acquaintance with Felons, who made it his Business to help People to stolen Goods, and by that means gain'd Money from them; which was divided betwixt him and the Felons, and thereby greatly encouraged such Offenders, and had not apprehended them. That it was a very surprizing Plea for a Man to say, I am more guilty than you are aware of, and therefore I ought to suffer less. And that it could not be thought that the Parliament ever intended by this Act to excuse a Man meerly because he was a Felon, and more Criminal than another.</p>

I believe these that are now in the Court are the same; especially the Cutting Tool, and the Fly of the Press, for he had them of me. He did not lodge in my House, but used to come and work there now and then; and sometimes I assisted him in coining about twenty Pieces that were counterfeit Guineas, and Half-Guineas, and some Moidores, and other Foreign Peices. He paid me no Rent for my Cellar; but allow'd me Part of this Counterfeit Money, in Proportion to the Quantity that he made. From S. Paul's Church-yard, by the Prisoner's Directions, I removed these Implements into Rosemary-Lane, and afterwards to Mr. Williams's in Benjamin-Street, near Swallow-Street; and from thence to Mr. Bails's  in Wild-Street, where I left 'em, and went to Sea, which is now about two Years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hornby thus deposed. I have known the Prisoner eight or nine Years. I being Clerk of the Works at the Admiralty, and he being then a <rs id="t17250513-56-deflabel279" type="occupation">Carpenter</rs>

In October last, a Statute of Bankrupt was issued against him, and I was chosen Assignee. Upon which Occasion, he had several times invited me to dine with him, at Mrs. Milliscent Russell's in Paradise-Row, by Hanover-Square; so in January last, I went thither; I think we had a Turkey for Dinner; but it not being ready, he told me, if I'd go into the Cellar with him, he'd let me see something that I had never seen in my Life. I went down with him, and he shew'd me his Press: In this Press, said he, I can make Buttons; but I'll shew you a greater Rarity; and with that he took up a Piece of gilt Metal, put it into the Press, and struck it, and it came out like a Half-Guinea, except the Milling on the Edge; and that he presently did, by running it thro' his Edging Tool. I believe that this is the same Press, and that the same Edging Tool.</p>

             thus deposed: When I first knew the Prisoner, he lived with Mr. Fordham in Benjamin-street; from whence, in about four Months, he removed his Lodgings to my House in College-street; from thence into King-street in Golden-Square; and from King-Street to a Plumber's in Jermyn-street, where he lodged when he was taken up. He desired me to let him have the Use of my Cellar in Paradise-Row. I told him it was damp, and was but of little Service to me, and therefore he should be welcome to it without paying any Rent. He brought thither in the Evening several things in Baskets, two great Pieces of Iron, a Block, and other Things, that I had seen him once work with at Mr. Fordham's; and they told me then that they were making of buttons; but I saw some Pieces taken out like Money. He put up a Grate in my Cellar. I have sometimes heard Knocking, but I never saw him work there; for he always kept the Keys himself, and would suffer no body to go down. He used to have Sea-Coal and Charcoal brought once in two or three Weeks; but it was always laid down at the Cellar-Window, and he shovel'd it in himself. He sent me (I believe nine or ten times) to Mr. Yarndner's a Founder, with a sort of blackish Metal to be flatted, to the Thickness of some of the Notches in this Gage Iron; and sometimes I fetch'd the Pieces back again after they were flatted. These Parcels are very much like them: I believe some of them will fit this Notch; that's the Thickness of a Guinea. Yes, they fit it exactly. Then here is another Notch of the Thickness of a Half Guinea; another for Half Crowns, and another for - I don't know what; perhaps for Moidores, or some other Outlandish Money. The last Parcel I carried to be flatted, was a little before last Chistmas; but I never carried out any from the Prisoner after it was flatted. Once or twice, I think, I carried some Gold to be flatted.</p>
               <p>Yardner deposed, that Milliscent Russel and

            , had often, within these four Years past, brought him Parcels of Metals to be flatted, 20 or 30 lb Weight at a time, which seemed to be a Mixture of Brass, Copper, and other Metals; and that latterly they had brought some Silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oakly deposed, that about three Years ago he had several times cast a Mixture of Copper, brass, and other Metals for the Prisoner, 20 or 30 lb together. The preceding Depositions were confirmed by Quinny, (who served the Prisoner with Charcoal) Pierce and Brown, two Smiths; the former mended the Fly of the Press for Fordham; and the other made, for the Prisoner, the Iron Clamp or Collar for the Block, to keep it from splitting, which was produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Broom the Bricklayer thus deposed: I set up such a Grate as this for the Prisoner in Mrs. Russel's Cellar: I believe it to be the same, by as having so many Bars at the Bottom, which is not usual, for it makes it draw prodigiously. I told him, that such a Grate, in the Manner that I fixt it, would burn the Devil and all of Fuel. So I would have it, says he; it must serve me either to roast or boil, bake or stew.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chandler the Messenger deposed, That on the 16th of April, in Mrs. Russell's Cellar, he seized all these Coining Instruments produced in Court, and had had them ever since in his own Custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pinkny, Deputy Warden, thus deposed: This Press, Cutting Tool, Edging Tool, and these Dyes, which we found in Mrs. Russell's Cellar, can serve for no other Use than Coining. I likewise found there, these 21 false Half Guineas; They are strongly gilt, three of them weigh'd something more than a Guinea. The [O] in [GEORGIUS] leans a little towards the [E], and is something less than the other Letters, which is exactly the same in this Dye, which was found in the same Cellar. These Dyes appear to have been lately made use of, for here is some of the Gilding now sticking in them.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called two or three Witnesses in his Defence. - Knight, a Chair-Maker, thus deposed: I was drinking with the Prisoner in New Bond street, when Hornby came to us in a great Hurry, and desired the Prisoner to get an Iron Clamp for him, and leave it at Mrs. Russell's.</p>

He carried it down to his Mistress at the Bar. She scrupled it for being so thick. Mr. Thomson, Warden of the Mint, happened to be behind the Bar at the same time, and desired to see it. He caused it is be cut, and it proved Counterfeit. Harpham and the Prisoner afterwards coming to the same House were apprehended</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172505130008"/>Mr. Reynolds thus deposed. I paid the Prisoner twenty two Guineas on Account of Mr. Hornby. The Prisoner being blind, or pretending to be so, he fumbled over the Guineas a pretty while out of one Hand into t'other, and then began to ring 'em; and one of 'em not sounding well, he desired me to give him another for it, which I did; but when I look'd upon it, I told him I was sure that he never had that Guinea from me, for all that I gave him were old Guineas, but this was a new shining one; but I thinking it might be good, I made no more Words of it, but paid it away in the Afternoon; but the next Day it was return'd me. I told him of it, and he readily gave me two good Half-Guineas for it.</p>

             thus deposed. I desired the Prisoner to give me Silver for a Guinea; which he did, after Mrs. Reves, his House-keeper, had look'd upon it, and told him it was good. But next Day she brought me a Guinea, and said she believed it was not good, and desired me to get it chang'd. But this was a King George's Guinea, and the Guinea that I gave him the Day before was King Charle's Guinea. But I did not know what to do in the Case. I went to change it at Mr. Cotton's, and he took me before Justice Ward, in whose Hands the Prisoner's Guinea was left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel thus deposed: I was telling the Prisoner, that the Guinea that he had given my Wife, was left in the Justice's Hand. The Justice has no Business with it, says he, Go and fetch it from him, and I'll give you eight Groats for it, for the Gold upon it is worth so much. The Guinea was produced in Court, and compared with the other that was cut. They appeared perfectly alike, and particularly the Figure [3] in the Date 1723, was remarkable by a small Blemish occasioned by a Fault in the Dye. One of Harpham's Dyes was again produced, with which they exactly agreed in that, and all other Parts. <rs id="t17250513-61-verdict297" type="verdictDescription">
