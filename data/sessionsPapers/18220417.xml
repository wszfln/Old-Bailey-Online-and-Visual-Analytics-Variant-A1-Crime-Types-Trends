            . I am eleven years old, and live in Old Cock-lane, Shoreditch. One Sunday evening, in January, about a quarter before eight o'clock, I was going home from school with my sister Margaret, who is younger than I; we were looking in at the pastry-cook's-shop window, she screamed and said a boy had taken a handkerchief off her neck, and I saw it under the prisoner's arm, he was about two yards from me - Mr. Gaylor took hold of him, and sent me for a light; he denied having it. I saw a gentleman take the handkerchief from him. I am sure he is the boy.</p>

He lives in the house himself - I occupy the parlour; my window is very high from the street, there are five or six steps leading up to the house. On this day three weeks, I went out about eight o'clock in the morning, and returned about eight o'clock at night; it was then dark - I had locked my door, and left the key with Mr. Hemmings, when I went out the window was shut close down, and I found it still shut. I missed a counterpane, a pair of sheets, two shirts, an apron, and a dark cotton gown, which I am sure were there when I left in the morning.</p>

            . (This witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath). I am ten years old, and lived at No. 6, Carpenter-street, near Tufton-street, at this time; I was going on an errand, about eight o'clock at night, and saw Mrs. Bishop's parlour window open; it was moon-light - I saw things thrown out of the window into the street, and then saw a tallish man jump out of the window. He took up some of the things, left the rest, and ran up the street. I saw a shorter man jump out - I was just crossing the road, and called out Stop thief! three times, nobody answered me. I saw Mr. Matthews knock at the door; the first man who jumped out, had a dark waistcoat on, and no coat - the shorter man had light round clothes on. I only saw two men, that (pointing to Donahow) is the tall one, I am quite sure of it. I cannot speak to the other by his features, but by his clothes, his coat and trowsers were light.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer, and live five doors from Tufton-street. On this evening, between seven and eight o'clock, I was at my own house, three men went by, I was eight or nine feet from them in height, looking from my window, I can speak positive to both the prisoners; a third person was with them. When they came between my shop and the next, one of them turned round, and said.</p>
               <p>"This is the shop," pointing to the next door; this drew my attention. They went on to the corner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170004"/>of Tufton-street. Soon after, in consequence of what somebody said, I went to the house, and alarmed the people; a great crowd collected in a short time, and in the crowd, I saw the two prisoners; there were sixty or seventy people - I am sure they are two of the three I saw go by my house. I told a boy to go for a constable - they stood near me, and might have heard me; they ran off directly I had spoken.</p>

I was going along Tufton-street, on the night in question, and passed this house, about eight o'clock, and saw three young men standing there; two of them were lifting the other one up to the window, but directly they saw me, they dropped him down - I went on three or four doors, and told a lady who stood at a door.

I met him on Sunday last, about half-past twelve o'clock, in Flask-walk; he asked if I wanted any money, I said Yes; he asked if I would have a sovereign, I said No, I would much rather have 1 s., for I should be better able to pay him; he gave me a crown piece, and after that shewed me a great quantity of sovereigns, which he took out of his breeches pocket, and a great quantity of silver, which he took from his coat pocket, tied up in a white cloth; I asked how he got it. He said he got into his father's house in their absence, and had broken the till, and had taken the money from it - I persuaded him to go and deliver the money up to his father, he refused to do it, and said he would take a coach, and go to London; I said I certainly would go and tell Mrs. Read; he said I might if I chose. I went to her, I took a cart, and overtook him at Pancras-church, on the roof of a coach. He got off, I delivered him to Batten, who took the money from him, and took him to the watch-house. I have known him about ten years. I think he was much intoxicated - he lived with his father, and worked for him. I never knew him to be weak in his mind.</p>

On the 14th of March, about twenty minutes after seven o'clock at night, the prisoner came to the house, and said he had brought a letter which required an answer. I said the family was not home. He said he would call the next night with it; he would not leave it. He brought it again next night, and requested an answer. I told him to come into the passage. - I took the letter of him, and shut the door; he stood on the mat. I laid the letter down on the sideboard, and went down stairs for my coat; when I came up he still stood where I had left him. I took the letter to Miss Sharpe in the drawing-room, but as I suspected something, I returned to the stair-case, and looked over the bannisters - I saw him take the clock off the bracket in the hall, and saw it in his hand; I ran down, calling Stop thief! He opened the door with one hand, having the clock in the other, and dropped it on the threshold of the door, and ran off. I pursued, and took him in Lamb's Conduit-street, without losing sight of him. I am sure he is the man. It is Miss Sharpe's dwelling-house.</p>

He dropped it at my feet - I collared him, but he got from me. The footman pursued him quite close; it is impossible he could lose sight of him. The prisoner is of the same stature and dress as the man, but I will not swear to him.</p>

I am an inmate of his house - he was not at Greenford on the night in question, Tuesday the 18th of February; I was there, and went to bed about half-past ten o'clock. I saw all the windows and doors fast, and secure. I was disturbed a little before two o'clock, by the barking of a little dog, and by a noise of knocking of the inner doors, and hearing footsteps in different parts of the house, I got up and went down stairs undressed, with a double barrelled gun; I opened my door as cautiously as I could, and immediately heard footsteps going down stairs, and when I had got down about six steps, a light went across the hall, and I observed two or three figures pass; I fired one of my barrels, and pursued them into the dining-room - there is a window which opens on to the lawn, and as they went through there I pulled the trigger of the other barrel, but it missed fire. I followed them through the window on the lawn, and pulled the trigger again, and it missed fire again - I then saw two men together, and one seperate; two of the men followed the gravel walk, the other went through a clump; I immediately lost sight of him. I drove the two towards a quickset hedge, which they dashed through, it was six feet high on the inner side, and eight on the other. I heard some one going over the pailing, and as I returned to the house, I stumbled over a pair of shoes and a hat, which I took up, and carried to my bed-room - I then got a light, dressed myself, and sent the servant to alarm

            . I am gardener to Mr. Condell. I was called up, and went with King into the Uxbridge-road, and about a mile from my master's house, I took Naylor, he was walking on the foot-path, in company with Adams, whom King secured; the constable searched Naylor in my presence, and found three silver forks and two cruet tops on him. I did not see Adams searched; I saw him strike the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time was this - A. About three o'clock in the morning, it was a dark night. I can swear to Adams; I had a good opportunity of seeing him - his face was close to mine when King collared him, I noticed his features, and person most particularly; he was without his shoes; King held him a minute or two, he then gave him a violent blow on the head, and got from him - he was taken the same morning.</p>

            . I am carter to Mr. Condell. Mr. Platt called me up, I did not go in pursuit. On the morning after the robbery, I searched all round the premises, and traced where they went through the edge, it was broken quite down, and in the same trace down the meadow, nearly two hundred yards from the edge, I found a table cloth spread, and a clock, some silver candlestands, cruet-frames, and between four and five dozen of knives and forks, all covered over with a baize table-cover - I looked round and three or four flint stones laid at the corner, close to the house, and a glass decanter, half full of brandy; and just in the centre of the house, were three or four more flints, a bottle of gin, and the iron bar of the window; it was about twenty yards from the window. I was going to town that morning with a load of hay, and when I came into Kensington, I saw Bowles, (Mr. Epley's carter). I walked with him, and told him of the robbery, and in consequence of what he said, I looked and saw the prisoner Adams in his cart, and noticed some small pips on his hat, as if from a hedge, and his coat was torn on his left shoulder, there was also a green mark on his shoulder; he had neither shoes or stockings on. I got Pugh who was going to town, to secure him, we got in the cart, and handed him down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you search him - A. Yes; and found a loaded pistol in his left hand trowsers pocket.</p>

            . I live at Greenford. I went with Hughes, and met Adams and Naylor, I believe it to be Adams, but cannot positively swear to his features. Hughes took Naylor, whom I afterwards searched. When I came up, I said,</p>
               <p>"Good morning gentlemen," they said, "Good morning;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you come from," they said,</p>
               <p>"What odds is it to you," I said,</p>
               <p>"A great deal," and by this time, I saw that the man, whom I believe to be Adams, had neither stockings or shoes on - he resisted greatly when I seized him; he thrust his hand into his right hand pocket, I ordered him to take it out, which he did, and I threw him on the path - he begged me not to ill-use him, I said,</p>
               <p>"Then be civil," he said,</p>
               <p>"I will," he resisted again, and put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket - I felt and found what appeared to me a pistol, I held it fast, he resisted, and we struggled till we got from one side of the road to the other, and then he pulled some weapon from his right hand pocket, and gave me a blow on the head, which caused me to lose my hold of the pistol, and he got away. I staggered but did not fall down - my head had a cut between two and three inches long. I then went to assist Hughes. I observed Adams coat was torn on his left shoulder before I seized him. I searched Naylor at the cage, and found the property mentioned in his pocket. I then went to the Green Man, public-house, Ealing, and saw

               <p>Q. Did you not hesitate about them before the Magistrate - A. I said I would not positively swear to them, but I looked at them, and felt more positive, and had no doubt of them - they had changed their clothes then. I said I would not swear positively, but believed them to be the men.</p>

            , of Enfield. I had a load of hay from Uxbridge, and delivered it to Spurgear. I bound the hay myself; there was nothing in it - As I came to town I took up Ward and Anson, by the seven mile stone, and at Notting-hill turnpike. King took them out of my cart.</p>

            . I am horse-keeper at the Old Hatts, on the Uxbridge-road. About four o'clock on the morning of this robbery, I met Anson and Ward at the Old Hatts, where I change my horses; they asked their way to London, and said they had come from Twickenham, and lost their way - I told them to go straight on, and went with them, to the Green Man, and got them some hot, and two pipes of tobacco; they went away in Birch's hay cart. I noticed that they had handkerchiefs tied over their mouths, and their hats over their eyes, and they would not walk into the house to warm themselves, but drank the hot at the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. Early on the morning of the 19th Feb. I went down and examined the house. Naylor was delivered into my custody at Hanwell, and at Mr. Condell's house, Mr. Platt gave me a pair of shoes, a hat, a dark lanthorn, a crow bar, and a glove. I examined Naylor's person, and found several scratches on his hands, which appeared recently inflicted, as there was a discharge from them - he would not tell me how they came so. I then asked him how he came by the plated articles found in his pocket? he said he had come from Uxbridge early that morning, and about half a mile of the other side of Hanwell, he came up with a man without shoes, and that man asked him to carry those articles for him, which he did, and shortly after, near a cross road, two men came up, and took them both into custody; that he surrendered, but the other man without shoes knocked down the man who took him, and got off. He was very dirty, his knees were muddy both before and behind. I took him to the office, and soon after Adams was given into my charge; he had no shoes or stockings on, his trowsers were very muddy, and his left-hand trowsers pocket nearly torn off; his coat was torn in the left arm. Upon taking his coat off I found several small holes like shot holes had passed through the tall; the shoes which Mr. Platt delivered me were tried on his feet, they fitted him. I took him to the back of the office where Naylor was confined, and asked Naylor if he knew him, and at the same time told him I should give his answer in evidence; he said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who gave me the plated articles, which were found in my pocket, and the same who struck the person who took him, and made his escape." Adams denied it, and said he did not know him at all, and had never seen him in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170008"/>life. Naylor said he was the man - a pistol was produced before the Magistrate; I found it was loaded with two balls, and primed - I unloaded it. I received Anson and Ward in charge at Mary-le-bone watch-house, and examined their persons; and found their hands scratched in the same way as Naylors, and a little bloody, and their clothes very muddy. I took Adams into their presence; he said he knew neither of them, and they said they had never seen each other in their lives. Ward and Anson said they had been tumbling about, which made them so muddy. I produce Adam's coat, also a dark lanthorn, a crow, and a hat, which was tried on, but fitted neither of them well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Naylor always gave the same account - A. Yes. The place he says he met Adams at, is about a mile from the house. The shoes would have fitted Adams if his stockings were on.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT re-examined. My gun was loaded with small shot. I conceive, from the appearence of the premises, that there were five or six persons - I only saw three, but on the lawn in front, there were foot-marks and flint-stones, and a bottle of spirits, in two different places on the lawn, and the foot-marks were in two or three different places.</p>

I went to bed about twelve o'clock. Under the window which fronts the street, there is a door, which opens for the drovers to put their ropes in; it was fastened by a lock. I was called up at three o'clock by the watchman, and found this door forced, and the lock off; there is a door inside, opening into this place, and that was also forced open, I am sure it was safe overnight - the inner door had not been opened for five years; it leads into the bar, and on examining the bar, I found an empty drawer standing on the counter, which had been robbed of between 5 s. and 10 s. worth of copper; it was in its proper place over night. I then found another till taken away, with about 45 s. in copper in it; the lock of a door in the bar was picked, which was locked when I went to bed, and the bar parlour had been entered, and from a cupboard there, was taken two table and six teaspoons, a pair of sugar tongs, a cream pot, a pair of salt-spoons, and a punch ladle, all silver; and 6 plated spoons, two table cloths; and a bundle was taken from a dresser, which did not belong to me. The value of the whole is about 7 l. with the money. The watchman took me to a court within two doors of my house, and in that court was a privy; the floor of which was taken up, and the whole of the articles and money stated in the indictment where found down there, but only part of the copper. Newman brought me a small crow-bar and chisel two hours after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The privy does not belong to your house - A. No. The court leads to two private houses, and the privy belongs to them; I do not know whether it is always left open. The tills were in their proper places at night - the outer door of this place door was locked; one drover, named Nicholls, has a key; it was not a night on which he would have occasion to come there. I tried the door on this night, and found it safe - if that had been open, they would have to force the inner door.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre. On the night in question I was near Cock-court; was walking by my box, which is opposite Cock-lane, and the Fortune of War, - the court is two doors below, down Cock-lane. At half-past two o'clock, Bartho-lemew came over to me; he appeared to come out of the side door of the Fortune of War, in Cock-lane; he said,</p>

               <p>"Watchman it is a cold morning," I said,</p>
               <p>"We cannot complain for the time of year;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I am locked out, I live down at the bottom of the lane," I said,</p>
               <p>"Can't you make them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170009"/>hear," he said, he did not like to disturb them - we talked for near half an hour; he kept his eye on the Fortune of War - I went down Cock-lane, at three o'clock to cry the hour; he remained by my box. I came out of the lane into Giltspur-street, and down a court to cry the hour; I took off my hat, having suspicion of him, and looked out of the court, and saw him cross over to the Fortune of War. I went into Cock-lane, and could see nothing of him; presently I heard a gingle, which seemed to proceed from the court, where the two houses are; then Close came out of the court - I crossed over and asked what he was doing there; he said he lived there; I said I thought he did not, he persisted that he did, and wanted me to go in and see that he did; I took him by the collar, and said I would take him to the watch-house, and have him examined, but as he persisted that he lived there, I let him go, and he went up the court, which is no thoroughfare; I remained at the end. Cook (a watchman) came up; I placed him there to prevent any one coming out while I went to the watch-house for a reinforcement - I brought Godfrey, and found Cook at his post; we went up the court, looked about, and could see nobody; presently Cook put his stick through a hole in the privy door, and said there were persons there; we demanded entrance, but could not obtain it, then we heard a noise inside like breaking of wood; we broke in at the door, and found the prisoners there; we secured and took them to the watch-house; then returned to the privy to see if we could find any thing; I looked about the yard, found nothing, and put my lantern down the privy, and discovered linen, plate, and broken wood, down in the soil. We went to the Fortune of War, and found the side door open - I had examined that door before one o'clock, and found it safe. We alarmed Mr. Gardner; he got up, and looked over his house; we took him to the privy, I got a chisel and hammer, pulled up the floor, and found the property stated in the indictment there, and gave them to Godfrey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you first see Bartholemew - A. At half-past two o'clock - he appeared quite sober; he did not ask leave to sit in my box, or where he could get a night's lodging; he was alone then. He asked if we allowed people to sit in the watch-house, I said</p>
               <p>"No, provided we found you drunk or at housebreaking, we would give you a night's lodging." I knew there was a privy in this court; any one might get to it, it has only one seat, I believe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed any body go up the court from the time you first saw Bartholemew, till you heard the gingle - A. No, my Lord.</p>

            . I am the inspector of the watch. Hogan fetched me to the court in Cock-lane. I found Cook standing as a sentry; we all three went up, and all was silent; we looked about and found nobody in the court or in the inner yard where the privy is; it is in an inner yard, which is enclosed by a door - it might have been left open. We found the privy door shut - Cook put his stick through; we forced it open, and found the prisoners there; Bartholemew came out first, and desired we would not use him ill; I laid hold of him; the other came out, and said the same and surrendered; we had not charged them with any thing. Before the door was open, we heard a great noise like the breaking of timber. We found the property; and some implements of housebreaking in a green bag in the privy. Previous to searching the privy, we took the prisoners to the watch-house. Both gave their names - Bartholemew gave his residence No. 30, Onslow-street, Saffron-hill, as a baker; I asked what he did in the privy; he said he went for a necessary purpose. Close said he had no residence in London; that he was a shoemaker, and had come from Devonshire that day. They were taken to the Compter. We then went and found Gardner's house broken open. We searched the privy immediately after taking the prisoners to the watch-house, and found the articles stated in the indictment; also a broken till, a green bag, containing 3 s. in silver, and seventeen picklock keys, 16 s. 4 3/4 d. in copper, and a chisel were picked up, a small box, and a bottle - and in the yard we found 8 d. in copper loose on the pavement. The property was given to Pike. On entering Gardner's house, by the door, we found a small dark lantern, and a large door key; a gimblet was stuck in the outer door under the window, with a string tied to it, which would enable them to keep the door close after they had got in; we found the lock of this door wrenched off, and the inner door open; there are two holes to the privy.</p>

               <p>BARTHOLEMEW'S Defence. I am totally innocent. I had been over the water with some friends, stopped late, and on coming home, about two o'clock, I was intoxicated - I found the street door locked, did not wish to disturb the other lodgers, and meant to walk about till morning. As I crossed Smithfield, this watchman stood with a man in his box, I asked if I might sit in the watch-house; he said the officers would not allow it - we talked a few minutes; I then went up the court into the privy, and to the best of my recollection fell asleep there. I never saw this person before, and to the best of my knowledge was never in Gardner's house in my life.</p>

            . My husband is a sawyer, and lives in St. George's-fields. I was told of this robbery on the Saturday. Bartholemew came to our house on Good Friday, he had a bad foot; I asked him to sit down till my husband came in, which he did till about eight o'clock - I asked if he was not hungry, and gave him some pork and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170010"/>a pint of porter. He stopped till half-past one o'clock - I believe he was rather intoxicated; he and my husband had three pots and a pint of beer between them; I had some of it - we were drinking from about nine to half-past one o'clock; he fell asleep part of the time in the arm chair, and I awoke him. I thought him intoxicated - he smoked three pipes; I asked him to stop, but he said he would go home to his wife and child. I have known him five or six years; he was an honest steady man. He lived some where about here, but where I do not know.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Bartholemew a good character.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James, Westminster. On the 19th March, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Piccadilly, with an apron on his left shoulder - I stopped him, and asked what he had there; he said his own property - I took him to the watch-house, and found it contained 36 lbs. of lead; he said he found it in Kensington-road; he was coming in a direction from Knightsbridge. I went to Elford, and we compared the lead with the gutter, it fitted exactly with part of it - the prisoner said he lodged at the house over the shop. I examined his room, and found 65 lbs. more rolled up in his bed, in a sheep's-skin - this also fitted the gutter; a great deal more was taken away. When he saw Mr. Elford,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170011"/>he said he did take it, but hoped he would not hurt him.</p>

On the 6th or 7th of November; I bought this mare, it was in my stable there; I saw it safe at six o'clock on the night of the 6th of March; I cannot say whether the door was locked. The patrol called me up about a quarter-past four o'clock next morning, and informed me my gates were open - I missed my mare, and traced her out of the yard to a lane leading to Kingston; a patrol and I immediately went towards Kingston; and the patrol overtook the prisoner within an hour after, on the mare's back, going towards Wimbledon Common. When I came up, I found him with the prisoner and the mare - it was mine, but it appears to have been stolen before I had her; I bought her of one Hall.</p>

I presented a pistol at the prisoner, and told him to stop, for he had stolen the mare; he said, There he was, and there was the mare.

I found the closet open; I do not know whether I had locked it at night, but I generally do. I thought the key was in my pocket, but I have sometimes left it in the door by chance. My wife discovered it before me; I saw the gold there about seven o'clock at night, but did not see the plate that night; it consisted of eleven table, eleven tea, nine desert, and two gravy spoons. There was 45 l. by the side of the gold, which was not taken.</p>

On Wednesday, the 3d of April, I left the workshop at six o'clock in the evening - I left tools of various descriptions in a basket there; I went again at six o'clock in the morning, and found the door open - the bolt of the lock was broken; it appeared to have been done either by a crow-bar or chisel, and I missed all the tools.</p>

I was sitting on the step of the shop door, about half-past eight o'clock, on the night of the 3d of April, and saw the prisoners pass me, each had a basket of tools on his back - they went into Mrs. Turpin's shop, and put their baskets on the ground; one of them went out for half an hour - the baskets were not touched till he returned - then John Turpin said to me,</p>

            . I am a porter to Messrs. Harbons. On the 27th of March the prisoner came in for a pair of hinges - I was coming into the shop and saw him put a parcel containing seven brass hinges into his pocket - I told him to lay the parcel down; he said he had nothing belonging to me - he was standing where the hinges were. My master took hold of him, and in the scuffle I saw him drop them. I picked them up.</p>

            , (who is included in the indictment,) on 14th March, to look at some fur seal skins at my house; I shewed him about six. Buckley said he came with Wilson from Boxer and Co., and appointed the following morning for me to see him at Boxer and Co's office, No. 1, Pinner's Court, Broad-street. I attended there, and found Wilson sitting in a chair; it had the appearance of a merchant's counting-house. Wilson asked if I would give a little credit for the skins - he had said he should be a large buyer if we could agree. I said, if I sold them, I must have cash, and could give no credit; he appointed to meet me at two o'clock that day, at my house. Buckley was writing at the desk as a clerk, and within hearing. Wilson came to my house at two o'clock, and looked out 180 skins, which came to 90 l. 18 s. I asked when they were to be delivered; he looked at his watch, and said</p>
               <p>"You can deliver them, I suppose, in an hour." I said I could. I got a porter with a truck to take them, and sent my son with them. He brought the skins back in one hour and a half, directing me to be their the next morning before half-past ten o'clock. I got to Pinner's Court, about twenty minutes before ten with them. Buckley was sitting at the desk writing, and an elderly man was there. I asked if Mr. Wilson had been there. They said,</p>
               <p>"No." I said,</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose he will be long." Buckley said,</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Wilsonseldom exceeds ten o'clock." I waited a few minutes; said I will go to the end of the court to the porter, and perhaps I might see Mr. Wilson come up the street. I stood talking to the porter, and saw Mr. Wilson coming; he came up to me, and said</p>
               <p>"Good morning." I said</p>
               <p>"I have brought the skins according to order." He said</p>
               <p>"Let the porter deliver them, and I will pay you for them." The porter put them down in the office. There were sixteen others, a little damaged besides, which I had in a bag to see if I could sell them, as he seemed anxious for skins. Buckley was there when they were delivered. I told Wilson there was a mistake of 3 s. in the invoice; he was to pay the portage; he took the invoice, and looked at it, and said</p>
               <p>"Very well, 3 s. is of no consequence." I said</p>
               <p>"Will you look at these sixteen skins." He did, and said</p>
               <p>"I will not purchase them now; we will leave them for the present till I have paid for the others." I waited a few minutes for my money, and he said he had two heavy bills, and must wait till the office was open to get them cashed, which would be in the course of an hour. I said</p>
               <p>"I thought you would have been prepared with the money, my business is urgent, and I cannot leave home long together." He said he was sorry to detain me, but the office would be open in an hour, and then he could get the cash. I said</p>
               <p>"I will wait then till you have the money." The skins were still in the office. He left the office to get the money as I thought; Buckley still remained there. I waited some little time, and then walked to the end of the court, and returned; the skins were still in the office. Buckley said,</p>
               <p>"Take a seat, for Mr. Wilson will not be long." While I stood at the end of the court<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170016"/>the elderly man passed me, and on my return Buckley was alone in the office. I said</p>
               <p>"I suppose you know Mr. Wilson, don't you." He said</p>
               <p>"Yes." I said,</p>
               <p>"Is he a respectable man." He said,</p>
               <p>"A very respectable man, and in an extensive way of business near Manchester." I said,</p>
               <p>"Not in Manchester." He said,</p>
               <p>"No." I asked what place. I understood him to say Salford, about six miles from Manchester. In a few minutes the prisoner Levi came into the office, and bent his head over the railing of the desk, and said in plain English,</p>
               <p>"Have the goodness to tell Mr. Wilson he can have 200 l. at five o'clock." This was near eleven o'clock. I took notice of him, he left the office. In a few minutes Wilson came in, and apologized for detaining me. I said I was sorry too, for my business was urgent at home, and I expected the money, and said,</p>
               <p>"It will not be long now before you get it." I never intended to give up the goods without the money. He said he was sorry to detain me. I said,</p>
               <p>"If one of the two bills you have is not too heavy, and a good one, I will take my amount out of it, and give you the difference." He said,</p>
               <p>"You are very polite, but I have left the bills at the banking-house, and should not like to take them away." He took out his pocket-book, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got a bill here, you see, but it is not of very large amount." I leant my head over, and saw it was a bill. He said he could not get the money before three o'clock. I said</p>
               <p>"I thought that was very strange, that he ought to be prepared with the money. He proposed paying me at three o'clock. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then you cannot get the money." He said,</p>
               <p>"No, not till three o'clock." I took the sixteen skins, and put them in a brown holland bag, and put it on the rest of the skins, and said to Buckley,</p>
               <p>"Sir, these skins will be safe here till I return, or send my son?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes," as I was to send for the money, if I could not come myself. I then hastened home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them credit till three o'clock, or leave them on their assurance, that they would be safe till you had the money - A. It was about half-past eleven. I hastened home and instantly sent my son to the place to retain possession of the goods. It would take about quarter of an hour to go there. I told him to stay near the door till three, and then go in if I did not come - and if he could not get the cash to bring away the goods. He came home after three, and said we were robbed. I went to Pinner's Court, and found the clerks, the skins, and all the books gone, and nothing but a few wafers left. I made enquiry, and on Sunday Hewksley gave me information. I found 174 of the skins at Rose and Crown Court next morning, on the first floor. The sixteen skins were left behind in the counting-house. The prisoners were taken on Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You have recovered all but six - A. I dealt with Wilson; he was recommended by Buckley. I am a woollen-draper and shipowner, and various businesses. Wilson is not to be found. I never saw Levi till he came, and said Wilson might have 200 l. at five o'clock.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. I went to Pinner's Court in the afternoon, and saw Buckley. I had the skins on a truck, in care of a porter. Buckley asked for an invoice, which I gave him. He then said Mr. Wilson was gone to drink tea with a gentleman (it was then a quarter-past four o'clock) and had left word for my father to come next morning at half-past nine with the skins. I came back, and next morning, about a quarter-past twelve, I went to the counting-house, and waited outside till three o'clock, and was to go in then if my father did not come. He did not, and I went in at three o'clock, and found nobody there, nor any skins, except the sixteen damaged ones. Books and every thing were gone. Nothing was taken out while I was waiting; they must have been gone before I get there. I returned and told my father. I was not above a quarter of an hour going from my father's to the counting-house.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter, and live in Little Moorfields - my stand is at St. Lawrence Church. A person came to me at twelve o'clock, and said if I would go to No. 2, Pinner's Court, there was a job for me. I went, and when I got into the counting-house, the skins were delivered into my sheet by Buckley. I could get no answer where I was to take them to, but Levi went with me, having a few in a bag, when I got opposite Old Bethlem, I asked if he was going through the gates. He said</p>
               <p>"No; to Rose and Crown court." He spoke very good English. My load was too bulky to get through the gate. He took me to a private house, No. 12, Rose and Crown Court. I untied them below; they were carried up to the first floor. He asked me what the job was. I said 1 s. 6 d. He gave me 1 s. 2 d. I saw some bills stuck up afterwards, which led me to Wells. I shewed him where I took the goods, and they were recovered. I am sure of the prisoner person.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. On the 1st of March, at seven in the morning, I observed Trueman appeared bulky. He was cleaning out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170017"/>the warehouse. I allowed him to leave the warehouse at eight o'clock, for breakfast. He passed out of the warehouse into the cellar of the private house; and when he had been there about ten minutes I called him back; he still appeared bulky. I said, he had something about him. He denied it. I told him he must satisfy me what he had got in the paper, which I saw under his coat. - He answered nothing. I took this satin, fourteen yards, from him; it has our private mark on it; he seemed confused. I told him to follow me up into the warehouse. He said he would tell me all about it. I told him to say nothing to me; he said something which I paid no attention to, but told him to return to the cellar till Mr. Leaf came to town. He was taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not his duty lead him to where the satin was kept - A. He swept part of the warehouse, but not where the satin was; the paper was not visible till after I spoke to him. He said he found it on the staircase under suspicious circumstances, and meant to tell his employers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written). After eight weeks imprisonment, I am brought here for an offence I never committed, but did what I considered my duty. In sweeping the warehouse I frequently found goods where they ought not to be, and determined to acquaint Mr. Leaf of it, and in March I found these goods on the stairs and put it carefully in my pocket; it was visible to every one; the end of the paper hanging out. Is this the conduct of a theif; would any man in his senses place stolen goods in such a situation.</p>

            . I am turnkey of Bridewell; the two prisoners were both prisoners there. Mr. Gill applied to me in August, and left a trunk in my care. I deposited it in the strong-room in the prison; the prisoners had no access to it. Early in February I was taken ill, and remained so till the 24th of March, when I returned to my duty, and on the 26th I found the door of the room had been opened, and the box broken open. I had not seen it since February; they were both prisoners there then. I watched and saw Green deliver a shirt and handkerchief to a woman, to get washed for him. Mr. Gill afterwards claimed them; an officer searched Dodd and on him found a shirt, marked T. G. which Mr. Gill claimed, and the stockings on his feet. I then searched Dodd's cell, and found two pair of sugar tongs; nobody but him was confined in that cell. I also found two pieces of silk, and two pair of stockings, in his cell, all claimed by Mr. Gill. I found nothing in Green's cell. I charged Dodd with it; he said he was very sorry any body was blamed besides himself; that he committed the robbery, but nobody but himself knew any thing of it. Green said he had the things of Dodd; he might go to the room unobserved in the day time. The locks must have been picked. Dodd was committed for two years from Guildhall Sessions, and made a wardsman in the prison.</p>

            's waggon came by, driven by the deceased, while the coach stood there; the waggon passed the Gosport Coach, and then the Malborough Coach came by; the waggoner's right hand was near the horses; the Malborough Coach was on the right hand side of the road; the Marquis of Granby is on the left, coming to London; the Malborough Coach passed on the right hand side, the deceased was passing on the left side of his horses, close against the body horse; the waggon was about three yards from the foot path; when the Malborough Coach drove by, the prisoner started directly on the left side, between the waggon and the left side, and as his coach passed the waggon, the box of the coach's hind wheel and the box of the waggon, came in contact together. The coach was going on faster than it ought; it got by the waggon somehow, and then the waggon horses set off full trot. The waggoner caught hold of his own trace harness, to prevent the coach going over him, and then the horses set off at full trot. The waggoner fell down, and his fore and hind wheels went over him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say there was only three yards between the waggon and the foot-path, did the coach go on the foot-path - A. No, it went very near it. I did not see the coach or horses strike against the deceased. The coach passed by my window, just as the boxes touched, I hollowed out very loud,</p>
               <p>"Coachman you must stop, or you will run over the man." I ran down and stopped the waggoner's horses. He laid at the White Bear ten or twelve days and then died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The waggon had to pass the Gosport Coach on its way to town - A. Yes, the road is wide enough for four or five to go abreast; the waggon was far enough out in the road. My window is about seventeen yards from the Granby; the left hand is the near side; the waggon had quite cleared the Gosport Coach before the coach started; the accident was about thirty-eight yards form the Granby; the coachman had passed the body of the waggon when the man fell, but not the horses. I did not see the waggon leader make a sudden start to the near side. I looked more to the waggon than the horses; I know the waggon leader is rather skittish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The deceased caught hold of his trace harness - A. Yes, my Lord; he was pulled down. I saw him fall just as the coach passed him; I think the coach would have touched him, if he had not got close to his horses; he stepped half a yard out of the way; his own waggon ran over him, not the coach.</p>

            . I keep a Grocer's Shop at Hounslow. I stood at my door, which is seven houses from the Marquis of Granby, in the town, on the same side of the way. I saw the Gosport Coach at the Marquis of Granby; the driver was taking up a lady and gentleman. I saw the waggon come up to my door, and the Malborough Coach passed it very clear on the other side. I did not observe that it made the horses turn out of the way. At the time it passed the Granby, the driver of the Gosport Coach got on his box, and drove very fast indeed, on the left side, between the waggon; and as the waggoner was bearing very near towards our side, the coachman persisted in passing; and when they came opposite our door, the kennel being very low, I thought the coach would be over, as the waggon was so very near, there was scarce room for the coach to pass; the coach wheel went into the gutter, and made the coach leau over much towards my house; the waggoner got a little from my house, and how the accident happened I did not see. The body of the coach did not entirely pass the body of the waggon till it had passed my house; the coach being then between me and the waggoner, I could not see him. I afterwards saw him lay nine yards off. The waggon had then gone over him. There was room enough for him to have driven straight, and then it would not have happened.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say the coach was so near the side, you were afraid it would be over - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Marquis of Granby. I was at my lodgings, and saw the Gosport Coach at the Granby; the prisoner drove it. I went and stood by the horses, on the public house side of the way. I saw the rein of the Gosport Coach under the near leader's tail, and attemped to take it away, but the coachman started so quick before I could take it; he hit the wheel horse, and started at a goodish pace, not much faster then he ought to go, but coaches do go at a good pace. The waggon seemed to be over right the leaders head, but being afraid at seeing the rein under the horses tail, I did not take notice, fearing the leader would kick, and cannot say whether it could pass the waggon without danger, but it could not without the coach wheel going into the gutter. As it passed the waggoner, he went up scrambling to his horses traces to save himself, to get out of the way of the coach; then his horses took fright, and two of them turned right across the road, towards the Malborough Coach; this was before he fell; I cannot say whether the coach touched him or not; I saw him thrown down. The Malborough Coach being on the right side, I suppose turned the horses back again nearly straight; I think if the prisoner had gone on steady it would not have happened; or if he had gone on his right side of the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you see the prisoner off the box - A. No, the waggon had not quite cleared the coach when it was about to start; the waggoner was bearing on his left side, to let him pass on the right; he fell at the time the Malborough Coach passed; he laid hold of the traces, and I suppose was pulled down by the horses pulling on; the body of the coach was about ten yards from him; when he fell his left leg was behind his right, and he fell under his middle horse.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When his legs were entangled, was he falling - A. He was holding by his traces; the prisoner started with the leading reins in his hand, but they could not be strained so as to have a full command of his horses. He could not be off seeing the waggoner.</p>

            . I am a solicitor. I was on the Hounslow Road, on horseback, passing on my own near side, which was the off side of the waggon; and as I approached the hind part of the waggon the prisoner appeared to have his horses in confusion. I don't know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170019"/>whether he was on the point of starting or not. He had drawn his horses up. He appeared to me to be intending to turn to his own side, which he ought to have done, being behind the waggon; but he turned his horses between the waggon and the curb on the left. I saw nothing afterwards, till I saw the man on the ground. His thigh was broken. He was taken away on a shutter. It gave me the impression that he was knocked down by the head of his horse.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow, and was examined before the Coroner. I was at Mrs. Ogleby's, and saw the coach pass close to the path. I saw the waggon fore-wheel knock the man down. The Gosport Coach had then passed about two lengths from the waggon before he fell.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the coach pass the waggon - A. The Gosport Coach had passed two lengths before I looked. He fell with his feet under the waggon. He was hitting the coach horses. Q. I thought the coach had passed before you looked. How could you see him hit the horses - A. The coach was more by the side of him at first. There was room for two persons to pass between the coach and waggon, at the time he was striking the horses. He was walking very slow when the wheel knocked him down; and his horses went slow.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Marquis of Granby. The Gosport Coach just passed to take up a gentleman and lady. I stood to see the lady into the coach. The coachman was getting on his box, and the moment the passengers were in, the coach started. I saw the waggon on the other side of the coach. There was room for four to go abreast. The bodies of the coach and waggon were very near together. When it started there was room for the waggon to go further from the coach. I saw the coach pass the waggon about two yards off, and saw the waggoner catching at the chains of his waggon; and his horses began a trot. This was after the coach passed - I saw him fall. I think his foot slipped as he caught at the chain apparently to stop the horses. His leader had turned towards the coach as it was going by.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say when the coach started the body of the two were abreast - A. I think they must. There were three horses to the waggon, and only two abreast to the coach; I think I saw Simpkins there. I think the reins had caught. The waggon had not passed the body of the coach then. The accident happened forty or fifty yards off. Q. Then it is not true that the waggon horses were walking slowly, and the waggon knocked him down - A. No, it was trotting. The wheels knocked him down. There was room for the coach to pass; for it did pass. There was no danger - the coach went slowly at first - it neither galloped or trotted.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. It started slow. How far did it go before it got into its usual pace - A. About twenty yards.</p>

            . I am horsekeeper at the Marquis of Granby. The coach stood there about half a yard from the footpath. The waggon came along very near it; there was plenty of room - three or four carriages might pass. The first horse of the waggon was before the coach when it started; the waggoner was walking on the near side of his horses, and the waggon body was opposite the coach fore-wheel. The coach set off very slow, at a shuffling trot; and after it passed the waggoner he laid hold of his chain - crossed his legs, and fell down. There was about a yard and a half, between the coach and waggon, when it passed. I should think there was four or five yards between the waggon and the curb.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see Simpkin - A. Not till after it was over. The coach went about ten yards at the shuffling trot. The accident happened forty or fifty yards off. The Gosport Coach was ten or fifteen yards beyond the waggon when it happened. The waggon was bearing on the coach, and I suppose the coachman hollowed out to him, and then he turned his horses out again. I was standing behind the coach.</p>

            . I am an ironmonger, and live at Maidenhead. I was a passenger on the Malborough Coach. Just as we got opposite the Marquis of Granby the Gosport Coach set off. The waggon was by the side of it. The bodies were nearly abreast, and I saw the deceased either strike, or attempt to strike the Gosport coachman with his long whip, and in consequence of the smack of the whip, as I suppose, the waggon horses went on a trot. I saw the deceased attempting to hold the traces of his waggon; he fell and both the waggon wheels went over his legs. The Gosport Coach was then several yards before the waggon. Our coach was beyond the waggon, and the Gosport Coach was before ours.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you sit - A. Outside, in front, on the near side, with my face towards the horses' heads. The coach started just as we got opposite it. There was no racing. I am positive the waggoner attempted to strike the coachman. Just as it was setting off he was near his hind horse. I have seen coaches pass well in less space, and without danger.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. There was room enough to pass without danger. Quite sufficient - if he had been an active man he could have got out of the way.</p>

            . I was standing at the door of the Marquis of Granby when the coach started. The waggon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170020"/>was then a little behind the coach. There was something the matter with the reins, which detained the coachman a few seconds; and in that time the waggon drew up, and rather drew on him. The coachman was deprived of the reins of the near side. Somebody extricated them. He was then in the kennel, by the footpath - the waggon having drawn nearer on him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Daddy or father, hold off a bit." He held off, and then the coachman pulled his horses out of the kennel further into the road; and just as he got past the waggon horse, the waggon leader horse shyed towards the side of the Marlborough Coach. I believe the horses got right of themselves, and went away in a smartish trot. It shyed at something on the off side. I saw the man with his legs crossed; he appeared feeble. I said,</p>
               <p>"that man will be under the wheel" - I saw him catching at the chains; and it had such an affect on me, I closed my eyes for a few seconds, and then saw him fall on his left side. I don't attribute the accident to the prisoner's coach. I ran to the man's assistance, and assisted the medical gentleman as well as I could. When he was collected, I asked how he came by the accident. He said, his daughter told him, before he left home, he should die; that he knew his death was come; that he was knocked down by his own horse, and run over by his own wheels; that it was an accident, and could not be helped.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell the Coroner all this - A. I was not suffered to speak, or any one else, scarcely.</p>

He came very near me; I said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, are you going to run over us" - he went a little further down, turned back, and came towards me; but not so fast; he stood and went back again towards Tyburn, at a fastish trot up the road. He came back in about an hour and a half fall gallop, whipping his horse all the way; I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't go so fast, you'll run over somebody," he did not answer, but kept whipping his horse - I was below Bond-street. I knew the deceased very well, his name was

               <p>"For God's don't go so fast, you will do mischief." Mine was the first coach on the stand. Downs was crossing from the middle to the side to get out of the way. Several people hollowed to him, but he took no notice. The cart came so quick on Downs that he turned himself sideways, and the shaft and the horse's shoulder caught him, and struck him about the head and shoulder, shoved him forward about a yard and a half, and then the off wheel went over him - the prisoner continued whipping his horses more and more to get out of the way; he was followed but got out of my sight.</p>

I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner in a cart galloping; I never heard him call to the man to get out of the way - the horse knocked him down, and cut his head open. I saw him whip his horse twice after he went over the deceased. He certainly must have seen and known that he had ran over him.

            . On Saturday, the 23d of March, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I received six shillings from Mr. Webb. The prisoner Leach was present. Mr. Green who was present, said he would see me out the back way, for fear I should be robbed; and Leach said he would see me frighted; so I went out with him in front. I was going home to Phillip Street, Curtain Road; Taylor, was outside the door; we all three went together to the Swan. He (Leach), asked Taylor to have some beer. We went in and had two pots of beer; we all three went in, and two or three doors off Taylor threw an old coat over me; Leach was a few yards before, and threw me down, and took the money out of my left-hand. I had 5 s. I had lent him 1 s. as we came along, as he asked me. I got up directly and cried Stop theif! I saw Leach before me but could not see Taylor; I told him I had lost my money; he said</p>
               <p>"If you run round the corner, you can catch him." Leach went on; I picked up the coat and walked on, and saw Leach at the corner of Essex-street, Kingsland Road; he said I shall stop here. I went home and told my father. I am sure Taylor robbed me. I knew him before. They were taken on Monday morning.</p>

The prisoner came up to me, and said he was to meet a gentleman there at eleven o'clock, to examine the pipes in the kitchen, as he was going to have tin pipes put instead of leaden ones. He stopped a few minutes, and then went down. I followed him to light him out, but he turned back at the bottom of the stairs, and pulling a piece of cord out, said he would take the dimensions of the pipes, and give the gentleman an answer when he called; I let him go into the kitchen alone. Franklin called to me in about five minutes, to know if I had let the man out; I said No. I went down to the kitchen and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170022"/>found he had pulled the leaden pipe out of the sink, and laid it on the window, and had a small piece of it in his hand; he said</p>
               <p>"This is what I want, for I must have something to make the tin pipe the same size, and must take it and the brass top to fit it." He went away with the pipe. He had pulled it away from the sink. I thought it not right to let him go without orders, and I asked him who authorized him to come and take it away. He said</p>
               <p>"The gentleman who has taken the house." I said</p>
               <p>"No gentleman has taken the house." He said</p>

I saw Dawson with him half an hour before, a quarter of a mile off. I saw Little walk into the house, and Dawson on the opposite side; Little came out with something under a cloth; they both ran off together towards Bromley. I alarmed the house. I saw them together, pursued, and seized Little in a privy at Bromley. He had nothing then.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of February, about half past two o'clock in the morning, I saw a person going up Short's-gardens, and in two minutes after I heard some dogs bark; a rattle sprang. I run up Keeton's premises, and on a kind of gallery on the first floor, I heard something drop. I got on the parapet, and found the prisoner laying in the gutter, and about 50 lbs. of lead close to him, which I compared with the gutter; it fitted. A knife was found just by him.</p>

               <p>Mrs. SUSANNAH BOYLE. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 2nd of November last the prisoner came into our service, at 14 l. per annum wages. Up to the 27th of February she conducted herself to my satisfaction. She asked permission to leave the house on the 25th, for medical advice. On Wednesday, the 27th of February, about half-past ten in the morning, I left the house with my nursery-maid and the children - leaving Eden, (the house-maid) and prisoner in the house. I returned ten minutes before twelve - found the closet locked - on unlocking it I looked for a tea-spoon, but could find none, and called for Eden, the house-maid. The prisoner was not in the house; and I saw no more of her. She had given me no intimation of her leaving. The table-spoons were also gone from the closet. I went up stairs to a drawer, where part of the plate was kept, and found the lock disorded and a key broken in it. In the after-part of the day I missed the two pelisses, a shawl, a scarf, a pair of stays, and the other articles stated in the indictment. They are worth 25 l. I had some things at the mangle, and sent orders that they should not be delivered to her if she called.</p>

            . I am house-maid to Mr. Boyle. The prisoner was also servant there. I occasionally fetched water from St. John-street. On the 27th of February, about a half-past ten or nearer eleven o'clock, she asked me if I was going for water - only she and I were in the house. She wished me to fetch the water, and get her a watch ribbon. I asked what sort - she said she would leave it to me choice. I washed up the tea things and she assisted me to put them in a closet in the dining-room, which is close to the kitchen. The plate in common use was kept in that closet - there were table and tea spoons, a silver mug, wine strainer, fish knife, a butter knife, four salt spoons, and desert spoons, there at that time. She went down and cleaned her boots and put them on, saying, that her feet ached with the shoes she had on. She only spoke once about my getting the water, I should have gone at that time if she had not spoken. She folded the clothes for me to take to the mangle - and told me to take them, and tell the women to do them directly; and that I would call for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about her work - A. She intended cleaning her kitchen, and the bed-room. I went out about eleven o'clock, and had not the least idea of her leaving. The key was in the cupboard door, and every thing safe when I went out. I returned in about twenty-five minutes - she was gone and never returned. - Mistress came home in about ten minutes, and asked me for a tea spoon. I said they were all in the closet, and on looking, all the plate was gone. I went up into my own room, and missed the property stated in the indictment as mine (enumerating them), which were all safe when I left the house. The prisoner's box was also gone. I saw my things again last Tuesday - they have been brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you went for water were you not going to buy some for fur yourself - and I asked you to buy me a watch ribbon - A. Yes, I was to buy her ribbon at the same time.</p>

            . I live in West-street, Smithfield. On the 27th of February, about eleven or a quarter past eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to my house; she knocked at my mother's door, and asked for a person named Jones; my mother went to her; I afterwards saw her; she begged the favour to leave a box which she had with her; I gave her leave. She asked if it would be safe; I said</p>
               <p>"If you do not think it safe, do not leave it." She said she had had words with her mistress, and had left her place, and was going back to settle with her; that she could not go out in that condition, and pulled out of her box a black gown and spencer, and put them on, and went away. She went out first without changing her dress, and then changed it, and my husband took away the box with her. She gave me a red whittle and an old cap instead of money, saying that her mistress had not paid her in small change. Next morning I went with these things to Mr. Boyle, and stated what I knew.</p>

            . I am turnkey of Giltspur-street Compter. In the night of the 24th of March, about one o'clock, the prisoner knocked at the Compter door. I admitted her. She asked if I knew her; I hesitated, and he said she came to give herself up to justice. I asked her a few questions, and put her to bed with two other women. She said she should say nothing till she had seen Mr. Williams or Mr. Boyle, and intimated a wish to see them. I knew of this matter from hand-bills which had been left with me. She was genteelly dressed, and had this pelisse and shawl on. I brought Mr. Boyle to her next morning.</p>

            . I live in Francis-place, Westminster-road. My husband keeps a clothes shop; the prisoner lived in the neighbourhood. The prisoner came to my house, and asked me to buy eighteen duplicates. I said I did not know whether they would do, as my husband was out. He left them with me, and I advanced him 5 s. My husband advised me to return them, but he did not call again for them. I gave them up to Clinton.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. On the 20th of March, between three and four o'clock, I was in the New road, and saw the prisoner driving at a most furious rate, with two more in a chaise; near Battle Bridge, he ran against a gentlemans' horse, and cut him. I stopped him for the assault. I detained the mare which was in the chaise, and sent her to the WhiteHart; he told me that he had brought her and a grey poney which he had sold, from Cokefield, and that they belonged to his brother; that he was going to Harford with the mare, and then to Ware, to a Mr. Godfrey, who was to give him 25 l. for it. He at first said he had sold it; and drove it in the chaise to see if he could warrant it to go quiet in harness, he was very drunk.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you get acquainted with him. - A. About eighteen months ago, at Melksham; my father wished to prevent our marriage, and said he heard he had a wife, but I placed confidence in him; he always denied having a wife.</p>

On the 5th of March, two little boys came in at dusk, for a halfpenny worth of cakes; they went away, and in the morning I missed this property, which hung on a chair - they might have taken them while I turned to get the cakes.

As soon as he unscrewed the shutters he looked round, then pulled out one of the drawers, and I saw him put the drawer too - I considered he had taken what he thought proper; he walked round the counter and took some of the shutters down - I walked forward when he was at the back of the warehouse, ordered the doors to be closed, and as he advanced I said, " William, you are robbing us," he denied it - I said</p>
               <p>"It is of no use denying it, walk into the counting-house;" he pulled out two or three needles, I said,</p>
               <p>"You have more, produce all you have;" and reluctantly he pulled out some packages of needles. We searched him and found in the whole three thousand four hundred on him.</p>

               <p>"April 8th, 3 l. making 10 l," to be the prisoner's hand writing. We went with the prisoner to William's, Great Arthur-street, Golden-lane, he took us there; but we had great difficulty to get him to take us there; it is a chandler's shop - we found Williams there; the prisoner was asked,</p>
               <p>"Is that the man you have taken the pins and needles to," he said Yes. Williams was asked if he knew him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes," Drinkwater searched. Before this I saw nearly a quire of paper on the counter, which I recognised as our property, from its particular manufacture. I saw a needle case found on the premises, and under the bed two brown paper parcels; one containing 14 lbs. of pins, and the other 24 lbs. in papers as we pack them; the prisoner stated that he took them there, and we found a memorandum which led us there.</p>

I went and waited till four o'clock, when he came with some papers and a pen in his hand, and said he was sorry to keep me so long, and asked if I had got the change, I said Yes; he asked for the bill, I said he had that. I shewed him a stamped receipt; he said that would do very well, and I must follow him to Lloyd's, and at the top of the stairs he told me to wait and he would be with me directly; I waited a few minutes - he came, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got the change ready, give me the change, and sign this paper;" I endeavoured all I could to sign it, but the pen he gave would not write - there was grease at the end of it; he had got the change; he said,</p>
               <p>"I will get a fresh pen," and went into the Coffee-house again, as I thought for that purpose, but he never returned; I did not see him till he was taken up eight days after. I never saw the merchant. I gave him two sovereigns and 10 s.</p>

The prisoner is my uncle; we were formerly partners in selling pens and quills - the partnership ceased three years ago. I had a dispute about his wife's business some time ago, before the Magistrate, but none with him. She, him, my wife, and I, were at Lambeth-street Office together in March; his wife made a charge against mine, which was dismissed. On the following afternoon, about five o'clock, I was in my kitchen, the prisoner knocked eight or nine times; I knew his voice; he called me a b **** and a thief, and threatened me with my life to come up; I went up and opened the door - my child was not with me. I opened the door and as I trod off the wooden step on the stone step of the door, I received a stab on my right side, and as I came off the step I received another in my hand. I had said nothing at all to him; I saw nothing in his hand at any time. After he had stabbed me, my wife picked up the knife - I never saw it in his hand - I struck him with a broom stick which I had in my hand before he stabbed me - it was by the threshold of my door where he stabbed me. I struck him with the broom stick on the head; I was on the ground. I was pulled down, I cannot say by whom, there was so many there - the people came up seeing the scuffle. I do not know how I came on the ground. I went to my father and shewed him how I was stabbed, and then returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get away from where you lay down - A. Three or four people lifted me up, I do not know them. I believe the prisoner ran away. I did not strike him before he stabbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After you struck him did you not both pull off your clothes, and fight for a quarter of an hour - A. No, we did not fight at all, that I swear. We live next door but one to each other.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you give your wife the knife - A. She picked it off the ground. I never said I would hang my uncle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you never said that when your uncle struck you and you were going to strike him, that you saw a knife under his coat sleeve - A. I do not know that I ever did. I believe he kicked me when I was on the ground, but I was insensible. I said that a young man who is gone to Brighton parted us.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call out that you were stabbed immediately - A. I was afraid, because my wife was in the family way.</p>

             came up in ten or fifteen minutes, and opened the door; the moment he got off the wooden step on the pavement, he pulled his knife from his sleeve and stabbed him; I saw this quite plain.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not your name Cook - A. I have gone by that name; it is my mother's maiden name. I have not seen my husband for twelve months. I get my living as I can. I let a room to three females.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the uncle and nephew fight long - A. I did not stay to see, for when the blood came from his hand I went in doors. I went out again in a quarter of an hour and saw him come out in his shirt and say,</p>
               <p>"Look here how I am stabbed."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you let out a room for unlawful purposes to men and woman - A. I let the room to the women, they do as they please.

            . I am dresser to the London Hospital; I was called in to see the prosecutor a quarter of an hour after, he had received a wound in his right breast; I probed it, it was about three inches deep, and in a slanting direction; I should suppose it was given by such an instrument as the knife produced, it was a serious wound, I ordered leeches to it, the shirt was bloody before they were ordered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not very deep. - A. It had struck against one of the breast bones and glanced off; if it had not been for the bone it would have penetrated the lungs; the cut in the waistcoat corresponds with the place the wound is in.</p>

            . I am a porter; I was on London Terrace, Commercial Road; I saw this man rather in a rage talking about somebody, and all of a sudden a door opened, the prosecutor came out with a broom stick in his hand, and struck the prisoner as hard as he could; the prisoner did nothing to him before the man struck him; he was without his coat and his shirt sleeves turned up; then the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and a scuffle ensued for three or four minutes, or rather better, the prosecutor got him against a back wall and pummel led him well, so that he could not see out of his eye, and his face was all over a gore of blood; the prosecutor went in doors and I left. I saw the prosecutor go into his house; they were both quarrelling and fighting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are quite sure the prisoner's face was all in a gore of blood - A. Quite, and his eye was quite swollen, he had scratches and pinches on his face; they were quite plain, so that every body might see them.</p>

I heard my brother's voice; I called her up to the door; he was speaking loud; I went up and saw my son George open his street door, he lives two doors from me; he opened his door with a broom stick in hand and struck his uncle over his head; he staggered, then he threw the stick down and struck him with his fist till he fell; then my brother pulled his coat off - my son had none on, and they fought for a quarter of an hour. When my son came out he struck him instantly with the stick, and the blood gushed out of his temples. After fighting my brother was taken into his own house and then into mine; he was very bloody. In about a quarter of an hour my son came to my door, and said, he was stabbed; this was the first I heard of it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why not say you was stabbed before you fought;" he opened his breast and shewed it me, and I did not see a drop of blood, it looked like a wound. My son has said, he would go twenty miles to hang his uncle at any time; and my son hung himself once, about twelve years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that when he presented his side to you, there was no appearance of a wound or blood - A. None; I saw a wound but no blood.

On the day before I received a letter from Mr. Abbott, I opened it in the prisoner's presence, it contained a 20 l. note; she was sitting by my side at needle-work; the note fell down by the side of the fire, and she picked it up; and gave it me; I said</p>
               <p>"Mary there is a 20 l. note, pick it up;" this was about half-past twelve; I gave the note to Mr. Revett, when he came home after candle-light, I gave it him in the letter; he went out to get it changed but could not; he then put it in the cash-box, and locked it; he took the box up stairs, when we went to bed, and put it on the drawers in our bedroom. On Sunday about half-past one, I went to the cash-box; my husband was not at home; I had taken the key out of his pocket in the morning, and placed it in the looking-glass drawer which was locked; this was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I opened it about half-past one, and took out 6 s. in silver; I did not then see the 20 l. note; I did not look for it; I only went to the silver drawer; I immediately locked the cash-box, and placed it between the bed and the mattress; I am confident that I locked the box; I carried it by the handle, and if it had not been locked it would have opened in my hand; I was very particular in locking it; I left home a few minutes after this, and went to where my husband was; I came home with him in a coach about nine o'clock; we were not sent for; I found several people round the fore garden gate, and there was an alarm of fire; I found several people up stairs; but my conversation was directed to the prisoner, whom I found sitting in the parlour, by the door; Mr. Balls was up stairs; I asked the prisoner how the fire came, she said, she did not know; I repeatedly asked her, and received the same answer; she did not move from her seat, but appeared quite unconcerned; Mr. Revett went up stairs; I saw the bed-room before he came down, and I saw the bed-hangings were burnt, and the bed was on fire then; I had given the prisoner leave to go to chapel that evening; I went to Mrs. Ball's house, which is five minutes walk, and returned shortly; Mr. Revett then produced the cash-box, and the 20 l. note was missing, he said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you know something of this," she denied it; he said,</p>
               <p>"There should be a 20 l. note in this cash-box," I had replaced the key in the dressing-glass drawer, it was not produced at this time; Mr. Revett said, it would be better to have every person in the place searched before they left, which was done by the parish constable; the prisoner was still sitting in the same place all the time; till the officer desired her to go into the other room to be searched. The note was not found, she fainted away, and was afterwards searched; the outside of the box was burnt, a sovereign which I had left in it, and some silver was still there; the prisoner had frequently seen me take money out of the box - I am sure I did not leave it in the state it was found.</p>

            . I came home with Mrs. Revett; I had put the 20 l. note in this cash-box, (producing it) under this bill of exchange, and placed the inner box, containing the silver and gold over it; when I came home at night I went up stairs, and perceived, on approaching the bedroom, that the curtains were on fire and nearly consumed, and immediately on my reaching the top of the stairs, Balls handed the cash-box to me; the bolt of the lock was shot, but the asp was not in it; the bed was partly burnt; the straw pallias appeared to have been set fire to in four places; the bed furniture was entirely consumed; the posts of the bedstead were partly burnt; but the sacking particularly, over a place where it appeared to me a fire had been kindled on the floor; a place in the floor and wainscoat were burnt; also the paper of the room, and the bed-board; that was all the damage. When I missed the 20 l. note I saw the prisoner sitting in the parlour, I said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you know something of this," she said,</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Sir, I do not;" I then ordered a general search; I directed Williams to go to Ball, and search his lodging, as he had been at my house; he is a relation by marriage; I went with him; the note has not been found. When the prisoner was going to be searched she appeared agitated and fainted - immediately after the search she was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you got the pieces of the floor here - A. Yes; the wainscoat and paper were also burnt; it appeared that the object was to conceal the note being stolen -

            . I went to Mr. Revett's house on this day; I got there at half-past four o'clock, before my husband; I found the prisoner alone; I went to enquire if her mistress was out, (I am Mr. Revett's aunt) and if she wished to go to chapel I was to keep house for her; she said, her mistress had given her leave to go out; Mr. Revett had asked us to come in the evening, and let her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170036"/>go to chapel; I returned home to tea, and came back to the house a little before six; the right hand parlour shutters were shut up, and one of the kitchens; she went to chapel as she said, and returned at a quarter-past eight o'clock. I was in the house the whole time, and in the left hand parlour the principal part of the time. When I first entered the house after she was gone I searched every room, it was about six o'clock, being alone I thought it proper; I saw nothing in disorder at all; I searched the bed-room, and looked under the bedstead, there was no sign of fire or any thing to occasion it; the bed curtains were neatly folded and laid upon the pillow; the bed was not turned down; I had no candle, it was not dark enough; when I came down, as the kitchen was shut up, and the cellar dark, I lighted a candle which was left on a table in the parlour, I lighted it at the parlour fire; I looked round in the cellar, kitchen, and closet, under the stairs, then returned to the parlour and put the candle out; I did not go into the bed-room with the candle; I saw nothing of the cash-box; there was no fire in the bed-room grate, nor in any room but one parlour and one kitchen; the prisoner returned at a quarter-past eight o'clock, I had lighted the candle then, and she took it from the parlour to go into the kitchen to light her kitchen candle, and pull off her things; she came up with my candle, I asked her if she had been to chapel, and if she was in time; she said Yes; I asked who preached, and what was the text; she said, she did not recollect it; Mr. Balls came at half-past eight, and sat with me; I then told the prisoner we would take some bread and cheese and porter for supper, and return, observing that I supposed Mr. Revett would not be offended; she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" and brought up the tray, and fetched some porter. We then thought it would be best for one of us to stop till Mr. Revett came home, and I left Mr. Balls there.</p>

            . I came in and had bread and cheese; my wife went home; the prisoner came into the parlour, took a candle and went out of the parlour, and shut the door, she staid out nearly ten minutes, and came again into the parlour, and set the candle on the side board; I do not know whether it was lighted; when she came in she sat down on a chair by the door; I never knew her do so before; I had not asked her to sit down; I said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you had better come nearer the fire," and moved to let her; we talked for ten or fifteen minutes about Eagle-street chapel; I then smelt fire, and said,</p>
               <p>"Molly, I smell fire;" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have a time or two."</p>
               <p>Q. Once or twice you mean - A. Yes, I took the candle off the table and went up stairs; the smell increased, and when I got to the chamber-door, I saw the smoke coming from between the door and door post. I called out and said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, the bed is on fire," she was still sitting in the parlour. I came down to her, went to the front door and gave the alarm of fire; she still sat there and did not stir to give any alarm; she was crying and did not speak to me. I went over the way to Messrs. Brooks to give the alarm, and returned immediately; I took a candle and went down to get water; the fire was extinguished; Mr. Brooks, Ellen and Williams came into the house and assisted. The prisoner remained sitting in the parlour till Mr. Revett came home; Williams found the cash box and handed it to me; I gave it Mr. Revett in the same state as I received it, it was very hot; I went down with him; his account is true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you came down, having discovered the fire, you at once went to the door and gave an alarm - A. I did, I was gone a very short time leaving her alone in the house; she could have escaped if she choose, or while I was up stairs. She fainted when the constable ordered her into another room to be searched; it was not proposed for a woman to search her - the road is open to the house in front; there is a brick wall behind, seven feet high, a back door leads to the garden.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After your wife left did any body come in - A. Nobody. I should think the place could not have been set fire to a quarter of an hour before I discovered it. I cannot say whether the bed was turned down or not, the back door was bolted; I saw the watchman open it to get at the water-butt.</p>
               <p>MRS. BALLS. I was alone in the house about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose that after you examined the room, if any body had set fire to the bed directly after, must you not have discovered it - A. Yes. The back door leading to the garden was bolted and barred, and the shutters also.</p>

            . I am Mr. Revett's servant. On the Saturday I had bought nine bundles of fire wood - I used a bundle and a half on Sunday morning, and left half a bundle in the dresser drawer, and put seven in the cupboard under the stairs, the prisoner was in the kitchen and knew this. After the alarm, next morning, I looked in the closet and found only three bundles; but next morning I found two more in a foul clothes basket, which stood in the same closet - I might have put them there myself; only two bundles were then missing. I know that the prisoner had a cambric muslin slip, which is a sort of petticoat with a body and short sleeves - I saw it on the floor of the bed-room, were we both slept, on Sunday morning; she had worn it on the Saturday - it was old but serviceable. On the Monday I saw part of it between the bed and mattress in our bed-room, and the other part I did not find. When I came home with my master and mistress, the prisoner was in the parlour; I asked her where the fire was, she said she did not know - I asked her three times, she said she did not know whether there had been any fire in the house or not. I asked why she did not get a light for the men who were going down stairs getting the water; she said nothing. After she was searched I asked her if she went any where besides to chapel; she said not in the evening, but she went in the morning to No. 11, Saffron-hill; I asked her again in the morning about the text, she said she could not remember the chapter or verse, but the words were,</p>

He went away, and in twenty minutes returned crying, and said he had been knocked down in Austin Friars, by three people and robbed of the money, that he had taken it out of his pocket, with the notice to see where he was to go to; that as they met him, one of them struck him in the eye, mouth, and stomach, and knocked him down, and took the money from him; that they lifted him up, and put him on a step of a door, and left him. I sent for Mr. Richardson, and kept him there till he came, he gave the same account again.

Richard was not there; I did not see him that day - I saw him on Thursday morning at his lodgings. I whistled as I went by, and was let in by Jane's sister. I went up and saw the prisoner and Jane in the bed. Richard asked if I would have any thing to drink; he sent Harriet for gin and peppermint, and after it was drank Richard gave the bolster to Harriet, and asked her to give me the notes out of it. She was a long time getting them out. She emptied all the feathers out, and at last found them. He looked at them, and said</p>

               <p>"It is all right; give me the bolster - put the feathers in, and I will put them where I can place my hand on them." He put them in again, and she sewed the bolster up; and after breakfast, at eleven o'clock, Richard, I, and Mason, went out together<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170038"/>to go to Covent Garden. Richard gave Mason some sovereigns. I told him to walk on one side of the way, and we two would walk on the other, to avoid suspicion.

               <p>Q. Did he at last give you any money? - A. On the Saturday morning I went up stairs - he gave me what he said was 500 l., and twenty sovereigns, to take care of for him, I said I would. It was in two bank notes, one was a 200 l. I saw him again on Sunday; and he told me that his brother went to borrow some money for his master to take up a bill; and when he had got the money he gave it to him, and said he had been knocked down and robbed of it. When Richard gave me the money, he said,</p>

It was not taken till the Friday following. He told me to take a pound or two when I wanted it, but not to take the notes. He put some rag over the notes, and then wrapped the sovereigns up in it.</p>

On the 5th of March I was sent for - I and Mr. Richardson, the prisoner George, and Mr. Sterry went to Austin Friars, where he said he was robbed; he pointed out the spot where he was robbed; we could find nobody there that knew any thing of it. He said it happened about four o'clock. Next day I went after Richard, and found him at last, at Ingram's, the Sun, in Bedfordbury. I had very hard work to get him away. I was surrounded immediately I seized him, and unless I I had produced my fire arms, I should not have secured him. He made very great resistance. I was forced out of the skittle-ground into the tap-room. I found 24 s. 6 d. on him.</p>

            'S, Defence. I have nothing to state only the manner I was robbed of the money. When the bill was presented to Mr. Richardson, I was not aware I was going to take it up. The direction was left, and about eleven or twelve o'clock, I took it to Mr. Sterry's, and told him the bill was due. He called afterwards, and said,</p>
               <p>"Send somebody between three and four o'clock for the money." I was not aware I was going to take it up, till I was sent. Mr. Richardson sometimes took them up himself. I left Mr. Richardson's at half-past three in the afternoon; previous to that, about ten minutes before, I had to go to Thomas-street. I had met my brother in the morning, and went with him to have something to drink, at the Cock. He had a young woman with him, and said he was going to the Cock. The last time I saw him, was twenty minutes after three, and then I did not know I was going to take up the bill. When I returned, I was ordered to go to Mr. Sterry's I stopped there ten minutes before I received the money, which was given me from a parcel of notes. I went out of Mr. Sterry's front door, and along London Wall, up Winchester-street, to Austin Friars, and in the notes I had the direction of the bill. Not being sure of the number, I unfortunately pulled the notes out of my pocket, and looked at the direction; at the moment three very genteel persons passed me, and the moment I put the money in my pocket. I received a blow on the back of my neck; at the same moment one in my mouth, and one on the chest which knocked me down, and completely deprived me of speech; two of the persons lifted me up by the arms, and placed me on the step, and run towards Broad-street; the contrary way to that they were going when they met me. I was not able to call after them through the blow, but run as well as I was able, the way they went; but never saw them after they crossed the corner of Austin Friars. I run as fast as I could up Threadneedle-street, but could not see them; I returned the same way as I came to Mr. Sterry's, and several people asked me what was the matter. I said I had been robbed. I make no doubt but they would have gone with me if I had asked them. I then thought it most advisable to make the best of my way back to Mr. Sterry's, and endeavour, if possible, to stop the number of the notes. I stated to them the manner in which I had lost it, they asked me if I should know the persons again, if I saw them. I said I was certain I should know two of them; Mr. Sterry said I must come to the Mansion House. I went before the Lord Mayor, and stated the manner I had lost the money. Mr. Richardson and Mr. Sterry were sometime together with the Lord Mayor. We then went back to Mr. Sterry's, and staid there till near eleven o'clock; they then said they did not believe what I had said. Mr. Richardson, I believe, objected to my being taken into custody that night, and I was taken to his house, where I remained all night, and next morning proceeded to business as usual, and opened the shop, swept the door, and brushed the windows, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170039"/>about nine o'clock Mr. Richardson went out, and did not return till about eleven. He had told me previous to going out that I must go before the Lord Mayor, and undergo an examination. I said I was willing, and about eleven o'clock I went. I was not in custody, I had abundant opportunity to escape, if I had been guilty, but I knew I was innocent.</p>

            'S Defence. I recollect being in company with my brother on the day in question, as I was in the habit of seeing him three or four times a week; the first time I met him was about half-past twelve o'clock, on Ludgate-hill, I was in company with a young woman, he said he was going to Holborn; I said, I was going to have something to drink at the Cock, and would wait there for him; he came there and went home; I waited there after he had left me, till about a quarter past three, and just as I was coming away he came there a second time. I asked him to sit down, and if he could stop; he said he was going to Thames-street and could not wait. We all came out together from the Cock, and stood a few minutes talking at the door; I went towards Temple-bar with the woman. I wish to make a few observations as to Hayes. He acknowledges I did not know where he lived; I leave it to you to consider whether it is likely that I should leave so much money in care of a person to whom I was a stranger. If I had counsel it would be plainer to your Lordship. On the first examination he swore it was a 300 l. and 200 l. - On the second, he said it was a 200 l. note, and the other might be a song for what he knew. He mentions likewise in his statement a third person named Harriet, who, if she was brought forward, could perhaps greatly corroborate his testimony. These witnesses, I submit, are kept away, because if they were questioned as to Hayes's character (for I know for many years it has been no good) he has been an utterer of forged notes. As to Hopper, the first I knew of him was his being procured as an hired bail for me at Lambeth-street, for which he received 10 s.; he went to my father and offered not to come against me for 20 l., and he sent into the gaol to say if I sent him out 2 l. he would not appear.</p>

             and M'Carthy were prisoners there. We were all in the same yard; I saw Dempsey throwing some sopped bread at the prisoner out of the yard, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, just after breakfast; the bread hit him on the shoulder; the prisoner took no notice of it, but went down stairs; Dempsey followed him, threw more pieces of bread at him, which hit him on the back. As he was going down stairs the prisoner said, if he did not be easy he would hit him on the top knot; then the prisoner went up stairs again and the deceased threw more bread at him; then the prisoner kicked at him, but missed him; they then both got together and struggled, and both fell; he did not strike him, but threw him in the struggle; the prisoner was uppermost, they got up again - had another scuffle - I saw no blows, the deceased fell again, and the prisoner at the top. Dempsey seemed hurt and said, he would not fight any more, and leant his head on the table. He died in the afternoon. He laid hold of the prisoner's foot and began the wrestling.</p>

            , ESQ. I am surgeon of Newgate; I saw Dempsey between twelve and one o'clock, he was then dying very fast, and died in three minutes; I opened his body, the internal appearances were perfectly healthy, and completely free from the appearance of violence, there was no appearance of scratch or bruise; I examined his head particularly, there was a rupture of one of the principle arteries, and six ounces of blood were taken out, that caused his death - it is impossible to say it was in consequence of the fall.</p>

Salter walked across to the Maunder as soon as he saw me going aft; Jennings was walking on the Maunder, Salter said something to him, and when I called the officers to my assistance, they both went into the Maunder's cabin, I saw them both come out together and lean over, and one of them threw something over into the water, it floated, and then something was thrown in which sunk; I said to Salter you have made a pretty thing of it; he said, I had a d - d sight to say about it; nobody was near the Maunder but Salter, he was within eight feet of it; Culverhouse picked up the thing which floated, it was two large bladders; we took them into custody; Roebuck searched the Maunder and found a bladder smaller than the one which was full of rum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You never saw Jennings out of his boat - A. He has got the palsy in one arm; the rum was running when I discovered it; Salter got over two or three lug boats into the Maunder - it was moon-light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How many vessels were there in the bason - A. I do not know, the Joseph laid a-head of the Maunder - I was walking on the quay to keep myself warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not these men in the habit of passing from one vessel to the other to keep themselves warm - A. They walk on their own vessels, but not from one to another; I have seen them do it - I had been walking about for a quarter of an hour on the quay.</p>

I afterwards went into the Maunder, Roebuck came out of the cabin with the skin in his hand, I pulled two bladders out of the water just a-stern of the Maunder.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. - Q. There were many other boats in the bason - A. A great many, most of them touched each other; there were four excise watchmen in charge of different boats, including the prisoner's, no other vessels had a cargo.</p>

I never saw Marsh there. I went there on the 14th, and on the 16th, I lost the articles stated in the indictment. They were worth above 5 l. altogether. I left the silk gown in a box unlocked in a closet in my room. The pelisse hung in the same closet, and the rest of the things were in a large hat-box in the room. I left them there safe about five in the afternoon of the 16th. Gilson went out on the 6th. I cannot say whether she carried any thing out with her. She went out again in about a quarter of an hour; it was then a little after seven o'clock. She said to me,</p>

I said I would certainly charge an officer with him; he dared me to do it; I took him towards the watch-house; he went willingly, but when he found me in earnest, he resisted and ran off; I cried Stop thief! and he was taken.

            . I was at work on the premises. I saw the prisoner come across the parlour floor, about nine o'clock; he had no business there. I saw Down pursue him; he returned and gave an alarm. The prisoner ran away; I pursued him to his lodging; he was concealed there, and denied to me; I went and got Down, and then secured him in Hanover Square; he made great resistance, and said he had nothing; at last he took me to a building, where we found them.</p>

On Saturday, the 23d of February, I was sitting in the counting-house on the wharf, and on turning my head, saw Driscoll climbing the fence; I did not suspect anything - five minutes after I saw him pulling the pailling down, and pulling some old rope through - I told the watchman to take them, they ran off, but he secured the prisoner. I cannot swear to the rope.</p>

               <p>"You need not be alarmed, all is right," and placed herself by my side, and she asked me a great many questions, and occasionally smacking my pocket which had the watch in, I thought I felt her hand in my pocket, she made a spring from me, I missed my watch, she ran down stairs and got into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170046"/>room on the left side of the passage, and fastened herself in; I ran up stairs and broke the windows, in order to procure assistance; the landlord called the watchman, two watchmen came up, and after some time they got her, and went to the watch-house; some altercation took place between me and the landlord, and in the mean time the watchmen and the prisoner disappeared; I went to Bow-street and described her, the watchmen are not here; I believe they would rather give evidence in her favour; she was taken again between seven and eight o'clock; I was merry, but had my recollection about me; I might have been drunk when I went to the Constitution; I might be under the influence of liquor when I went with her, but was not deprived of my recollection.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 22d of March I saw the prisoner in York-street, Westminster, with something very heavy in a basket; he had no cart then; I followed him into Orchard-street; he turned into a marine store-shop, and put the basket into a scale; the master was behind the counter; I asked the prisoner what was in the basket; he hesitated, and said, it was a bit of lead which he had brought from Five-fields, Pimlico; I asked where there, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I may as well tell you the truth, it is a piece I brought from my masters building, in St. John-street."</p>

On the 24th of March, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and said he knew of a customer for her; I took him to the stable, and went with him and the pony to shew to the customer - I asked who it was, he said if I went with him he would shew me; he took me to New-street, Carnaby-market; we went into a public-house, and had a pint of beer, then went to another public-house - he went in, and I stood at the door with the mare; he came out, and said the man was at the Ship, public-house, in Wardour-street - I went to Wardour-street, with him and the mare; he went into a public-house there, and gave the halter to a foot soldier, who stood at the door, to hold. I was standing by, and a man named Balls came up, and pretended to look at it - the prisoner was in the public-house at this time; I went in and asked him if Balls was the man who was to be the customer - he came out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Balls you are the man I was looking for, this is the thing that will just suit you;" I had hold of the halter then. Balls said,</p>
               <p>"I think it is rather stiff behind." The prisoner took the halter out of my hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"No it ayn't, you shall see;" he jumped on her back, and rode away with her - I thought he was coming back, and went up the street, returned in about ten minutes, and Balls was gone also. I knew the prisoner before. I went to Ball's house, as I knew he lived just by, and asked if he had seen him; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! no I have not seen him since," and he did not want to have any thing to do with it. I have never found it. I saw the prisoner a fortnight or three weeks after, about nine or ten o'clock at night in bed - I did not know I had a right to take him, and while I went down to tell the watchman; he left his bed, and could not be found. On the Thursday following I saw him in the Haymarket, took hold of him, and told him I wanted him to come with me; he said if I would go home with him, he would - I went part of the way, and met

He never represented that he meant to purchase it. I have known him twelve months by sight, but did not know where he lived. I had refused 3 l. 10 s. for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Large pay you for it - A. No. The prisoner came to me about nine o'clock. I believe the soldier stood by when the prisoner took the mare. I did not know Balls before - I did not entrust it with the prisoner to go and sell for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been after him, and said to his friends<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170050"/>that the money was all you wanted - A. That was after he was taken. I never said I gave him authority to sell her, or that I knew the money was all I ought to have - I said I heard he was drunk.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live in Edward-street, Soho. I bought the mare of the prisoner; I cannot tell on what day it was - I had her nine days, and sold her again before he was taken. I bought her in the evening at dusk; he rode into my yard, and was very drunk indeed - I asked what he was going to do with it; he said to sell it, and wanted 3 l. for it, I said I would buy it for 2 l., I gave him 1 s., and said I would pay him in the morning if it was sound; he came next morning, and seemed sober - I ordered him to take it away for I would not have it, it was such a dog horse thing, and had a broken back; he was taking her out of the yard, and a man said give him 30 s., I did so, and kept it nine days, it got no better, and I sold it for 2 l.; I swapped it for hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whose it was - A. He said it was his, and had been given him for a chop in Long-acre, for a black horse - he gave this account in the evening, and in the morning also when he was sober. I do not know where the person lives who bought her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him - A. I have known him for years. I do not know that he was acquainted with Warner. The prisoner deals about Smithfield in horses. I never knew any harm of him, only when he gets drunk, he is like a madman. I believe 30 s. is more than it is worth.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. Warner came to me on a Sunday before my son was taken, and said it was a bad job that the prisoner and him went out together to sell the horse. I understood that my son had bought it for him at Smithfield, and was to have it to sell when he wanted to part with it; and that one morning they both went out to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he accuse your son of stealing it - No; he said he wanted the money or the horse. He asked where my son was; I could not tell him, I had no reason to know that he had run away. He afterwards said he wanted 5 l. for it. I enquired among the neighbours; they said 2 l. was enough. I said I was poor enough, but would give him 3 l.; he would not take it. He said he would go into Court, and do his best to punish him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son wrong in the head - A. Yes; I got him into St. Luke's, eight months at one time, and ten at another. When he gets in liquor he is wild.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. You would give 3 l. to prevent his punishing your son - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Ham; I worked at Hounslow. On the 25th of March, before dinner time, I was at the Horse and Groom at Kingston, and saw Day there. He asked two men who were there, if they had seen Dummey. I have heard Walton called by that name, and answer to it. They said No, they expected him, and in he (Walton) came; three or four of them called him Dummey. He asked if the ragman was come. A man came in afterwards from Kingston, who answered to the name of Ragman. Then Walton went out, and brought in the copper in a bag; the ragman weighed it in the taproom, and said it was eleven pounds and a-half, and put the money on the table. Day sat on the same bench, and took it up, which Walton did not object to.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170051"/>The ragman took the copper away directly. The prisoners remained and drank together, and drank with me. Walton said he had like to have lost the copper, for some boys were bird-nesting in a ditch.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dart, who lives next door to the East India House. On Thursday night, the 4th of April, I went to bed about eleven o'clock, and slept down stairs; after I had been asleep, I heard a noise at the area window opposite my bed, it was shut close down when I went to bed; I first heard the noise about half-past twelve, and rose up in bed, but could see nothing, and thought it must be the cats, and about one o'clock I heard a noise again; I rose up again and saw a man on his hands and knees getting in at the window, which was pushed up, the window ledge is two feet two inches broad; he was in all but his feet; I called out Haloo! what is the matter; his answer was,</p>
               <p>"I will let you know what is the matter;" I jumped out of bed, and he retreated; I ran up stairs and alarmed the house, master came down, the man was then gone. The window is about five feet from the bottom of the area. We got two men to assist us, and searched the inside of the house, but could find nobody. We immediately searched the area, looked in the coal cellar, at the left hand was the prisoner standing up with his face close against the wall. We asked how he came there; he said he had no business. I asked how he came in; he said he let himself down at the corner of the area. I am sure it was the same voice as answered me, and said</p>
               <p>"I'll let you know."</p>

The other man then asked what time it was. I pulled out my watch, and he wanted me to lay him the 5 s. I said I had not got 5 s.; and put the watch into the man's hand, holding the seals in my own.

            . I am porter to Mr. Pickersgill. I followed the prisoner across Cheapside, down Queen-street, by Mr. Edenborough's, and into Budge-row; he then returned up Queen-street, into the Old Jewry, and Basinghall-street, where I saw an officer, and we took him. We asked where he was going with the goods; he said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you;" and then said he would let us know, and went into Mr. Brittens, and delivered them in Messrs. Edenborough and Co's. name. He said he was their porter, and we accompanied him there. Mr. Edenborough disowned him, and we took him to Mr. Pickersgill, who gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>"D - n you, what is it to you?" he went on, and rested his goods a little while - I told him to come on, he said he was not afraid. and went into Mr. Britten's and pulled out the invoice; Mr. Britten asked the numbers of the cords; he pulled out a pencil and wrote them down.

On the 21st of April I went to bed about eleven o'clock - the family had not then all come home; I sleep in the attick. I was disturbed between two and three o'clock by hearing a scuffling on the stairs. My young men who slept on the same floor awoke me. Mr. Stokes, who lodges on the second floor, came up to me naked, and in great alarm, and said he had had a scuffle with thieves. I came down stairs, and let in the watchman and people who had assembled about the house; then went to examine the house, and found a desk in the parlour wrenched open, and a metal watch taken out - a silk handkerchief was taken from my hat, which was on the sideboard. I missed from the kitchen closet, a silver tea pot, seventeen spoons, a pepper box, and a pair of sugar tongs, which were all silver and worth 10 l. 10 s., together. I found all this property at Mr. Platt's house, and knew it to be mine. I saw Harrington's coat at Bow-street - he is my apprentice.</p>

            . I am a clergyman of the Establishment, and lodge on the second floor of Mr. Russell's house. I came home about eleven o'clock, the street door was then closed. I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and about three I was between asleep and awake, and saw four men in my room standing near my bed; my sitting room door was open, and they stood in a row - they told me to be quiet, and threatened if I did not to shoot me. I am not quite certain but think I saw one pistol. One of them asked who the landlord was, I said nothing; then they left one as guard over me, and I thought he had a pistol - I kept my eyes nearly shut during the time. The other three went into my sitting room - I waited a few minutes, and then gave a sudden spring on the man, and cried out most lustily; he and I had a struggle across the sitting room, to the stair case, I then gave him a push and sent him down stairs; then went up to Mr. Russell and informed him. I believe the other three ran down stairs, for I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man who was guard over you, any light so that you could distinguish his features - A. I think I saw them standing with a candle in one of their hands. I cannot speak to any certainty, whether either of the prisoners are the men. A gold watch, with three gold seals, and a gold chain, worth about 10 l. together was taken from a little table in my bed-room; also a pair of spectacles and a silk handkerchief. I saw the watch and appendages in an hour or two in the hands of Mr. Fitch. I saw the handkerchief at Bow-street, but have not found the spectacles. I saw the prisoners at the watch-house, and from the voice of

I slept in the kitchen. I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and was not awoke till Mr. Russell came down. I found the office window on the ground floor, at the back of the house open - a pane of glass was broken, which was whole when I went to bed; nearly the whole pane was out - I am sure the window was shut down when I went to bed, and half the shutter shut. When I was alarmed I found all the shutters up and the window up; it looks into the back yard. I had a gold watch, with two gold seals, and a key, worth about 7 l., which was stolen; it hung up over the kitchen dresser; I had shut the kitchen door when I went to bed. I also lost two 5 l. notes, ten sovereigns, and 15 s., from a box on the dresser, which was locked - I found it broken open, and taken into the parlour. A coat belonging to

            . I am a watchman of Shire-lane, and Temple Bar. At three o'clock I heard the rattle spring - I came down Carey-street, and heard a scuffle in the two pair of stairs of Russell's house; I stopped at the door, a gentleman put his head out of window and called out thieves! I sprung my rattle, and remained at the street door, and in a short time heard the chain of the door drop, it opened a little way, and I saw the glimpse of three mens faces - I up with my stick and said,</p>
               <p>"If either of you attempt to come out I will knock your brains out;" I made a blow at them. They closed the door in my face, and broke my stick. Thomas a watchman came up; I called to the people within to let me in, and in ten or twelve minutes Mr. Russell met me in; Thomas followed me in; we saw the office window open - I heard a rumbling of men in Mr. Oddy's yard, which is enclosed by New-court wall, it has a door leading into the court which was fast. More watchman came up, and I placed them in New-court to prevent an escape that way. Thomas and I called to the private watchman to open the gates of New Boswell-court, and we two (only) went in. We knocked at Mr. Oddy's door and were let in by the servant; we searched in the lower part of the house, but found nobody; we then went into his yard, which the office looks into, and found a silk hat near the window of Mr. Russell's house; it has not been claimed by any person belonging to the house - it was given to Davis at Bow-street to try on, and appeared too small - he said it was not his. We then gained admission into Mr. Platt's house, who has a window looking into the yard; we went through a back door into the yard, and found Desmond in the yard; he said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I deliver myself up to you;" he had no shoes on - he was not known at Mr. Platts. I then asked who were his associates; or thieves with him; he said no person but himself - I said I knew there must be more for I saw three faces in Mr. Russell's house - he still said there was none but himself; I delivered him over to a watchman to take to the watch-house - I then went back to make further search, and after day light found five table, nine tea, and three salt spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs, all silver, on the tiles of an outhouse of Mr. Platt's house, Mr. Russell claimed them. I found six picklock keys of different sizes with them; also two skeleton keys, (one of them broken); a large door key and another small key. As I returned from lodging Desmond at the watch-house, Davis was delivered to me; he was searched at the office, and nothing was found about him.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is opposite Mr. Russell's. I have heard Quennell's account, it is correct. We found the picklock keys on the tiles of the wash-house, and the spoons. I found in the same place a pistol loaded with powder only; no ball or slugs, and a phosphorus box; also two handkerchiefs, one of which Mr. Stokes claimed, and 
               <persName id="t18220417-139-person1360">Russell</persName>
             the other, and also the plate. In Oddy's yard I found a hat. Oddy's servant gave me a coat, a silver tea pot, and a pair of shoes. Russell claimed the tea pot as his own, and the coat as his apprentice's. Desmond had no shoes, and I lent him these to walk to the watch-house, and to Bow-street - they appeared rather too small; he walked with the heels down. Another pair of shoes, and a small iron crow were found in Mr. Stokes's room. I found two chisels with the spoons, and in the yard a dark lantern.</p>

               <p>MR. STOKES. When I went to bed my sitting-room door was shut. I found it open after the struggle. I found a pair of shoes, a hat, and an iron crow in my bedroom, which were not there when I went to bed. I found my writing desk forced open, but nothing taken out.</p>

The woman was my landlady, and was with me at the time. My coat and waistcoat were torn off my back, and when they were returned to me, this property was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the prisoner took them - A. I swear he took my coat and waistcoat, and returned it without them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner indicted you for the assault, and since that you have charged him with this felony - A. Yes. The prisoner preferred the first indictment.</p>

            . I am a bay salesman, and live at Little Stanmore. I know the prisoners, they live in Edgware parish, about four hundred yards from Stone's. I went with a constable and a search warrant, to the house of Simm's, about half-past seven o'clock Sunday evening - I did not then know that the prisoners lived there - we found a woman there, and searched the house, and in the room the woman was in, we found part of a fore quarter of lamb, boiled, and in the adjoining room on a table I found a hind quarter, undressed, and gave them to Hinton. I apprehended Alsey in bed two doors from this house, on that evening; I said we must search; he said he had no objection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170059"/>- I remained with him while Hinton searched, and brought up, part of a fore quarter of lamb, baked in a pie, a hind quarter undressed, and a piece of lights - we did not ask where he got it, nor did he give any account of it. I compared all the lamb with the skin next morning - there is no doubt of its being part of the carcase, from that skin. there was a piece of flesh left by the hind leg in the skin, which matches exactly. I produce both skin and meat; it matches the skin, and the two quarters match. I apprehended Weedon that evening, and told him I had been to his house, and found lamb there; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

I had received ten of the sovereigns from Mr. Blissett, of Leadenhall-street, and six from Mr. York. I counted them on the morning of the 30th of March, and put them into my right-hand waistcoat pocket.

               <p>"You treated me when I had no money to treat myself, and I will treat you now, as I have money." He said he would have some gin and peppermint; I fetched a quartern from the bar; this was about 11 o'clock. We drank and talked together some time, he came and sat by my side, by the fire-place. I had a pipe which confused me so, that I fell asleep, and about one o'clock, Toogood came and awoke me. I felt and missed the bag and sovereigns. The prisoner was then gone; nobody but him had sat near me. I am sure the bag of sovereigns were safe when I paid for the liquor. He was taken that night by the watchman. I saw him next morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170060"/>and said</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was at the Princess Royal, and saw them together; the prisoner sat on his left hand; they sat together for three-quarters of an hour. Matthews fell asleep. Two men came in before that, and went out again; they did not go near him. I went into the back-yard, and while he was asleep, the prisoner came there to me, in about two minutes, and said he was off; I asked which way, he said to Blackfriar's Bridge; I said I was going that way, and we would walk together, we went out together, without going through the tap-room, and went to the King's Arms, Hill-street, Finsbury; he called for a pint of porter, and pulled out 2 1/4 d; I said that would not do to pay for it. He then called for a pot, and shewed me an old pocket, which he took from his left-hand waistcoat pocket, and said he picked it up against Mr. Matthews. It was like the one produced; it was an old pocket; I neither saw gold or silver in it, it appeared to have something in it. I left him there, and went back to Matthews, and he missed his pocket and money. I returned to the King's Arms, and he was gone. He had told me he was going to call at the Pied Horse, Chiswell-street, we went, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Matthews say liquor had overcome him, and he was quite stupid - A. I saw that he was, they were both drunk; the prisoner made no secret of picking it up.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at the Duke of Northumberlad, next door to the Worship-street Office. I have been acquainted with the officers for a year. On the 13th of April I met the prisoner by appointment; he was to bring me twenty counterfeit shillings; he came in after me, and said he was sorry to detain me; we left the house, and went up Noble-street, and saw a woman standing there, and just before I got up to her; he said</p>
               <p>"This is my old woman," I said,</p>
               <p>"What is that your wife," he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, she has got the stuff," meaning counterfeit money; he said,</p>
               <p>"You may as well deal with her as me;" I objected to it, and said I would never trust a woman with my business - he asked me to step on a little way, I did so, and on turning round saw the woman give him a parcel; he followed me up the street leading into Gee-street, he there stepped up to me, and shifted the counterfeit money slily into my hand - I gave him 6 s. good money, which we had agreed on before. I could not get him to go the way I wanted; we went up Gee-street, into Compton-street; his woman kept with us all the time, and then we parted, and agreed to meet on the following Monday, at the same place. We all three went into a public-house in Compton-street, and at the door, he said he wished me to meet at this house on Monday - I objected to that; he said he would rather, because it was out of his parish, and the officers would not expect to see him there. I said it was taking me so much out of my way. We then agreed to meet at the White Lion, public-house, on Monday, and I ordered another score; I was afraid he was aware of what I was after, and I took a circuitous round to Worship-street - I found the officers were not there; and I gave the counterfeit money to Mance. On Monday I went to the White Lion, and was there about a quarter of an hour; he came in and said</p>
               <p>"Have you seen my wife;" I said No; he said</p>
               <p>"She is looking after you, you may as well walk with me" - I went out with him, and let him lead me where he pleased - he took me to the City-road. He was apprehended at six o'clock in the evening; he told me he had had so much call for them during the holidays, that he had made himself bankrupt, for he had sold all out, and in order to keep his customers together, he was obliged to buy of other people. I saw his wife standing under the workhouse wall, City-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you get your living by shoe-making - A. No. I go on messages for the officers. I have only dealt with one man besides the prisoner.</p>

I searched him before he went to buy the money, and saw six good shillings delivered to him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Goswell-street, and saw the prisoners attempt to take something from a stationer's shop. I watched them across the road to Brennand's; they passed the shop, looked in, and returned. I concealed myself in the door way, and saw Brennand go into her cellar; Bainbridge then went into the shop, took the bacon, and came out with his shoes off. Lawless was looking through the window all the time. I seized Bainbridge, and he ran away - next morning I took him on Saffron-hill. I am not quite certain of him.</p>

She did not come to bed at all. I awoke about six o'clock in the morning, and my clothes, consisting of the articles stated in the indictment, were gone. A person in the next room fetched my aunt.

            , SENR. I went after them, and saw them in Cromer-street. Sheering was carrying a basket, and I believe Stephens to be the man who was with him. He stopped to rest from the weight; I went up and asked what he had in the basket, which was covered over; he said old stuff, that he had brought from Battle Bridge. I said if he would tell me where, I would go and see if it was right - if so, I would let him go - he refused, and the other ran away. I took Sherring to the watchhouse - went with a constable, and took Stephens in George-street, Battle Bridge, in about an hour and a half. I afterward took the lead to the premises, and 51 lbs. of it matched the roof, but there was 101 lbs. in all. I believe he has been an industrious lad.</p>

He said they were ordered; I went up to enquire leaving him alone in the passage where the coat hung - when I came down I missed it, and him; he was found in Spitalfields that evening.

She said she picked it up at the corner of Bell-lane. Directly as I took her, Squince, (who was just before her ran away); they did not appear to know each other. As I returned I found him in South-street, and directly I made towards him; he ran off, and was stopped. He said he lived in Webb-square.</p>

I watched them following a lady and gentleman, and in about ten minutes, I saw them in King-street, near Mr. Green. I walked on the opposite side, and saw Day draw a handkerchief out of Mr. Green's pocket; they crossed over to my side. I crossed, and told Mr. Green, then ran over to the butcher's, and pushed them into the shop. Edwards ran out, and Mr. Green pulled him in again; and in the scuffle, I saw him take the handkerchief out of his hat, and throw it down. I picked it up close behind him.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Duke-street, Bloomsbury. On the 20th of March, about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, I was in Little Russell-street and saw a man running as hard as he could, with a trunk, the prisoners were close behind him; he pitched it into a public house door way, and crossed into Museum-street. The prisoners stood opposite the door. Smale crossed, and took up the trunk, and followed the man. White stood at the corner till he passed them, and then ran after him to the end of Great Russell-street. I ran down Gilbert-street; saw Taylor, and told him to come with me; I got into a Great Russell-street, and laid hold of Smale with the trunk, and asked where he was going to take it; he said that a man asked him to carry it - the other man was in the middle of the road, and ran away. I found White behind, and gave him in charge.</p>

Two or three days previous to the 31st of January, the prisoner came and left his card, stating himself as a tailor, living at 32, Cumberland-street-road. I enquired, and found he did live there. He said he wanted a piano-forte for a most respectable lady, who had his first floor; he hired it at 16 s. a month, and referred me to Mr. J. Bunning, No. 14, Cumberland-street, and then left. I made enquiry, and was satisfied. We had no further conversation. I went to his house about the middle of the day on the 31st of January, I was to have a month in advance, and 2 s. for the carriage, which the man who took it brought back. I did not see him again till I saw him in custody. He called at my house, when I was out, and paid 3 s. more. On the 9th of February, I found my piano at Mr. Green's shop, in Newman-street, about three minutes walk from my house.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Stafford-street, Lisson Green, Paddington. On the 31st of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the private door of my house, and gave a double knock; I answered the door - he wished to know if I would take a piano-forte in pledge, and produced a card. After some hesitation, I agreed to go and look at it; I went to his house, No. 32, Cumberland-street, and examined the piano - I agreed to advance him 10 l. on it; it was brought to my house the same evening by two porters, and the prisoner with them. I gave him the money next morning. On the 8th of February it was redeemed by a person named Green, who paid the interest and principal.</p>

            . I am a furniture broker, and live in Newman's-passage, Newman-street. I redeemed the piano-forte on the 8th of February - I believe the one produced to be the same. I have known the prisoner a year and a half; he came to me on the 7th of February, and asked if I would buy a piano-forte - I refused, he said it was a very good one if I liked to buy it. I said if I can buy it worth the money I will. He said it belonged to a lodger on his first floor, and he wanted to sell it for her;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170071"/>as she wanted some money to pay her rent. I told him to call the next morning at ten o'clock, and if I could I would look at it; he came next morning, and took me to Goodwin's, and just before we got there, he gave me the duplicate, and stood on the other side of the way while I went in; he said he would wait there. I looked at it, and redeemed it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why he would not go into the shop with you - A. He said if they would not let me have it he would go in himself - he said,</p>
               <p>"You take this ticket in, and I will meet you at the public-house;" he said he would not go in - I did not ask him why. I had no suspicion of him. I redeemed it for 10 l. and 2 s. 6 d., interest. The prisoner wanted 6 l. for the ticket, I said I would give him 5 l., which I did - I gave him part of it in the public-house, and part at home, where he gave me a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not go nearer to the shop than the public-house - A. Yes. I looked at it, then went over, and told him what I would give him for the ticket. I redeemed it, and we both went home together - he asked what he should give me for it back again in a week's time. I said,</p>
               <p>"If you want it back, why do you sell it;" he said he thought he should want it again - I said I would rather have the money than the piano, for mine was a bad place for business, and he should have it back for the same money, and if he brought any one to buy it, and got 2 l. on it, I should expect something. It had not been in my shop two hours before Mr. Nutting's man claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You agreed to let him have it back at the end of a week or fortnight - A. Yes. He made no secret of it. While he was out of the way, his wife gave me the delivery note, which the prosecutor had sent with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he get out of the way - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean when you said,</p>
               <p>"While he was out of the way" - A. He was not at home, and the officers said he was out of the way. His wife said he was afraid to come home, for fear of the officers.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of April, I had been looking for him from the 9th of February. I waited at his house four hours before I could gain admission, and then found him laying on the roof, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock at night. It was at a house in Clerkenwell, which he had taken the day before the piano was pawned.</p>

I asked Green to advance me something on the ticket for a time, and shewed him the delivery note, and said I did not want to dispose of it altogether, or I should get into trouble. He looked at it, and said he would advance but 4 l. I said,</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of April, I took Avis. I found she had a gown tied in a handkerchief, and a shawl was on a woman's back by her side, to whom she said she had lent it. She said she lodged at No. 2, Clement's-lane; when I came there I found a Agent there; he said it was his lodging. I found a handkerchief, an apron, and two small keys, one of which fits the prosecutor's room.</p>

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. On Wednesday, the 3d of March, about half past eight o'clock at night, I was in Barbican, and saw the two prisoners attempt a gentleman's pocket; they did not succeed. About two minutes after they crossed over to the prosecutor. I saw them attempt his pocket several times; and at the end of Golden-lane, Balchin got the handkerchief quite out, and gave it to Gardner. I went over; when they saw us they ran up Whitecross-street. I took Balchin, and Keys took Gardner.</p>

            . I am a hay binder, and live in Charles-street, Lisson Green. I was at work in a rick-yard, near this house, on Monday the 15th of April, about ten or eleven in the morning, and under some rubbish I found a piece of lead, about a hundred yards from the house, and about two yards further I found more. I told Wallis, and watched, and about half-past seven o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner with it on his back, about a hundred yards from the place where it was concealed. I asked what he had on his back; he answered nothing - I found it was the lead; it weighed about 50 lbs. He took us back to the place, and shewed us where he had it from, and four pieces were left behind - it weighed in all 236 lbs. He said he was nearly all night getting it there. I saw one piece fitted to the roof.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Nevitt. I work close by the premises. I watched the place where the lead was concealed, and about half-past seven o'clock saw the prisoner come and take it away from the place. Langton stopped him - there was four more pieces of lead left behind. He said he took it off a house at Kilburn, and it took him nearly all night to get it there. I saw it fitted to the prosecutor's house, and have no doubt of its being taken from there.</p>

On the 26th of March, I was at my door at Battle-bridge, and saw the prisoner running with a basket - I followed him; he jumped over a fence, basket and all - two pint pots fell out with Menti's name and sign on them. Somebody picked up a quart pot of the same name. I got over the fence and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170075"/>secured him behind a dust hill.
