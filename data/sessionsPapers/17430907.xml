On the 11th of August between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070004"/> three and four in the Afternoon, the Prisoner came to my Shop, and asked if the Gentlewoman was within; my Man said yes, and brought him to the Parlour where I keep the Lace. - He said he had an Order out of the Country, for seven Yards of Mecklin Lace; I asked him what Price he would go to, he said about 12 s. a Yard. I asked him, what Breadth he would have it, and he said about an Inch; then I took out a Box of Lace, and shewed him two Pieces, one of 14 s. per Yard, and the other Half a Guinea. He gave them to me again and said nothing, I took out another Box, and he put his Hand upon one of 13 s. and then he clapped his Hand upon another, and said, I suppose that is dearer. I told him it was 20 s. per Yard; he bid me Half a Guinea, for what I told him was 13 s. and took up his Hat and Cane, and said, you bad better take my Money, I will give you 11 s. which I could not take, and he went away. I missed the Piece of Lace directly, but I did not know at first but I might have put it into another Box; it happened to be stopped by Mr Paine the Pawnbroker, who was so kind as to bring it to me, and has kept it in his Custody ever since. He did not come as a Dealer in Lace, but as a Sort of a Gentleman. - This is the Piece of Lace that I missed at that Time.</p>
               <p>Maltus Paine. On the 11th of August, about three or four in the Afternoon, the Prisoner brought me a Piece of Lace to pledge; I have had some little Dealings with him before, and he has told me he was a Lace Merchant; the Night before this, I happened to have some small Information from a Gentleman who has another Indictment against the Prisoner, that he had lost a Piece of Lace which I had taken in, and that gave me some Suspicion of the Prisoner; that was the Thing that brought this to light, or else I had taken this Piece in from him; for I took him to be a Man of Reputation and Character; he asked me five Guineas upon it; I asked him whose Property it was, he said, it was his own; I said, it is very possible it may be your own; but I am informed that I have a Piece in my Custody that you brought me that is not your own, and I will know whose this is; so I stopped him, and had him before a Justice - he did not make any Confession, he said, he received it from a Perriwig maker that was making Wiggs for him - I believe I should not have lent him five Guineas upon it - he said it was his own, and that he dealt in Lace - he did not seem surprized, he was not under any Confusion - I have made it my Business to enquire after him, and People give him but a very indifferent Character - this is the same Piece I had of the Prisoner.</p>

I deal in it.

            . I have a first Floor in Mr Pearce's House, and deal in Lace; the Prisoner came on the 29th of June, about ten in the Morning, and said he wanted seven Yards of Mecklin Lace, of about 10 s. per Yard; I shewed him one, he said, he would give me Nine; I told him I would take no less than Ten; and that as he seemed not to understand the Value of it, if he paid me the Money, and did not like it afterwards, I would give him the Money again; I opened another Box, and he put his Hand in and took out a Piece; I took the Piece out of his Hand, and said they were above his Price; then he clapped his other Hand, with his Handkerchief in it, upon the Corner of the Box, and I imagine he took the Piece of Lace that way, (I had put the Piece up again that I shewed him) and as he went out he offered me 9 s. 6 d. About an Hour and an half afterwards I missed the Piece of Lace that he stole out of the Box that he put his Hand into; and about three or four Days afterwards I missed five Pieces more, two of six Yards three Quarters, two of six Yards, and two that were but Remnants; then was I dubious, whether some of my Servants had not stole them: I went to Mr Paine's, and told him, I had lost several Pieces of Lace, and he was very ingenuous in shewing me what Laces he had; this is the Piece I had of Mr Paine, the other Piece that I lost then I never had - I am very positive this is my Lace, and that I missed this Piece of Lace the 29th of June: I believe the Lace went all at the same Time, for I never saw the Prisoner since - This is not the Piece that I missed at first - I did not shew this particular Piece of Lace to him - I opened two Boxes of Lace, and this was in one of the Boxes - I missed one Piece out of one Box, and five out of the other - the Night before he came I told my Laces over - I did not tell them over again till three or four Days after he was there.</p>

               <p>Maltus Paine. Mrs Mason was at my House, and was telling my Wife of her Misfortune, in losing several Pieces of Lace. I said, I have taken in two Pieces, may be one or both may be your's. I shewed the Lace to her, and she was very positive to this Piece; this Piece I had of the Prisoner. The next Day afterwards he came with another Piece of about thirteen Yards, and then I stopped him and the Lace too. When he brought this Piece of four Yards and an Half, I asked him several Questions, and he gave me such satisfactory Answers, that really I had no Suspicion of him. I lent him a Guinea upon it.</p>

I must borrow some Money of you, Mr Pearson not minding what he said, he said again sharply to him, I must borrow some Money of you, whereupon Mr Pearson gave him half a Guinea, and about 3 s. 6 d. in Silver, and then he gave him his Watch - He held the Pistol very high close to Mr Pearson's Ear - The Prisoner was on Horseback - Then the Prisoner said to me, I must have your Money, with that I gave him about eight or nine Shillings first; then he said, You have got a Watch, and I must have that, and accordingly I gave it to him; then he said, put your Hand into your Pocket, for you have more Money, and I must have that; then I gave him a Guinea in Gold, and 12 or 13 s. in Silver. - He cocked his Pistol, and held it towards my Face. There was another Person with him who dropped a black Crape over his Face, and was on the other Side of the Chaise with a Pistol in his Hand, which seemed as if it was cocked; the Prisoner's Face was bare all the Time.</p>

               <p>Q. What Time of the Day was it?</p>
               <p>Cole. I believe it was better than half an Hour after Five.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Cole. I believe I have. - I knew him immediately when I saw him afterwards, at the George in Piccadilly, that Day Sev'nnight. - I went there about my Master's Business, and saw the Prisoner in the House. I asked the People of the House if they knew that Man, and they said yes; and I said that Man had robbed me. I then acquainted my Fellow-Sufferer, Mr Pearson, with it, and the next Day we went with the Man who keeps the George to the Prisoner's House: - He keeps a Publick-House, (the Rose and Crown) between Marybone and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070007"/> Paddington, and before Pearson came quite up to his House, seeing the Prisoner standing by the Door, Pearson said, he was sure that was the Man that robbed us we went into the House, and had drank two Pots of Beer with the Prisoner, and had some Pipes and Tobacco, and a Quartern of Brandy, and came out of the House without saying any Thing to him about it, at that Time; the next Morning I got a Warrant from Col.

               <p>Cole. While we were drinking the first Pot of Beer, I thought he looked a little Shy, and that he looked hard at Mr Pearson.</p>

             and I were stopped on Hounslow-Heath by the Prisoner, about half an Hour after five in the Evening, he said, I must have a little Money of you before you go any farther; I did not apprehend him at first, for I thought he was only in Joke; the second Time he spoke pretty sharply; I got up in the Chaise with my Whip in my Hand, and had a Mind to have struck him; but seeing another Person, who dropped a Crape over his Face, I kept back; I gave him half a Guinea in Gold and 3 s. 6 d. in Silver, and then my Watch; and my Friend gave him a Guinea, a good Handful of Silver, and his Watch; I said to the Prisoner we are a Couple of Servants came out to take an airing, and I think you have aired us very handsomely: I asked him whether he would not give me something to pay the Turnpike, and he give me a Shilling; I asked him whether he would not give my Companion something, and, he said, he would not; the other said, give him something, and then he gave him a Shilling; the Prisoner said, Now you are richer than we are; I said it was false; for they had got our Money, and we had none of theirs; the Sunday Sev'nnight following, my Mate told me, that he had seen the Man that robbed us, at the George in Piccadilly; we went to the George, and from thence to the Prisoner's House; and before I came to the House, I believe by half the Length of a Field, I saw the Prisoner at his Door, and said, that is the Man that robbed me; says the Man that kept the George in Piccadilly, are you sure of that? I said, I am sure of it, we had some Beer and a Quartern of Brandy - I believe this was about five o'Clock when we got to Hanns's House - That is the very Man that took the Money from me and my Mate, and no body else.</p>

               <p>Q Do you think a Man can ride that in about half an Hour?</p>
               <p>Pearson. According as the Horse is - the Horse was wet with Sweat.</p>
               <p>Q. What Colour was the Horse?</p>
               <p>Pearson. It was a Sort of a Chesnut.</p>

Pass came to my House the 26th in the Morning, and was married that very Day. I went to Pass's Wedding about ten o'Clock that Morning. Clay was then at my House.</p>

I went and got a Nap of Sleep, and went in the Morning to see how Things stood, and the House was close shut up. I told Mr Owen the Constable, I believed I should have a Jobb for him about 11 o'Clock; the Prosecutor came to the Alehouse about 11 o'Clock next Morning, and asked me if I would have any Beer, said I, Let us do Business first; I saw Madam and her Partner coming by about half an Hour after 11; thinks I you are the Woman that has the Watch; said I, she is gone into that House; the Windows were broke, but Bawdy-houses generally are so. I spoke thro' the Windows; the Prosecutor went for a Warrant, and after he was gone, she pushed out, I took hold of her, and would not part from her; said I, as there is a Robbery swore against you, I will keep you. There came a Man out, and asked me what I had to do with his Wife; said I, D - n your Wife, what's your Wife to me, I do not mind your Wife.

               <p>Ross. My Father was born in Scotland, he has a Company of Scotch Hillanders; they call them the Scotch Regiment; they are in the Service of Holland: My Father is now in Garrison at Art; He has been in Holland, near fifty Years.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know your Father was born in Scotland?</p>
               <p>Ross. I have heard him say several Times that he was born in the Shire of Ross.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in England?</p>
               <p>Ross. Three Months and a Half and better. - I have been enlisted in General Harrison's Regiment since the 25th of May. - I was enlisted when the Prisoner met me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met together who spoke first?</p>
               <p>Ross. He spoke to me first in French, and said how do you do, do you understand French? Then I stopped and answered him in French; said he, I have seen you before; may be so, said I. Then I went with him to the House of one

There came a Drawer into the Room, and the Prisoner said to him, Here is a clever Man but he can talk no English at all, and he is afraid he should be taken up, because he is a

            . The Drawer went out, and there came in a Chairman, I think his Name is Caibow; this Chairman thinking I could understand no English, said, if he would take him along with him he would go. - The Prisoner said it was a dangerous Thing to meddle with such Matters here; then the Chairman was called and went out, so the Prisoner came up to me, clapp'd his Hand upon my Shoulder, and said, I should be glad to have you for a Comrade, and you shall go with me to France; says he, I hope you are not against your own King and Country, meaning that I was a Frenchman: He said, if I would go with him, he would give me a Note under his Hand that I should be an Officer as soon as I came on the other Side of the Water; says he. I will give you 40 Livres. No says I, That is too little for such a Man as I am, I will have more as that - I spoke this in French. He put his Hand in his Pocket, and pulled out a French Crown. which I have here to produce, and said, he would make that 40 Livres more; (the French Crown was produced) this is worth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070017"/> about 4 s. 6 d. English Money; I took this Crown of him, and he called for a Pot of Beer; after we had drank the Beer, I was studying how to come out of that House, for fear of being knocked on the Head, as they were all his own Country People.</p>

               <p>Q. What were they Frenchmen?</p>
               <p>Ross. They all spoke French.</p>
               <p>Q. What Country People do you think they are?</p>
               <p>Ross. They are Irish People - the Prisoner is an Irishman; they talked both English and Irish; then I made a Proposal to him, that as he was a Man that understood English, and I could not, if he would go along with me down into Wapping to get my Goods, I would go with him where he pleased; he agreed to that, and pulled out half a Crown, and gave it to the People of the House, for a Lodging for me and himself, and for the Reckoning, which was Fifteen-pence Half-penny - we did not lie there; this was between five and six o'Clock; the Prisoner and I went to the Black-Boy and Trumpet at Tower-Hill, and I called for a Pot of Beer, I spoke to the Landlord, and desired him in Dutch to go to St Catharines, to get a File of Musqueteers, but he refused it, and said, I should go myself - the Landlord spoke Dutch - the Prisoner could understand some Words of what we said; then, I said, I would talk to him in English; and I told him he was my Prisoner, and I would hold him; I had no Money in my Pocket, but this Piece, that I had of the Prisoner, and the Landlord would not let us go without paying for the Beer; said I to the Landlord, keep this in your Custody till I come and pay for the Beer; then I took the Prisoner out of the House, and carried him before Justice Dennet.</p>
               <p>Court. This is all mispending of Time; for the Man took him to be a Frenchman; we will suppose this Man was a Subject of his Majesty, of which there is some doubt, if he pretends to be a Foreigner, and can't speak a Word of English, he is to be taken for what he pretends to be. <rs id="t17430907-34-verdict179" type="verdictDescription">

            . I was lying upon a Couch, where the Prisoner was sitting, cutting of Matches; I was asleep, but the Noise waked me; when I awaked, I heard the Prisoner say, You B - h, I never was concerned with the Butcher in White-chapel for Sweet-Breads and Kidneys; the Deceased made answer, and said, I never gave a Butcher nor a Carman the Clap in White-chapel; the Prisoner said, if you say so again I will do you a Mischief; the Deceased rehearsed it over again; and being in Liquor, aggravated the Prisoner very much; the Deceased was in another Room - the Door was shut when these Words passed; there was but a slight Partition, that they might hear very well - the Deceased began first, for she was very much in Liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Deceased in Bed or up?</p>
               <p>Brown. She was in Bed; the Prisoner then opened the Door - there was no Lock upon the Door, it was a Sort of a Spring Bolt, tied with two Strings, and they were twisted round a Nail; and the Door was easily got open; the first Thing I saw, was, that the Prisoner laid hold of a Knife; which, I suppose, was the first Thing that came to her Hand - it lay upon a Chest of Drawers, and she flung it at the Deceased - I saw her sling it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not stab her ?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, she flung it at her, and she received a Wound under the Collar-Bone, on the left Side; and the Deceased said, Lord, Lord, see how she has stabbed me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Stabbing implies a sticking with the Knife in her Hand; did she strike her with it in her Hand, or did she throw it at her?</p>
               <p>Brown. She flung it, I do assure you.</p>
               <p>Jury. At what Distance was it flung ?</p>
               <p>Brown. About two Yards and an half - then the Deceased said, Lord, Lord, see how she has stabbed me; and the Prisoner said, I am sorry for it; and if I have done it, I am willing to suffer, I will not run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you upon your Oath say she threw it at her?</p>
               <p>Brown. She flung it at her, I do assure you - I will never vary a Tittle for the best Person upon Earth.</p>

I got up between three and four o'Clock that Morning, and was cutting of Matches, when she came in drunk; I got some Gin for her, and she would have had me have got some Tobacco; and as I would not do that, she abused, and aggravated me very much, and, I said, I would lick her; but my Landlady hindered me, says she, let her come; and as I could not come to her, I took up the Knife, and threw at her. <rs id="t17430907-35-verdict183" type="verdictDescription">

I asked the Landlord, whether he knew any Thing of the Man or the Woman; he said he believed they were honest People, and we might venture to buy it.

               <p>Josias Taylor. Last Saturday Evening, about eight o'Clock, I was going with a Friend to drink a Tankard of Beer, and just by my own Door, in Bishopsgate street, I found something lightly touch my Pocket; I put my Hand into my Pocket, and found that my Handkerchief was gone; I saw the Prisoner about the same Distance from me that he is now; I immediately run after him, and seized him, and said, Sirrah, you have got my Handkerchief; he took the Handkerchief out of his Pocket and threw it down directly; I took up the Handkerchief, and carried the Prisoner into a back Room; said I, Sirrah, this Practice will bring you to the Gallows; he begged that I would let him go, and said, his Father and Mother would beat him; there was a Gentleman came and said, he had picked his Pocket within these five Minutes, but he would not prosecute him; says one who had been a Constable, this is the third or fourth Time that he has been sent to Newgate: I searched his Pockets, and found these five Handkerchiefs about him. The People very well knew him.</p>

               <p>Q. Who knocked you down?</p>
               <p>Fennel.

I got hold of Warwick; but the three others made off directly; they went about forty or fifty Yards, as near as I can guess; came back again, and knocked me down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who knocked you down then?</p>
               <p>Fennel. He in the red Waistcoat, I take it to be Bunn.</p>

            . The Night this Robbery was committed, we happened to see some Linnen hang out by White-chapel Mount; and we were going out for it; but before we went, we happened to call at the Blue Anchor, and drank a Pot of Beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to the Blue Anchor?</p>
               <p>Burton. There was Bunn, Leach, Warwick, and myself; while we were there, the Prosecutor came in, he called for a Pint of Beer, and

             came up to him, and quarelled with him; the Prosecutor bid him get out of his Company; afterwards, Leach asked us, whether we would rob that Fellow, and we all four consented to do it; he had not got above twenty or thirty Yards from the House before Bunn knocked him down with a Mop-stick, and Leach took his Hat and Wig; after Bunn had knocked him down, Leach leaned upon his Breast, and Warwick took the Money out of his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Burton. I held him by the Feet while the others robbed him - we all shared the Money together, that Night (the Linnen we did design to steal being taken in) we went into Spittal fields Church yard, got over a Wall into a Gentleman's Garden, and stole some Linnen; I was taken that Night, and carried to New Prison, and I made myself an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bunn. The first Night I saw Burton was at Mr Smith's, the Yorkshire-Grey in Rag-Fair; he called me in, to drink a Pint of Beer, and said, he had robbed a House, and got 15 l. and so persuaded me to go a robbing with him.</p>
               <p>Bunn said, he was under fourteen Years of Age; and</p>
               <p>Leach said, he was under fifteen Years of Age.</p>

On Saturday was Fortnight, the 27th of August, I was in Whichapel Butcher-Row, and hearing a Cry of Stop Thief, I turned my Head and saw the Prisoner spring by me very swift, and he turned into Somerset Street, in Aldgate Parish. I being a Headborough of St Mary Whitechapel, I run after him, but being slip-shoed I could not run fast enough, I cried Stop Thief; knock him down. Then he crossed from one Side of the Way to the other. I came up with him, and seized him by the Collar, which gave Way, so I thrust my Knuckles into his Throat, he said, for God's-Sake let me go, I have done no Harm, I have only returned from Transportation; said I, I will stay till the Prosecutor comes up. The People bid him go, and the Mob grew outragious; when Mr Burdeaux came up, he desired I would assist him, and said, that the Prisoner had robbed him, and had returned from Transportation, and that he had threatned Destruction * to him and his Family: I pushed him along as fast as possible towards my Lord-Mayor's-House; the People called us all the Thief-takers they could think of; the Mob arose in Battle-array, so that I said to the Prosecutor, I would assist him no further; but he begged I would. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070024"/> got him into a Coach, and Dirt was thrown into the Coach by two Women, whom I took particular Notice of. I put him into the Poultry-Compter, and the next Day had him before the Alderman, he acknowledged himself to be the Man, and begged for Mercy; he said, he had suffered a great deal, and begged the Prosecutor that he would not take away his Life; he behaved himself very civilly all the Way.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I shipped myself at Philadelhia, the 15th of March, and was to take a Loading of Tar, and then to go to Leith in Scotland. I said to the Captain, it was very dangerous for me to go to London, for I shall be taken up for returning from Transportation; he said I should never fair out of the Ship; he said he would put in at Cowes, and instead of going to Cowes, he came to London; so I ventured on Shore, and there was a Gentleman's Son who was going on Board a Man of War, and I was to go in his Room, and to have five Guineas for it, and was going to the White-Hart in Lemmon-Street about it. I was told to take Care not to come in Mr Burdeaux's Way; it was but the fifth Day that I had been in London; the Ship arrived at London the 10th, and I was taken the 27th.

            . I lodged with the Prisoner; my Brother, the Deceased, used frequently to come and see me, and upon this Day three Weeks he came between nine and ten in the Morning, and this Accident happened about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, during which Time we had three half Pints of Brandy, between the Prisoner, one Mrs Stewart, an Acquaintance of her's, my Brother, and I; I believe my Brother did not drink half a Glass of it. Mrs Stewart laid down upon the Bed, and the Prisoner said, my Brother went to put his Hand under her Petticoats, and he said, I had no Intention to put my Hand under her Petticoats, I had no Thoughts of it; he said he only laid his Hand upon her, and thought no Harm in it. Then the Prisoner began to curse and swear, and called him a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070025"/> many Names, and said he had a great deal of Impudence to meddle with any Body in her Apartment, that she was no Companion for him; my Brother said, What is that to you, I will do as I please; the Prisoner made Answer, No, you Rogue, you shall not do as you please in my Apartment, and she took up a short Hearth-Brush, and gave him several Blows upon the Head with it; What, says he, are you in earnest ? Yes, said she, I am, you Dog. Then he took the Brush out of her Hand, and slung it away; then she took up the Bar of the Grate, and was going to knock him down with that; he took the Bar out of her Hand, and threw it away; then she took hold of him by the Hair of his Head, and he endeavouring to get her Hand out of his Hair, scratched her on the Face, and gave her a Push from him, and she fell down backward; then she started up again, took up the Poker, and gave him a dead Stroke on the right-side of the Temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she strike him with great Violence or no?</p>
               <p>Collins. She did it designedly to be sure, for she said before the struck him, You Son of a Where. I will knock your Brains out; - it a had she could strike him; the Poker has a little sharp Point, which was wore away with the Fire, and was like a crooked Nail; it run into his Temple so that there was a Hole I could put the Top of my Little-finger into; when he received the Blow he said, I am murdered, and the Blood and Tears ran down from his Face, and so the Tears did from mine. - She knocked him dead down with the Blow, - it was a small Poker, about the Bigness of my Finger, not three Quarters of a Yard long; - he cried out Murder, and I cried out Murder; he bled about half a Pint.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Prisoner behave?</p>
               <p>Collins. She thought nothing of it, she said, he gave her more than she gave him, and did not Care if she had given him six Times as much; then my Brother and I went away; we had two Pints of Beer at an Alehouse, and he said he would go to his Lodging.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there no Surgeon applied to?</p>
               <p>Collins. No. my Brother took no Notice of it for two Days - The Deceased was a Glover and Breeches Maker; - he could do no Business after he received that dead Stroke, and did not eat a Morsel, till Death took him, but he drank pretty much Small-Beer and Pump-Water, and that would come up again before it was well down in his Belly: - He received the Wound on Thursday, and was turned cat of his Lodging on Friday Night, and on Saturday Night he got another. - I was with him when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sensible when he died?</p>
               <p>Collins. He was a little headful some times, but he came sensible about Half an Hour before his Death, when I got him a Pint of Ale, and rais'd him up to drink it, and after he had drank it, he fell off my Arm like a great Stone, and never spoke afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any Physician or Surgeon?</p>
               <p>Collins. No, he did not mind it for two Days, though the Wound run with Blood and Water, and his Face was swelled as big as three Faces.</p>
               <p>Coroner. The Parish where he died would be at no Charge, and no Surgeon would come near him.</p>

The Deceased came to our House on the Saturday Night, when my Mother and I were not at Home; and some of our People took him in; and my Mother was angry, and said, it was hard to bury a Man for one Night's Lodging; the Woman that was with him (his Sister) called us up; I went, and found that he drew his Breath very slow; I said to her, pull him straight, for I thought he was dying; and the Woman cried, and said, he was murdered by one Mackintosh; I got an Officer, and went to take her up: says the Deceased's Sister, you must be pretty sly about it, or she will get away; I left the Officer at an Alehouse, because she should not be apprized of the Thing; I knocked at her Door, and said, Mrs Mackintosh I want to speak to you; she opened the Door, and I thought looked a little surprized at seeing a Stranger; I said, there was some-body wanted to speak with her at the Black-Boy; she said, she would not go; I got within the Door, to prevent her shutting of it; said I, What are you guilty of any Thing that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070026"/> are afraid of going; may be, I am, said she; I got within the Door, and caught fast hold of her, and cried out for Help; one of the Men at the Alehouse came and took her; says I, you are a vile Jade, you have murdered a Man, and he is now dead at my Mother's House; she said, he would have murdered her - she said, she hit him with a Poker; and that he run to the Grate, and took a Bar off, and hit her with it; and that the twisted the Bar out of his Hand; I cannot be positive whether, she said, she struck him first; she said, he had abused her; and if she had not killed him, he would have killed her</p>

            . (High Constable) On Sunday Morning, Aug. 21. I heard a Noise in the Square, between six and seven in the Morning, and was informed, that a Woman was taken up; I went to enquire about it, and found the first Evidence in the Cage; I asked the Reason, and they told me it was upon Suspicion of Murder; while I was talking, one of the Headboroughs came with the Prisoner at the Bar; and, they said, This is the Woman that has done the Injury to the Man; I asked her whether she had struck the Man; she said, she had; said I, what did you strike him with? She said, with the Bar of the Grate: then, said I, with that you killed him, for the Man is dead; she clapped her Hands together, in this Manner, having a Child in her Arms, and said, God forbid, and sat herself down, and cried.</p>

               <p>Collins. I never declared any thing to that Effect - I never mentioned it; I said, I could not tell what would be done to her, for to be sure she murdered him, and she deserves to be hanged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she had murdered her Husband, and had got seven Pounds for it; and that, she would hang me, if she did not get a Farthing for it. The Deceased gave me thirty Strokes upon my Shoulders, Thighs, and Hips; it is very strange, that a strong Man should take any Thing from such an ailing Woman as I am; he called me a thieving B - h; I said, I never did thieve any Thing in my Life; then he gave me several Blows, and I cried out, to awake these two Women, who were upon the Bed,

             was very much fuddled.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between the Prisoner and the Deceased?</p>
               <p>Jones. The Prisoner said, the Man had murdered her; she had her Child in her Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What Marks were there upon her?</p>
               <p>Jones. She was all over bloody, and could hardly take Breath with that I called him Villain; he called me a great many B - hes, and said, he would give me as much, if I spoke another Word; with that I took the Child, and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave them under such Circumstances?</p>
               <p>Jones. Because my Husband would not let me stay; the Deceased being such a vile Fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Marks of Violence upon Bryan ?</p>
               <p>Jones. Not a Mark in the World.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of any Thing?</p>
               <p>Jones. Nothing at all - the Deceased two Days afterwards sent for the Prisoner, and desired to make it up, and said, he bore her no Malice, and would had her have drank with him, but she would not; Collins was there, at the same Time, and desired her not to bear Malice.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collins. Did not you see this Woman two Days after this?</p>
               <p>Collins. This Woman was not within the House all the Time that I lived there; all that she says is false; her Sister has not seen her these twelve Months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you before a Magistrate, to give an Account of this Affair?</p>
               <p>Collins's Examination taken by Justice Richards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070027"/> was read, and agreed with the Evidence she now gave.</p>
               <p>The Justice being asked, what Condition the Prisoner was in, when she was brought before him; the Justice said, he believed, she had twenty Scratches all over her Cheeks and Forehead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Deceased and his Sister went on Thursday Night to the Black Boy and Trumpet by the Ditch Side; and they being troublesome when they are in drink, they turned them out of the House; he said, he was followed by a Press Gang, and that they abused him very much; but that he did not mind his being beat, if he had not lost his Hat; and that was the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that his being abused by the Press-Gang was the Occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Collins. There is nothing in it; I do not blame her, for endeavouring to save her Life - he was not abused by my Press Gang - I do not know any thing of his losing his Hat.</p>
               <p>Mrs Grant. The Tuesday Night he was at our House, and say there; I did not see him again till the Saturday Night; and then, I told him, I had not Conveniency for him; and gave him 2 d. to get him a Lodging; his Neck was swelled up even with his Chin, and if it had not been for his Voice, I should not have known him - he talked very reasonably.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collins. Where did you go to on Thursday Night, after you had been at the Alehouse?</p>
               <p>Collins. We parted at the End of the Lane; and, he said, he was going to his Lodging; I met him the next Morning, and between six and seven in the Evening; and then, he went to Mrs Johnson's, and lay there (she keeps a Lodging House) Mrs Grant was afraid he should die in her House, and so would not let him come there. <rs id="t17430907-46-verdict239" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 8th of June, I was going along the Road to Harefield, in a Cart, with one Horse, with Mrs Horabin, Mrs Hildersry, and my Wife; I was going down the Hill, and saw three Carts coming up; the Road was there fifteen Foot and an half wide; I got off the Cart, and drawed out of the Track which I was in, three or four Inches, and stood up against the Bank; so that I think the Prisoner might have gone by without coming upon the Cart we were in; and if he had gone on the other Side of the Lane, there would have been Room enough for a Man to have stood between the Wheels of the two Cart; the Road was not at all dangerous; it was a dry Time; I never knew an Instance of any Cart being overturned there: About five Yards before he came up, to me, I said, honest Friend, or Fellow, he so good as to bold to; with that he took hold of his Horse's Head - he was on the right Side, where he ought to be; he took hold of his Thill Horse Halter, but never spoke a Word; when he came nearer to me, I said or for God's Sake, hold off; but instead of that, he hold nearer to me, and pushed the batt End of his Whip against the Horse's Head, and drove him towards me; and the Wheel went out of the Track, and came against my Wheel; I cried out, for God Sake, stop your Horses - I thought he was very sober, it was about eleven o'Clock in the Morning - the Woman that were in my Cart were sitting in Chairs, and I thought they were very safe then, for the Wheel was locked in; but the Wheel of his Cart drew mine up upon the Bank - one of which was upon the Ground, and the other up in the Air; and then the Women fell out before his Wheel; I had hold of my Horse all that Time - the Women slid out at the Back-Side of the Cart, and so fell before his Wheel - not above a Yard before the Wheel.</p>

               <p>Cook. He never stopped at all; - his Cart went over my Wheel, and so over the Women.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the Wheel so close to your Cart, did you say any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Cook. I called to him, but there was not Time for an Answer. - I saw the Wheel go over that young Lady, Mrs Horabin, and I thought she could not have lived; I turned her Coats on one Side, and the fleshy Part of her Leg was tore in such a manner that it was surprizing.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think that after the Women were upon the Ground he could have stopped his Cart?</p>
               <p>Cook. I do not think he could, time enough to prevent the Mischief - my Wife died<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070028"/> of the Wounds, to my very great Loss: The prosecuting of this Man will be no Recompence to me, but I think I ought to do it in Justice to my Country; as soon as my Wife was dead, I went to enquire after the Prisoner, and he was gone off; the Monday after my Wife was buried, I offered five Guineas to have him taken, and desired a Person to take my Horse, and if he rode 20 Miles that he should endeavour to find out the Prisoner; we could not then hear of him, but the first Time I heard of him at his Master's I had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Mrs Horrabin confirmed Mr Cook's Evidence, and said, that the Cart run over her Thigh and her Arm, and broke her Thigh, and that there was Room enough on the other Side of the Road for the Prisoner to have pulled off. - I was in a covered Cart, but not so covered but that I could see through the Hoops.</p>
               <p>Mrs Hildersly gave an Account very consistent with Mr Cook's, and that he called to the Prisoner a dozen Yards before he came up with them, that he looked into their Cart, as he was going by, drove on, and said nothing; but cannot be positive whether his Wheel was out of the Track, she being so frightened, that she could not tell whether she fell cut of the Cart, or not, nor how she escaped sowell</p>

            . I drove one of the Carts that were on the Road at that Time, and where Mr Cook drew out of the Cart-Ruts, there was Room for two or three Carts to pass there, without any Danger; and after he got off, he led his Horse two or three Pole, and drew his near Wheel upon the Bank, the Value of two Foot; which occasioned the off Wheel to lean towards the Wheel of the Chalk Cart, and by that Means the Top of the two Wheels rubbed against one another - the Women fell down behind the loaded Cart of Mr Jefferies's - I was four or five pole behind the Cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no part of the Wheel of Mr Jefferies's Cart that run over these People?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. No, they fell behind the Wheel.</p>

               <p>Barth. Menitray. On Saturday, the 9th of July in the Evening, on Tower-Hill I met the Prisoner and another Woman; the Prisoner wanted me to come into a House; I went into a House with them both, and then the Prisoner asked me if I would not have a Quartern of Gin: The Gin was brought and I drank a Dram of it, and it had such an Effect upon me, that I fell fast asleep, and slept from seven to ten. - I had not been drinking to signify any thing, I was as sober as ever I was. After I awoke I knocked for some body, in order to go away, and saw only an old Woman with a Pipe of Tobacco in her Mouth, who asked me, if I would not go away; I said I was willing to go, but feeling in my Pocket, and missing my Watch, I said I was not willing to go, for I had the Watch when I went into the House; after I had asked for my Things, in comes a Soldier with his Hanger, in order to thrust me out, and gave me several Blows; I was going to call the Watch, and the Soldier said, What do you want to ravish my Wife? You Dog, get out, I have a good mind to murder you; and though I was in that found Sleep, I was almost positive it was the Prisoner that took the Watch out of my Pocket. I am positive to her Person that she was with me.</p>

               <p>Morgan. I cannot be positive to a Minute; the Man made two or three Blows at me with a Mop-stick, which I received upon my Knees, the Cure of which cost me six Guineas; however, I overcame him with my Cane, and he got into a Shed, and then I got into the Lane or Street, or what you please to call it; when I was out of the House, y shut the Door; and I stood at the Door, and It does not any Thing Door, for I will not go I have Satisfaction; if I lose my Things I cannot help it, but I will have Satisfaction; the Prisoner then threw me my Shoe-Buckles and Knee-Buckles, and flung my Hat and Wig over the Fence to me, and bid me be gone, like a Scoundrel Dog, as I was; I made answer, and told them, I would not go; I took a Piece of Chalk, and wrote my Name upon the Door, and said, I would have Satisfaction, before I went from that Place; and, I believe, I walked about an Hour, before I could see any Body to send for a Constable; Mr Sharrock, at the Three Pidgcons in Fleet street, came to my Assistance; I told him, I had been robbed in that House, and desired he would see me satisfied, in some Shape or other; while I was talking to the Constable; the Prisoner, he came to the Door. and asked what Business I had to walk there; I told him, I had been robbed in the House; he made me this Reply, that he was Master of that House; I said to him, Sir, If you are Master of the House, I desire you would order your Door to be opened, for if you are an honest Man, you will not suffer any dishonest Thing to be done in your House; he said, he knew nothing of it; he had been Abroad all the Night: The Constable heard the Door open, and we went in; said I, Sir, Don't be afraid, I will go in first; we went into every Room of the House; and Mr Sharrock said, I believe Mr Morgan we shall find the Money, and we found it under the Bolster; exactly the Money that I lost - there were no People to be found in the House, but an old Woman, and a little Infant about twelve Months old; then I told the Prisoner, Sir, You very much like the Man that used me; so I charged the Constable with him; carried him to the Bell in Bell-Savage Yard, and from thence to the Counter - I cannot swear he is the Man; I believe he changed his Apparel, and came round about some way or other: he that abused me, was a tall Man. pitted with the Small-Pox [a Description suitable to the Prisoner.]</p>

               <p>Morgan. I thought there might be as much honestly up two Pair of Stairs, as up one Pair; if a Man does love a Girl it cannot be helped, but if he does he is not to be murdered and robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say that Mr Drinkwater and Mr Sharrock persuaded you to this Prosecution?</p>
               <p>Morgan.

When I came there Mr Morgan was at the Door, and said, he had been robbed in the House, and that he would not leave the Door till he had Satisfaction; presently I saw Mr Stansbury standing there, said I to Mr Morgan, Do you think you should know the Man if you saw him; he turned about, and saw Stansbury, and said, I believe that is the Man, and he charged me with him. I desired Mr Stansbury to give Leave for somebody to get over the Pales into the House; he denied it, and said he had been out all Night, and he would not give Leave. After I had waited there about a Quarter of an Hour, the Door was opened, - a Girl opened the Door, and then we went up Stairs, and the Girl said, May be, Mr Sharrock, you may find the Money upon the Bed in such a Room, for the Captain was there; I said to Mr Morgan, You will have your Money again, for I have seen this Trick several Times, and there the Money lay under the Bed not as if it had sell out of any body's Pocket, but in a regular Order; there were five Moidores, Half a Guinea, and three Shillings. Then I took Stansbury to the Bell, in Bell-Savage-Yard, and told him what Money was lost. The Captain had then made a Mistake of a Guinea. he thought he had lost a Guinea more, and Stansbury said, He would leave his Watch, and make him any Satisfaction if he would let him go; I told him as I had got him, and several Robberies had been committed in his House, I would not let him go, without being discharged by a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came you to know of the Blood-Bowl.</p>
               <p>Sharrock. Because I saw it in the News-papers.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by casting?</p>

               <p>Gray. Cotes threw some in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell, who cast them that were cast whole?</p>

               <p>Q. Did Marmaduke or Cotes do it?</p>
               <p>Gray. I saw Cotes and Duke do that; after that they left off at that Time, and on the Monday Morning, when I came to work, they seemed sorry for what they had done; and said, they would do so no more; the Wednesday after that, we were casting Plates and Easons again; and

Pieces, and that which cast the Half-Crowns, and melted them down in my Master's Iron Ladle, and threw them under my Master's Pit; and said, that there never should be any such thing done more while he staid; - the Prisoner was taken up the next Day, - Duke was run away; he went away on the Wednesday; when Cotes melted the Moulds down, he had some of the bad Pieces by him, that they had made, and he put them into the Pit, and melted them.</p>
               <p>Q. What made Duke run away?</p>
               <p>Gray. I believe it was upon the Account of something that Mr Stevens had heard, and he charged him with it, and he run away.</p>

            .

I took up a Person that I mistrusted, and she cried out Murder, and then the Neighbours described the Prisoner, and said they saw such an one go in, but they did not know her Name. Upon hearing a Noise and Disturbance, the Prisoner who lodged at the next Door, came out; then one of the Neighbours swore that she was the Person that went in and out twice. The Prisoner said if I would not hurt her she would tell me where the Things were, she went with me to the Pawnbroker's and asked for the Things; they brought them out, but would not let me have them without paying the Use, tho' I told them they were my Things that were stole, and there was their Prisoner; the Prisoner ran away and went to her Lodging, and I took her that Night.</p>

Mr Pope told me, he believed, that Fellow had got some Sugar that was stole, and that I should do Service to my Country to take him; I asked him how he came by it; he first asked what Business I had with that; then, he said, he was going with it to Schoolhouse-lane, then to Cut-Throat-Lane; he said, it belonged to one King in Cut-Throat-Lane; then, he said, he was to go to St Catherine's with it; then to a Dutchman, a Sugar-Baker, against the Watch-house in Ratcliff Highway (that is Mr Pope) - the Sugar was as wet as Muck, and the Bag as wet as if it had been dipped in Water - I believe, when he came before the Justice, he did say, it belonged to one King of Shadwell-Market - King came, and saw the Sugar after the Prisoner was committed, and said it was his.</p>

               <p>Millington. Mr Ambler sent to me several Times, to desire me to keep my Servant from coming. I know nothing of the Robbery - Thomas Fox is my Servant.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fox. Is that your Hand?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes; but I had no more Value for it than nothing; I rented an empty Room of her for three Weeks, in the Time of my Necessity; I rent a House of 24 l. a Year now.</p>
               <p>- Ambler. I arrested the poor Man (Blathet.) and when I had him in Custody he said, If you do not stand my Friend, I shall be ruin'd; says he, Fox owes me five Pounds for which I have a Note of of his Hand. I went with this Note to Fox's House, and told him, if he did not pay it, I must arrest him, says he, If this is the Case, they shall not be long out of Newgate, and in a Day or two the Robbery was sworn against the Woman. Fox owned that he had the Value of the Note at that Time. One Mr Eastwood a Soilicitor, swore her Husband into a Conspiracy, and he was kept in Custody till be could raise a little Money to get himself discharged; the other never followed it. Her Husband was a Butcher in Carnaby Market, in pretty good Circumstances; but the swearing him into that Conspiracy cost him near 100 l.</p>
