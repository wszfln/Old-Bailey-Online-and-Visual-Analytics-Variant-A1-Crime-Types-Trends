                  </hi>. I am a policeman, stationed at Ealing, No. 137 T. On the 20th of Jan., about four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road, near Ealing, and between the Green Man and the Coach and Horses, I met two of Messrs. Fountain's wagons—I did not see either of the prisoners at that time—the wagons were loaded with flour—I saw a truss of hay behind each wagon—in consequence of information, I folded a piece of paper, and put a piece into each truss—the teams stopped at the Coach and Horses, as I expected they would—while there I saw Newell, who is ostler at the Coach and Horses, take a truss of hay from behind each wagon, and place it in the shed where he keeps the corn—it was clover and grass toge<lb/>ther—Barber and Foster were not standing by—they were in the house, I believe—I procured assistance, and went after the teams—I asked a boy, who was with the wagons, if they had left any hay at the Coach and Horses—he said, "No"—the prisoners Barber and Foster were one in each wagon—I spoke to the boy loud enough for them to hear—I then asked Barber, and he said he had—he did not give me any reason why he had done it—I then went to the other wagon, and asked Foster if he had left any hay there—he said he had not left any, and never did leave any, and did not know that any was gone—I then went to the Coach and Horses, and found the two trusses of hay in the shed—they were the same which I had marked—Newell had been to bed—he got up, and came down to the door when I went to his house, I asked if he chose to give any account of how he became possessed of the hay—he said, "I sup<lb/>pose</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010006"/>
               <p>you know how I got it"—I asked him if he had any objection to my taking possession of it—he said, "If you take it away, I shall expect you to bring it back again, but you may take it if you like"—on their return with the teams from London I took Barber and Foster into custody—I knew the wagons of Messrs. Fountain—Barber and Foster were in the habit of coming up with them—I have seen them stop at the Coach and Horses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Barber.</hi> I was riding on the wagon, and heard him say to my little boy, "Have you left any hay?" I looked out of the wagon, and said, "Yes, be<lb/>cause I had more than my horses would eat, and my hay would be all right when I came back." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not hear anything of the sort.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Barber.</hi> The policeman told me himself that he stood at the door at the time Newell took the hay and put it in the shed, and he said, "I am going to take it and put it in the shed till the men come back." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not say anything of the sort—he tried to prevent my seeing where he took the hay to—he went round the back of some carts, instead of going straight up the road.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">EDWARD FOUNTAIN</hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, as millers at Hillingdon. Barber and Foster have been in our service—they were so on the 20th of Jan. last—it was their duty to drive two wagons laden with flour early that morning—I have seen the two trusses of hay taken by the police<lb/>man from the Coach and Horses at Ealing—I believe it is my property—the prisoners had no authority whatever from me to leave, or consent that Newell should take any portion of my hay into the Coach and Horses—my instru<lb/>ction were for them not to take any quantity that they could make away with—they were not allowed to take half the quantity they did take—they took what they had, themselves—I have told them repeatedly what they were to take, and they both knew—that day the horses went twenty-two or twenty<lb/>three miles out—they had other bait in their nose-bags, independent of the hay—I know of no reason for leaving either the trusses, or any other quantity of hay belonging to me for my horses at the Coach and Horses, or I should not have appeared here as a prosecutor—they would come back to the Coach and Horses and have a bait there—that was their only baiting place—if they wanted hay, it must have been to feed the horses on the road—they had a sack of bran, chaff, and beans, besides the nose-bags—I had refused them having hay for some time, and they reported that their horses did not go on as well without it, and I allowed them to take a small quantity for the purpose of feeding on the road, and only that—I allowed them to put up at the Coach and Horses for bait, with what they had with them—they had my orders expressly not to take hay in trusses behind the wagon for the purpose of the horses—the quantity they had, exceeded what they could have any occasion for.</p>

And in about two minutes I heard the street door slam—I went up, and the prisoner was gone—I missed the cloaks out of the hall, which I had seen there the night before—it was their regular place.</p>

I was in the Minories on the 12th of Jan., and I saw the two prisoners together—they came past the Three kingdoms public-house, and went to Mr. bateman's window—they stood talking there a few minutes, with their faces turned towards the window—they stood close to me, and I heard Jennings say to Jones, "go on, it is all right"—that led me to suspect something wrong—I saw Jones go into the shop—I went to window, and saw her give Miss Higgins a shilling—I saw her look at it—she turned it round, and rubbed it with her finger—she took it back to Mr. Bateman—she then came out and gave it to Jones—I went and stooped her, and took it from her—she said a lady gave it her for carry-ing a parcel—I asked where the lady lived, and where it was done—she said she did not know—I handed the shilling to Miss Higgins, and left Jones in the shop with a friend of mine, who was with me—I went and laid hold of Jennings, who was six or seven yards from the door—he dropped three shillings—I picked them up, and said, "where did you get these?—he said "I found them wrapped up in a piece of paper, which I have in my pockets"—I took him into the shop—Jones was there—I asked Jennings if he knew that female—he said, "No, I never saw her in my life before"—I told Miss Higgins to mark the shilling, which she did, and gave it me—this is it, and these are the other three.</p>

I am a cloth-manufacturer, carrying on business at Leeds—my father is partner with me—I have an agent in London for the sale of cloth, Mr. Isaac Hainsworth—his warehouse is in Aldermanbury, next door to the Axe Inn—I was in town at Mr. Hainsworth's on the 30th of Nov—amongst other goods in the warehouse there was a piece of rifle green cloth, and another piece of double milled brown—the green was twenty-nine yards long, and the brown was twenty-seven yards—I saw them safe on the 30th of Nov.—I was at Mr. Hainsworth's again on the 1st of Dec., and about one o'clock that day Mr. Hainsworth and I went out of dinner together—the prisoner was in the warehouse and boy named Sykes, whose father is commission-agent Mr. Hainsworth said to the boy, "John, come, are you not going to dinner?"—he said no, he had dined, he was going to the West end for his father—Mr. Hainsworth said, "You must leave the keys of the warehouse at the Axe tap, John"—Mr. Hainsworth and I went to dinner—in about three quarters of an hour we returned and found the ware-house locked, and the key was at the Axe tap—on the following day Mr. Hainsworth and I took stock, and the rifle green cloth and the double milled brown were missing—they were gone out of thr warehouse—on the 5th of Dec. I saw the prisoner—I did not give him into custody, as I had not found the cloth—I did not know positively who had got it—I went out of town on the 5th of Dec. and returned on the 1st of Jan.—it is the course of my business to go round to customers to show them samples, in order to effect sales—on the 6th of Jan. I went to Mr. Morgan's shop in cloth-fair—while I was trying to effect the sale of some cloths there, Mr. Morgan said I could not sell him any as cheap as he had bought some—I saw two six yards remnants of rifle green cloth on the counter—I knew them directly I saw them, and I made inquiries of Mr. Morgan how he got them—in consequence of what I learned from him I went to the police-station, and gave information—I went with the officer to a beer-shop in Milton-street, I found the prisoner and gave him into custody—here are the two pieces of cloth of six yards each which I found at Mr. Morgan's—they formed a part of the twenty-nine yards which were at Mr. Hainsworth's on the 30th of Nov., and which I missed in taking stock on the 2nd of Dec.—I have another piece of cloth which is my manufacture, and which I sent to Mr. Hainsworth's—it is the fellow-end to that twenty-nine yards—they were woven together at my father's house—in colour and shade they are the same—there are two of the red threads in the middle of the list of it which are thicker than the other—the number of threads in this cloth is twenty-nine, and there is the same number in that found at Mr. Morgan's—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard at the wholesule value—I knew it by the colour and the thread, and the mark in the list.</p>

I took stock, and the pieces of green cloth and the pieces of brown were both gone—I did not find what had become of any of them, till after these two pieces of rifle green were traced to Mr. Morgan's—I have looked at these two pieces, at the texture, the make, the shade, and the list—I have no doubt they are a part of that twenty-nine yards that was the cloth of Mr. Wade, and was missing from my premises—we sold the fellow piece to it at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard to whole<lb/>sale houses—I suppose it sells retail at ten or fifteen per cent. more.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live in Bloomsbury-square. In Jan., 1845, I car<lb/>ried on the business of a jeweler, in Argyle-place—on the 7th of Jan., 1845, the prisoner called at my house—I had known him nearly a month—(I had been dealing with him before—he had brought me some orders in Dec., 1845)—there were two diamond brooches among other things on the counter—he looked at them—I beilve he said he could sell them—I am not certain whe<lb/>ther he did not say he had an application to show such things to the Queen—as far as I recollect, he came for something, and said he could sell some<lb/>thing handsome, being commanded to get such things—I do not recollect his precise words—I believe when he had them away he said he had come expressly from Windsor—that he had on that day been employed by Her Majesty at the Castle; and, as far I recollect, he said he was sent for these brooches—that he was sent to get something handsome to show Her Majesty—some brooches or articles of jewellery—he said he was employed at the Castle, and had two guineas a-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he explain what opportunity he had of showing them to Her Majesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I recollect, he said he was commanded to bring them, and that he had means of showing them to Her Majesty—I gave him the brooches, and told him the price of one would be 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think.</p>

I received the letter I have lost—I do not remember the post-mark, but I think it was King William-street, City—the substance of the letter was that he was going abroad, it was not that he was obliged to go, in consequence of a suit for a divorce that was going on, it was apologizing for this conduct to me, and returning me the duplicates, and saying that he would pay me some day—I do not think it said he was going abroad—I directly ordered inquiry to be made for him, but could never ascertain whether he had gone abroad—received information that he was in this country from a man named Wilson, who I had in my employment, and who the prisoner had brought to me as a workman, a man in distress—my affairs were not in the hands of the assignees at the time I received the information of his being in this country—I did not receive information from Wilson to take him into custody—I lost sight of him for some months—I received the next information that he was to be found only a few months back—when my attention was called by the return of the duplicates I did not refer to my books to ascertain the exact dates of the transaction; I think I had no other transaction with him till early in Jan.—I never saw him after the 15th—I had not fifteen jobs from him in Dec., I think only four, they came to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ascertain that from him my workman's books—I have one book here, in which payments appear, that is for the stick—my payments for work are in a petty cash-book, which my son kept, he is in India—I have had notice to produce that book, but cannot find it—I have lost two books, the book in which the amount paid to me for work appears is lost—I have ascertained the amount from my workman's books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, carrying on business at Enfield. By the direction of the Corner of the Duchy of Lancaster, I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>motem</hi> examination of the body of Martha Hobbs—that was about seventy<lb/>two hours after her death—she had evident marks of <hi rend="italic">psoriasis</hi>, which is a scaly disease of the skin—it is sometimes called scaly tetter—on examining the brain I found recent inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arachnoid</hi> mem<lb/>brane—there was a gelatinous deposit in the convolutions of the brain, which appeared like serum and lymph together—the substance of the brain was flat<lb/>ulent—the brain was very much congested, which was particularly seen in the medullary structure of the brain—it was more particularly marked there—there were adhesions—I think there was no mark of chronic disease—there was a small portion of fluid at the base of the brain—there were no marks of disease on the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi>—there was inflammation of the internal lining of the <hi rend="italic">pericardium</hi>—that was also recent—I think the congestion of the brain was brought on from the transfer of the chronic disease of the skin to the serous membranes of which I have spoken—it leads to the chronic disease of the skin being transformed into an acute disease of those membranes, which very soon ended in death—in my option, the cause of death was acute disease, brought on by the transfer of the constitutional chronic disease of the skin to the in<lb/>ternal membranes and organs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would, or would not that transfer be accelerated by the continued ap<lb/>plication of cold in the shape of wet sheets, and wet cloths to the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The continued application of cold, by acting on the blood-vessels of the skins, causing a contraction of them, and thereby driving the blood from the surface of the body to the internal organs, considerably facilitates the transfer of such diseased action—I found the body in an <hi rend="italic">anemial</hi> or bloodless condition—that remark more especially applies to the external appearance of the body—the cutaneous vessels, which are very numerous on the <hi rend="italic">derma</hi>, commonly giving to the human character that flesh colour, were entirely empty—the constitu<lb/>tional disease of the skin which I witnessed, and the poverty of system, by which I mean poorness of blood, and which, in all probability, had existed for a considerable time, would have induced me to adopt a different line of prac<lb/>tice—there was decided poverty of system and poorness of blood—the sto<lb/>mach was empty of food, and the colon, which is the organ usually conveying the feces, had no particle of feces in it—that state of the body would render warmth necessary, and cold I consider would be prejudicial—in a case of acute inflammation I possibly might have bled in the onset, to have unloaded the vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you have the goodness to tell us whether or not, in your judg<lb/>ment, the application of cold water cloths to the head, and wet sheets to the body, supposing them to have been applied, did or did not cause the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that the cold application caused the death of the patient—I cannot say that it did not—I cannot, as a medical man, say that it did—under such a state of body as the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination indicated I think such applications would accelerate the death—the application of cold long conti<lb/>nued to the surface of the body would most unquestionably increase conges<lb/>tion of the brain, or produce it; hence the practice of putting the body in a</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the application of cold to the head you did not include in your former statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—if cold was applied to the head whilst the body was in warm water, that would have a tendency to counteract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing wet sheets to be placed round the body, and cold wet cloths applied to the head at the same time, what should you say then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I certainly think the practice injudicious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But would it, or not, if applied to a person suffering under this cuta<lb/>neous disease, accelerate death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If no reaction took place, it would un<lb/>questionably, in consequence of the application of cold on the surface of the body, and I think the emptiness of the blood-vessels on the surface of the body, show that reaction had not taken place—in consequence of there being a law in the animal economy to transfer disease from the surface of the body to the interior, from natural causes in that body, it is impossible for me to say what degree of power I must allow to that natural cause and what degree of power to the cold, therefore it is impossible for me to say that cold killed the individual—I cannot distinguish the one from the other, and I have the authority of John Hunter for saying that we cannot arrive at it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable, in the service of the London and North Western Railway Company. On the 9th of Jan. I was on duty at the Camden station—I recollect looking at a wagon that had come up, and was on the railway—it contained eight casks of tallow—between nine and ten o'clock I assisted in shifting them from one place to another, and I observed the head of one of the casks was out—the tallow was in it, but on the casks being shifted two large lumps, with some small ones, fell out of the cask, through their being bumped backwards and forwards—they fell into the bottom of the wagon—at a quarter to twelve I saw the prisoner coming from towards that wagon—he had something in his hand which appeared white—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010044"/>
               <p>could not distinctly see what it was—as soon as he observed me he stopped—I was crossing the line, about five yards distance off him—he stopped, and turned his face towards the wagon, and held what he had, and what proved to be the tallow, between the wagon and himself—I made a pause, and as soon as he crossed the rail he started back—he turned round, retraced his steps, passed between the third and fourth wagon, and placed what turned out to be the tallow, on the foot-plate of the engine No. 90 and tender—he passed down on the same line that the engine was on—I stepped to the left of the line, and asked the engine-driver who put the tallow there—I then called the prisoner back—he came back, and I asked him what made him take the tallow from the wagon—he said, "Oh, do look over me, and allow the tallow to be put back again"—I told him it was not consistent with my duty to allow him to do anything of the kind—I took him into custody—this is the tallow—I have looked at it, and compared it with the tallow in the wagon—they are of the same kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do they use tallow for oiling the wheels of the carriages and engines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, quite a different thing—I have some of it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to ask the engine-driver who put the tallow there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My reason was, for more sub<lb/>stantial evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think that your evidence was substantial enough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how came you to ask the engine-driver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he saw it put there—I asked him for information—I knew myself—I asked him be<lb/>cause I should have another witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not imagine anybody would disbelieve you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had not helped to take this bag of tallow—I had seen it before—me and the en<lb/>gine-driver moved the casks—the prisoner was not assisting—he might be present on the stage—he did not come close to me, and talk to me—I did not see him when the wagons were shifting—it was not me let the grease fall out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was shifting the casks from one line to another—they were bumped out by the engine—I did not move the grease—the engine moved it—while the engine moved it, it came out—the driver has charge of the engine—I have been a police-constable on this railway four years and five months—before that I was a soldier—I was ten years in the East India Company's service—the prisoner has been there seventeen or eighteen months—we have had a word or two, but it was before this—it was some time ago—we were on amicable terms—my feelings were quite good to him—I had no anger towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember one day the train being late, and some of the trucks were knocked off the line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was my duty to give the signals that day—the prisoner said it was my fault that it happened—I told him he was a false man—I did not say if he was off the station I would make him smell hell—I do not recollect the terms I used—I said, 'You are a false man"—these were the words I used, as far as I recollect—a person named Heale was present I think immediately after—there might have been a few other words—I do not recollect what—I have not the best of me<lb/>mories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him you would mark him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—I did not say, "I will mark you, you b—r"—it might be "beggar"—I said I would mark him—that was not because he said it was my own stupidity and folly—I said I would mark him because he interfered with my duty.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010045"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And I believe you did contrive to mark him, did not you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I remember Christmas-day—I was on duty—I did not bring up some new wagons—the prisoner came in charge of them—he brought them up to Camden-town—I did not order him to take them back to Kilburn—he did not refuse to take them back, saying he had been two days and one night at work—he never mentioned anything of the sort—I said he was drunk, but not that I would report him for being drunk—Mr. Richards, the clerk, is here—the prisoner did not insist on going to the office—I took him myself up to the office—I did not take hold of him—he walked alongside of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that in consequence of his saying, "I will go to the office, and have it ascertained whether I am drunk or not?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was not so<lb/>ber—Mr. Richards considered him so—he was mistaken—a great many cows sometimes come up by our railway—I have a can—I do not occa<lb/>sionally relieve the cows of any superfluous milk that they may have—I do not swear I have never milked the cows on the railway—I might—I have, but if I did such a thing I have had permission to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But how came you to swear to me that you never had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that is of immaterial consequence—if a man came up with a quantity of cows, and said, "You can have a can of milk," I might have had it—I have not reported it to the railway company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you used it yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I believe my inspector who I once had knew of it—that was Mr. Challos—I never said a word about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been in the service of the railway com<lb/>pany some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, four years and five months, and the prisoner has been in their service seventeen or eighteen months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During that time had you no quarrel with him previous to the occasion of your calling him a false man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. previous to that we had been on good terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During you on that occasion show your signal to your fellow policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I appealed to the guard, in presence of the prisoner, and the guard said I showed it at 100 yard distance, and the prisoner said I had only shown it at six yards distance—there were high words on that occasion on both sides, and I told him I would mark him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the mere effect of momentary anger, or a purpose of settled malice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not malice; nothing more than heat and anger,—on Christmas-day it was not the prisoner's business to bring up the train—he had nothing to do with it, unless he acted as porter—he assisted in getting these wagons on, that were thrown off—that bad not caused any delay, or hindered another train—we moved the wagons off—I saw the prisoner on Christmas-day, at the end of one of the goods-trains, drinking out of a tin can, and a labouring man with him, who appeared to be sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Trough the indecent answer he made me, he was under the influence of liquor, not to say drunk—a proposition was made that he should take the train back to Kilburn—it was his duty—he did not take it, because I took him up to Mr. Richards, and he directed me to report him for being absent from duty, and Mr. Richards sent another man—Mr. Richards said he thought the prisoner was not fit to take the train back, and directed me to report him, but I did not, I let him off.</p>

I sent 603 pieces of mouselin-de-laine to Mr. Matthews, our dresser and hot-presser, to block and board them—on the 9th of Jan., 300 pieces were returned, and on the 12th of Jan. 303 were returned, making 603 pieces—I afterwards found, on measuring them, from five to a dozen pieces were short of their proper quantity—my attention was called to the fact by Cobley, by the production of some pieces apparently detached from the larger ones—I found by comparison that they had been cut from the larger pieces—these are them—here is the original piece which this one has been taken from—this smaller piece makes up the proper quantity with the other, and this small piece has our private mark on it; and here is also the stamp put by Act of Parliament, by which these goods are registered when they are brought out, they are made of wool and cotton—this piece is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these pieces are all form our goods—we have no means of swearing to these other pieces—they have no mark—they are the exact patterns of ours—there are several places in the original pieces where these have been torn from—if you take a glass and examine the threads, you will see this one has been torn from this piece—it fits and matches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cloth-worker and dresser—I am employed by Partridge and Co., of Cheapside. On Thursday, the 7th of Jan., I received a quantity of mouselin-de-lane from them, to board—we boarded them, and sent some back on Saturday, and some on the Monday—I had the prisoner and about seven more to do the work—I noticed on one of the pieces the name of Partridge and Co.—I think the prisoner would in general have an opportunity in doing that work to detach pieces from them, but not on this occasion—there were seven more helping him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were a lot of others employed on this work beside the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were my servants at the time, but are not now, only two of them—the prisoner was at work part of the time these goods were in the house, though not all the time—he worked for me five years—two years at the shop in Noble-street, and three years at No. 46, Basinghall-street—my business is to board and press these goods for Mr. Partridge—I do that for many others—I have these kind of remnants from time to time in my possession—I do a deal for houses, and we buy remnants of this description, and I sell them as well as being a dresser—none of the men in my employ buy them, to my knowledge—there are men in the trade who make a common practice of it—I do not know Petticoat-lane—when I was at journey work I used to know it—I used to work for Dodridge and Lowe, and our cart used to go sown there; and Rosemary-lane I know, but still I am not a dealer there—I believe these could be bought and sold in Petticoat-lane—I never had a more honest lad than the prisoner—till this matter, he had always borne an irreproachable character—I am sorry to have to appear against him—I would employ him again to-morrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lower Simonds-street, Chelsea. On the 4th of August the prisoner came and knocked at my door—my wife let him in—he came in the name of M'Gan, he said he was my wife's brother, and he was glad he had found his sister—my wife said she did not know she had a brother—she had him in and made much of him—he remained till the Friday evening—he then absconded, and we missed two silk handkerchiefs and a pair of stockings—he stated that he had brought two feather beds and a piece of linen for sheeting from my wife's friends in Ireland, and be borrowed a sovereign on the Wednesday to go the Docks to release those thing and bring them, but he did not bring them—I found him on the 15th January, and gave him into custody—he acknowledged he took the handkerchiefs, but not the stockings—my wife had left Ireland 24 years ago, when a child, and she did not know whether she had a brother—the prisoner could tell all her rela<lb/>tions better than she could herself, and she had a letter about a week before he came to say he was coming, and she thought everything he said was true.</p>

I remember the prisoner coming to his house in Aug.—he said he had come from Ireland, and had got some beds and some sheeting, that he had been a sergeant in some regiment in India, and had got a great deal of property from there, silks and satins, and everything else, and a great quantity of jewellery—he got a sovereign on the Wednesday to go to the docks to get thing out—he said they were <hi rend="italic">quarantined</hi>—he introduced himself as one of the family—he said my mistress's father had married another party in some other part, and he was her brother—he stopped, and was made very much of, till Friday, when master was gone to town he made off—I missed the handkerchiefs and pair of smoking—I recollect the prisoner took up the handkerchiefs and rubbed them to his face to see if they were India handkerchiefs—he said they were not India as his were.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hart-street, Covent-garden, and am a coach<lb/>plater. The acceptance to this bill is no my handwriting—I know nothing of it—I never authorized the prisoner or any person to accept this bill for me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It is not at all like your writing, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It does a little resemble it in the name Breese, except the E—I have known the pri<lb/>soner about twenty years, but had not seen him for twelve years, till within the last three years—he is a master smith—during the three years we have done a little business together—I never accepted but two bills for him in my life—the last was in January, 1846—he came to me, and said, if I would oblige him by accepting a 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, he could not exactly tell what time the party would discount it, and asked me to leave the date—this is it,(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) and the only one in existence—there never was but one previous to this, which was one for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner destroyed that—the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was an ac<lb/>commodation bill—I did not owe him a shilling—I had paid him my accounts. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not an account between you at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing but a few jobs—not 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I accepted it entirely to accommodate him, as he said in three months he could take it up—I did not pay that bill—he gave me a memorandum at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About the first or second week in Oct. were you at the prisoner's shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think I saw him himself for a week previous to this bill being dated—he had done a few jobs for me and I for him, but I did not see him—I think I was at his shop the beginning of Oct.—I had paid the balance of his account, and had his receipt—he wished me to be security to a loan society for him, which I declined—everything was paid—he did not at that time speak to me ablut the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he came to me, and stated that he had lost the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and would I accept another that was a few days after</p>

               <p>the 19th Jan., 1846—I objected, and did not accept another—he said he had given it to a person to give cash for it, and had lost it—I said, "I should like to see the party, give me his address"—he said he did not exactly know the address, it was somewhere about Clerkenwell—he gave me a memorandum that it was lost, which I have here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you called on him in Oct., did you not speak to him about the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill you had accepted in the early part of the year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not know it was in existence—I had accepted a 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill previous to the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but never one afterwards—the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was in Cope's hands and became due in Jan.—I said nothing to him in Oct. about a bill or bills in Cope's hands—I said nothing at all about any such bills.</p>

No—there were no bills in Cope's hands—he did not say that or anything to that effect—nothing was said about a 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill at all at the interview in Oct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say I bad rather not accept a bill of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard anything of it at all, and I never was asked a question about it—he did not say he wanted the bill at once, and beg me to accept it at once—he said nothing about it, nor did I say very well, you may put my name to it, nor anything to that effect—I have been in the habit of running into his shop at various times on business—perhaps twice a week, at that time, about trifling articles—I might have been there two minutes or five or six minutes early in Oct.—I did not produce any bills of parcels to him—accounts were not produced on both sides—I don't think I have seen him since the 10th or 12th of Oct. myself—this bill was regularly presented by cope for payment—he had not presented any other bill at my house—I had no transaction with Cope on my own account—I have been in business there about five years—I was never in pecuniary difficulties.</p>

               <p>was standing just by the bellows, and seeing him come in I thought I ought to get out of the way, not knowing his business—I got up in a conrner—I was taking some bread and cheese and porter—I could hear what passed—they were talking together about five minutes—Mr. Breese was about to leave the shop, when Mr. Johnson turned to him and said, in a faint voice, "What is It you want?"—Johnson said, "I want you to do a little bill for me to-day"—Mr. Breese said he was in a hurry, as he was going somewhere, but would be back in about an hour or an hour and a half—Mr. Johnson said that would not do, it must be done directly—the answer of Mr. Breese was, "Well, if that won't do——"—I beg pardon, Mr. Johnson said, "Will you allow me to sign it for you?"—the answer was, "Why, yes it will be all the same."</p>

I was one of the last persons up, with my wife and housekeeper—it was the practice of the potman to leave between ten and half-past ten at night—I went to bed on the night in question about twelve, or half-past—I had seen nothing of the prisoner James Barker from half-past ten till the time I went to bed—the last time I saw him that night was at a quarter before ten—he was then opposite the bar—he was fastening up the shutters in the front of the house—there are places where he might have concealed himself in the house—I went over the house that evening to see that the fas<lb/>tenings were all safe—I saw the shutters of the front window, where I had seen him a little before ten o'clock—the screw was placed in the hole, and to all appearance fastened, until I went to try the fastenings, as I do every night, and I then found it was only placed inside, to deceive me—it was insecure—it was placed so on purpose, because I always found the place left secure except that night—if the shutters had remained in that way it would have been easy to get in at the front, without any noise at all—I made them fast—I then did what I usually do with my cash-box—I went round the back of the house, and it was all safe then—the back window leading into the garden was down and faxtened, and the blind in its proper place—it is a dwarf blind at the bottom of the window—I went all round the back, inside the house, not outside—I took up the basket with me and the cash-box, according to my usual custom, and locked up the other cash-box in an iron safe—I locked my bedroom door as usual, and, as far as I recollect, I left the key crossways in the lock ad it is now—(<hi rend="italic">the lock was Produced</hi>)—a little after six o'clock next morning I was awoke by Cowles, the gardener—I had not been disturbed during the night—as soon as the alarm was given I found my bedroom door half open—the gardener did not come into the room—he came to the door and knocked—I received a light from his lantern, then discovered that my cash-box and key were gone—I then went down stairs—I observed the piece of iron produced sticking through the key-hole of my bedroom door—I ran against it—I went down to the parlour, and found the iron safe half open, and my bunch of keys lying on the ground—it had been opened by those keys—I missed the other cash<lb/>box from the safe—the cash-box in my bedroom contained 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, chiefly silver—the cash-box in my contained one 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and some silsver and gold; making altogether 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed a good deal of property altogether, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—more than half of the money was cash—I missed two gold watches, a gold guard, a gold chain and key, and one silver watch out of the back of the drawer in my bedroom, some glass decanters, and pint rummers, a bottle of gin, and a hat—I found the bottle afterwards, broken, and about a gill of the gin left—the police came, and went round the back part of the house—I found my hat in the water-closet, burnt in the inside, as if a candle had been concealed in it—the name was burnt out—they had had the hat to screen their lantern, to examine the papers with; some dock warrants, and other papers, of no value to any person but myself, were found in the water-closet—I went round the house and fount no marks of violence outside—I went to the coffee-room window at the back of the house, and found it part of the way open—the dwarf blind was moved on one side, and the window open sufficient wide to admit a man, or two men, at a time—a person could get at the front window, the shutter of which was un<lb/>screwed without leaving any marks at all, but behind the house they must get into the garden, and come to the coffee-room window—they had piled some baskets to get up on to reach the bottom cill the window, which is about eight feet from the ground of the garden—there were about six one-dozen wine-baskets piled up to form steps to the window—they could get within one foot of the window from the baskets—there was nothing at all about the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant K</hi> 21.) On the 9th of Jan., about eleven o'clock, I was at the station, and saw Sergeant Wood take off from George Barker a pair of boots—when he had done so I accompanied Wood to Mr. Edmonds garden, and found foot prints of two persons—they were in the left hand corner of the garden, and at the end of the path leading from the house to the fence—there were the footmarks of two persons at D and also at B—there were no footmarks from D towards C—the toes were towards the garden fence, and within the garden, as though of a person coming from the house on to the railway—those were footmarks of two person—they appeared to have got over at C, the place where I saw the double marks—in one other place there were the marks of footsteps both ways, coming and going, and in one place they were only in one direction, going towards the fence—there were the footmarks of two person going from the garden towards the fence, and then footmarks of another person going to and coming from—that was nearly opposite the back door of the house, in the garden, at the railway end of the garden, nearly in the middle—the plan accuarately shows the situation of the footmarks—there were the marks of the prints across some ground which had been dug up, between the garden and the railway—they were of two persons, and they were at D also—I should think there were half a dozen marks there—the foot marks at B were of two persons going, and the impressions of the one coming, apparently from the railway, of two going in a direction from the house, and also the footmarks of one person having gone towards the house—at D there were the footmarks of more than one person going away, all going towards the fence—I saw George's boots compared with the impressions at the point D—they were compared by making an impression at the side of them, and not by putting the boot into the impression already made—they corresponded exactly with the impression already there, both the right and left—they were nailed boots, and in the centre there were twenty-four nails in three rows, eight in each row—I also made an impression at the point B, where I observed the marks of going and coming, and they also corresponded—there were three large nails in the toe of the right boot—the footmarks of the one person coming corresponded with George's boots, and the footmarks of the one person coming corresponded with sponded with George's boots—there were three large nails in the right boot, which had been put in since the boots had been made—the nails had been worn away, and these had been substituted for them, in the toe of the right boot—I found in the impressions the marks of those three larger nails—there was</p>

               <p>row of small nails on the left, and they corresponded with the impression I found on the ground—I firmly believe these boots made the impressions—I afterwards took James's boots off—they had no nails—I have them here—I compared them with the footprints of the other person, and they corre<lb/>sponded exactly in length and breadth, and in the size of the toe—the im<lb/>pression fails towards the toe—they appeared to have been too long for the person who wore them—I went also to Horrow-lane and made an impression with the boots there—I should say both of the boots had made the impress<lb/>sions which were there—they were on the bank leading from the railway to Harrow-lane, in a direction as though from the garden fence towareds Har<lb/>row-lane, and from there towards the railway fence—it was on the bank of the railway into Harrow-lane—there were the impressions of both—we compared them, and they exactly agreed—they were going from the railway towards Harrow-lane—the ground on the railway line is hard gravel—we could trace the impression of the nailed boots both going and coming, in the vacant space between the railway and the garden, and the other footmarks only from the garden towards the railway.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. Clark, of the Central Criminal Court. It is my duty to make out orders for the costs of the pro<lb/>secution for the County generally, and the City of London—it is also my duty to pay orders for the costs of prosecutions in the City cases—on the 4th of last Jan. the prisoner came to the office—he delivered in his recog<lb/>nizance-paper and applied for his expenses in the case of John Anderson—he had been bound over in recognizancds—here are his recognizances—he said, "Is there anything allowed for my traveling expenses"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "At Cheltenham"—I asked him if he had come from Cheltenham to attend the trial—he said he had—I asked him when—he said, "Last night" (that would be Sunday, the 3rd of Jan.)—I asked him when he had left London for Cheltenham—he said, "On the Thursday previous"—I asked him how it was he had left for so distant a place, knowing that he had to attend so soon afterwards at the trial—he said, "The fact is, that having left the police force, I had forgotten all about having to attend this case"—I asked him how he had come up to London—he said by a second class train—I asked him how much he had paid—he said, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him how that was. That the second class fare was only 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(I had Bradshaw's Railway Guide to refer to)—he said Cheltenham was nine miles from Glou<lb/>cester, and Paddington was some distance from here, and he had paid alto<lb/>gether 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not recollect the exact words of his replay, but I inferred by his answer that it was made up to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—he gave different rea<lb/>sons why the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. should be increased to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I acted upon them—understanding he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and finding the mileage at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a mile would amount to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he had not paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a mile I allowed him but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each way, that was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the day and night of his traveling to town, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the day of his attendance here. Making toge<lb/>ther 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made out an order to that effect, and I paid him the amount, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the order I made out—he put his signature to ie in my pre<lb/>sence—I paid the money—he would have been entitled to half-a-crown as a London witness, he having left the police force—he had been at the office once before, to my recollection—I cannot say that I had known him attend<lb/>ing here as a witness—I remembered his name.</p>

               <p>not in a perfect state now—it requires to be examined by Mr. Clark, and signed by him and sealed up and sent to the Chamberlain, and then it would be paid—I pay in advance for the convenience of the witnesses, instead of giving them an order on the Chamberlain, which would oblige them to go some bank—there is an agreement between the City of London and Mr. Clark that he should pay those orders, and they pay him again—the ordinary course would be that this order would be given to the man, and he would take it to another place and get the money for it—instead of that I make out the order and give it him—I should not have paid him this money with<lb/>out first making out the order—I should have required his signature as a voucher—this order is quite perfect for the payment of the money by me to the witness—I should not pay a sum of money without getting the signature of the witness to the form of the order, which is perfected afterwards—this order is full and perfect as between myself and the witness, as between my<lb/>self and the Chamberlain it has to go through certain other forms, before we get the money—if I were guilty of carelessness I should lose the amount myself—the conversation which I have stated I had with the prisoner is quite accurate—I wrote it down as soon as I discovered the falsehood—I did not give the prisoner the sum of money he mentioned himself, I gave him something more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the payment of this money, I apprehend, where you use ordinary and proper diligence, you would not consider yourself liable to lose the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Clark is the agent of the City of London for this purpose—I think I excrcised all the caution I could on that occa<lb/>sion—I paid him this sum of money on a calculation made by myself, in con<lb/>sequence of his having said he came by the second class train, and in compa<lb/>rison with the usual charges—I thought the sum allowed him sufficient for a person in his situation—if he had not mentioned that he came by the second class train, and the price of the fare, I do not know that I should have allowed him that sum—I should have asked him the question.</p>

A liberal trial given. Apply for the Groom at 29 1/2 New-street, Covent-garden; Scott's Arms Yard, Bedfordbury, where the horse is.") I went to the yard the next day, or the next day but one—I first saw the prisoner Shaw—I asked him about the horse—he knocked at the stable door I found the horse and a mare, and the prisoner Goddard in the stable—Shaw said it was his horse, and directed the groom Goddard to produce it—it was brought out and led up and down the yard—I looked at it, and noticed a bare place on the back—it answered the description, except that it seemed rather shorter—I do not think it was more than 15 hands high—the groom after<lb/>wards said so—Shaw said I might have a week's trial of the horse, if I would leave a deposit of a few pounds with him or the groom—he said the price of the horse was forty guineas—I said nothing about the price—I objected to try the horse then as the weather was frosty—I said I would call when the weather was open—I asked him if he had hunted the horse—he said no, he had only bought it that summer—I went away, and on the following Saturday, the 19th, as the weather was open, I went to the stable—I knocked at the door and saw Goddard—Shaw was not there—I asked Goddard what the owner of the horse was, he said he was a surveyor, and lived at No. 14, Floodyer-street, whitehall—while I was there Shaw came—he repeated his offer, he said I might have the horse on trial if I would leave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him or the groom—(Goddard was present)—he said the price was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (he had altered the price to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I said nothing about the price, I never made any bargain—I said I should like to try the horse, and wished to have it that afternoon—after enquiring what the use of the deposit was—he said as a guarantee that the horse was not returned with broken knees—I said I would take the horse on trial that afternoon, and requested that it might be sent to my chambers in Chancery-lane, at five o'clock—Shaw promised it should be sent, and the groom undertook to bring it—I then, in the presence of Goddard, paid to Shaw 4 sovereigns, which was all the gold I had, as a deposit for the return of the</p>

I further acknowledge to have received this day 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in part thereof") I had never purchased the horse, nor even offered money for it—I held the letter open in my hand to Goddard, and demanded the horse—I said, "Either under the agreement you made this morning, or upon this letter, I am to have the horse"—he said he could not give it me—I said, "You have no excuse for not giving it to me"—he refused to give it to me, and said I might see Mr. Shaw at Floodyer-street—I did not at all intimate to the groom that I agreed to these terms—I went to No. 14, Floodyer-street immediately afterwards—a women opened the door, and said Mr. Shaw had gone to Reading, and would be home on Monday—I went to Floodyer-street again on the Monday—another person opened the door, and said Mr. Shaw had not been home, and they did not know when he would be home—I went to the stable that Monday, and no one was there—I was directed by a person in the yard to a public-house—I went there, and en<lb/>quired for Mr. Shaw's groom, and Goddard appeared—he told me he had heard I had been to Floodyer-street, that he had not seen his master, and did not know what was to be done—I went away—I think I went again on the next day, the 22nd—I could not find either Shaw or Goddard either there or at Floodyer-street—on that day, 22nd, I saw an advertisement in the Times re<lb/>ferring to the same stable—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi> "Two horses for sale. The proprietor having only use for one, will dispose of either; the one a powerful brown muzzled mare, the other a handsome bay gelding, full tail and mane, 14 hands and 1/2 high; hunted the whole of last season; regularly broke to double and single, harness; both young, safe, and temperate. Apply at the stable, No. 1, Scott's arms Yard") I went to the stable on the 24th—I did not see any one at the stable, it was locked—I saw Goddard at the public-house opposite—I asked what was to be done about the horse, whether I was to have it—he said he did not know what master intended to do—he was keeping the horse for me—I said, "Can't you give it me then"—he said "No, I have no orders—I believe he wants a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—I repeated the question, "Is he keeping the horse for me"—he said, "Yes—I do not know what he means to do"—I said, "Then what does this advertisement which is in the Times this morning mean"—read that (reads) "To be sold 2 horses, one a bay gelding, stands 15 hands 2 inches high, very handsome; short black legs; a good saddle horse—and broken in to single and double harness"—my horse was a black legged horse—this was quite the description of it—I said, "What is this advertisement"—he said "It is not the horse, it is the mare"—I said, "The advertisement says a horse"—he said, "That must be a mistake"—on the 30th Dec. I went again and demanded possession of the horse, or the alternative, the return of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he said he could not tell what was to be done—he did not know what master meant to do—he believed master was keeping the horse for me—I said, "I must proceed against your</p>

I am brother-in-law to Mr. Sweet—I received some information about the 22nd of Dec.—I think on the 23rd Mr. Sweet pointed out to me an advertisement which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on the 22nd—I went on the 23rd to Scott's yard and I saw Goddard—I said I came in consequence of this adver<lb/>tisement tisement that had appeared the previous day, that there were two horses to be sold, one a bay gelding, I wanted to look at that—he showed me a bay gelding with a flowing mane and tail, and short legs—I asked him if the horses were his—he said no, they belonged to Mr. Shaw, of Floodyer-street, that he wanted to sell either of them, he did not care which, but that he (Goddard) had power to sell if he chose—I asked what Mr. Shaw was—he said a surveyor—I said did not know exactly whether the horse would suit me, where could I see Mr. Shaw—he said at 14, Floodyer-</p>

               <p>street, but not then, as he was just gone in the City, but Mr. Shaw was in the City every day, and he would give me a call in the City if I chose—he said Mr. Shaw had had this gelding about eighteen months, and he described it as a most excel<lb/>lent house; that it had been used for a Brougham, and had been hunted, and if I had only seen it going by the Horse-guards I should have been charmed with its action—I said I did not want the horse for myself, but for 3 friend, that I should not dream of having the horse without a trial, and I said the advertisement mentioned a trial would be given—he said, "Yes, you may have it a week on trail"—he said, "Will you have it now, will you buy it at once?"—I said, "I don't know that I can buy it now, I had better see Mr. Shaw about it"—I then left the stable, and I immediately afterwards returned and said to him, "Is there anybody else after the horse?"—he said nobody, except he believed his master had a letter from the Isle of Wight, but he did not think anything would come of that—I said, "If there is anybody else about it I shall not think anything more about it"—on the 24th Mr. Shaw called on me—he stated that he came in consequence of my having called about a horse—he gave me this card, "Mr. William Shaw, 14, Floodyer-street"—he said, "That is my town address, my country residence is at Reading"—he said his servant had taken an unwarrantable liberty—(I Should have said that Goddard told me the price of the horse was forty guineas, but he believed pounds would be taken)—Shaw said his servant had taken an unwarrantable liberty in saying pounds, that he had asked 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but would take forty guineas, but as his servant had said pounds of course he must abide by it—I said, "I cannot take it without trial"—he said I might have it on trial when I wished—I said, "I cannot take it now, I am engaged on Saturday, I will bring my friend to look at it on Monday, and I will say whether I will take it on trial or not"—Shaw said, "Well then I will keep the horse for you till Monday, of course you will have not objection to give me a deposit"—I said, "Is that usual?"—he said, "That is my way of doing business"—I said, "I don't know that I shall buy the horse, I don't think I can give you any deposit now"—he said, "You cannot except me to keep the horse for you"—I said, "I don't require you to keep it if you meet with a purchaser"—he told me he would let me know if he met with pur<lb/>chaser between then and Monday, and he said he should be in the way from ten till two o'clock on Monday if I would call—I went to the stable on the Monday between those hours and took two friends with me—Goddard was there—I asked him if Mr. Shaw was there—he said no he was out, but there was a friend of his who would do—I saw the horse that Monday—I had seen it before, but it had not had its cloths✗ off before—on that Monday I saw it without its cloths—it was a short black legged bay gelding, with a flowing mane and tail—it had a piece robbed off its back, where it had been sore apparently, and the hairs were not grown—I do not think there was anything said then about my having it on trial and paying a deposit—on the following Thursday Shaw called on me again—he apologized for not meeting me at the stable—he said he had been there on the previous Saturday, thinking that was the day he was to have met me—he said I might have the horse on trial whenever I liked—I said I could not take it during the frosty weather—he said, "Well if you will give me a deposit I will order the groom to take it where you like when the frost is over"—I said, "What deposit do you require?"—he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., just whatever I thought proper—I did not give him any—the last time I saw him was on the last day of Dec.</p>

MELLER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in the employ of the Society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three years—he was sent there by Mr. Perkins, the engineer, who is employed by the Society, to be at the Hall, and was in the habit of coming daily—his proper way to come was by the kitchen entrance—the workmen employed on the premises have not used the bencher's entrance since Oct.—they had been in the habit of using the bencher's entrance up to the time in question, for going out, but not for coming in—it was not part of his duty to clean the locks—we have a proper lock<lb/>smith—the first person who gave me information about this lock was Mr. Wheatley, the laundress—a person named Hurst was in the still-room—I do not know that he was present when the prisoner took the lock off, or whether he is here—I did not give the prisoner money to buy some tools, for the purpose of attending to the locks—I bought some tools for the furnace—they were not of a description to apply to locks that I know of—they were not bought for locks, and the money was not given for that purpose—the prisoner was not engaged at workint at locks—he said Mr. Perkins took his tool away, and he had money given him to get tools that would be useful to him in his business connected with furnace—I gave him no directions what to buy—I gave him money—I did not see the tools he purchased, till after he was in custody—I cannot say that he had not openly interfered with this lock before—the cook's room is in the south part of the building, looking towards the square—I found the key in its place in the morning—there is more than one door opening into that place—the key I have fits the outside door—that door leads into two more rooms, and then into Mr. Sparke's—there were a carpenter and his labourer employed on the premises at this period—I do not know how many other—I believe one or two—I should not say that any person could have got access to that key if they required it—my part of the house was opened of a morning, when the laundress was there—I was not in the habit of locking my door, the house door I was—it is not connected with Mr. Sparkes's room—it is on the other side of the building—I had no fault to find with the prisoner up to this charge—I had every confidence in him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, and live at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Last Dec. I was in London, and stopped at Hinton's Coffee-house, Red Lion-street—between twelve and one o'clock, on the night of Christmas-day, I was driven by a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> form the City—I was to be driven to Holborn—he said it would be as near to go up Chancery-lane—when we got to the Grapes public-house the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped, and I saw the prisoner—I treated the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> and the prisoner there—they appeared to know each other—I had been drinking, and got three or four shillings of the landlord on a brequet-chain—I spent that in drink—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> left me, and the prisoner said he would see me home—on coming out of the Grapes he pleaded poverty, and said he did not think he could get a place to rest himself, he could not get a place to go to—we walked on to Holborn to the Coach and Horses, and had some ale there—I left a diamond ring with the landlord—we left there somewhere about three o'clock—I let myself into my lodgings at last, and the prisoner went with me—about ten o'clock in the morning I asked the prisoner to raise up the bed and give me my watch—I looked at it—it was a little after ten o'clock—it was a gold watch—it was left then on the chimney-piece, and I dozed off to sleep again—when I awoke the prisoner had left the room, and the watch was gone—I got up, and found all my things strewed about the</p>

               <p>room, my papers especially—the key of my portmanteau was in my pocket the night before, and the portmanteau locked—I found it open, and missed things from it—as soon as I could dress myself I gave a description of the prisoner to the policeman, and saw him at the station on Sunday—I have not the least doubt of his being the person, and never had—he had a better handkerchief round his neck, I thought, a better coat, and a new hat.</p>

On the 31st Jan., about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners and another with them, at my master's, in the tap-room—they called for some been, which they had—I had a waistcoat, trowsers, and shirt lying on the table—I shifted them from there to my bed-place, I slept in the tap-room—there were four half-crowns, eight shillings, a sixpence, and a fourpenny-piece in the waistcoat pocket; 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. alto<lb/>gether—the money rattled as I moved the clothes—there was no one in the room but the prisoners, the other man, and myself—I left the room to clean the bar, leaving them there—they went out, and three marines came in—I followed them into the same room—as soon as I got in I searched my clothes, and missed four half-crowns and four shillings—the three fresh men were in the room—I searched. them, and found a shilling, a sixpence, and a few halfpence on them, but no half-crowns—they were willing to be searched—I let them go—I got a constable, went after the prisoners, and came up with them in High-street, Woolwich—Lee ran away, the other two stood still, and were searched, and taken to the station—Lee was taken about two minutes after he went down an alley, and a policeman went up and met him—he was searched, and three halfpence farthing, and three half-crowns were found on him—I knew one of the half-crowns—there is a cut across the head, and a dot against the eye—there was hald-crown found on Runnett, the man who has got away. And on Southam, a sovereign and a fourpenny-piece—no person went into the tap-room while the prisoners were there—I was cleaning the bar, right opposite the door, and should have seen if anybody had—I know this half-crown which was found on Lee—I have had if better than six weeks.</p>

About eight o'clock on Sunday morning I received information, and went in search of the prisoners—Edwards was with me—we came up to them in High-street—when I was fifty or hundred yards from them, Lee made off and ran up an alley—I apprehended Southam and Runnett—I told Southam the charge was for stealing some half-crowns and four shillings from Edwards—he said he knew nothing about in—I asked what money he had about him—he said a fourpenny-piece—I said, "I should like to see it"—he put his hand in his pocket, and said he had half-a-crown—I took it—I asked Runnett what he had—he said, "a shilling"—I took that, and went five or six paces down the alley, and took Lee—he said he went there to ease himself—I asked what money he ha—he said, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he put his hand in his pocket, and took out 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half-crown, changed the half-crown into his left hand, and clenched it—I took them to the station, and searched their boots—Lee had some rag wrapped</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lee's Defence.</hi> I went to a shoemaker's shop, and bought a pair of boots, and afterwards sold them for three half-crowns. I met Southam; we went into the public-house and had two pots of porter; there were five of us there; afterwards two more men came in, and a man who looks after the steamers went and washed himself there; we left the place, leaving three marines there, and the things on the table; I had been confined ten days, and that was the reason I had got the money, as I could not get out to spend it.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe any injury in the neighbourhood of the hip? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I examined her as minutely as I could, both before and after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I went to satisfy my own mind again from the statement of the Coroner's Jury—that was after I heard of an injury to the hip—it was both before and after Mr. Lee was examined—when appli<lb/>cation was made to me to give a certificate of death I said, "I must first ascertain the real cause of it"—I went to see the body, and saw no appear<lb/>ance of external violence—I saw no place where the skin came off—nothing of the sort appeared—I first went before the Coroner's Inquest, examined the body all over, and I saw no external injury—that was before dissection—after dissection I examined again most minutely, and saw no marks of vio<lb/>lence about the hip and no mark of injury at all—I treated her also for diar<lb/>rhoea—I made no <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I did not look internally—the parts were all replaced when I saw her after dissection—I did not examine the region of the lungs—she was suffering under diarrhoea I first saw her—I am still decidedly of that opinion.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">LEE</hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I received the Coroner's warrant to do so on the 4th of Jan.—I made a partial examination on that day, and also on the 5th—I made a point of examining first to ascertain whether any external marks of violence could be seen—I first examined the skull and found nothing about it to indicate violence, but on the lower jaw, on the right side, I found a considerable patch of ecchymosis, or diffused blood, extravasation of the blood—I could judge whether that was an injury inflicted during life, by ex<lb/>amining the state of the blood vessels—I opened them, and ascertained that it resulted from an injury during life, from particular marks in the blood—that was not an injury that could lead to death—on the right side, between the hip joint and the ribs, part of the skin was abraised—the upper skin, called the epidemis, was removed—it was a piece about two inches square—I examined the internal part of the body at the same place, and found a large band extending to about the depth of six inches, extending from, or rather commencing from the medial line, or centre of the body, to the spine—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010141"/>
               <p>in the form of a band, six inches in width—that was inflammation, and cor<lb/>responding with that portion of the abdominal parts—the intestines were decomposed—part of the band was right underneath the place where the skin was abraised—I judge that the decomposition of the intestines was the consequence of the inflammation, for this reason, because it formed such a perfect contrast to the other vessels, which were so healthy—they were not at all in a state of decomposition—the injury to the intestines that I describe would be quite sufficient to account for her death—the state they were in would explain it—I cannot form any judgment as to how that injury was caused—any external violence, a blew, a fall, or a kick, would be sufficient to cause it—I examined the lungs, they were congested, as might be expected in a person of her years, and from the season of the year, but not to an extent that would cause death—I could not form any judgment as to whether she had been suffering from diarrhoea.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see externally any marks of such a violent blow as would have occasioned the internal injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was ecchymosis on that part certainly, but so many days after death I cannot say whether that was not from decomposition taking place—there was nothing to enable me to say that there was a blow of sufficient violence to occasion what I found in<lb/>ternally—there was no appearance of such a blow, fall, or kick, as would have produced what I found inside, but there is no resistance at this part, and consequently the appearance of an external blow would not be so much seen—I mean although there was no external mark, that did not prove that she might not have had a blow, considering the want of resistance at that part.</p>

               <p>system that was excited—I sent him eight pills of henbane and opium, which is a sedative, to allay the irritation—there were five grains of opium and ten grains of hyoscyamus in the eight pills—he was to take one pill three times a day—I also sent him a slight aperient saline purgative, a fourth of which he was to take three times a day—there were six ounces of it—he would take four ounces and a half a day—it contained a portion of nitre—I sent that medi<lb/>cine between two and three o'clock to the bakehouse where he worked, but he was out at the time—I called to see how he was about half-past four or five o'clock, at the bake-house, and asked how he was getting on—he showed me the pill-box and the empty bottle, and said, 'I have swallowed all your pills, and drunk all your physic"—I laughed at him, and thought he was joking—he showed me the empty pill-box and bottle—so large a does would act as a powerful excitement, and considerably quicken the circulation, and increase the animal vigour—it would act on the brain, I should say, to a very great extent, and produce, in would act in about half an hour after it was taken—the excitement would continue some hours—I should think he would scarcely know what he was about.</p>

On Sunday, the 3rd of Jan., I was on duty near Baker's house—Mr. Baker complained to me of a felony having been committed—I desired her to go to the Tailors' Arms, Gravel-lane—she went in—I followed her, and found fifteen or sixteen persons assembled—the prisoners were there, and john Witty among them—Mr. Baker pointed him out in the hearing of all the men there, as the man who stole the cigars—I told him he must go with me to the station-house, that Mr. Baker accused him of stealing cigars—he said he would not—I told him he had better come quietly—he replied again that he would not—the prisoner Muires immediately said, "I am d—d if he shall"—I told him again, he</p>

               <p>had better come quietly—he said he would not, and the rest of them bustled round me and pushed me away from him—I did not capture him then—they stood before me, and prevented me getting up to him—I went for assistance—met sergeant Payne, and Richards a police-constable, very near the house, returned to the public-house with them, and found Witty and all the men there—we told him we had come to take him, for stealing the cigars—the prisoners all four said, he should not go, and so did Ambrose, a man who was not taken—I got up by Witty and seized him—I had to force my way through these men to do so—just as I got hold of him, some one (I do not know who it was) put a quart-pot into his hand—he then made a blow at at sergeant Payne, forcing his way in with a quart-pot—I caught the blow with my arm, and took the pot from him—a scuffle ensued—Scully imme<lb/>diately said, "Well, he shall go," caught hold of him by the hand, and suc<lb/>ceeded in dragging him to the door—when they got out, they all shut the door against us, pushing Witty out, and keeping us in—I ran out at the side<lb/>door, down Ewer-street, to Union-street, after him—I lost sight of him among the people in Union-street, and he escaped—I cannot say whether any of the constables took hold of Witty besides me—I was struck by Muires in the public-house several time—we had a considerable struggle.</p>

               <p>—I pulled down the fence, and came to his assistance, and Muries was arrested—after I got into No. 8 yard, and left the prisoner alone in No. 9, three bricks were thrown from that yard—they did not strike me or the other officers—we then took Muries into Ewer-street, and as we were going to the station I re<lb/>ceived a blow on the head—the hat I now produce I had on at the time—the blow struck me on the back part of my head—it threw me forwards on my hands, and broke my hat—it just grazed the skin off my head—I had got ten or twenty yards from the house—who threw the brick-bat I did not see—I had left Connell in the yard—he had an opportunity of getting into the street as quick as us, because the door of the passage was open.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Budding, of park-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea. Some few weeks ago the prisoner came to my shop—there were several customers there—after I had served them, she asked me to change two half-quartern loaves which her little sister had bought—I was to give her a brick loaf for the two little loaves which she produced—I gave her the brick loaf, and put the two small loaves on the shelf—I am positive I had served no bread whatever to anybody—no little girl had bought two loaves—the prisoner went away—I saw her again coming out of a shop opposite, with the quartern brick under her arm—I called her across to my shop, and said, "You have not paid me for that quartern brick"—she said, "Have I not? give me change for a half-a-sovereign." which she produced—I gave her two half-crowns, four shillings. and some pence, deducting for the loaf—she said, "What is your bread?"—I said, "7 1/2 d"—she said, "I cannot pay but 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, your bread?"—I said, "7 1/2 d"—she said, "I cannot pay but 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Very well, give me my change"—she gave me four shillings and one half-crown—I said, "That is not at all"—she shuffled among some plates, and said, "Oh, dear, here it is!" and then gave me the other half-crown.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she come back to your shop from the opposite shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called her back—she had been cheated out of the bread, because I knew I had not sold any, and she had stolen those two small loaves off my counter—I found they had been removed, and I had exchanged them for a brick, under the idea that she was telling the truth—she gave me back her full change—I gave her back the half-sovereign, and she went away—I missed the small loaves off the shelf directly—they were two crusty half-quartern bricks—I then recollected that she could not have bought them—she said her little sister had just bought them at my shop.</p>
