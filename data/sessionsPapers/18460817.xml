I am registrar of births, deaths, and marriages for the district of St. Luke—I live in the City-road—I have my register here—on the 12th of May last I saw the prisoner'—he said he came to register the birth of a child—I asked him to take a seat, and went to my desk and took out the book—I had not heard of the birth before he came—it is part of my duty to make inquiries and exert myself to get all the information I can—there appeared something strange in the prisoner's manner which made me suspect all was not correct, and I asked if he was the father of the child—he said he was—there was on the mantel-shelf a caution-paper, and also one lying on the table—on my asking if he was the father of the child, he said he wondered why I asked him that question, or why did I doubt him—I said, "I don't doubt for a minute, but as registrar I am bound to ask you the question I have done, "at the same time handing him a caution-paper—I had not pointed hit attention to the paper—it was before him on the table—I said, "Perhaps you will just have the kindness to read this, to show that I have no desire to ask unnecessary questions"—this is a copy of what it required by the act—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I called his particular attention to the part at the top of the paper, which he read hastily and threw it down—it is to this effect, that no putative father is to be allowed to sign as father, and nothing is to be inserted as to '-. legitimacy or illegitimacy—I have not got a copy of the Act of Parliament—these papers are supplied from the registrar-general's office—they are directions to me—this is the entry, No. 33—the prisoner used the words, you need not doubt my veracity, for my wife is the daughter of Mr. Wallen, the respectable architect of Finsbury-circus"—it might be, "late of Finsbury-circus"—I replied, "I simply asked you whether you were the father"—knowing that sometimes an uncle will come, conceiving that he has power to register the birth—I then made the entry in the register as it runs here—I asked him, "When born?"—he replied, "5th May, 1846, at 15, King-street"—I said, "The sex?"—he said, "A boy"—I said, "The name of the child?"—he gave the name, "James"—I said, "The name and surname of father?</p>

I live at No. 3, New-street, Bishopsgate—Michael Gompertz is my father-in-law—I engaged the prisoner on Tuesday afternoon as servant—on Wednesday she was wash<lb/>ing the whole of the day, and on Thursday evening the robbery occurred—Sarah Cohen had brought the box to my house on Wednesday night, at twelve o'clock, and put it on to the first floor, by the window—I saw it safe at one next day—the prisoner was up stairs during that afternoon, cleaning—about half-past seven I called her, but she was absent from the house—she returned at eight—I asked where she had been—she replied, "At the washerwoman's, taking in the clothes."</p>

               <p>"Dear Ann,—you have no doubt suffered much uneasiness and distress of mind at my sudden disappearance from town, the cause (a singular one) I will endeavour to explain; but the real fact is, J am so confused and wretched that I am not able to give you the particulars, and I fear much that what I am going to relate will only be considered a fabrication by all parties, with the exception of yourself; what I tell you is true. Mr. Ruff handed me two checks to get cash for, in order to discharge some bills. I went to the banks (two) and got cash for the checks, and unfortunately I put 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the bills I had to pay, and some letters, in some brown paper; the other money I had in my trowsers pocket; the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and letters in my coat pocket. It is not far from the banks to White and Greenwell's, the first parties I intended to pay. Oh, Ann what was my consternation and surprise, when I got to White's, my parcel was gone—yes, gone, and for ever I did not go into White's. I retraced my steps to the banks; that was useless, there were thousands walking to and fro. I certainly did look into one auction-room for about half a minute, on the road to White's, but I cannot swear that I lost the money there; How it went it is impossible for me to say. Expecting im<lb/>mediate dismissal or a prison, I wandered about in a state of distraction that I cannot well describe. I knew not, nor did I care whither I went. I really thought that I should have gone mad. If the scoundrel who robbed me had felt what I felt, he would, I think, have altered his course of life. I cannot enter into the detail of my journey here, it would exceed my limits; to be brief, I made the best of my way for Cambridge; the Miss Jones's were at Yarmouth. I stated my case; they have been kind, very kind. One gen<lb/>tleman, when he heard of my misfortune, gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but would not give me his name or address. I am in rather better spirits. I hope I shall be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184608170021"/>
               <p>able to make up all the money to my kind employers. I send you 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Ruff; take it to him; tell him, Ann, my case; he may, perhaps, allow me time to get up the money; I will beg, borrow, I will do any thing but steal, to make it up; sell or pawn my things for your immediate wants. I leave Yarmouth this day. I shall endeavour to reach Darlington, and try my friends there. Ann, keep up your heart, my dear, all may be well yet; we have had many severe trials through this uncertain life, but this is the most awful blow I ever experienced; may it be the last. Poor Ann, my eyes are now swimming with tears, I cannot write more; if I succeed in Durham I will write.—yours, ever truly, G. <hi rend="smallCaps">WRIGHT</hi>. I can say nothing about my children. The letter for Mr. Ruff you may take with the inclosed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the letter contains 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or at least an order for that amount."</p>

On Thursday night, the 9th of July, I went to bed about ten o'clock—I examined the house—it was all safe and fastened—I had a gold watch, which I took up to my own bed-room when I went to bed—there were two salt-spoons in the sideboard drawer—when I awoke at three o'clock in the morning the watch was then safe—I had it in my hand, and looked at the time, and put it back upon the bedstead—I went to sleep again—I awoke again about seven o'clock and missed the watch—I went down stairs, and the staircase window was open—it was shut when I went to bed—it looks on to the leads at the back of the house—I found the kitchen door open, which was that and locked the night before—I missed the spoons and the tops of the pepper-castors from a sideboard in the parlour—they were safe the night before—a person getting on to the leads could get through the staircase win<lb/>dow into the house—a reward of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered, and a bill placed in the window—the watch was worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bridgewater-gardens. On the morning of the 15th of July I came out of the Coach and Horses with two friends—the pri<lb/>soner and another man were outside—we stood there talking for several minutes—the prisoner and the other began insulting us, by making a noise with their mouths, and turning to ridicule everything we had said—I turned round, and asked if their insults were meant for us—they said, "Just what you like"—I said, "What do you mean?"—they said, "Just what you please"—I remonstrated with them, and said I was old enough to be their father—they said, "Here we are, two young ones"—I said, "Is it fighting you mean?"—I put myself in an attitude of defence, and in about two minutes afterwards I received a wound in my hand from the prisoner, from a sharp instrument—it bled dreadfully—I caught hold of him—a policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—I have a doctor's certificate from Gray's Inn-lane Hospital—my fingers were both dreadfully cut</p>

I heard the prosecutor ask the prisoner what they made the noise about—they said, "Nothing particular"—they were making noises after some females—the prosecutor said, two young men like them ought to know better than to interrupt people in the street, especially females—the prisoner said, "I was not aware you had any female in your company"—Hare said, "Is that intended for us?"—the prisoner said, "Just as you please, if it suits you take it to yourselves"—he then asked him several questions, and then asked if he meant fighting—they said, "Just as you please"—Haie said, "I will take no advantage of you, as I am old enough to be the father of either of you"—I said, "you had better come about your business,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Holywell-lane, Shore<lb/>ditch—the prisoner is my wife—we were married on the 9th of Oct.—she has two children. On Friday afternoon we were at tea—I poured my tea out myself into a mug—she was in the room—there was nothing in the mug before 1 put the tea in—I put sugar in, but no milk—my master's boy then came, which caused me to leave the table—I went about a yard from it to the door—I did not leave the room—when I went I could not see what was on the table—I left my mug on the table—I was at the door about three minutes—? I returned to the table, and observed that my wife had put all the milk into my tea—I had poured some tea into a tea-cup for my wife, and into a little tin pot for my child—there was some milk in a tea-cup when I left the table, and when I came back all the milk had been poured into my mug—I asked her what she had put all the milk into my tea for—she said, "Did not you. want it all in your tea?"—I told her I did not, I never had anything without she had part of it—I poured the tea into the saucer—the saucer was full—I drank almost all of it—I felt it burn me in the throat—it was a very strong acid—I asked her what she had put into my tea—she said, "Nothing"—I said if she did not tell me I would go to the doctor and ask him what she had put into it—I took the mug with the rest of the tea in it—I went to the door, then returned to the table, and asked her to let me feel in her pocket—she refused—I put the mug of tea on the tray—I proceeded to search her pocket, and after once or twice she let me feel in her pocket—I pulled out some white powder on my fingers—I showed her my hand with the powder on it, and asked her what it was—she said it was oxalic acid, as well as she could repeat the words—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Bowen, a surgeon, in the Curtain-road. About four o'clock, on Friday afternoon, the 24th of July, the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a pennyworth of oxalic acid—I wrapped up half an ounce in white paper, and labelled it, "Oxalic acid—poison"—there was quite sufficient to destroy life—I gave it her, and she went away—in about half an hour her husband came—he brought a woman's pocket in his hand—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184608170039"/>
               <p>put my hand into it, and found some small chrystals, which I examined, and found to be oxalic acid—after that Joseph Barker came, with a mug, three parts full of tea—I kept it as he brought it, till I and Mr. Bowen analyzed it—we detected the presence of oxalic acid—I am quite sure of that—I tasted it—I gave the prosecutor some chalk—he began to spit very much after it, and the saliva was rather frothy, which would be the result of having taken oxalic acid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How much did you find in the pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter of an ounce—I weighed her half an ounce—there might have been more than half of it left—I did not see the tea-pot—I did not examine any other vessel with tea in it, but that brought to me—I cannot from that judge what quantity the prosecutor had taken, but it must have been a very small quail<lb/>tity—about a quarter of an ounce would produce sickness if it remained in the stomach—he must have taken much less than that—if a person took two mugs of it it would produce sickness, and killed him, if it remained in the stomach—the small quantity he took would not have killed him—if he had taken the whole it would decidedly have destroyed him—I did not say anything to the prisoner when she bought it—it is used to clean brass and other things, by almost every housekeeper—it is commonly used for domestic purposes—I bad not known her before—I remarked her features particularly—I did not see her again till the next day at Worship-street—I recognized her immediately—I have no doubt of her—I cannot say whether that is the only oxalic acid I sold that day—I never noticed the prosecutor in my shop except when he brought the pocket—I did not recollect his features—I had sold a goodish quantity of oxalic acid that week to women and men, and children too—my shop has pretty much traffic—I might have sold the husband some oxalic acid without recollecting it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Joseph-street. About three weeks ago Thomas Alexander Bartlett was playing at a game called "Pussey-cat"—that is done with a bit of wood, and a stick, with two points to it, and you hit it as it is up in the air—I and his eldest brother were playing at peg-top—I saw the wood go up against the prisoner's hoop-sticks—the prisoner came out of his door, and hit Bartlett on the head with his open hand—the boy ran away, and the prisoner ran after him, and hit him with his double fist under his right jaw, and knocked the left side of his head up against the brick wall, and then left him—the boy tumbled down, got up again, and went in doors—I and his brother went in with him to his father's house—his brother had picked him up and we helped him home—he went to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ropemaker, and live at 15, Joseph-street. Thomas Alexander Bartiett, my son, was eight years old last Jan.—on the 20th of June, I came home, and saw him—he had a cold, but was not very ill—I went away about half-past four o'clock—I gave him some cooling medicine the next day, Sunday, the 21st—Mr. Clealand attended him a fortnight afterwards, and after<lb/>wards a person named Hawkins—he remained in the house from the 20th of June up to the time of his death—he was not kept to his room—he went about the house—he was treated as a person with a violent cold—on the 21st of June I went out, and saw a man named Brown, who told me something—the prisoner was in the street, but did not hear it—I saw the prisoner im<lb/>mediately after—I told him I understood he had misused one of my chil<lb/>dren last evening, and begged him not to do it again; if he had any com<lb/>plaint <hi rend="italic">to make</hi>, to make it to me, and I would correct him—he said he should do no such thing; he had done it, and would do it again—Mr. Haw<lb/>kins attended my son till his death, which was on the 11th of July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 36, Collet-place, Commercial-road. On Thursday, the 9th of July, I was called to attend Thomas Alexander Bartiett—I found him labouring under excessive fever—he was in a <hi rend="italic">comatose</hi> state, insensible—he could not put out his tongue when asked—he died on Saturday morning—his symptoms were those of pressure on the brain—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, with the assistance of Mr. Hayes—there were no external marks or bruises on the head—there were some marks which we could not say were bruises—on removing the scull-cap, there were two patches of effused blood; one, nearly the size of half-a-crown; it was extravasated blood, between the membranes and the brain; the second, was about the size of a sixpence; the vessels were generally congested, and we con<lb/>cluded that these effects could only be attributed to violence—their position did not enable me to judge where the violence might have been inflicted—any blow on the head might produce a rupture of the vessel—there had been time for any considerable signs of violence to have gone—we generally observe these symptoms to come on about a fortnight or three weeks after an injury—if a blow inflicted produced a bruise, that bruise would cause extra<lb/>vasation—there was time between the 20th, and the time I saw him, for the whole of the extravasation to be absorbed, and the bruise gone—we examined the stomach—the organs and the abdominal cavities were generally healthy—there was nothing at all in those regions to account for death—I attribute the death to the rupture of the vessel, and effusion of blood on the brain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>over the whole of the membranes of the brain—I should attribute that to the fever—there was very considerable fever, which is always the case in an injury of the brain—the vessels are so minute that the size of the ap<lb/>perture <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the rupture cannot be detected—it was <hi rend="italic">on the pia mater</hi>—we could not detect it in other places—I cannot say from what particular orifice the blood came—the vessels are so transparent that it is very difficult—the turgidity of the vessels extended over the whole of the membranes—they showed general vascularity—it is not common with infants in a state of fever to rupture a vessel of the brain—from fifty to seventy is a more likely age—I never knew it arise from fever in a child eight years old—it is possible—the two patches were both on the left side of the head, about the temple—a; violent blow under the ear, or any part of the head, might produce this injury:—a violent blow would rupture a vessel on the opposite side—falling with his, head against a wall might produce it—the only doubt I had was whether he might have fallen on the head—he could have got up and walked home after; such injuries—inflammation of the brain frequently does not come on for two or three weeks—my attention was called to it by sleepiness and fever.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on the afternoon of the day after he was brought in, but he was not immediately under my care until the 1st of July—Dr. Spiller attended him until then—lie was the house-surgeon till then—I had seen him from time to time from his first coming in, but on the 1st of July I ex<lb/>amined him—he was suffering from an abscess in the neighbourhood of the bladder—an incision had been made the previous day, on the left side of the abdomen, and the abscess opened, there was a very foul purulent discharge, mixed with urine, and very large sloughs—the supuration increased a great deal, and he died at half-past eleven o'clock on the morning of the 9th of July—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 10th—I found two ruptures of the bladder at the anterior part, one about the rim of the pubes—that rup<lb/>ture was the cause of the inflammation which led to the abscess, and finally caused death—that rupture was caused by some violent blow, either direct or indirect, on the region of the bladder itself—there was no indication whatever of violence on the body—the internal organs were for the most part healthy—there were some old marks of the lungs being affected—there was nothing to cause death but the rupture of the bladder—I have not a doubt that was the cause of death,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker—I live in Upper East Smith<lb/>field—on Friday evening, the 31st of July, between eight and nine o'clock, a person, a gentleman in appearance, came into my shop and said he was recom<lb/>mended to me for a gold patent lever watch—my daughter Susannah was in the shop and a lady named Miss Harding, of Burr-street—when the person came in who enquired for the lever watch, he came to the glass-case and sat down in a chair which was further from the door than the lady was—I pro<lb/>duced him three watches with which he was not satisfied, and I showed him another—four patent lever watches I placed on the glass-case—in about ten minutes that gentleman was followed in by another person, who was, no doubt, the prisoner at the bar, but my attention was drawn off, attending to the lady with her ear<lb/>rings—I believe the prisoner is the person—he squeezed by the lady and got to the person who was looking at the watches—he said, 'Mr. Harris, what do you charge for cleaning a patent lever watch V—he had then squeezed in between the lady and the gentleman, which my daughter will be able to explain—I told him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price—the prisoner then went imme<lb/>diately out of the shop—I should think in about two minutes—he did not pro<lb/>duce any lever watch to be cleaned—when he came into the shop the four lever watches which I hadshown to the first man were safe, and two gold guard<lb/>chains</p>

               <p>were on the glass-case—the prisoner went out of the shop, and I should think in about a minute the other man went—before he went away he said, "I will call again to-morrow, Mr. Harris, and take one"—he went away, and my daughter hallooed out, "Father, there is a gold watch gone, and a gold guard"—I looked at the watches—there were only three on the glass-case then—one was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the prosecutor. I was in his shop on the occasion of this watch being lost—I saw the first person come in—he asked for patent lever gold watches—Miss Harding was not in the shop at the time—she came into the shop while the first person was there—our shop has a single window—it is a long shop—there is a long counter—it extends the whole depth of the shop—there is a glass case on the counter, which does not extend the whole way—it is at the farther end of the shop the other man went to the upper end of the shop, near the glass case, and there he wasshown the watches, on the case—Miss Harding was next to the man that was looking at the watches—she was standing, the man was sitting—Miss Harding is not an acquaintance of our family, she was a stranger to us—while the man was looking at the watches, the prisoner came, in—I am confident he is the man, I took such particular notice of him—Miss Harding was in the middle—the counter is on the right-hand side of the shop—the prisoner came to the right-hand side of Miss Harding—he said, "Mr. Harris, what do you charge for cleaning a three-quarter plate lever watch?"and he shuffled himself between Miss Harding and the man—it was not necessary, to have that question answered, that the prisoner should pass by Miss Hard<lb/>ing, and get between her and the man who was looking at the watches—there was two yards vacant at the counter before he got there.</p>

Lamb was in my ser<lb/>vice, and Jeremiah Roscow occasionally dealt with roe—he never bought any beds of me—on a morning, I believe, about the end of March, I had occasion to go into my back warehouse—I found Jeremiah Roscow there, packing up a bale—I suppose it was cotton—I did not see the contents—it was not before the shop was open, but before we generally commence business—I asked what he was doing—he replied, "I am buying cotton; here is Mr. Lamb;"and Lamb made answer that he was, and from hearing that I went away—previous to the 8th of June I received information—I then took stock, and missed feather-beds and ticks—I cannot say to what amount, but it was some 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I likewise missed a writing-desk—I sell writing-desks—on the 13th of June I went with the policeman to Mary Roscow's house—we found there a writing-desk and three feather-beds—neither of the prisoners were there—I went the next day to Jeremiah Roscow's house—I found a feather-bed there—he was in custody at the time—I believe the beds are mine, though there is no identifying of them—the desk I am able to identify.</p>

I passed me at the corner of Queen-street, going down towards the Poultry, on I the same side the Mansion-house is—I saw the two prisoners following close I behind his heels, and watched them—the prosecutor went down the Poultry—I he stopped and looked at a shop-window, the prisoners stopped also—the. I shop was 100 yards from the corner of Queen-street—I cannot say what I shop it was—the prosecutor stopped about a minute—he then went on, and stopped at the corner of Arthur-street, London-bridge—the prisoners then separated, and stood about five or six yards apart—the prosecutor then crossed over the road towards Gracechurch-street, and came back on the other side of the way—the prisoners followed just after—I saw the prosecutor stop at a stationer's shop two doors from Fenchurch-street, on the right hand side in going from London-bridge—I saw Shrimpton close up close behind the prosecutor, as close as he could stand, and Williams stood close behind Sbrimpton, a little on the right, but as close as he could stand—that is I what is called covering—I saw Shrimpton's hand pass towards Williams, and I saw Williams take something from Shrimpton and put it into the left breast of his coat, between his coat and waistcoat—I was standing first at a shop door opposite—I then went into the shop, and directly I got in I saw what was done—I ran over directly, and both the prisoners walked away together towards Fenchurch-street—Williams was branching off towards the left at the corner of Fenchurch-street, and Shrimpton was going straight on—I took bold of Williams, and Shrimpton turned round to look at him—I dragged Williams towards Shrimpton, and took them both back and put them into the stationer's shop—the prosecutor was still looking in at the window—I told him he had been robbed, and he came into the shop—he said he had lost a pocket-book—I put my hand under Williams's left breast and produced this pocket-book—the prosecutor said it was his—when I took Shrimpton he said He was a respectable man, and told me his name and address—when I got him to the station the inspector asked what he did in the City—he said he was going to Woolwich to receive some money of a Mr. Saunders—the inspec<lb/>tor asked where Mr. Saunders lived—he said he did not know—that he did not know what he was saying—on the Monday he was taken before the Magis<lb/>trate and remanded—he then told me he knew no Mr. Saunders, and was not going to receive any money, but was only going for a trip down the river—I had told him that I was going to Woolwich to make inquiries, and then he told me that—when I first saw the prisoners it was about seven or eight minutes past</p>

               <p>three o'clock—the clock struck three as I was going across St. Paul's Churchyard—I followed them for about ten minutes—I was on the same side of the way when they first passed me, and I crossed—I saw they were looking at the prosecutor's pockets—I did not know either of them before—they looked round, and I looked in a pastry-cook's shop—I did not hear them speak, but they were together a good deal—sometimes they separated, and then they joined again—I noticed their dress—I particularly noticed Shrimpton, because he had a lightish Tweed coat on—when we got to the police-station in Garlick-hill, Bow-lane, the charge was booked at half-past three—I should say the pocket-book was taken about twenty minutes past three as near as I can guess—after we had been before the Magistrates and the prisoners were committed, I received a communication from Henry Wild—I searched Shrimpton, and ten sovereigns and some silver was found on him—I ascertained from him where he lived, and I went there—I think it was No. 35, in the Curtain-road—there is a wheelwright's shop there of his and his brothers—I found there these forty-three keys—three duplicates, one for a watch pawned for Si. 10., one for a piece of linen for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two bed<lb/>gowns for 1.—I found two pocket-books and a savings-bank book—some of these keys are small and some large—some of them are tied up in a bunch.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 2nd of June, I was sent for to a house in Labour-in<lb/>vain-street—I found the deceased lying on the floor, with her head on the mat, which has been produced, and her legs slightly inclined towards the foot of the stairs—the body was not lying so direct across the passage as it is represented in this plan—the head and left shoulder touched the skirting-board, and the feet were slightly inclined towards the stairs—she was some distance from the foot of the stairs—this other sketch is more like the posi<lb/>tion—her feet were about a foot from the stairs, taking a direct line across the passage from the stairs—I had her taken up stairs, (before that I had observed marks of violence)—I examined her person, and found on the head, cheek, and nose six marks—they put on the appearance of a dried state of the skin—it resembled very much like when a blister bad been applied to a child just previous to death—it was a very slight scratch on the nose—n the back of the head, rather at the right side, was a wound of a somewhat triangular shape, of a jagged and lacerated appearance—the bone was bare—it was through the scalp to the bone—the scalp was about a quarter of an inch thick—the wound took an upward direction—that wound itself was not the cause of death, but the skull was fractured at the part where the wound was—I have no doubt the rupture of the vessel of the brain was the cause of death—it is called the longitudinal sinus—there was nothing about her person to account for death, except that wound—I examined the staircase and the parts where she was lying, but saw nothing to account for that wound, supposing she had fallen down stairs—there was no hard substance on the mat on which she might have fallen to wound herself—there were no bannisters to the stairs—there were no projections against which the head could have gone while she was tumbling down stairs, except the stairs themselves—they were wooden stairs—there was no carpet on them—I examined them mi<lb/>nutely—if the wound had been caused by the head going against the stairs, I shpuld expect to find marks of blood on the stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184608170076"/>
               <p>opinion—I have seen the piece of iron—the wound might have been inflicted by that—the same wound could have been inflicted by the toe of a heavy boot—the toe of this boot, shown me by Sergeant Thurgood, might have produced the wound—in addition to the blood I have described, there were two or thee distinct jets of blood on the sleeve of his jacket—Dr. Leathby made experi<lb/>ments upon them—some of them were scraped off by him—I did not observe any artery ruptured—I did not examine the artery—it was a vein—I did not trace any artery—I am aware of the difference between the rupture of an artery and that of a vein—from an artery the blood would spirt out—I did not not observe the rupture of any single artery in the body on examining it—arterial is of a different colour to venous blood, but venous blood becomes heightened in colour when exposed to the air—when arterial blood spirts from an artery it takes a course—none would descend in drops, all would go up in a stream—the blood from an artery puts on an elliptical appearance and co<lb/>agulates at the bottom—that is exactly the same as a drop which descends sideways—I am not prepared to say that there is anything particular in the mark one drop would make from another, only the blood from an artery comes in a distinct splash, and the other in a continual stream—I saw the jets of blood on the jacket in Dr. Leathby's presence—I am not prepared to swear whether it is arterial blood or venous—I first saw this instrument in the morning—I did not fit it to the wound—it might produce the wound—any instrument or contusion might have done the same—I went to apply the toe of the boot to the wound, but decomposition had advanced so that it was impossible to have said if the wound was inflicted by that—it might have caused the wound—the sides of the triangular wound were nearly equal, two inches on each side—most contused lacerated wounds of the head put on a triangular shape—a wound from a stick might produce a triangular shape—there is nothing particular in that shape—a wound inflicted by the edge of the stairs, or any blunt instrument, might have been triangular—whether the body comes to the instrument, or the instrument to the body, it would pro<lb/>duce the same appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you first saw the woman, had she a cap on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I saw a cap up stairs—I saw nothing particular about it—the woman had not a great quantity of hair behind—it was down—it was not long hair—she was a middling-sized woman—I do not think she was so tall as five foot eight—supposing she had fallen down stairs violently from top to bottom, I found nothing to account for it, except the laceration of which I have spoken—I found no other wound—a person descending in that way, and tumbling against a projecting surface, would account for the wound I saw—the edge of the stair is a rounded substance—whether she fell backwards or forwards, it would account for that wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College Hospital. On the evening of the 17th of June the prosecutrix was brought there—I examined her throat—it had been stitched up, but I found it necessary to re-dress it—there was an incised wound in the right side of the throat, about four or five inches long, dividing the external jugular vein on the same side—it was about three quarters of an inch long, and an inch deep—it was a very dangerous wound indeed—I did not expect her to live at one time—an ordinary knife might have caused the wound—from its position, it is not at all likely she could have inflicted it herself—it must have been inflicted by another party, I think—it was not quite horizontal, it was diagonal.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>doubted whether the right hand could have inflicted it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when a wound is inflicted by another hand I can tell whether the person uses his right band, by the position and direction of the wound—it would depend on the position of the persons; but it is my opinion that the man must have stood behind the woman, and drew his hand across the throat—it could not have been made by a marl standing in front of her—I particularly examined where the first incision was made—there is what we call a tail, in professional lan<lb/>guage—a wound is made in the skin before it gets to the deep parts, and that was particularly evident, showing that the incision must have begun, and got deeper as it went on—the tail of a wound is at both ends—we cannot tell at which end it began.</p>

On the 17th of June, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the pri<lb/>soner and his wife return home, and go into the house—in about five minutes afterwards I heard Mrs. Hannan halloo out, "Oh, oh!"—I was on the step of the door—I went to her door, and saw her just at the top of the stairs, close to the street door, bleeding from the neck—she had a white apron on—I said to her, "Peggy, what is the matter?"—she said, "The villain,"or "My husband, has stabbed me"—I cannot say whether it was one or the other—I called to Mrs. Paine, who lives in the house, for some water, and the policeman took Mrs. Hannan to Dr. Walker's—I did not go away—after she was gone, I saw the prisoner standing outside his own door—I did not see him come out—he must have come up the kitchen stairs without my noticing him, or he might have come from up stairs—he did not inhabit any part of the up-stairs, only the kitchen—they were both very tipsy—I saw Mrs. Collins there—she said to the prisoner, "you foolish man, go away"—his answer was, "No, I won't, I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I don't disown it"—he was taken in charge very soon after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of General Thomas Grosvenor, of No. 42, Lower Grosvenor-street, in the parish of St. George Hanover-square. The prisoner Jones was in our employ for about two months pre<lb/>vious to the 10th of July—on that evening I was at the theatre with my son—I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—I told the pri<lb/>soner he might go to bed also—he appeared at that time to be perfectly sober—the key of the house is usually hung up in the entrance-hall—next morning I went to the General's dressing-room—there was a box there which had been corded and locked—I found the cord was taken from it, and the box was rifled of all its contents—I missed certain articles from the box, which were produced before the Magistrate—my attention was called to the General's writing-box—it was locked at the time, but I saw it opened—I do Rot know, of my own knowledge, whether there had been any money in it.</p>

On the 10th of July I saw Jones in the General's dressing-room, about eleven o'clock—he asked me in a very careless sort of manner, what the General's blue box was—I told him it was the General's money-box—on Saturday morning, the 11th of July, I recollect going into the General's dressing-room—there had been a fire lighted by somebody on the preceding night, and there was a vast quan<lb/>tity of burnt paper—the only piece left unburnt was this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) which is part of a letter—it was then about a quarter past seven o'clock—I went to call Jones about eight, and he did not make any answer—after the discovery of the robbery, I went to clean the grate in the dressing-room, and this piece of cord came down the chimney with my sweeping about-'—I had dusted the box myself on the Friday, and this cord was round the box—this is the key of the street door—on the Friday following I found some keys behind a lot of old books in the General's dressing-room.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of July, Jones came there about ten minutes before seven o'clock—he came in alone, and was followed by a labouring man, the prisoner Stokes, and another woman—Jones ordered some whiskey when he came in—I did not serve him with that, but recommended him to take soda-water, and some was provided for him—the persons with him had some ale, which Jones paid for—the amount of the whole was ls.—he tendered a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay for it—he was a little intoxicated at the time—I sent the servant out to get change for the note, and I returned the full change to Jones—the two females had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he had four sovereigns and a half, and three half-crowns—he then had some more soda-water in the parlour—the labouring man went into the parlour with him—I ordered him out of the parlour, and he went into the tap-room—the two females were at the bar—Jones paid for the soda-water he had in the parlour, and some ale—he pulled out of his pocket three bracelets, a gold seal, and several other things, and</p>

               <p>and asked me for a bit of paper to wrap them in—Jones then went into the yard—Stokes waited a minute or two, and he did not return—she then asked me for a pennyworth of gin, which she paid for out of the 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she then took the things and the 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went to the door—I called her back, and said, "you had better take this key,"which was lying there—she took that with the rest of the things, and went off—Jones then came from the yard—I said, "your wife is gone"—he said, "Is she?"and then he told me she was not his wife—he sat down, and said, "I am a ruined man,"and began to. cry—he then took this gold chain off his neck, and threw it over the counter into the glass-tub—he had been drinking—he was not very drunk—I cannot tell How he walked.</p>

The prisoner was in the same establishment as cook, and had been there a considerable time—I knew the deceased Susan Tolleday—she acted as kitchen-maid—on Saturday, the 15th of Aug., about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I was cleaning the windows at the front entrance of the hotel, which commands a view of the edge of the staircase—the kitchen is on the same floor as the staircase—I saw Susan Tolledav leaning against the bannister in the passage, holdng her hands up, with a knife in her right hand—I saw that her throat was cut, and blood rushing from it very furiously—I went to her assistance—she fell before I could get to her, before I took hold of her—I might have got to her before she fell, but I was confused at the time, and did not know what I did—she fell before I took hold of her—I then went into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner there—there was nobody else in the kitchen—he was in the act of pulling down his coat—he came im<lb/>mediately towards me—I said, "Dear me! what have you been at here?"—he said, I have done it; I wish you to give me in charge"—this was in the kitchen—he afterwards came out of the kitchen, near to where the deceased was lying—he said, "Don't take me this way"—he wished to go out at the back door—when the policeman came, I heard him say to him that he had done it, and wished to give himself up—the deceased remained where she was lying until the doctor came—I believe I have stated all that the prisoner said.</p>

On the 10th of July, about eleven o'clock, my father sent me to Old Ford with a jar of pickles in a bag, to a customer—I went over Twig Folly-bridge, and on the bridge saw all the prisoners, and about twenty boys altogether—I was to meet my father on the bridge—I stopped on the bridge, and put the jar on the ground—I heard one of them, I believe it was Moffatt, say he had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> a man out of his handkerchief, and if they worked pretty hard to-day they should earn 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day—Jones said, "Yes, if we work pretty hard at <hi rend="italic">smugging</hi>"—I crossed the bridge with the jar, and got right on the other side—five of them instantly followed me—the prisoners were among them, and another one, who is not taken—Moffatt laid hold of my shoulders, Jones held my arms behind me—Moffatt pretended to speak to me—he said, "Halloo, Frederick,"and put his hands into my right-hand jacket-pocket, and then into my waistcoat-pocket—I knew him well by sight before—Meagan took my jar and bag from me—it was not in my hand—I had put it on the ground before they came up to me—he had got three or four yards away with it and then stood still—he held it in his hand—Robinson came near me, held his fist up to me, and was going to spit in my face—Moffatt said, "Don't do that, let us do what we are about first,"and then Fossey, the one who is not taken, came up to me, and asked Moffatt whether he had got anything out of my pocket—he said, "Not at present"(I did not know Fossey by name before, but have heard the po<lb/>lice mention his name since) the other boy then came and stood by the side of me—Robinson laid hold of my arm, and said he was going to look at my hand to see if I had anything in it, and the others stood on the other side of the bridge and saw it done—they did not do anything to my pocket—Moffatt put his hand into my pocket, and asked me if I bad a few coppers to spare—I said I had nothing for him in my pocket—some labourers came by, the prison<lb/>ers then began to run, and Meagan dropped the jar—I called out for help just as I saw the men—in about a quarter of an hour my father came up—he went with me down Cut-throat-lane—the prisoners had gone down there—we found</p>

I was at Worship-street, and heard the prosecutor say to his son, "you stick to what I have told you, or it won't be of any use"—I said, "Is that a father's advice, to direct a boy to swear against a poor lad who is innocent?"—my son stopped at home from the time this happened till the morning he was taken—he used to go to work with me at Ditcham and Co., at Blackwall—I worked for Wright, a rigger, at the West India Dock-gates—I heard what I have stated before the examination—I did not tell the Magistrate what I had heard, because I thought it would be of no use—the witnesses were not allowed inside—I told the Magistrate I had witnesses for the boy, and Edward York gave evidence.</p>

On the 22nd of July, about twenty minutes past four o'clock, I was on duty in Park-street—Mr. Carr called me to stop a woman who was running—she came right against me—she met me, I stopped her and took her back—Carr asked her How she got into the house—she said she did not know—she said she had been drinking, that she was drunk, and did not know How she got in—she afterwards said she believed the door was open—Carr asked had she a key?—she said "no"—she had no shoes on—I asked her where her shoes were—she said they were folded up in her shawl—I asked her to put them on, she took them out and did so—I took her to the station—a female searched her there and produced this key and a sixpence to roe, and said she found them on her—the prisoner heard that, and did not deny it—I have tried the key to the prosecutor's door, it opens it easily—I opened twelve doors in the same street with it, equally easy—in the morning the inspector asked her about the key—she said it belonged to her—she appeared very sober—her feet were very dry—she had no difficulty in putting on her shoes, that I noticed.</p>

I am a police-constable in the service of the London Docks—I went with inspector Walker to take Reed at his own house—I told him he would be charged with being concerned with Cundick in stealing four bales of gunny-bagging, the property of the London Dock Company, on the 8th of June—he said "you know, Mr. Clements, there were only two from our place"—I said "Yes, you are right, there were only two from your place, and two from No. 2, but the entry in Mr. Barwick's book is in your name for the whole"—he said "I finished loading the bales and Cundick went over to No. 2 about some samples"—I have been in the Dock upwards of thirty years—I have known Whiteford the greater part of that time—he was foreman in the cotton sampler's department, and had the management of the cottons—Cundick was an extra labourer—Whiteford knew the rules respecting the delivery of cottons—there is a description of stuff called gunny* bagging, goods come packed in it—if it becomes damaged it would be the property of the Dock Company—they would mend the bales and take the old pieces that come off—they are sent to the store, and sold in the Company's rummage sales—the gunny-bagging is packed up to be sent to the stores, but not anywhere else—Whiteford and Candick had no authority to get rid of gunny-bagging out of the Docks—these warehouses were in the Docks.</p>

I am vault-keeper in the London Docks—Schwartz is delivery foreman—it was his duty to receive such orders as this, (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>,) after its being presented at the office—I have got Schwartz's book here—on receiving such an order as this it would be his duty to see the goods mentioned loaded, make an entry in his book, and give a pass-ticket, after mak<lb/>ing the goods out in the vault—this book is in his handwriting—on the 15th July here is an entry, 3 casks of oil, 662 gallons, and 1 cask of over-drawings—here is no mention of a basket or a bottle—this pass is Schwartz's writing—this and the order would be given by him, to take to the gate to get the cooper's pass.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> you mention three casks of oil, and one of over-drawings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the deductions that was necessary for the safe carriage of the oil, had been already made in the overdrawn cask—it would not have been necessary for any of the overdrawings—we do not take samples from these casks—if it had been necessary to reduce the quantity of oil in either of these casks, and put it into another vessel, it would have been Schwartz's duty to have entered all the number of vessels that went out of the dock—the effect of having only four packages entered on the pass-ticket would be that one package went out without any check whatever—when the order is presented they usually leave one cask, which is sent in by the mer<lb/>chant, which is applied to the overdrawings—after the overdrawing had taken place, and the casks bunged up, there could have been no necessity for drawing from the cask—if this bottle was hooked up at the crane, it would have been Schwartz's duty to have it entered in the pass—this pass orders the remainder of the oil, three casks, 662 gallons, and one cask overdrawings, to Sir C. Price—here is the filling and the overdrawing upon it, which shows it was the whole of the order.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 77.) On the 14th of Aug., about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Wimpole-street, and heard a noise as if somebody had jumped—I turned round, and saw a tall man standing on the cellar-flap of Mrs. Davis's house, and saw the prisoner jump off the leads of a jeweller's shop, come to the corner of Wigmore-street, and both of them ran down Wigmore-street—I sprang my rattle—the prisoner stopped, and began to walk—I went up and asked him what he did there—he said, "That man has struck me," pointing to the man who had ran away—I took him to the station, and found four silver tea-spoons in his coat pocket, and two silver thimbles, also some lucifer matches, and in his right-hand pocket two pieces of netting, a thermometer, and other articles—I went back to the place I saw him jump from, got on the leads of the jeweller's shop, and saw the sash of the drawing-room window <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up—I gave an alarm.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 26th of July, about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, I was in the White<lb/>chapel-road, opposite the church—I turned down Black Lion-yard, and the prisoner turned down after me—I did not see him till I turned down—he caught me by the collar with one hand, and seized my watch, which I wore in my fob, with the other—it had a chain, seal, and key to it—he snatched the chain, and broke it from the watch—I never saw him before to my know<lb/>ledge—I could see him quite plain, and have not the least doubt of him—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, he was brought to me by a policeman—at the time of the robbery there was a companion of his came down with him, behind me—I saw very little of him, but my hat, and gloves, and two handkerchiefs were taken—I had no opportunity of seeing his com<lb/>panion's face—I do not know who took my hat and handkerchief, but they both ran away—my hat was taken off behind—the hat and handkerchiefs were worth 15". or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On Friday night, the 17th of July, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I wasatthe Garrick tavern, and saw the three prisoners and another man drinking—they all four crossed the road, and went into a public-house opposite—I went there and saw them—I heard Webb say to Gill, "Will you haveany more drink"—she said, "No"—I heard her say, Where shall I meet you"—I did not hear the answer—I saw Gill and Jones together again about a quarter to two o'clock that night, going up Christopher-court, Rupert-street, near Mrs. Barkley's Howe—Jones had something square carrying by the side of him, wrapped up in something dark, with one corner hanging down—they were going out of Ru<lb/>pert-street, going in a direction from Mrs. Barkley's house, and not above three minutes' walk from it—they were both together—I was standing at Mrs. Smith's door, No. 1, Christopher-court—there was a gas-light opposite—Mrs. Smith goes by the name of Bowner—I have no doubt of the prisoners Jones and Gill being the parties—Jones had a black band round his hat, very broad, and I knew Gill before.</p>

I saw her—she said, "Mrs. Butcher, How do you do?"—I said, "Very well, you are the person I want"—she first seized me by the neck, she then let go her hold and ran up stairs—I followed her, and sent for a policeman, and gave her into custody-next day I searched her premises with the policeman—I found a shirt on her husband's back, marked with my husband's name—I found a coat hanging up which I had not missed, and a black scarf in a band-box, a fork, and a blanket on the bed—they are my husband's—I had not given the prisoner any of these things—this is the coat—these are my articlet.</p>

I am single, and live in Rope-yard-rails, Woolwich—I was in the Duke on Horseback on the evening of the 4th of Aug.—I saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners—they all came in together—a pot of beer was called for, and the two prisoners shoved the prosecutor against the fire-place—they came away from him directly, and his right-hand pocket was tamed inside out—Pitcher then went back again to him and took bis watch-guard off his neck, and his watch out of his pocket and put into his own—the two prisoners were then going out, and they said to another marine who wat there," Come on"—he said,"Indeed I won't"—the prisoners went out, and I never saw them again till they were at the station—the prosecutor stopped till Mr. Harris came and fetched him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Wright commence business there the very day you took the pri<lb/>soner up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect, but as soon as I became acquainted with those facts I went to my solicitor—a great many of my customers have gone to Wright—some of them are now returning—they were hucksters who came to the wharf for their coals—it was his usual business to treat with thent, and receive their money—I know nothing of Watts—he had not been a customer of mine—I very likely saw Mr. Wright at the Coal exchange on the 21ft of May—I do not recollect saying to him, "I see you are going to be a neigh<lb/>bour of mine, and take my late clerk into your service"—I will not swear did not—he did not say, "Yes, is there anything against his honesty?"made no reference to character, nor did I say, "Not the slightest"—he mip have said, "Have you anything to say against him?" and I studiously avoided giving any answer.</p>

               <p>might just have remunerated at the trade price—the price in the bill was not raised to give him a premium above the proper price, but reduced so as to gire him the benefit—I have allowed very few of these transactions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this entry to Mr. Watts in this page, did you look at it when you made out the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I posted it from here into the journal—it was decidedly not in this state at the time I posted it—I made it in the ledger as I found it—if it had been 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as it is here, I should have entered it so—it first went to the sundries account—the account was not opened then—I cannot say whether there has been anything under this figure—I posted this entry—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—the prisoner told me the price—I originally had 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was the price he told me when he asked me to make the bill out—it was merely to make it for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did, and at that time he told me to make an alteration here in the book—I cannot remember when it was—I cannot find the lesser amount—the entry is correct—it is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the price I is added since I posted it—the next entry is 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to another party—I do not know anything about any erasure—here is 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. put to the entry—it was not here at. first—it is Wicks' entry.</p>

On Sunday, the 28th of June, about half-past tea o'clock in the morning, my house was closed—I heard a knock at the door, and on opening it the two prisoners came in—I asked what they wanted—they said they were travellers, and wanted refreshment—I said, "What I" they said, "Half-a-quartern of gin"—they came to the bar and I served them—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they gave me half-a-crown—I gave them 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not notice that the half-crown was bad till five minutes after they wcrt gone—I had put it into my pocket—I had no other money there—I then con<lb/>cealed it in my bed-room, in a pewter sugar<lb/>bason on the sideboard—nobody but my son was in the house at the time they came in—he did not see what I did with the half-crown—it remained in the bason till the following Sunday—I never told anybody of its being in the bason—oo Sunday, the 5th of July, about ten o'clock, the two prisoners again knocked at my side door—I was watching for them, expecting them—I looked through the window, saw they were the same men, and let them in—they asked for half-a-quartern of gin and laid down half-a-crown—I took it up, drew the gin, and said, "This is a bad half-crown; you gave me one, you smashers and coiners, this day week"—they wanted me to give it them back—I kept it, called for a constable, and bolted both my doors—before the constable came the prisoner Brown said he would knock my by head off if I did not give him the bad half-crown, and he would give me a good one for it—I refused—shortly after<lb/>wards a constable came in, and he sent for another—when he came I gave the prisoners in charge, and said I had taken another bad half-crown of them that day week—they did not deny having been there—one of them, I do not know which, said, "It was not a bad half-crown I gave you, it was a bad shilling"—I sent my son for the half-crown, and told him where to find it—I give them both to the policemen—they were both marked in my pretence.</p>

On the 10th July I was in company with West, and followed the prisoners—I saw Wilson go to Mrs. Leary's stall by St. George's Church—when he left it I followed him till he joined Jones and Lloyd, about two hundred or three hundred yards from the stall—at the time Wilson went to the stall, the two others were about ten yards from it—after this, I saw Jones go to Mrs. Briant's stall—while she was buying the gooseberries Lloyd stood overlooking her, with his hand in his waistcoat-pocket—as toon as he left the stall, I saw him take the shilling which had been tendered by Jones, and gingle it on the pavement, and say it was a good one—di<lb/>rectly he left, I went up and asked the woman what she had received—we went into the public-house, and the barman bit it—I produce it—I have had it ever since—I went up to the stall directly after Jones and Lloyd left it—I lost sight of Wilson about a minute before they went away—they had been all three standing together talking—my attention was directed to Jones and Lloyd going up to the stall—I produce the second shilling.</p>

I am a draper, and live in High-street, Peckham. the prisoner was in my service for two years, within four days—she was a milliner-Moody told me something on the 7th of July—I went to his house and found a brown paper parcel containing three yards of linen-cloth, and the other articles stated in this indictment—these are them—I can swear to all but the flowers, the net and three remnants of ribbon—this gimp is a pattern that we had at the time, and we have missed such—I then made out an account of articles which the prisoner had had, and gave it to her—I asked her if she had had any other articles to enter, either herself, or from any other person—she told me she had not—that she had entered everything up—I asked her to read over the bill</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. John Lee, a grocer, at No. 8, Dorset-place, Old Clapham-road. On Tuesday, the 28th of July, about two o'clock, I hung out in his garden two table-cloths, three pairs of stockings, a pair of totters, four pairs of drawers, a cotton waistcoat, a sheet, not a shirt, and light pocket handkerchiefs, and there was a shift in the wash-house—I saw them all safe on Wednesday morning at two o'clock, as I was sitting up for Mr. Lee half-past six the same morning, I missed the articles—I found the wash-house door wide open—it had been shut the night before—I observed a chair by the wall, by the side of the back door, between Mr. Notley garden, which is next to ours, and the Clapham-road—a person could get from there to our garden, and get out by going back again—these the articles—some of them belong to Mr. Lee—this cotton handkerchief belongs to Mr. Robert Scrivener, who is lodging there—this shift is my own, and was in the wash-house—the other things were out to dry.</p>
