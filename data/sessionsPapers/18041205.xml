               <p>Q. Do you know this Mr. Spence, and where he lives? - A. He lives close to the office, in Wapping, he is a master plumber; I did not have any doubt but the lead was very right, I let them go with the lead; and after they had gone a little distance, I was a little dubious, I turned round, and saw them going towards Wapping with the lead; I sent Rodman to watch them, and I followed after, and when he was a little way from me he called to me; we saw them again at the public-house, the sign of the Rising-sun, where I took them into custody, directly opposite to Mr. Anderson's, an old iron shop; I questioned them what they had done with the lead; they told me they had left it where they knew where to find it, it was of no consequence to me what they had done with the lead; I insisted upon their telling me what they had done with it; I took them into Anderson's shop, and I asked Anderson what became of the lead those two men had left in his shop; Anderson strongly denied that they had left any lead in his shop; and by threatening to take them before the Magistrate, Caithness said to Mr. Anderson, what is the use of denying it, you took the lead from off my shoulder, and carried it backwards; Anderson and Caithness had a long contest in the shop; Anderson strongly denied it, his daughter and wife also denied it; Kelly said nothing; Caithness still insisted that he left it there; I took them all before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understood you that they said it was Mr. Spence's property? - A. Yes, they said that.</p>

No; Mrs. Davis lives in the lower room, she has a door to herself, and that door does not go up stairs; it is a back door that leads up stairs, and comes into a stone passage that leads into the court; Mrs. Davis came round to me when I called her; I had stopped the prisoner then; she told me to let her pass, as she had nothing but what belonged to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you find besides your own property? - A. Part of the property belonging to a young woman - one petticoat, two pair of stockings, one pair of pockets, and a cotton apron, the property of

               <p>Q. Were you at home on the 23d of November? - A. Yes; my father is a haberdasher and milliner: About half past six o'clock, the officer of the street came and asked me whether we had missed any thing out of the shop, it was quite dark; I looked, and found that the window of the shop was cut; I told him what was taken away; the street-keeper produced a handkerchief, which he opened, and shewed me the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What had been taken from your shop? - A. About fourteen yards of flannel, two silk handkerchiefs, and thirteen pair of gloves; they all lay in the window against the pane which was cut; I had put them there myself in the morning; the pane was not intirely taken out; the hole was large enough for any man to put his arm in.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person draw fourteen yards of flannel through there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the glass appear to be cut - by a diamond, or broken? - A. The street-keeper found an instrument on the person that cut it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar; had you seen him near your shop that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your shop-door shut at the time the street-keeper came to you? - A. It was.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol of the Minories: Between six and seven o'clock on the 23d of November, it was dark; I saw the prisoner at the bar looking in at the right hand windows of Mr. Glanville; he went from there to the left hand window, there is a door in the centre; he stood there for the space of a minute, and he retreated up a court, called New-court; I crossed over the way, and I felt the window where he had been standing, and I found the glass taken out; I walked away, and he came to the same situation again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear to be any vacancy from the opening? - A. The things that were behind had fallen against it, so that the place was blocked up; I walked away, and he returned again; he took his observations, and went to the same place after the space of a minute; he looked about him, and looked in the other window of the shop; he then went to the place where the glass had been taken out, for the space of a minute, and then retreated into the court again; I stood still, and he retreated backward and forward to the window, and up the court, four or five times; I kept my eye on him; I crossed over the way, and I laid hold of him; I saw his pockets stick out, and I said, my lad, what have you got here; he said, nothing at all; he put his hand to his pocket to throw them down, but I kept his hands up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to throw them down? - A. He did, but I kept him from that; I took him across the way into Mr. Price's shop, the shoemaker, and there I searched him, and found upon him thirteen pair of men's and women's gloves; I found nothing else on his person. After I secured him, I went back to Mr. Glanville's, and informed them; then I went into Vine-street, that leads out from New-court, and there I found this roll of flannel, and two silk handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were watching this man, did you observe any body else go up in the direction of New-court? - A. No, I saw not any person with him; I found these things hid behind a truck, standing up against a wall; I then took the prisoner to the watch-house, and on searching the prisoner I found a knife; I have been a patrol for these five years; I produce the knife; the knife is for that purpose, to work the putty round the mouldings, and the glass flies in all directions.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you observed at the time you were watching the prisoner, have you any reason to believe that he saw you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you searched him, and found this upon him, did he say any thing for himself? - A. He said so far as this, it is all over with me.</p>
               <p>(The articles produced, and identified by the prosecutor and his son.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Every thing that man has said against me is false; I was coming from Wapping, and coming down the Minories I saw those gloves laying on the ground, and I knocked at the door to see if the gloves belonged to the person of the house, where I picked them up; he came to me, and said, what are you doing; I said, I have been doing nothing at all; he said, come along with me, and he took me over the way into a shoe-shop.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you out so late? - A. I came on shore with my shipmate about eleven o'clock, after mooring the ship, it was dark; he was going to see his mother, and I was going with him; I missed my shipmate, and a gentleman came and told me he knew where my shipmate was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you fell in company with the prisoners? - A. I cannot tell, it was in a house; I was never in the house before, I do not know where the house was, I was not real sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you were in company with these two men? - A. Yes; the tall man, Williams, came in first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with him? - A.No; I do not know whether my shipmate did, he was in company with my shipmate.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get in company with Williams? - A. About half past eleven, I cannot rightly tell; the other came to Holborn-hill; I never took notice of him before my shipmate left me in the house; a woman wrangled with him, and the watchman came and took us all out; I cannot tell the name of the place, I am a Prussian; then I was going to treat this man with a pot of beer, and I was turned out of another house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050007"/>Q. Then you went towards another? - A. Yes, and this gentleman told me he knew where my shipmate was; I wanted to go to my shipmate, I did not know where he was; then we came to this house that was shut up, and there I put the half-guinea in at the scuttle, it was to pay for a pot of beer; they handed it me out, when the young man, Edmonds, with the blue coat, took hold of the half-guinea; he ran away with it, and I ran after him; the tall man, Williams, stopped me, and prevented me from pursuing the other man; he said it was a sixpence, and I could swear it was half a guinea; in trying to stop me, he tore my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. The one that took the half-guinea said nothing? - A. No, he was standing close behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your half-guinea again? - A. I called the watchman; they were both stopped, and the half-guinea was found by the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When the half-guinea was handed out through the hole in the door, did you try to get it? - A. I said, give me the half-guinea; they said it was a sixpence; I said, let me see it; I was going to lay hold of it, but he was first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I see you are an honest fellow, as I expected a sailor to be; when you handed it in, somebody not choosing to give change, handed it out to you; you gave it in voluntarily out of good nature to treat your friend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was returned out from the door, you had no objection to his taking of it - you thought he would give it you again? - A. I would have taken hold of it if I could; I told him to give it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, afterwards; you did not object at the time; he certainly should have given it you; you did not say, do not you take it -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He did not ask your leave to take it? - A. No; and when he laid hold of it, he said it was a sixpence.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of the night at the watch-house of St. Andrew's; I heard the sailor calling out stop thief; I was close by him at the time with the inspector.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he charge with taking it? - A. He said, Edmonds, the short one, was the man that snatched it from the door; when they were at the watch-house, I saw the inspector get the half-guinea in the way he has described it; the sailor was very particular in knowing the man in the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. He was quite sure of the man? - A. Yes, and he described him as the same man at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Edmonds's defence. I had been at the play along with George James, and after I had been to the play I called at Mrs. Stepner's house, in Fleet-street; I staid there till about a quarter past twelve; I could not go to my lodgings, I was locked out. Coming by this watering-house, I stopped there, and that young man came to us, with two or three more, very much in liquor; he forced his discourse to me, and asked me to have something to drink; I said I did not want to have any thing to do with him; he put his hand into his pocket, and took out the money, and put it in this hole; the landlord refused changing it, the money was returned, and he accused me of taking the money; I had a drab coat on when we were taken, and he said it was a blue coat. When I was stopped, I said, this man accuses me of having half a guinea; in the mean time, the prisoner Williams said I had nothing to do with it; the watch laid hold of him, and we all went to the watch-house together; the witness, James, will swear that I had been in his company the whole of the time; I never saw the prisoner Williams before in my life.</p>
               <p>Williams's defence. This sailor was very much in liquor; he was coming down Fleet-market, and two watchmen were dragging him to this watering-house-door; there was a cry of stop thief; I caught hold of this sailor, and the constable laid hold of me and the sailor.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brant.) Where did you take Williams? - A. Higher up than Bartlet's buildings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Edmonds been in company with the prisoner Williams at all, previous to taking the half-guinea? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Brant. This witness was the other man we took and turned out of the watch-house; there were five or six in the gang; the sailor had no charge against him.</p>
               <p>Court. (To James.) What are you? - A. I am a fishmonger, I live with Mr. Brown, of Leadenhall-market, I am his servant now; I clean fish, I am a weekly servant; I left the play at Covent-garden as soon as it was over, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live at the time this circumstance happened? - A. I cannot rightly tell; he was a glass-cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew who he worked with, nor never where he lived? - A. Not lately; I have known him about these twelve months; about six months ago he lived in Poppin's court, Fleet-street, I never visited him; I met him promiscuously going to the play at the top of Fleet-market, and we went to the play together.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way home from Covent-garden, how long were you going from Covent-garden to this house? - A. Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. To this watering house? - A. We were longer than that going there; we delayed the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do - this must be an hour after the play had finished, and you had got no further than St. Andrew's, Holborn, that will not take above ten minutes; I should be glad to know how you had been employing yourself? - A. We went into Fleet-street, to a court there, and got something to drink; then we went to No. 4, Bowling-alley, Chancery-lane; I was going home when I was turning up St. Andrew's hill, and we stopped at the watering house; we had not been at the watering house above two minutes, getting something to drink, when the sailor came up.</p>
               <p>Q. You had something to drink before? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man take the half-guinea out of his pocket? - A. No, I neither saw it handed in or out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did take it? - A. I cannot tell who took it, I did not see any half-guinea; I can swear Edmonds did not take it, he had hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Williams? - A. He was standing near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him standing there? - A. I cannot say I did; my friend Thompson -</p>
               <p>Q. You have a friend Edmonds - does he go by the name of Thompson? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to talk of your friend Thompson, where was he? - A. I suppose he was a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your friend Edmonds at the time this half-guinea was lost? - A. My back was right against the pillar of the door, and he stood alongside of me; his arm had hold of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this man called out to some man taking his half-guinea? - A. He charged Edmonds; one was on one side of the door, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were within a yard of each other? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not charge Edmonds while he was standing at the corner? - A. He did not; Edmonds turned the corner, and then he sung out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you run? - A. I went up Bartlet's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Williams run the same way with Edmonds? - A. Williams stopped till after Edmonds run; Edmonds run first, and then the sailor run; I called out to him what do you run for; he said that man has got my half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call out to your friend, what do you run for? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make? - A. No answer at all; I was taken at the corner of Bartlet's-buildings, when I was standing there, some gentleman came and catched hold of me, he said, come along with me; I said, I will go quiet enough; he took me to the watch-house, we were all searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them then this man was at a distance? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the Justice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to about this business? - A. I had a subpoena to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to your friend in prison? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your yard? - A. An open farm yard; he was in the yard close to the stable-door; I ran after him, and as he was going out of the gate he dropped the cock, I saw him drop the cock when he got there; he then ran down Pigwell-lane, about two hundred yards off; I catched hold of him, and brought him back, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he live in your neighbourhood? - A. We do not know where he lives; he told the Justice he lived in the parish of St. Luke's; I know nothing of the man myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Where was your yard dog at the time? - A. He was in the stable with me, and he came out with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of the stable he was going out of the yard? - A. I saw him close to the stable-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the cock in that young man's possession? - A. Yes; I saw it drop from him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the middle of the day, there were a number of people passing and repassing? - A. There were none in my yard; I saw the cock drop from him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of receiving any visits at your house? - A. The sister and mother, and another old woman, came into the house, and went up and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. No men came there? - A. None that I can recollect; only Benjamin Johnson, her husband; I used to let him in regularly of an evening.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix.) How is that? - A. Oh dear, no; never such a word passed; she begged of me to be merciful; I was very unwilling, as the articles were found, to prosecute, but never no money mentioned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not give the room up, nor was I half an hour out of the place, before she came and said, I had robbed the place.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prisoner.) How long was it till she came to you, after you had robbed that place? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) You found where the prisoner was within half an hour? - A. Yes, I found her out through her own sister; I followed her sister that very day I missed the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found out where the prisoner was? - A. Yes; I went to the Office in Worship-street, and informed the officer; I got a warrant, and the gentleman went up stairs in Turk-street, Bethnal-green, and took her.</p>

He told me to make no resistance, that he could call help, and he

With that the prisoner passed me, and went towards Newington, and I went towards Newington-green; when I got a little way from him, I turned to pursue the prisoner; with that he turned, and saw me following of him, and he came to meet me; I told him I would have him pursued; he said, what is that you say, what is that you say, twice over; I told him again I would have him pursued, and directly I cried out, William. The prisoner then passed me, and run through a little gate; he turned to his left hand, and went into another field; he went the length of that field, and got over the bank; then I lost sight of him. I turned myself, and saw this William, and a gentleman; they both came to my assistance; I told them what had passed; William pursued the prisoner, and he took him in a place called Cut-throat-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about demanding her money? - A. He did mention the word money, but I cannot particularly say what; he then walked on with me till we came to the lady in the field where he had stopped her; he desired me not to say any thing to him, as he had surrendered himself up; I then put him in the cage till night, and then I took him to Worship-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know him? - A. Yes, he is very well known, I have seen him often; he did live about Clerkenwell, he is something in the chair way; he has been here before for stopping ladies in the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he follow any trade? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have this to say: I was going from Newington-green to Newington; I met a woman going there, and I asked her the time of the day; she seemed rather frightened at my asking her that; I said to her, do not be frightened, I do not want to hurt you, nor neither do I ask you for your money; I went on my way a few steps, and she likewise her way; then she turned back, and said she would have me pursued; she called out, William, William, several times, as loud as she could; it rather frustrated me, I did not know what to do; I made my way over into the next field, I turned back, and saw somebody was in pursuit of me; I rather stopped, a person came up to me, and asked me if I had met a woman; I told him, no; he said there had been a woman stopped, and he would advise me to go back with him; I said I am going to see my father, who is in a workhouse at Hoxton; he said, I can take you up on suspicion; I said, is the lady in the field where she was stopped; he replied, yes; I then consented to go back with him, which I did, and the lady, when she saw me with him, said, I was the man that stopped her; I was then immediately put in the cage.</p>

               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Did you hear the first part of his account - is it true? - A. It is not true, I told you every word, word for word.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you in your house missed a ten-pound Feversham note? - A. We had, on Wednesday the 28th, it was missed from a drawer in a box, after having been posted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. With respect to its being missed, did you miss it, or one of your clerks? - A. I know nothing of the taking of the note; in consequence of its being missed, on Thursday morning I went from Finchley to the office, (I was informed by a junior partner) to the prisoner; I told him that I had reason to believe that he had taken that note, and that every one in the house knew of a Feversham note being missing; he at first denied it; my partner, Mr. Burgess, was in the room with me, I turned and said to him, will you go and fetch the man who says he gave it to him; while he was gone, he confessed to me that he had taken it; I still told him the man was coming who would prove it to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had taken it? - A. He said he found it on the ground, very near the place where this box stands; I then charged him with having the ten one-pound notes that had been given for it; I said, most likely you have got this ten pounds in your pocket now; he said, no, I have not, sir, I have them in my desk; he looked into his desk, and delivered them to me, the ten one-pound notes, which I have now; he begged that we would forgive him, that he had got a wife and three children.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'DONALD sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050016"/>Knapp. I am a clerk in Messrs. Williams and Co.'s house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this ten-pound Feversham note? - A. It was missing on the 28th of November, from a box where they are put after passing the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay a Feversham ten-pound note? - A. I did pay one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a ten-pound Feversham bank-bill in that box? - A. Yes; I took them out of that box to count them, on Wednesday morning, there were twenty-two, and in the evening there were twenty-two.</p>
               <p>Q. And on Wednesday, the same day, you found one missing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On finding one missing, did you acquaint your master? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after that, see that note again in your house? - A. I cannot say that was the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a note that was produced by a person of the name of Rust? - A. I saw it at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At what time on Wednesday morning did you count the notes? - A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you find? - A. Twenty-two, and the second time we found only 22; there were 23 in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your cash-book here? - A. It is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself never counted 23 in that box? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at every examination you found no more than 22; do you, sir, mean to state from your own knowledge of any Feversham bank note being missing? - A. Not from my own knowledge.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a waiter at the Cock and Woolpack eating-house, Finch-lane, Cornhill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he came to our house upon this day week; he gave me a note to go to the house of Messrs. Williams', in Birchin-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there? - A. The clerk who gave me the notes in change.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Medley.) Is that the person you paid the notes to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Rust.) What did you do with the notes that you received from that gentleman? - A. I counted them up, they were all ones, to the amount of 10 l. I took them home, I kept them till Mr. Greaves was in the parlour, and then I gave him the notes; he gave me 6 d. to get a pint of beer and told me to keep the change.</p>
               <p>- MEDLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a clerk to Messrs. Williams's, do you know this drawer where the Feversham Bank-notes are kept? - A. I do; I believe it will be necessary to explain this business a little. After the notes are paid, they are put on a file, and then a clerk takes them off that file; they are then taken to a person who writes them off into the cash-book, and this clerk, M'Donald, takes them off and posts them in the ledger; the next is, they are posted and marked off in the cash-book; they are marked off the day after, to see whether the number paid is the number posted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Williams.) Q. Do you know any thing of this being one of the notes? - A. It has been, I believe, in that box; the whole that is known of that note is, that Medley paid it to Rust.</p>
               <p>Medley. It was presented to me for payment on the 29th of November, I believe Rust is the person that presented it; I asked him how he would have it; he said, in small notes; I paid him in small notes; I asked him who he received it from; he said, he received it from Denton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you seen this drawer to see whether there were any Feversham Bank-notes in it? - A. I do not think that I had, I was not in the Office; this was originally paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of its ever having been in this drawer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever see it before Mr. Rust gave it you? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Rust.) Q. Can you speak to that note, whether that is the note you received from the prisoner? - A. I cannot really say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Medley.) Q. No other note was tended to you but by Rust? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you pay more than one to Rust? - A. I believe not to Rust.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Rust.) Q. How came you to say when you received the ten one-pound notes for the Feversham note, you had it from Mr. Denton? - A. I generally say from my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from your master or from the prisoner? - A. The prisoner told me to go to that house and get small notes.</p>
               <p>Q (To Medley.) What is your department at this Office? - A. I generally pay at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. You have nothing at all to do with the writing off in the cash-book or posting in the ledger-whether, in the course of your duty, it came in the scope of your duty, to write it off in the cash-book or post it off in the ledger? - A. I cannot swear positively yes or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you on Wednesday or Tuesday counted the Feversham Bank-notes in the drawer? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether you saw this Feversham Bank-note before Rust brought it you? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then there is an end to the case.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Medley.) Q. This note, prior to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050017"/>being tendered at your house, it was due and unsatisfied? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps it never was in your house as you know - if it comes in your house you pay it? - A. To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your house before it came from Rust? - A. I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no Feversham Bank-notes before they come to be paid? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not have come into your house, unless it comes to be paid? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever re-issue these notes yourself? - A. Never, I suppose they re-issue them.</p>
               <p>Q. What becomes of them when they come to you? - A. We send them to the country bankers as vouchers for what we have paid; but if we do pay any, and cannot produce them, we cannot charge them with the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I shall prove to your Lordship, that this note never was in the possession of that house till Rust brought it there; and, in the first place, there is no evidence that it is the note belonging to Messrs. Williams and Co.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Williams.) Q. Are you partly sure, that, in the conversation you had with the prisoner, he confessed having this ten-pound Feversham note? - A. I am perfectly-sure, in the confession of the prisoner to me, there was a Feversham ten-pound note mentioned by the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman in Smithfield; I met the prisoner on Monday morning, between twelve and one o'clock, with a large parcel on his shoulder; I asked him what he had got there; he said meat, and he had bought it of an acquaintance of his the other side of Blackfriars-bridge, in Cuper's-bridge; I asked him how he came so late with it; he said, he had met a friend, and he had taken him to drink with him; then he told me he was stopped by a watchman, and taken into St. Sepulchre's watch-house, and detained there some time by the constable; he told me when they found every thing safe and honest, they let him go; I called the next watchman to me, and asked him to go to the watch-house; the watchman went there, and the prisoner said he would go with him there, and they knowing nothing of the prisoner at the watch-house, nor the parcel neither, detained him; the watchman came back to me, and I took the meat to the watch-house, and delivered it to the constable of the night; he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Jones.) Q. You swore you met me with a parcel on my shoulder, and you stopped me with it, was not that parcel on the door when you came out of the box? - A. It was when I come to you; when I first came out of the box it was on your shoulder, and when you saw me come out, you threw it on a cil of a door opposite my box.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prisoner.) Q. You claimed it afterwards, and said you bought it of a friend the other side of the water? - A. I said so after I got to the watch-house.</p>

             sworn. - I was officer of the night; the prisoner at the bar was brought in by the watchman, charged with stealing this meat; I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been there from the time the prisoner had been there till the time you came back? - A. No. (Produces the meat.) I asked him how he came by it; he told me he bought it of Mr. Druce, at Cuper's-bridge; I asked him how he came to be so late; he said, he had been drinking; I asked him how he came by such a quantity; he said, he meant to let a friend have a part of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Do you know that meat? - A. I do, I know every joint; I lodged this meat in my slaughter-house about half past eleven o'clock on Saturday night; it was taken from my slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought it of a person of the name of Druce; I took it of him, thinking it might be of use to my family; I was thinking of salting the legs, which they do in my country which is as useful as any thing else. As to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050018"/>crow, I never saw it in my life, nor was there any cushion on the seat in the watch-house; it is not common for watch-houses to have cushions on the seat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prisoner.) Where is the man you bought the meat of? - A. I sent for the man; he lives at Cuper's-bridge, but he is not here now.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            : On Tuesday, the 20th of November, we had some friends at our house in the evening, and being a rainy evening, we had occasion to send for a coach by our servant-girl; after some time she returned with one, of which the prisoner was driver; I think the number was 287; the coach was intended for my brother-in-law and sister to go home to Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this? - A. A little after ten; I had occasion that evening to go to the Excise Court Office, in Thames-street; I proposed to take a part of the coach with my brother-in-law to the bottom of Houndsditch; in the course of the prisoner's waiting, he sent the servant girl into the parlour, saying, that if the company did not come, he must not wait; we made an observation, that it was improper that the coachman should be in our shop with the door open, and that he should remain with his coach, and the door shut; it was alledged, that the man came in for shelter from the rain; that was the conversation amongst ourselves; after that, the parties went in the coach, and I went with them in it; it happened to turn out, in going along Bishopsgate-street, we heard something rattle in the coach; we then said to one another, there must be some china in the coach; I asked my sister if she had purchased any; she said, no; we heard it again; we then thought it might be the steps of the coach; it was a very good coach; it was not that; we looked under the seats of the coach, and there we found some tea cups; I held them up for some time, and when we got against the lights, I perceived they were my own; we heard some more; I felt again, and found some basons; by that time we had got to the bottom of Houndsditch, and the coachman was drawing up; we then desired him to drive to Whitechapel; when we got there, before any of us got out, we desired a light to be brought; we had a light, and searched further; we found other basons and saucers of another kind; we then immediately called the watchmen and patrols, and got what assistance we could; I challenged the man with taking them; he said, he knew nothing of them, he supposed that our girl put them in the coach; after some altercation, we concluded to take him into custody; we had him in the house for that purpose; he made a great deal of resistance, said it was his coach and horses, he would not be taken from them; we persisted, and took him to Whitechapel watch-house.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are a servant to Mr. North? - A. Yes; I did not know any thing of it till the next day; I fetched the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When the coach came, what became of the coachman? - A. He stood inside of the door all the time; he told me to tell my mistress and master as it rained very hard, he would stand in the inside; I went and asked my mistress leave; mistress said, it was a very odd thing that he could not go inside of his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the china at that time? - A. It stood inside of the door at that time; there is no partition to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any china in the coach? - A. No, nor I did not know there was any.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was sitting down a job in Bishopsgate-street just before eleven o'clock, the girl came up to me, and said she wanted a coach; I said, I was going home; she said, it is only going a little way; I then put her in the coach, and as soon as I came to the door, she got out; their street-door was open; I went to my horses' heads to feed them; I staid some time, and then I went to the door, and the girl was in the shop; I said, it was very hard I should be waiting here, so many hours I had been out; she went and told them; she came to me, and said they were going directly; the coach-door was open all the time I was feeding my horses, and likewise the door of the house; when they came out, they got inside; I do not know how the china came in the coach, I told them so.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer in the Excise: On the 26th of November, they were letting out wines from the bonded cellar of Messrs. Scott and Idle, in Leadenhall-street; it was my part to go down and regage the casks, and to examine the bond; when I came there, I found several casks ready to gage, and pull up; there were several vintners' porters, and soldiers, there at work, bringing the casks forward for the officers to gage at the foot of the stairs; I was there about ten minutes; the master of the vintners ordered all their men up, in order to pull these casks out of the cellar; I observed, about 7 yards further up the cellar, a light with two men, who did not seem to come forward; I got over the casks with the light in my hand to them, and their light went out; whether they blew it out, I cannot say; I turned round, and saw one of the casks leaking very fast from a spile; the prisoner at the bar had his leather apron and buckle on; I asked him what they had been about, and putting my hand between his leather apron and frock, I took out a tin can filled full with wine, (the can produced;) it is a can belonging to the army; I called the officer that was there, and shewed him the can; the cask was then leaking.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you very hard at work that day? - A. I believe there was a deal of wine pulled out that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When there is a very hard day's work, they give them a glass of wine in the vaults? - A. I can say before this Court I never heard of such a thing; I saw the prisoner with the can, and took it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him very drunk? - A. I did not make any observations upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an Exciseman, and make no observations at all; there were many soldiers there? - A. There were, and I found nothing upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several casks with spiles in them - you have heard of such a thing as leaking; who put in the spiles there? - A. I suppose Mr. Scott's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there in the can? - A. Full a quart.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near was the prisoner to this cask? - A. Not five feet from it; he was close by the cask when I took him, it was running very fast.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he enter upon it then? - A. He came according to his promise between nine and ten o'clock in the evening; I lit him up stairs, and the next morning he got up before us, between six and seven o'clock; he called at the foot of the stairs to know what he was to do with the key of his room; I told him to put it under the back-room door, where we slept, me and my husband; he made a rattling with the key; my husband got up, and made search for the key, but could not find it; I got up and searched, but it was not there; I was obliged to get another key, and open the door, and when I entered the room, the bed-clothes were stripped down to the foot of the bed; a sheet was taken of the bed, and a clean towel out of the room; I expected that he would be back at breakfast time, but he never returned; when he took the lodging, he told me that he was a carpenter, and that he had been a barrack builder; I asked him for a reference for his character; he said he was quite a stranger in London, that he came from Wantage, in Berkshire, and was to get up early the next morning to meet Mr. Taylor, the waggoner, that his chest was coming by; I never saw him from that time till last Sunday morning.</p>

They were in the room; I was the person that lighted him to bed; I made the bed myself, and left the towel in the room; last Sunday morning my husband went accidentally into the Spotted Dog public-house, in Oxford-street, the corner of Bird-street, Manchester-square, and there he saw the prisoner at the bar, and my husband gave charge of him to the watchman.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: I was going by the Spotted Dog, the corner of Bird-street, to the watch-house, just at seven o'clock in the morning; Plum sent a man out to call the watch as I was coming by the door; I went into the house, and saw the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house; I searched him, and he said he had left a bundle at the Spotted Dog; I went back directly; I found the bundle, and the great coat he has now on; I kept the bundle, and the great coat was given to him by the desire of the constable; there is none of the prosecutrix's property in the bundle; there are two old window curtains, and two sheets; I and my brother, by searching his pockets, found a paper where he robbed an old lady.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) I understood you to say that you put him to bed between nine and ten o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in your house besides you? - A. There were some other lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite clear, that when you went to the door, you found the door locked, and you could not open it but by the means of another key? - A. No, and I never found the key from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was there any other key in the house that would open that door? - A. Yes, there was, but I had it in my possession.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am very innocent of the crime; there were other lodgers in the house; the reason I went away was, I have not had the use of my hand for this twelvemonth, and I thought I could not pay the lodging.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say that loud? - A. Yes; he then threw it down behind him; I then went round, and insisted upon having the duplicate and the one-pound note; I told him I supposed he had stolen the watch, as well as the handkerchief, and therefore I sent for an Officer; he attempted to run away, and did get out of the shop, but my young man and I pulled him back again; I delivered the handkerchief to the Officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this handkerchief was pinned? - A. Yes, I had pinned it myself, and saw it there just before he came into the shop.</p>

Yes, at Mr. Grant's, in Fleet-street; I went with the prisoner to the shop, to know whether he had bought the watch there, and he said he did; I then took him to the Office; he there told me he recollected where he had changed all three of the notes; one he said he changed where he purchased the watch, another at a hosier's shop, and another at a shoemaker's; all three of those places in Fleet-street; I went and made inquiry, and found a lad had changed a 20 l. note at each of those places; I then returned back to the prisoner again, and asked him if he were sure there were no more things of his at Shepherd's, and in consequence of his direction I went and found a number of things that he said he had bought; (produces them;) after he had been examined once, I asked him how he had got out of the house, where he had stolen the notes from; he said he had been a very silly fellow for so doing, that about twelve o'clock at night he took the key and unlocked the box, and took out three 20 l. notes and three guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he took it from? - A. No, I told him there were more missing, and he said he was sure that was all he had took out; he told me the room door was not locked; I asked him how he got out at the front door; he said he unfastened it, and let himself out, and pulled the door to after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the house of the prosecutor at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) What fastening was there to the outer door? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MRS. SHEPHERD sworn. - Q. Did you deliver any thing to Trott? - A. Yes, I received them from

             sworn. - I am son to the last witness: On Sunday morning, the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners at the bar looking in my father's shop-window; I was in the street talking to a young woman, about twenty feet from my father's house; I did not see either of them go into my father's shop when I was conversing with the young woman; I did not attend to them, my back was to them; I turned my head, and I saw Peele drop a cheese, but I had no suspicion that he had stole it from my father's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do when he dropped the cheese? - A. He picked it up again, and when I had done talking with the young woman, I went to my father's door; a milkman was asking my mother if she had not lost a cheese; I then immediately ran after the two prisoners at the bar, I saw them with the cheese; they crossed the road, and walked fast away.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your running after them, did they run? - A. Yes, and I ran as fast as I could; I catched Fisher at the back of Canonbury-house, in the field, he had just entered it out of the road; they both ran together to Canonbury-place, and then they took different ways; I took hold of him by the collar, and told him he was the man I was running after; he asked me for what; I told him for stealing a cheese from my mother; he said he was not the man; I then asked him what he ran away for; he said, surely he might run if he liked; I had hold of his collar, and by assistance I brought him to my father's house; I delivered him into the care of the person that assisted me, till I fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how the other was taken? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain you never saw these young men go into the shop? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When you turned yourself to look, how was the door, open or shut? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time passed from the time you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050024"/>first saw them, when they had no cheese, and the time you saw them drop a cheese? A. It might be about six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you no farther than twenty feet distance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And all this time talking to this young woman, with your back rather turned from the shop? - A. Rather turned.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the shop door secured? - A Only by a common thumb-latch.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gentleman's coachman: On Sunday, the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was coming from town towards Crannis's house; I asked at Crannis's house what was the matter, seeing people stand there; in consequence of what was told me, I saw Peele running across the fields as fast as he could run to Canonbury-house; he got behind part of a wall, called Canonbury-park; then he slackened his pace, he had been running very hard; I had a great way to go round to find him. I saw him get over the gate, and there I lost sight of him; I went round, and there I saw Peele a great way in the field, walking behind an old gentleman very gently, with his hands in his pockets; I knew him by following him. I walked up to him, and took him by the collar; he asked me what I did that for; I told him he was the person that I ran for, I could not say whether he was the person that stole the cheese; he told me he was very innocent; I took him to Crannis's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make much resistance? A. He desired me to let him go by the collar, and take him by the arm; when I brought him in, they desired to speak to one another; the other was brought back before this; I told them they should not do any such thing without somebody with them, so I went with them; they said they would pay for the cheese; they told me, if I would go with them, they would shew me where they had hid the cheese; Fisher told Peele where it was. I went with Peele to the place, and found no cheese, the cheese was never found; he desired me to bring him back, and take the other.</p>

Before this unhappy circumstance befel me, I never committed a crime I was ashamed of, or any thing that could injure my character. I have now in Court my master and other witnesses, that are waiting to prove the same. I am apprentice to Mr. Hendenburgh, a gingerbread-baker, Saffron-hill, and having no time to visit my relations but on Sunday; on the 25th of November, I was going to visit my aunt and other relations, I met my brother-prisoner, Fisher; the morning being cold, we had something to drink, and not being accustomed to drink any thing strong, which we then did, we both drank more than did us good; this, of course, rendered us incapable of conducting ourselves with propriety and decency; and coming along Islington, we saw a cheese lay at a door on the ground; we rolled it along, first one and then the other, not intending to convey it away, nor to keep it; what became of the cheese, it is not in my power to say, but in half an hour afterwards a man laid hold of me, and said we had stole a cheese out of his shop; this, of course, we denied; but on saying he would take us to the watch-house, my brother-prisoner, Fisher, said, he would leave his watch, if we had stole the cheese; the prosecutor would have stopped us sooner, or pursued us at the time, and their not doing so, I trust will have influence on your Lordship's mind, if we had carried the cheese away,

He had the cheese under his coat, and I could see a part of it under his arm before I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050025"/>to my mother's, but I had no suspicion that they had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had gone to your mother's, after you run after them, did you see them with the cheese? - A: They were got out of the road, and were gone into the field; they were still in my sight; I run in the road after them; the field is open.</p>
               <p>Q. At the end of the six or seven minutes, when you set off to run after them, did you see the cheese then under either of their arms? - A. I did; I saw them carrying the same cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite clear that you saw the cheese under their arm before you pursued them at the first time, and you saw it at the time you ran after them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember either of these young men offering their watch to pay for the cheese? - A. I was gone for the officer.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prisoners.) Which of you was it that offered a watch to pay for the cheese? - A.(Fisher.) It was me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Do you remember Fisher offering a watch to you for the cheese? - A. When I got home, they were both in the shop, and the shop was almost full of people, and the outside of the door was crowded; I asked these prisoners what they had been at; they said, they were very sorry for what they had done; and I said, I fancy so too, I find you have stole my cheese; they said, they had done it merely out of a joke; they said, they intended to bring it back again at night; then Fisher pulled out his watch, and offered his watch for me to take no more notice of it; I told him, I would not take it from him; I said, I should have the constable here in a few minutes, and I shall send you to the watch-house; they then said, if they could go and find the cheese, would I forgive them; they both said that; with that, I let this gentleman's coachman take them one at a time to go and search for this cheese; Fisher went first; he came back again, and said to the other, I cannot find it; then the other asked if he might go and seek for it; he went, and he could not find it; then the constable came, and I gave charge of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Fisher, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Peele, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden: On Monday, the 12th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I stood in Cross-street, Sutton-street, near to Charterhouse-wall, I saw the prisoner at the bar with this package on his head and shoulders together; there was a carman coming along, he said, good man, you are loaded, it seems falling, shall I assist you? he put his hands, and heaved it up, while the prisoner got his head under it; they walked on by me; I looked at the bundle, and went and stopped him; I asked him what he had got; he said, what is that to you; I said, I am an officer, and I insist to see what you have got; I suspected them to be part of the things in the hand-bill we had given in at our Office; I asked him where he was going with it; he said, he believed he was going to Chick-lane, but the gentleman gone on was the person that the property belonged to, he had but just taken it up, that he met him in Aldersgate-street, he told him he would give him two shillings to carry a bundle for him; I asked him where he worked; he said at Mr. Bartholomew's, he was in the masonry line, at Islington, he was coming from work; I put him in a coach, and took him to the Office; after I had taken him to prison, I told him he might as well tell me where he fetched it from; then he told me that that man that was along with him brought him out of Whitecross-street, and engaged him to carry this bundle for two shillings, and that him and another man lifted him up with it at a shop-door within about three yards from where I saw him; there is no shop within a hundred yards of the place; he said, if he had his liberty, he could find the parties that gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man before? - A. I believe I have, but not lately; he had two shillings in his pocket, which he pretended to say was given him to carry the bundle; he is a stonemason by trade, he was out of here but four or five days before the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is he? - A. Sixty-six; I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gillman.) Look at these things? - A. I cannot swear to them, there are no marks on them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Woolley.) Do you know whether these are the goods that you put on board this waggon? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Williams. They are prohibited goods; I am a King's officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether these are the goods that you put on board this waggon? - A. I cannot venture to swear, but I believe I have a piece out of the same lot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am the man that worked for Mr. Wilmot, a plasterer, at Battle-bridge; as I was going home, at five in the evening, in Clerkenwell parish, between St. John's-street and Goswell-street, a man spoke to me at a corner house, and said, will you carry a load for me; he said into Field-lane; says I, Sir, I will go and fetch a knot; a knot, says he, you do not want a knot, it is only some things in a bag; with that, he fetched it out of a house; I had not walked above forty yards from the house, he gave me two shillings; he says, old man, you carry it very uneasy, shall I lift it up? Mr. Chapman coming by, asked me what I had got; says I, what is that to you, Sir, thinking it was some gentleman that enquired; a woman made answer, and said, he is an officer, and will see; with that, I begged pardon; then he tied my hands before me; pray, says he, how came you by these things here? says I, you know where you met me, as you turn towards the right towards Goswell-street way, there is a corner house, that is the house I came from; says he, did he give you any thing; yes, I said, two shillings; with that, he searched my pockets, and found no more; then he said, where do you live? I gave him to understand where I lived as well as I could, I was not afraid; I said, my daughter shall go and shew you; that is every word I said from first to last, and it is nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Chapman.) Is it a fact that he told you this story? - A. Yes; the prisoner's daughter was not there at that time, she was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at work for Mr. Newman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050027"/>and the turnkeys know it, at the time this robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it was an execution? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a writ to levy 16 l. on your goods? - A. It was, I looked at the warrant and copied it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were satisfied about the fidelity of it? - A. I was: I took my pocket-book out of my pocket and offered him the money; I took out 19 l. there were one 10 l. note, four 2 l. notes, and a 1 l. note; I counted out to him the 16 l. which he refused to take, saying it was not his duty so to do; he persisted, and I told him, if he persisted, I should send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. He persisted in staying in the house and levying the goods? - A. I suppose that was his intention; I laid the money on the table, where I was standing with him; I went up stairs to call a servant to be witness to my tendering it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect positively that you left the money on the table? - A. I can, I went up stairs for a witness of the tender, and when I returned the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring the witness with you? - A. I did, my servant maid; I expressed my surprize to him, and he said he saw me put the money into my pocket; I searched my pockets, and I even went up stairs; being loth to accuse a man under this circumstance, I suggested to Mrs. Waters that I would go to a place where I had dined; I then searched there, and made every possible inquiry; this was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in? - A. An insurance-broker.</p>
               <p>Q. On your return from the place where you had dined, what then? - A. My suspicions were immediately increased by a report that Mrs. Waters made to me, and I immediately sent for an officer; I gave him in custody to this officer; he was searched before me, at my house, by the officer, with the assistance of another man whom I sent for, his name is

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon him? - A. Four 2 l. Bank of England notes and a 1 l. Bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken the numbers of your notes yourself? - A. No, I happened to receive them that day at a banking-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards discover what the numbers were? - A. Not the numbers, the bankers' clerks do not keep the numbers of small notes, but they write the names of such persons as they receive them from.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the clerk here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing on these five notes, which were then produced by which you can positively swear they are your's? - A. Not sufficiently to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly clear of the 19 l. which you produced? - A. Yes, there were four 2 l. notes and one 1 l. note found on the prisoner in a pocketbook in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he discover any reluctance in being searched? - A. So much so that I was obliged to send for another person to assist.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by that, that he refused to be searched? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found these five notes what did he observe upon them? - A. He said they were his own, that he had been saving them three years and a half; I told him I was sufficiently satisfied by his conduct he had taken them; I desired him to go down stairs with the officer; as he was going down stairs with the officer, he begged to say a few words to me; I told him that whatever he had to say to me, I should be very willing to hear in the presence of the officer; upon which he observed, that the notes were mine, but that I had made him a present of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of his saying those words? - A. I am, it was in the presence of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I need not ask you whether you had made him a present of them? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the five notes they were secured? - A. They are in my pocket now; the officer took them to the Office, and gave them to me at the Office afterwards; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them, and give me the dates of them when they were issued from the Bank? - A.(Produces them;) One 2 l. note, dated 30th November, 1801; another 2 l. 15th October, 1804; another 2 l. 29th September, 1804; another 2 l. 19th September, 1804; and another 1 l. note dated 24th September, 1804.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. You have told us that upon looking at these notes there is nothing upon the face of them by which you know them to be your's? - A. Certainly I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050028"/>Q. You conceived yourself very ill used; you were rather angry? - A. I was very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. You offered them to him, and he refused to take them, saying he was not authorized? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you laid them on the table you went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been certain that you laid them on the table, how came you to go up stairs to look for them? - A. Certainly it was necessary to take every precaution before I accused the man; I was perfectly satisfied in my own mind, I only did it by way of precaution.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were certain that you left these notes on the table, after going to other places to look after them? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear to these notes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The other you never found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it within your knowledge that the prisoner's senses, by means of an apoplectic fit, are at times affected? - A. The whole of his conduct looked more like that of a madman than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. His conduct surprized you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the conversation you had with him, his answers were sensible? - A. In some sense they were not, for after the notes were given back he even abused me.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not strike you as a man quite out of his mind? - A. Not entirely so; I can mention one thing that struck me so; on my expressing myself angrily to him, he got up and went to strike me; this was in the kitchen, and when my friend and the constable were there.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever known him before in your life? - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Except that circumstance of rudeness, his conversation was rational; he told you what he came for, and that he was not authorized to take the money? - A. Yes, he did so.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you remember being sent for by Mr. Waters? - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that day, the 17th of November, when he gave the prisoner in custody to you? - A. The prisoner was in Mr. Waters's house when I went in, and Mr. Waters informed me what I was sent for; I took the prisoner into my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - A. First of all he said it was a scheme to get him from the premises, so that the goods might be removed; he told me that he was an officer as well as me; then I told him to lay aside every suspicion of that kind, he was in the possession of the goods, and he was under my care, and I would not leave him till there was another put in possession; I then went to search him; he resisted with a great deal of resolution that we should not search him, and Mr. Waters sent for the other witness; then we insisted upon searching him, and he took his shoes and stockings off, and began to take his small clothes off; then the prisoner said search my pockets; I told him that would not do; I saw he had his pocket-book in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his pockets? - A. We had no need; when he wanted me to search his pockets he had taken his pocket-book out and had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cover it completely? - A. No, I could see it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it when he told you to search his pockets? - A. Yes, I took the pocket-book from him and opened it, and took out five Bank notes; four twos and one one; he said they were his own property, and he had been three years and a half in saving them; I asked him if he knew the number of the notes, as he had had them so long by him; he said he did not; I told him I thought it was very odd, as he had had them so long as three years and a half, that he did not know the numbers of them; he desired me to seal them up; in a little time after he said they were the gentleman's, but the gentleman made him a present of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say that they were the gentleman's, and he made him a present of them? - A. In about a quarter of an hour after he had said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he said that? - A. He was going down stairs; after they were sealed up, they were in my care till we went down to the Office on Saturday morning, where they were produced and broke open; I delivered them to the Magistrate, and then they were returned to Mr. Waters, and I put my name on the back of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Magistrate give them to Mr. Waters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Waters) I suppose they have your name on them too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. He first said they were his own? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In about a quarter of an hour after that he said they were his master's - A. He said they were, but the gentleman had made him a present of them?</p>
               <p>Q. He was a little outrageous in his conduct then? - A. No, he was not; I was with him all night in Mr. Waters's kitchen; he did not seem to be a person out of his mind at all that night, not in the least; he offered to strike Mr. Waters at one time, and I really believe he would have struck him, had I not shewn him my staff.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Waters was in a great passion? - A. I cannot pretend to say; he had a right to be in a passion.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you remember Mr. Waters sending to you on the 17th of November? - A. Yes, I went into the parlour where the prisoner and my master were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was searched? - A. I was, I saw the notes taken out of his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any difficulty to be searched? - A. He said he did not like to be stripped before a parcel of people; I said, my friend, you must be searched; he began to undress himself, and after he had all his things searched, and his pockets, and nothing found on him, then they came to his pocket-book; I saw five notes taken out; he kept it in his hand till every pocket and every thing had been searched; he then said he did not wish Mr. Waters to see the notes, so the officer and he went to the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. He would not give you the pocket-book then? - A. No; the officer looked the notes over, and after he called the notes over, my master said there wanted a ten-pound note. After the notes were sealed up, before they came out of the parlour, the prisoner said he should be glad to speak to Mr. Waters, if he would hear him; he then said, they were your property, but you made them a present to me; this was at the parlour door, as he was going down into the kitchen; in the course of the night he seemed very well; I sat with him all the night with the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man converse rationally? - A. I cannot say he did at one time; he said one part of the night, I would sooner have gone to Botany-bay than have come into this house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass in conversing with the man, that led you to suppose that he was not possessed of his right mind? - A. I cannot recollect any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to Mr. Waters's house; he desired to look at my warrant, I gave it him, and he copied it off on a bit of paper; he then put the notes in my hand, and took them away; he gave me the warrant back again, and then went down stairs; he came up stairs after me, and asked me if he had given me any notes; I looked in my pocket-book, I told him, no; I did not look in my warrant; he called a constable, and he found the notes in my warrant, in my pocket-book; in going down stairs I found they were there, I did not know they were there.</p>

               <p>Q. What has been the state of his health lately? - A. I have not attended him very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his having had an apoplectic fit? - A. Yes, he has had two, I think; the first was about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they been in any degree of violence? - A. Yes, they certainly affected his mind, for at the time his mental faculties were very much deranged, and also at a subsequent time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was the last time you perceived that effect? - A. I cannot recollect exactly the time, but he seemed to be in a state of idiotism; I have met him in the street, and asked him how he was; he seemed to be in a state of stupor, and I then thought his intellects were not as they were formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you saw him, so as to mark any thing particular? - A. About six months ago I met him in the street, and I perceived these effects even then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. Q. Do you know any thing of his character? - A. I cannot say any thing particular, I never heard any thing that was bad of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive that his faculties were at all affected at that time? - A. They were, as they usually have been lately.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How were they usually - his faculties were not so impaired as not to know what he was about? - A. There was something of a stupor about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he converse rationally? - A. Not always.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. Q. Do you know of his having had these two fits? - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night? - A. About nine o'clock, I myself, and every lodger, were in bed; I left my wife up.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed, did you fasten up the premises? - A. Yes; I fastened the windows and the doors as they usually are; the wash-house joins to the house, it is a part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window of the wash-house secure? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge, just as it used to be of other nights; I got up about six o'clock in the morning; in the night-time I thought I heard something in the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it you heard this? - A. It might be between two and three o'clock in the morning; I had got some rabbits in the wash-house, I thought it might be them; I called who is there.</p>
               <p>Q. You got no answer, I suppose? - A. No; then I thought I heard the back-door go open.</p>
               <p>Q. The wash-house is under the same roof as your own room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. I thought it might be one of the lodgers come down and gone to the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning? - A. About six, or rather before, it was dark; we went to work at Mr. Dance's, the gardener, I returned at breakfast-time, at nine o'clock; I got intelligence, and that led me to my wash-house; I discovered that the frame was taken out, and that I had lost some things, I lost my wife's cloak, a pair of sheets, and some raw pork.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all that you missed of your property - Did Curtis return with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He lost some property too, did he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son here? - A. Yes, he lost some property; we then went together after this man, but he was taken in a public-house by the Duke of Devonshire's brewer; I went towards Brentford, the first house I went to was Mr. Faulkener's, the Waggon and Horses; then I went to the Seven-stars, at Brentford; where, afterwards, we found the things at the Fox and Hounds; I made inquiry whether any man had been there with a bundle; I found there a pair of shoes belonging to my son.</p>

               <p>Q.(The coat shewn the witness.) Is that the same sort of coat? - A. I can swear to the coat by the slit here; I looked at the coat; we did not agree; he had a waistcoat, and I looked at the waistcoat, and I knew it was bought at my shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it bought by that young man, Curtis? - A. Yes, I said to him, this waistcoat was bought at my shop, but you are not the man that bought it; he said no, he was not; he said, the man that belonged to it was at work, they worked together at Mr. Dance's, a gardener, at Chiswick; I said to him, send the man down that owns the waistcoat, and I will buy the waistcoat of him; he said, would I buy the coat on his back; I bought the breeches; these are the same breeches; I gave him half-a-crown for the old coat and waistcoat, and four shillings for the breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar - do you know them? - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing them at your shop in the 20th of October last? - A. I do, about half past four o'clock in the afternoon; they both came together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the shop besides yourself? - A. My wife was in the back part of the shop, and her father-in-law, sitting by the fire; there is a screen between the back shop and the front shop; it totally hinders any person sitting there from seeing who comes into the front shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the back shop is so separated by a screen, as just to leave a passage from one shop to the other? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if you were in the back shop, you could not see without going round that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As either of them sat, could either of them see what passed in the fore shop? - A. I believe he might, if he sat facing the door, but he sat with his face towards the fire, and his back towards me; my wife was so placed that she could not see in the least when the two prisoners at the bar came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they ask for? - A. They asked to look at some black lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen them before? - A. I had seen the tall one before pass by, I believe; I know more of them now; I have an officer here who can tell more than I; the short one I did not know at all, I never saw her before in my life; I asked them what sort of lace they wanted, whether British or real; she answered, real; Palmer, the tall one, said she wanted real, she wanted some very good; I immediately shewed them some of different patterns and prices, from five shillings up to eighteen shillings a yard; they seemed very difficult both in pattern and price; there was one lace in particular that took the fancy of the prisoner Harris; she said to Palmer, my dear, this is good lace, it is real lace, taking the cloak that she had on in her hand; she said, my cloak is trimmed with real British lace, and directly threw it over the counter, covering the lace, to shew me the lace that was on it; this was Harris; Palmer made answer, I know it is.

             walked to the door; I supposed that she intended to shew me some other that was outside, as we have a shew-board, and that shew-board stands sloping, you cannot see in the inside; but she did not go to the shew-board, but stood in the front of the door upon the threshold, and seemed to be adjusting something in the front of her, in this kind of manner, (witness described how); she supposed that I could not see her, having a pile of woollen cloaks piled up against the door, but so as not to cover the whole of it, but leaving one square of glass of the door uncovered, from which I can see every one that passes in the street; that is how I saw her in that motion; I observed her before she returned into the shop again; she was not quite out, but was upon the threshold. At the time she returned, the prisoner Palmer was looking at a lace of 18 s. per yard, it was Harris that went to the door;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050032"/>Palmer said the price was too high, that she should not like to give more than 14 s. but did not bid me 14 s. I answered I could not take that, and they both walked out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they be in your shop altogether? - A. I suppose about fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. So they bought nothing at all? - A. Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they were gone, did you miss any thing? - A. I began, as soon as they were gone, to adjust my lace, taking them one by one, and in the space of three minutes I missed the card of lace I now charge them with; this is the pattern of it, (shewing a small bit of lace.)</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite clear that you saw the card of lace upon the table while they were there? - A. The card of lace was there, and was particularly looked at by Harris, saying it was a good one; I am perfectly clear it was there, I had it in my hand to shew them.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are perfectly clear it was upon the counter, and that

             particularly admired it? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lose? - A. Twenty-eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the price of it? - A. Seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. The value of the whole? - A. Yes; the whole was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the pattern? - A. This is the pattern I know it by; it is a kind of a sample.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positively certain that that pattern, twenty-eight yards of lace, was laying on the counter, and that you missed it? - A. I am certain of that; I saw which way they turned after they went out of my shop, I took my hat, and went in pursuit of them; the street being very short, that in less than a minute they can turn either corner, I took the turning towards Cranbourn-alley, and through Leicester-square, but did not meet them; I saw no more of them till Wednesday, the 24th, about half past three, when they passed the door, both of them together; I then went in pursuit of them; I followed them up Long-acre at a distance, and they went into Mr. M'Knight's, a linen-draper; I beckoned to him, I stood in the doorway; I beckoned him to come to speak to me, as he knew me well; he turned into the back parlour, and he said if I would come to him, he would speak to me; I went in to speak to Mr. M'Knight, and in the mean time the prisoners stepped out, they saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to be particular about that? - A. When I was standing at the parlour door with him, they directly went out of the shop without purchasing a single thing of Mr. M'Knight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they inquire for any thing? - A. There was a person in at the time at Mr. M'Knight's looking at some kind of linen, but they all went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoners joined in company to look at any linen before you went into the shop? - A. I do think they had in the same business; I followed them immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When they went out, what did you do? - A. I stepped out of the shop, and took the prisoner Harris by the arm, and said, walk along with me. O, my dear, said she, I will walk along with you any where; I took Harris, and we went into Mr. M'Knight's shop again; I believe Mr. M'Knight's man brought Palmer in; she was brought in; they were taken into the back parlour, and I immediately sent to Bow-street for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described this action of her taking up the lower part of the cloak, and putting it over the counter - did the cloak cover any part of the lace? - A. Nearly the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the action of putting her cloak in that sort of a way, the appearance of a natural action to shew it you, or strange and forced? - A. It is rather unusual to shew it you in that manner; sometimes they will shew in this manner (describing how), but I never knew one throw it over.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not excite suspicion in you? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found that lace? - A. No, nor never heard any thing of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Bow-street; we searched the prisoners, and that is all we can say; we found nothing upon them; nothing that they said made any impression on my memory in the least; they denied the charge, and when they were fully committed, there was a girl stepped forward, and said, that Palmer was an innocent woman, and that she did this robbery.</p>
               <p>Palmer's defence. The gentleman has known me for many years, and he knows that I do not live many doors from him, and when he was at Bow-street, he swore to twenty-seven yards.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Is that true, that you knew her many years back? - A. No; I knew her and her father by sight, but I never spoke to the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Palmer. I bought a cloak of this gentleman the 24th of last May; I have never been in his shop since.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Did you sell her a cloak? - A. I really do not know, I cannot say that I have.</p>
               <p>Palmer. I have got my cloak at home.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Do you know that she lived in your neighbourhood? - A. I have seen her pass, but I did not know who she was.</p>
               <p>Palmer. I am an innocent woman, and the officer knows that a young woman came into the Office, and said she did the robbery.</p>
               <p>Harris's defence. I am an innocent woman; at the Office a gentleman came up, and he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050033"/>could not swear to our persons, we were not the women.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Did you before state that you did not know the persons of the prisoners at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Harris. His friend did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Had you any doubt before the Magistrate of the persons of the prisoners at the bar? - A. None in the least; I could identify the person of the prisoner Palmer, in case of an alibi; the two officers are here that searched them, and they found nothing upon them.</p>
               <p>Harris. At the time the gentleman said the robbery was committed, I had not seen Mrs. Palmer for three weeks, or a fortnight, and I brought her a gown that I made for her on that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure to his person? - A. I am positive of him, and as soon as he laid down the saddle, he stared me hard in the face; I passed by the person that was along with him, he was dressed like a groom; I slipped by the groom apparently, he strove to hide the bridle; I went about three yards, I turned round, and said, are you going to ride so soon as this in the morning; I had no suspicion of the robbery; they immediately jumped off from the kirb into the dirt, both of them; the other man that was with the prisoner seemed to have a number of keys with him, they jingled very much; I then ran after them, and cried, stop thief, and sprang the rattle at the bottom of Holles-street; at the last spring of the rattle I heard one

             sworn. - On Saturday, the 3d of November, about five o'clock in the morning, as I was coming into Cavendish-square to go to my daily labour, I heard the watchman's rattle, and stepping forward to assist the watchman, I met the prisoner at the bar running as hard as he could run; I caught hold of him by the collar, and I called out to the watchman, and told him I had got him, and when the watchman saw him, he said he was the man that had the saddle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through Cavendish-square to Norfolk-street, to my work, and from thence he took me; the watchman coming down Oxford-road, held up the light, and said I was the man; he asked me where I had been; I was afraid it would come to my master's ears, and I told him I was going a fishing; there being but four masters in our trade, if a man has a bad character, they will not employ him; I am a saffron-caker; I was not willing it should be known in the trade; the last witness has sworn false, you may depend upon it. (The saddle produced and identified by the witness, Good.)</p>

            ; they were both taken one evening, the 27th of October; I found a bill on Garobbo of my own, which I know was placed in a drawer with a lock of hair in it; the bill I had at Sadler's Wells, and I found the duplicates which corresponded with the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>ANN JACOBS sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the prisoner, Garobbo, left you? - A. On the 22d of October; she asked my leave on Sunday night to let her go to Somerset-house to receive her monthly money that her husband allowed her; she told me if I would let her go at ten o'clock, she would be back in an hour; I told her she might go; she went out at ten, and did not return till three o'clock, she was then in liquor; I was very angry with her returning so late and being in liquor; she said, she had a letter from her husband, and that she was to have another, and the other prisoner brought it; I did not see the other prisoner at first; she called me up stairs afterwards, and said she had received a second letter; she then asked me, as she was late with her work, to let the other prisoner stay and help her, if I would give her a bit of victuals, she would pay her for the work; I said a bit of victuals was no object to me, if she was honest; she said, she was as honest as untold gold; they went up stairs to go to work, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Garobbo capable of doing work? - A. She said she was; she went and laid down, I am positive, for I begged her to lie down; the other prisoner came down, and was cleaning some candlesticks in the kitchen, and I saw them both making the beds in the two pair of stairs; I went up stairs, and fetched the candlesticks out of the same room; part of the time Rockwell was down stairs, and part of the time she was up stairs;

               <p>Q. After they went away, did you miss any thing? - A. I went into the back parlour, and there I saw her own things gone out of her box; they had both been there about an hour before they went away; in the course of two days following, I saw my cupboard door undone, and there I missed my card of lace, part of it is in Court now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that lace worth? - A. There were nineteen yards and a half on the card, I valued it at forty shillings; I went to my drawers, and there I had a caddy that had five guineas in it, which I put by for my rent; it was locked when I left it, and I found the five guineas gone; in the one-pair back room, where they had been making the bed, I missed that and a fore-finger ring with hair in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that worth? - A. Three or four shillings; I missed a handkerchief-pin, a short window-curtain, and an apron; some of the lace I have seen, and the handkerchief I have seen, at Marlborough-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How old are you? - A. I am fourteen next Twelfth day.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether you know the person of the prisoner? - A. That is he that is at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the latter end of last month? - A. It was last Thursday week I saw him facing No. 77, Lombard-street, about four o'clock in the afternoon; he asked me whether I would go into No. 77, and receive that; there was a bit of paper given into my hand by the prisoner; I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner when you went in? - A. He stood in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in there and saw a clerk? - A. Yes, I gave the paper to the clerk, he is here in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hawkins was the person that you saw? - A. Yes, and I gave the piece of paper to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with that paper? - A. He asked me where I got it from; the gentleman looked in the book then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to the prisoner then? - A. Yes, by myself, in the street to the prisoner; I left the paper there; the prisoner was gone a little further; I stood there, and he came to me; I told him that the gentleman said he must step in himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you before you said any thing to him? - A. He walked away very quick; then two gentlemen came out and took him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner gone out of your sight before they took him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned back again, are you sure that he was the person that gave you the paper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the paper you received from the prisoner, you gave to Mr. Hawkins? - A. Yes, I had no other.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, Mr. Hawkins is nearer to you, tell me whether that is the person you gave the paper to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When the paper was given to you, were you not desired to go and see if it was a good check? - A. No, I am sure it was not; he asked me if I would go in and receive that.</p>

               <p>- HAWKINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Vere and Co. No. 77, Lombard-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving from the last witness a draft on the 29th of November? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the draft, did it appear to be a good one? - A. It appeared to be a forged one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050036"/>Q. You went and took the prisoner? - A. I did, and I went afterwards to the Mansion-house; I have it about me now, it was payable to Mr. Getham, or bearer, 20 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person whose name is there? - A. Yes, they have kept cash at our house, and they have at this time an account kept open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received it you saw it was a forgery, and did not pay it? - A. I did; I did not pay it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At present they keep an account with you, did they last Thursday? - A. Yes, and for years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this draft been in your possession ever since? - A. Not the whole of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the draft that you received from the boy out of your possession? - A. A very short time; it was in the possession of Mr. Lucadou from about four o'clock on Thursday till twelve o'clock on Saturday, at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it to Mr. Lucadou? - A. I did not; it was laid on our counter, and who took it up I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. It was out of your sight till you saw it before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark upon it before you parted with it? - A. No, but from the attention I paid to it, I have no doubt of it; I think I can swear to it without any difficulty.</p>

               <p>Q. On Thursday, the 29th of November, in consequence of a draft being brought in, you went out? - A. I went out by myself, just out of the door, and saw the prisoner speak to the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the boy that is standing up here? - A. Yes, I saw him speak to him, and then he ran away; I ran after him, and I came up to him in Pope's Head alley, that leads from Lombard-street to Cornhill; I told him that he had been sending a check by the boy to our house; he said he had not; I told him he had, and that he must go back with me, and as I was taking him back Mr. Fleming came up; he is one of our clerks; we then both took him into our house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the boy that has been examined bringing the draft? - A. Yes, I was there, between the hours of four and five; I saw him, and I think I saw the prisoner before he was brought in; I saw when he was brought in; I said, how came you by that; he made me no answer; I pressed him two or three times to tell me where he had got it; his answer was, he lived with Mr. Morgan, in Lawrence-lane, who kept cash at our house; I desired one of the clerks to go for a constable, and just at the moment he was going out of the room with this constable, he said, I wrote it, I meant it as a joke, or intended it as a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this draft? - A. I immediately took this draft and put it under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the Mansion-house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the draft to the Mansion-house? - A. I did not, I rather think it was Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Q. You locked it up and kept it till the next morning? - A. Yes, and when I came down into the office, I saw the draft again; I have not a doubt but it is the same draft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have not a doubt but it is a draft of the same purport? - A. I have no doubt at all it is the same, and now looking upon it I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been out of your possession? - A. It certainly has.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a draft, in your judgment, of the same hand-writing; you will not swear positively that it is the same draft? - A. I saw the draft and looked attentively upon it at the time; I have not a doubt but it is the same, to the best of my recollection and judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen a draft similar to this, and, upon recollection, it induces you to think it is the same? - A. I have not a doubt but it is the very draft.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the impression on your mind; Messrs. Booth and Robson had no account open at your house? - A. They have at this time what we call accounts open, upon which there is a balance due to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Have you any doubt of that draft that you took to the Mansion-house, but it is the same you had under lock and key? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Jury. We believed that he said he could not swear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Upon oath do you believe that to be the draft you had locked up in your desk? - A. I do believe it to be the identical draft; I have not the least doubt; I can take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt that you had it in your possession, and delivered it to be produced before the Magistrate? - A. I have no doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. It is not like it? - A. I think it is in imitation of it, but I have no doubt that it is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you speak it from what he has said to you? - A. No, I suspected it when the boy gave it me; I have seen him write many times, there is a faint resemblance, but it could not deceive me. (The draft read in Court.)</p>

Yes, I then knew it to be my master's, it is No. 106. he had not then been out of my sight; I told one of our men, and the man seeing the string, asked him to shew him the watch; I then took the watch, I asked him how he came by the watch; he said his mother bought it for him.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of your duty did you and Hewit see the prisoner? - A. Yes, near the entrance of Leading-street, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. That is close to the river Thames? - A. About 120 yards from the river we saw the prisoner in a boat; he had a bag of coals on his back; I asked him how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him they were coals? - A. No, we did not know at that time; he said, in the first place, the captain gave them to him; afterwards he said they belonged to different men that had been working on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any ship? - A. Not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any ship he had been on board of? - A. Not at all; he said the men had given them to him, upon which we took him into custody; then we told him we were Officers of the Shadwell Police-Office.</p>
               <p>Q. On what suspicion? - A. On suspicion of the coals being stolen from some ship or vessel in the river Thames.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the prisoner coming from at the time? - A. From the bottom of Shadwell market.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near to the river? - A. About 120 yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him you were Officers of the Police, what then? - A.He came with us as far as the middle of the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him why you apprehended him? - A. Yes, on suspicion of the coals being stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him from where you suspected they were stolen? - A. Yes, from the river Thames; after we told him we were Police-Officers he came as far as the middle of Shadwell market with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come along with you quietly? - A. Yes, as far as the middle of the market; when we first took him into custody he put the coals off his back; we helped them on his back again, and he carried them to the middle of Shadwell market; he then threw the coals from off his back, and said he would carry them no farther; I took the prisoner by the arm to take him to the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him by the arm to take him to the lock-up house, what was Hewit doing? - A.- A. I desired him to stay behind to take care of the property; the prisoner and I proceeded on to near the top of the market-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that market hill lead to the river? - A. No, to the Highway; when we got pretty near the top of the hill the prisoner turned round, caught me by the collar, and said he would go no farther with me; he struggled a good deal, and I threw him; he held me fast by the collar, and dragged me down with him; while I was in that situation, upon him upon the grounds, I felt myself to be wounded in the face, and I bled a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel when you found the blood in your face what kind of instrument it was? - A. No, I found I was cut in the face; a person came by at that time, of the name of Morgan, and assisted me.</p>
               <p>Q. How assisted you? - A. Helped me to get up, and the prisoner got up and I laid hold of him again; when we got quite to the top of the hill he laid hold of me by the collar again, and struggled with me, and I threw him again; while I was falling he cut me on the leg, and stabbed at my body in several places.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you received this wound in the leg, did you perceive it was with a sharp instrument? - A. Yes, it cut through my stocking very plainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is your present illness the cause of that? - A. Yes, I have been confined ever since; my clothes were cut in various parts of the body; I caught hold of the prisoner, and got him up.</p>

               <p>Q. Morgan was with you at this time? - A. Yes, and I proceeded to the lock-up house with him, and delivered him to the jailor and other officers present; I went to the surgeon, Mr. Pater, to get my wounds dressed.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner? - A. Yes, very near the top of Leading-street, Shadwell market; I stopped him, and asked him how he came in possession of those coals on his back; he said a captain belonging to the ship where he had been at work had given them to him; we then told him we thought the captain would not give him so many as that; he then said they belonged to different men, and they had given them all to him, and he had given them some beer for them; we told him we did not think it a satisfactory account, and he must go with us; he said he would go with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him you were officers? - A. We told him before, as we were bringing him along, that he must go with us; we came together to the middle of Shadwell market; the prisoner, Harris, and me; he then threw the coals off his back, and said he would take them no farther; Harris then took hold of him, and desired me to stay by the coals, which I did, and Harris and the prisoner went on together without me; I was to stay there till he came back; I thought he staid a long while, and got a strange man to help me up with them; I took them to the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the witness Harris there? - A. I did not; we locked the coals up, and produced them before the Magistrate the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Harris afterwards? - A. I went over to the doctor's, and saw him there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the witness Harris in Shadwell on the 22d of November? - A. I saw Harris having a scuffle with some man, about ten at night; I saw them fall together, Harris was uppermost; on their getting up again, Harris requested I would assist him; on that I laid hold of the man by the collar; after that he did not make much resistance; I walked a little way with him and then let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not observe any thing the matter with Harris? - A. As he was going to the lock-up room I perceived his cheek bleed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect which cheek it was? - A. The left cheek; I mentioned it to him; I asked him how he came by it; he said he imagined he cut it in the fall by some glass, or something that might be about there; then he observed he had lost his hat, and I said I would go back for it; I found the hat and took it to him in the tap-room where the lock-up room was kept, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that his leg was cut? - A. No, not then; he was advised to go to the doctor's, and I went soon after; they say the wounds are both in the leg and the cheek; they appeared to be cut by a sharp instrument, as I observed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear as if they could have been done by glass? - A. No, I said I would go over the way, and shew them where the scuffle was, to see if there was any instrument; I went to the place where the first scuffle was, with some officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found in your presence? - A. No, I returned to the surgeon's, and saw him dressed.</p>

Very much cut, the side of his cheek was bleeding very much; I went and searched the prisoner, stripped him naked, but found nothing upon him; after I had done that, I locked him up; then I went with three officers, with flambeaux's, to see if I could find any instrument that he was cut with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing? - A. Yes; about fourteen yards from where the scuffle was, I found a knife, (produces it); it was dirty on one side when I took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it bloody? - A. It did not appear to be bloody, it was thrown into the dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that you went to the place to look for the knife? - A. About five minutes after I searched the prisoner; I have had the knife ever since; it was shewn to the prisoner the day he had his hearing, he denied having any knife.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor, Harris, apply to you? - A. He did, on Thursday the 22d of November, between ten and eleven o'clock at night; he was bleeding in his left cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. He has shewn us the scar? - A. That was in consequence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It appeared to be done by a sharp instrument? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose it might have been done by such a knife as this? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have been done by glass? - A. It would have been more irregular.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have been done by an oyster-shell? - A. I should suppose not; it appeared evidently to be done by something sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his leg? - A. Yes; it was not so formidable in the appearance as that on the cheek; his cheek is now well, his leg is not well yet; his leg might have healed as soon as his cheek, but the first two or three days he walked about, and that might inflame it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the leg that night, did it appear to have been inflicted with a sharp instrument? - A. It was a simple division of the skin, without injuring any of the parts beneath.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the wound in the leg be inflicted by glass, or an oyster-shell? - A. No; it appeared to be by an instrument.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Oliver.) You said you went to the spot, and found a knife? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any oyster-shells, or glass there? - A. There were none.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never had a knife, nor any weapon in the world, I did not know he was cut, I did not know any thing about it; when he searched me, I told him I had no knife.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether she was in your service on the 15th of November last? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your house when she was in your service? - A. A number of articles, particularly the four table-cloths; the four table-cloths are the only articles that I have found.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth? - A. Twenty-five or twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss them? - A. Some time in October; I did not suspect the prisoner to have robbed me at that time; she had been in my service about a month or six weeks, then I suspected her, and taxed her with it; and in consequence of a search-warrant, I found them by a woman that was an accomplice with her, who is in Court now, to give evidence; it was on the 16th of November that I found the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. You came at the knowledge of these things by the accomplice of her? - A. Yes, she is an acquaintance of her's; I had a search-warrant and searched for the tickets; she then said, she would tell us all the other woman did.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched the house of this witness, and found the duplicates there? - A. No; we found several duplicates, but none of my goods were found; she told me she would explain every thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to you about the latter end of October with any thing? - A. It was some time in October, I cannot recollect exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she bring you? - A. Three tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she got them from? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she bid you do with them? - A. She asked me to pledge them for her, and I pledged them with the two gentlemen that are in Court; I pledged five in the whole, Mrs. Spencer gave me three, and two I took from the house of Mr. Diggles.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have access at Mr. Diggles's house? - A. I went to see her two or three times while she was servant there.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to see the prisoner; did the prisoner give them to you, or did you take them yourself? - A. She gave them me for the purpose of pledging them.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me she only gave you three, but, by your account, you had five? - A. I had five in the whole, they were at different times: she was in the habit of going backwards and forwards to Mr. Diggles, they were acquaintances; and when she was in better circumstances they used to visit each other.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Prisoner. She had them for her own use.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mell.) What did you do with the money? - A. It was to replace the things that she had made away with in her lodging, prior to her going to service to Mr. Diggles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is my landlady will answer, that, when I gave up my lodging, every thing was replaced before I left it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Mell.) In what line of life was the prisoner in before she went to service? - A. She had been kept by the Hon. Lessian Blackwood.</p>

             sworn. - On the 27th of October, Mrs. Mell pawned two table-cloths; I produce them, they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Has that woman been in the habit of pawning goods at your house? - A. Yes, I have known her these two years, she pledged the table-cloths in the name of Jennings. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Mrs. Mell has told us, that this woman was an acquaintance of your's before she came into your service? - A. The way she was acquainted with me, I knew the Hon. Captain Blackwood five years ago, and the prisoner was living with him in the situation you have just heard; I used to see her and Captain 
               <persName id="t18041205-37-person490">Blackwood</persName>

             is gone to the Isle of Jersey; some time after this I saw her in distress, and I wished to know how her circumstances were; she called upon me at my house; she said, she was in great distress, and she said she wished to get into service if she could.</p>
               <p>Q. When she called upon you, did she ever stay much in your company? - A. I treated her with a deal of kindness, and in summer time she came and assisted in the kitchen in pickling and preserving.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am in the profession, I am an attorney and solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her into your service? - A. About the middle of September.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to Mrs. Mell, do you know much of her? - A. I never saw her but twice before; I was at her house in order to search for the things, I never saw her but once at my house; after I had been robbed, I suspected every person that came into my house, and this Mrs. Mell came; I desired her to walk out, I had to go out to attend to my business; when I returned, I understood she had been there a second time on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew she was not in the habit of visiting any person in your house? - A. No other than the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are you a married man? - A. I am; I have been married some years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Me and my prosecutor were always in the habit of visiting each other before I went into his house, and when I went I was not as an hired servant, I was as an intimate friend to assist till they were suited.</p>

Willan and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make use of any promise or threats? - A. I told him if he did know any thing about it, it would be better for him to confess the truth.</p>

Yes, he came to my house; he said, Sir, I have got a very good customer for you; I said, I was very much obliged to him for introducing a good customer to me; he said, he should expect a little commission for the introduction, which is not unusual in London; I believe he then went out, and in the space of ten minutes he came in again with Mrs. Haley; she said, Sir, I want to look at some goods; I shewed her some printed cotton; she looked out goods to the amount of 60 l. 19 s. 5 d. including the wrapper of the parcel; she said, Sir, I hope you have no objection to take country Bank-notes; I said, no, certainly, if they were payable in London; she then looked out country Bank-notes to the amount of 85 l. upon the house of Robarts and Curtis; Mr. Barber's porter, of Cheapside, whose name is Mee, came in at the time; I said, I will thank you if you would step to the banking-house, and receive this money; he went, and brought the 85 l. in small notes; she said, she had a great many more country Bank-notes, would I be so good as to send somebody to get change for them; I sent Mr.

Yes, of the parish of St. John the Evangelist; I went to No. 5, Church-street; Cook was not at home when I went first; the second time I took him into custody; he asked me what it was for; I told him it was on suspicion of having 150 l. from Mrs. Haley; I then searched him, and found five shillings; I then took him to Bow-street; he wanted to know who gave the information; I told him that Mrs Haley said he had so much of her money; he said he had not, and if he had, he was too good a judge to keep such things about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what Mr. Cook was? - A. He has been an attorney in the country; I was accompanied by young Mr. Vidler; when I got to Bow-street.

On the next morning we went to No. 10, Goswell-street; he went up two pair of stairs; he went first, and I followed him; he said, walk in; he then opened a box with his keys, and took out a paper, and said, here Mr. Goodenough, here are the notes that I told you of, look at them, and see if they are right; there were in the paper two Bank-notes, No. 9559, a 100 l. and No. 1065. a 50 l.</p>

             left their defence to their Counsel.</p>
               <p>Cook's defence. I am perfectly innocent of the crime charged against me; I know nothing of the notes, except from Mrs. Haley, and as to the notes found in my lodging, they were given to me on Saturday morning; the day before she gave me five pounds in notes, and seven shillings, to go to the Excise-office to pay for the license. As I went along, I went to where my trunk was, at No. 10, Goswell-street, I always leave my trunk there; I never have any thing at my lodging barely, but my night-cap; I had locked up the notes in my trunk, because I was going to Wapping; I went to Wapping, and dined, and drank tea there; I returned the next day to the place where my trunk lodged, and I dined and drank tea there; on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050046"/>morning following it was a rainy day, it rained from the time I went out till I returned. When I was apprehended, young Mr. Vidler came to my lodging, and told me that Mrs. Haley had left in my house 150 l. to change in small notes; my answer was, whatever was in my possession was safe, and I wished the right owner to have it. Soon after that, Goodenough rifled my pockets, and as to money I had but five shillings and sixpence in silver and halfpence; he then took me to Bow-street, and who should he see but old Mr. Vidler, as he told me, and the office was shut up, and the Magistrate was gone; he then said he must take me to the watch-house, as I must be taken care of for that night, and as to the conversation that I had with him concerning the notes, I said, if you will go with me to-morrow morning where my trunk is, I will go with you, I shall be happy when they are all out of my custody; I desired him, as we were going along, not to drive up to the house, but to stop an hundred yards from the spot; we stopped at the end of Long-lane, and we went to the lodging where my trunk has been for two or three years; as soon as we got into the room, I unlocked the trunk, and produced the notes; the clothes that were in that room have been in my possession for two or three years, and the reason I did not wear them was, I had not proper apparel to wear with them; I opened the trunk as soon as I got into the room, and said, there they are, and I am very happy they are out of my possession; this was at the woman's lodgings that has washed my linen for these two or three years; she is as good a woman as ever breathed in the world; there was nothing but a trunk that contained a few books, and some private memorandums; he insisted, after finding nothing in my first trunk, on searching the other; I opened the other trunk, and he searched every paper, he shook every book, and he found nothing more in it, as God knows, but the 150 l. delivered to me by Mrs. Haley; that is the truth. I have no acquaintance in London to speak for me, I have kept no company in London these four years; very fortunately for me, a gentleman has come forward to give me a character; he has always acted by me, and every person, as a man of honour.</p>
               <p>Haley called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Cook called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she sleep in your room that night? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Perceiving that you had lost five shillings in the morning, did you tax her with it? - A. No; the officer was ready within three doors of my house to take her, provided she robbed me that night; I went to him immediately I got up; he came and searched her, and found the marked money there, which he produced at Bow-street, and there I saw them; I am sure they are the shillings I had marked the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long has there been two beds in the room? - A. I suppose about two months, I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not fit for a bed-fellow - did she not sleep with you? - A. I have had no bed-fellow except my wife, who is dead and gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You prosecute for the sake of public justice - I dare say you would be the last person to make offers to the prisoner's friends? - A. They have made me offers, but I have not made them any.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the reason you have come here, because they have given you none - do you know the Bull Inn, in Holborn, did not you go there? - A. I do not deny but I have been there; here is a person in Court that offered me fifty pounds, that I now positively swear to, but I told him I would not do so, that I had discharged a man in consequence of her robbing me, and therefore she should take the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if any body should say that you went to the Bull Inn to solicit her friends to compound this, it is not true? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for? - A. I went to the person that keeps the Bull Inn, by the desire of the prisoner, to let her brother know what situation she was in at this time, she would thank him to come to town.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whenever you met them, you met them at the Bull Inn? - A. I never saw Mr. Cannon, her brother, but twice in my life; the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050047"/>time I went to the Bull Inn was by desire of the prisoner</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner for her to express that desire? - A. I was in the yard, and the sister came to me and said she expected her brother was coming up, and immediately he came up to tell him to come down that evening; I told her I would do her that favour; I would call at the Bull Inn; I was going past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That very sister could have done that herself? - A. Her sister was here in the yard and asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. And would not go to the Bull Inn; why did not you tell her to go herself? - A. When I came out she was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What message did you deliver to the brother? - A. I told the brother that I saw the sister of the prisoner, and she wished to speak to him, if he would oblige her; that was all that passed between us then.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrols of Bow-street; I went to Mr. Baker's house, by his desire; I went in and searched the prisoner; I told her I was to search her, she had robbed her master; she said she had got no property of his.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find when you searched her? - A. Two shillings and sixpence; the two shillings are marked; in about an hour afterwards she was searched by a woman; I searched her as far a man ought.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the woman searched her? - A. No; the woman took something from her breast, and put it in her pocket afterwards; I took three shillings from the prisoner's pocket, and two shillings I took up from the floor, while the prisoner was putting her clothes on; she said the money was her own; I took her to Bow-street, and she was committed; I produce the three shillings that the woman said were found at her breast.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Look at these three shillings? - A.(Looking at them.) They were in my possession when I went to bed that night; I did not put the mark on them; I had noticed the mark that was on them; I had picked out marked shillings and took a copy of the marks.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You should have said that before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Let me look at the paper; you say you wrote the marks down before you went to bed? - A. I did; the last three shillings are the last marked on the paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. This was Monday night that you put the marked shillings in your purse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Tuesday morning when you recovered them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a good deal more silver in your purse? - A. Yes, about 2 l.</p>
               <p>Q. This paper you wrote on Monday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all the rest you have sworn to day? - A. That is the copy that I took off on Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an exact copy of what you wrote on Monday night? - A. It is the exact copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on Monday night how could you anticipate these three shillings? - A. On Monday night I had put down twenty shillings; that is a copy of the shillings that I missed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is the copy of the marks that are on the three shillings that were missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That could not be the copy wrote on Monday night, for here are two plain shillings, one is marked with an M or W, which way you turn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the paper which you wrote on Monday night? - A. I have not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you keep the Bull Inn, Holborn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Barker first coming to your house on the 30th of October last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to you when he came? - A. He asked me if I knew Mr. Cannon, of Long Crandom, in Oxfordshire; I told him I did; he then asked me if he was not a large farmer, and a man of considerable property; I told him I knew him to be a man of considerable property, and a great farmer; he said he had a sister of Mr. Cannon's living with him; she had been taking some money out of the till; did I think that if I wrote to him he would come to town and settle the matter without prosecuting her; I told him I would write down to him, and I did not doubt but Mr. Cannon would come, but I could not answer whether he would make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has Mr. Prosecutor been at your house? - A. He has been there not less than ten times; on Wednesday, the 14th of November, and Friday, the 16th, he came to meet the coach, and asked if Mr. Cannon was not come; I told him, Mr. Cannon had not been in town; he appeared very much disappointed; I asked him if he had done any thing when he had been in town; he said no, they would not give him money enough.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say how much he wanted? - A. He said he had asked 200 l. in all; he said that his recognizance must be forfeited, and the officer must have 40 l. I told him I thought it was a good deal of money for my own part; Mr. Cannon might do as he pleased.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did he demand 200 l. or say he had lost 200 l? - A. He said he had lost a great deal of money at various times, and he did not know but she might have had it; he came on Friday, the 16th; we had two pints of wine together; I took the liberty of asking him closely about it; he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050048"/>of his own accord; I never sent for him, nor did any body else; Mr. Cannon was not in town; he came to enquire for Mr. Cannon; then he told me he had lost a great deal of money; his affairs were in a deranged state; he had been ill, and had been robbed, and if he could get a couple of hundreds it would stop a gap or two; this was his expression - he had some heavy bills to make up; I then quarrelled with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the 16th did he come again? - A. I cannot speak positively, perhaps in the course of a week he has been repeatedly; on Sunday, the 18th, I gathered from his own conversation that there had been an intimacy between him and the prisoner; I said, I understand you have been free with your maid, and if a man makes free with his maid, he must expect they will make free with him; he then said, if I have, that is no reason I should be robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Therefore, from that expression of his, you made the conclusion, that there had been an intimacy - there might or there might not? - A. I told him he had been the means of bringing the woman to seduction; from that time I would not speak to him; I desired him to walk out of the house; he after that came to my house, last Saturday night; he came in a quarter of an hour after Mr. Cannon did, and offered to make it up for 100 l. Mr. Cannon said he would not give him a shilling; there are other witnesses will corroborate that Mr. Cannon told me, that the prosecutor had followed him from the New Inn, in the Old Bailey, to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been intimate with Mr. Cannon? - A. Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Barker admit of any intimacy between the woman and him? - A. When I said, if a man makes free with his maid, he must expect she will make free with him; he said, well, if I have, that is no reason that I should be robbed; that is all that was expressed; I saw her after wards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever hear her say any thing in the presence of Barker, if it was in his presence you may tell us? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You keep a public-house at Thame, in Oxfordshire? - A. Yes, I am acquainted with Mr. Cannon; I have been up to town with Mr. Cannon two or three times upon this occasion; we came merely to settle it, and at each time I saw Mr. Barker; I received a letter from Mr. Furnehough, and I think twice out of the three times I saw Mr. Barker at Mr. Furnehough's; the first time I think was on Friday, the 23d of November; Mr. Barker brought a publican that lives in Drury-lane to the Bull Inn, Holborn; I and Mr. Cannon, Mr. Barker, and that gentleman, were all four in a room; Mr. Barker proposed that I should be arbitrator for Mr. Cannon and his friend for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the accomodation proposed by Barker or by Cannon? - A. Barker said to Mr. Cannon, let us leave the room, and let these men settle it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who first talked about settling it? - A. Barker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Barker ever mention any specific sum of money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave the room? - A. No, Mr. Cannon offered 80 l. I said, it is of no use for you to leave the room; I will not agree to any such money, and Barker said he would not take any such money; we all four left the room, and went into another; I went out a little while; they said, when I came back, that Barker offered to make it up for 200 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did Barker ever say any thing to you respecting his circumstances? - A. Yes, when we went to his house, he told me that he had been ill, and that he had been robbed; he was afraid that he must call his creditors together, and he could not say whether he could pay 5 s. 10 s. or 15 s. in the pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever said any thing to you at any other time? - A. He always seemed to be very anxious to get it settled.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did not the first proposal come from the woman's brother; give me a true answer? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you and her brother go on purpose to make some offer to stop the prosecution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first sum that the brother offered? - A. Eighty pounds, and Barker said he would not take any such money.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. I am a farmer; I live in Long Crandom, in Buckinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. That is where Mr. Cannon lives? - A. Yes, it is on the borders of Oxfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come up with Mr. Cannon, in consequence of Mr. Furnehough's letter? - A. Yes, I went with Mr. Cannon and Mr. Fowler to Mr. Barker's house; we came to settle this business of his sister's; when we first went in, Barker knew Cannon; he said; Mr. Cannon, come in, and sit down gentlemen; we did so; then he began relating this circumstance that happened; he said his housekeeper had robbed him of five shillings that were marked, and they were found on her, and she was committed to prison; then he said he really believed he had been robbed of 200 l. and he was so reduced in circumstances, that he thought he must call his creditors together to take all he had; then he began to talk of his servant's character, and an excellent one he gave her as ever I heard; that he had trusted her with the keys of his bureau, that they both slept in one room, and that if he prosecuted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050049"/>her he should never be happy; he pointed out there might be ways to settle it, but he must not be seen in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before Mr. Cannon had made any offer? - A. He made no offer of any thing, I was in the room at the time, I do not know that Mr. Cannon spoke, he sat crying; I asked him what way or how this could be settled; he said there was a way, but it must be kept a secret; then he asked me where we put up, I told him at the Bull Inn, in Holborn; he wished us to stop a few minutes, and he would go and speak to his attorney, he did not live far from there, he would be back in ten minutes; he went out, and came back much about the time he said he should be gone; he said his attorney did not chuse to come to the Bull Inn, in Holborn, for there were many catch-pole fellows there that catched at people's words, and his attorney was at a public-house near that place, and if we would go, he would go and shew us where he was; we went to that public-house, I do not know the sign, it was not far from his house, Barker went with us; when we got into the room, the attorney, if he was an attorney, said, Barker, you must leave the room; he left the room, and came in again; and after he came in again, nothing passed there, excepting having a glass of brandy and water, and we came away; this was on the 22d or 23d of November; when we came out of the public-house, Barker said, I will go part of the way with you, I will shew you the Bull Inn; he went all the way, we did not want him; when we got to the Bull Inn we ordered a supper, and one of us, I believe, asked him to supper; he said he would go home, and then return; he came to supper, I did not see any body with him till after supper; after supper, they all went out of the room, and where they were gone to I could not tell; after a time, I went to see where they were, I found they were in another room; I was going into the room, and Barker said, I must beg you to stop out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there? - A. Barker, Fowler, and Cannon, and another person, a stranger to me; Cannon said, I will leave it to you and Barker to settle it; Barker and I went out into the yard, he made proposals that if I would give two hundred pounds he would never appear against her; and when the Sessions came on, he would come down there and stop till the Sessions were over; I told him I would not agree to such sort of terms at all, and I did not offer him a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen him since? - A. He has been with Mr. Cannon every day since; I have seen him every day, and I have heard him talk to Mr. Cannon about settling it.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen him come to the Bull? - A. About twice; he came on Saturday night. Mr. Cannon was there, I was with him a little while; I was sometimes in the room with them, and sometimes out; then I heard Mr. Barker say, I will not hurt your sister, but then I did not hear the sum; Mr. Cannon said, I will not give you one farthing, she shall come and take her chance at the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Dodwell, have not you known Mrs. Wharton? - A. I have not known much of her of late years, she was bred and born in our place.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you knew her, what sort of a character had she? - A. An extraordinary character.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You came to town for the very purpose of settling it with Mr. Cannon? - A. No; he asked me to come with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he was come to settle the prosecution? - A. We said nothing about settling till Mr. Barker did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew what you went to Mr. Barker's for? - A. We went to ask Mr. Barker merely what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no idea you were going to settle it? - A. Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Fowler had been with you, had not he? - A. He went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear his evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to persist that you had not any idea about settling it? - A. I did not apprehend any idea of settling it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had come up with Fowler and with Cannon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Barker.) Did you call on Furnehough, and give him directions to write to Cannon, to come up and settle this prosecution? - A. I went by the desire of the prisoner at the bar, she desired me to go to Mr. Furnehough, that he would let her brother know what situation she was in, and get him to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the first proposal come from you, or from the prisoner's relations? - A. I never made any offer at all, they made it first; they never had a letter from me on the business.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear positively, that you never made any proposal to them? - A. Never; Mr. Furnehough and this gentleman, as a witness, has sworn that I followed them home; Mr. Cannon and Mr. Fowler was here till near nine o'clock, till after the three prisoners were tried for the five hundred pounds; Mr. Cannon was here, and gave the old gentleman a character; I went to the Bunch of Grapes, I asked a lame man that was in the taproom to put my beer to warm; I was here till nine o'clock, and my servant will prove that I was at home by half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Furnehough.) What time did the prosecutor come to your house? - A. I left the Court at the time Mr. Cook was being tried; I went home before the rest of the parties.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050050"/>Q. What time did you see them at your house? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prosecutor come to your house? - A. I cannot exactly say, it was after I returned home from here.</p>
               <p>Court. It must be near nine.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was here till nine; here is my own servant will prove that I was at home at half past nine.</p>

             sworn. - The two shillings were both marked, I lost them on Sunday night, or Monday morning, I saw them about seven or eight o'clock; I took the money out of my pocket, and set down the marks upon them; I went to bed between nine and ten o'clock, I had put them in a purse in my breeches-pocket; when I got up, I searched my purse, I found three shillings were gone, there were only two shillings found upon her, and a sixpence, when she was searched, this was on the 29th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever ask two hundred pounds to make this up? - A. I never did make any demand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, desire Mr. Furnehough to write to Mr. Cannon to come up and settle this business? - A. I delivered the message to him as the prisoner at the bar desired me; to tell him the situation of the prisoner, and to desire him to come up.</p>

               <p>Q. And whether you said to him, that your circumstances were embarrassed, and that two hundred pounds, or any considerable sum, would be of great use to you? - A. I said, I had lost money to the amount of two hundred pounds, and which way I should recover myself I did not know, and I hoped I should make friends; I never demanded two hundred pounds of any one, nor a single halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, go to the New Inn, or the Bull, on Saturday night? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You deny being at the Bull and at the New Inn on Saturday? - A. I was at the Bunch of Grapes, and drank a pint of beer, and I heard the clock strike nine; I was not near the New-Inn, nor the Bull.</p>
               <p>Q. As your housekeeper had the keys of your bureau, she might have been in the habit of going there, or to your breeches, to get money to buy something in for the house? - A. She never had the keys of my bureau but when I was ill, she had them once.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I went by the desire of the prosecutor and searched the prisoner, I found on her two shillings and sixpence, I produce the money and the purse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You found this money in her pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Look at this money? - A. They are my property, I put them in my purse; and on the same paper I put them down. I produced the original at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is not here, that I should like to have seen; I don't like your copies.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Furnehough.) Q. Did the prosecutor desire you to write a letter to the prisoner's brother? - A. He did; he asked me first whether I thought Mr. Cannon would come forward and settle the business; and he asked me whether he was a man of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you, whether it was at his desire that you wrote to Mr. Cannon to come up? - A. It was; I told him that Mr. Barker had been with me; I represented the case, that Mr. Barker said he would settle it without bringing it into Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Barker said so to you? - A. Yes; I told Mr. Barker I wondered he had not called on me before she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times, altogether, has he been at your house? - A. Ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any time heard him say how much he asked? - A. Two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house last Saturday night? - A. Yes; and, upon my oath, I saw him on Saturday at the New Inn, in the coffee-room, I was with him at least an hour there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the New Inn from the Bunch of Grapes? - A. Yes; the coffee-room is down the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Fowler.) Did you see Mr. Barker at the New Inn on Saturday? - A. I do not know that I did; I saw him at the Bull in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dodwell.) Did you see Mr. Barker at the New Inn on Saturday? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with Mr. Furnehough and Mr. Cannon? - A. Yes; and I saw Barker at the Bull in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mary Jeffrey.) Did you tell her that bundle, or any bundle was for her? - A. I did not tell her any thing about the bundle.</p>

               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) What is the worth of that bundle - A. About 16 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner a family? - A. Her husband has left her; she has two children in Wandsworth workhouse.</p>

He was rather fresh; when I met with him first the parish watchman was with me, and he offered us something to drink; he turned his money from one hand to another; we counted it, 19 s. 6 d. I led him home to my own door; I am very positive he did not lose his money by the way; I lighted him up stairs, and saw him into bed; when I called him up in the morning, between six and seven o'clock, he told me he had lost his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner gone? - A. Yes; the prisoner came in the afternoon of the 10th; I was in bed; I got up when I heard he was there; he said he had none of the man's money; I went with him to the Office; he still persisted in having none of the man's money; I saw him searched; there were 26 s. and odd money found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a seven-shilling piece, a dollar, and half-crown, found upon the prisoner? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were no marks on those pieces? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Officer of Shadwell: On Saturday, the 10th of November, I took the prisoner into custody to the Office; I asked him at the Office if he had any money about him; he said, no, only a few halfpence; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket, under a Dantzick waistcoat, I found three halfpence and a penny piece in copper; in his breeches pocket I found, wrapped up in a piece of paper, one seven-shilling piece, a dollar, and two shillings; I searched farther, and found in a small red pocket-book a discharge and a pension-ticket, 3 s. in silver, and two sixpences, in a parcel; I asked him how he came by them; he said he was a lumper, and he got them all from Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Scott lives by you? - A. Yes, I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The man that I lodge with is a watchman; after I had a drink of beer, I went home and went to bed, and after I was in bed he brought up this captain's mate of a West Indiaman, and put him into bed along with the sailor; there was neither lock nor key on the door; the captain's mate, the sailor, and likewise a waggoner, slept together; when I awoke, I wanted to make water; I felt about my bed, and there was no chamber-pot there; so I went to the sailor's bed, and felt all about for it; who's that? said the sailor; I said, it is Peter; he said, what do you want? I said, I want to make water; after that, I returned to my bed again; in a little while after that the sailor came out of his bed, Peter, said he, the captain's mate has p - d all over me, I will thank you to let me lay alongside of you till morning, and in the morning, when I awoke, the sailor was gone away from me; the time came for me to go to work on board the ship; I got up, and told my landlady she was much to blame to take a strange man in liquor into her house; I went on board my own ship, and on Saturday I was taken up for the robbery; the mistress of the house said, you had better own to the robbery; I said, I cannot own to it, I did not do it; they took me to the Justice and overhauled me; they took my discharge from a man of war and my pension-ticket; my friends are all on board his Majesty's ships of war up the Mediterranean.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that Mrs. Tobey gave you, did you go after the prisoner? - A. I did; I found him at the Six Bells, on Thursday the 15th of November, in the afternoon; he had a large bundle with him, there were fifteen handkerchiefs altogether, ten of them were muslin handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wet at the time? - A. No; I told him that I suspected that he had got that with him that was not his own; he told me no, they were his sister's, and she lived at Hampton-wick; I took him to the office, the Justice's clerk and Mr. Julian examined him; the next morning, as the coach was coming to the door to take him to Bow-street, he burst out a crying, and asked me to let him go to Mr. Julian; I took him there, at his request, he burst out again crying, and he said, he had taken them off his master's hedge, and he hoped Mr. Julian would interfere and get him on board a man of war; when we came to Bow-street, the young woman swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix.) Look at that bundle, and tell us whether you find the ten neck-handkerchiefs? - A. Yes; they are all mine.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are a surgeon? - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar came as a servant to my house about a quarter past seven in the evening; I went out a little after, and visited a child that was sick; I returned in about three quarters of an hour, my wife told me the girl was gone, and had robbed the house; about ten o'clock she returned from the baker's with a loaf; I asked her the reason she stopped so long, and I told her I supposed she had forgot her pattens; no, says she, I have returned with the loaf, and the change of the half guinea; I asked her if she had brought the linen she had taken out of the kitchen; she said, she had not, nor did not take it, nor did she see any; I asked her the reason of her being gone so long, and also where she had taken her own box, as she had taken her own box with her; she told me she smelt something disagreeable on the top of the stairs, and she always conceived that she heard me in the back kitchen cutting up dead people, that was the reason of her going away; I told her it she did not tell me where the linen was, I should certainly send her to the watch-house; she said, she did not take it, I might do as I pleased; I then called the watchman, and took her to the watch-house immediately; the constable of the night took her into a little apartment, and searched her; he found none of my property on her, but found ten duplicates at another place; she gave the watchman the key of her box, and told him where she lived, and she had left her box at her lodgings, No. 30, Monmouth-street; there the watchman searched her box, and found none of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the things? - A. Something about two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Roberts.) What do you value the linen at? - A. Above two pounds.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. At half past seven in the evening I went to this place, I took with me a small box; there was a smell in the place, I thought it was the smell of human flesh, and they were chopping something up; I took up my band-box, and was going to leave the place; Mrs. Roberts rung the bell, she told me to go and get a quartern loaf and some cheese; I went home to my lodgings with my band-box, and I went back to my mistress with the loaf and the change; I could not get the cheese, it was too late; Mr. Roberts abused me when I came back, he said I had taken his linen; I told him I had not, I had never untied my bandbox at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

They did; I asked Gunn if he knew any thing of the China man; he said yes; I asked him if he had been to his house with a girl; he also replied, yes; I further asked him if he knew any thing of the dollars; he said, the girl must have taken them; I then told Gunn, you had better return this poor man his money; he replied that he was a poor man, and how could he afford to do it; he then asked me what the amount of them would be; Erpune said he had lost nineteen; I had a pen in my hand about to cast them up, when Gunn said, mind they are not 5 s. dollars, they only pass for 4 s. 2 d.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I am an officer of Shadwell: On the evening of the 1st of November, I was sent for to take the prisoner Gunn into custody, about half past nine in the evening; I then left him in charge with Mr. Gole, in Mr. Anthony's parlour, and went instantly to search his house; I first searched his person, and then his house, but found nothing; I then returned to Gunn, and asked him where the dollars were that the China man had lost; he told me he did not know, but he believed the girl had them, but that he would make up the loss, and begged of me not to take him into custody; I told him I could make no bargains with him of that kind, that I was under the necessity of taking him into custody; he several times said he was innocent, in his way to the Office, but he would still make up the loss, if I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you find the prisoner Alsey? - A. Several days, eight or ten; I traced her to Spital-fields, and from there to Lambeth; I found her at a public-house, under a false character, on Tower-hill; I told her I took her for robbing a China man of dollars; she denied it; I took her into custody, I searched her, and found nothing upon her; as I was taking her to the Office, she said it was hard she should suffer for Mrs. Gunn; about ten minutes before I took her to the Magistrate, which was the next morning, I had her in custody all night at a lock-up house near the Office, she sent for me, and told me she wished to tell the truth; I neither used promise nor threat, but desired her to be sure to stick to the truth; I told her to be cautious, for what she told me I should repeat to the Magistrate; she then said she had taken sixteen of the dollars, and had taken no more; she said she had divided the sixteen dollars with Mrs. Gunn; I then brought her before the Magistrate, and she said the same before the Magistrate; it was not taken in writing.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, Alsey, put in a written defence, which was read as follows:)</p>
               <p>"My Lord and Gentlemen, I humbly address you in the hope you will humanely consider my statement as the truth. The person who is tried with me kept a common lodging-house for the reception of men and women; I went with the prosecutor, and he gave me a dollar and a sixpence; Mrs. Gunn stopped me in the way, and told me he had plenty of money, and advised me to go up and rob him; I, unfortunately for myself, followed her advice, and shared the dollars with her; they not being stamped, and not considered the current coin, I could not part with them for more than 4 s. 2 d. a piece; I went to service for the purpose of retrieving my character, from which place I was taken up; I humbly throw myself on your mercy, and hope by your clemency to alter my mispent life.</p>
               <p>Gunn's defence. I know nothing at all of it.</p>

Yes; on the 6th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, she came to my shop, and offered eight cases to sell; I asked her if they were her own property; she told me, no, they belonged to a watchmaker that was in distress, and wanted the money; seeing them in an unfinished state, I rather suspected they were not honestly come by; they were bent almost double; I looked at the mark, and I knew the maker of them; they were marked WB,

               <p>Q. Did you see any boy in the house? - A. Yes; there were several children in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any difficulty about the key? - A. Yes; the second time, when the prisoner was with us, we were led to the room by a key; the officer had the key, the prisoner was close by; the officer went to put the key in the key-hole, and the prisoner immediately seized hold of it, and after some struggle wrested it out of the officer's hand, and chucked it down stairs; it went down to the very bottom of the stairs; he called out to a boy to run away with it; the boy got the key, and did run; Bray run after him, and brought the key back again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You said something about a machine for splitting straw; I believe you had some difference with the prisoner - you thought he wanted to take a copy of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These boards were part of boxes which had contained straw, and sent from the country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not these boxes used for fire wood? - A. Parts of them are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Godsell, a carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever had any boxes from your house? - A. Only one; I gave it to him to alter, and he brought it back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go afterwards to his lodgings? - A. Yes, in Redcross-street, with a key for him to open the door, and to look at it; when we came there, his landlady insisted we should not search.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the second time? - A. Yes; the prisoner was sent for, and directly he came, he said we should not search, because there was no warrant; I insisted upon seeing his apartments; he shewed us up stairs; when I went to put the key in the key-hole, after a long struggle, he got the key out of my hand, and threw it down stairs, and called to a boy to run away with it; I caught him before he got out at the door, and then we took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the 11th of November he came to my house, I asked him to come in and stay, as it was a rainy day; in about half an hour I had occasion to go up stairs, and upon going up I saw the prisoner draw near the fire; when I came down stairs, he was gone; in about a quarter of an hour I found the watch missing that hung over the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure it was there when you went up stairs? - A. Not perfectly, but I believe it was there; my wife missed it, I left her in the room below stairs; when I went up into the room the prisoner was in; I was out all the morning, I noticed the watch hanging up when I came home, that was about an hour and a half before the prisoner came; I looked to see what o'clock it was, nobody had been there but me and my wife; when I missed the watch, I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050070"/>nearest public-house to see if I could see him; I went to two public-houses, but could not see him; I returned, and in about ten minutes, looking out, I saw the prisoner going by the house, he was reeling as if he was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear intoxicated when he came about the lodging? - A. I noticed he was in liquor when he sat down in the chair; I followed him, and in about a few minutes he got into a house, I went in after him.</p>
               <p>Q. A public-house? - A. No, a private house; I stopped at the bottom of the stairs, and called out Jim; he said, who wants me? and came down; I asked him if he would step over to my house, I wanted to speak to him; he came over to the room where the watch hung, and I asked him if he had seen any thing that hung upon that nail; he said, no; I asked him two or three times, he still refused; I stooped down, and heard the watch tick in his pocket, it was in the lining of his breeches a good way down; after I told him he was the man that had my watch, he asked me to go out backwards, he wanted to speak to me backwards; I told him no, the door should not be opened; he made a stoop, however, by the door, and slid the watch on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the action as well as you can? - A. He unbuttoned his coat, and slid it out under the skirt of his coat on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. He did this in a way perfectly open for you to see? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him unbutton his breeches? - A. Yes, he took the watch from the inside of his breeches; I took up the watch, a labouring man came in, I left him in his custody with my wife, and went myself for a constable, and gave him in charge. (Produces the watch.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in any business? - A. I work in the Wet Docks, I am foreman of the warehouse.</p>

Yes; on the 22d of November she came down to the Flying-horse, Lambeth-street; I called Nowlan, my brother officer, and we went in search of the prisoners in different places, and next door to the Black Swan, in Rose-lane, Spitalfields, we found them; we went up one pair of stairs, we knocked at the door some time before they would open it, it was bolted on the inside, I believe; when I opened it,

             was sitting on one side of the bed undressed, and Jackson at the foot of the bed with his clothes on, he rather flew in a passion, and wanted to know what business we had there; I told him we came to look for a two pound note, and a seven-shilling-piece; I looked about the bed and found

             immediately said, it was not his money, it was her's; we then searched the room, Jackson knocked the candle out once or twice, he was very obstinate, he said the house should not be searched, they had nothing there but their own; we then got a light, and searched the house again, but found nothing more, we then took him into custody; on the road going to the watch-house, I asked Jackson how he could be such a fool to get into a hobble to rob this poor sailor; he said, he was very sorry, and if he had not been drunk he would have had nothing to do with it; we then took him to the watch-house, and in the morning, when we took them out, he begged to go to his master, and he would get the money, and make it good to the sailor.</p>
               <p>Q. On the over-night, did he appear to you to be drunk? - A. Yes; Jackson was very much so, Rumbold was not; I asked Rumbold in the morning where she had changed the note; she said she could not tell; I then asked her what she had done with the remainder of the money; she said she could not tell, that was all she had; and she could not tell whether it was a one-pound note or a two-pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jackson. Q. Can you say, positively, I had any of that man's money? - A, No.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Had you seen this girl in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
