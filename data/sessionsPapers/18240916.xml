About the beginning of June the prisoners came into the shop, and wished to look at a silver watch at eight or ten guineas - they said they would point out one in the window, which they wished to see; they both spoke: one of them went out, and pointed to a watch: I said the price was twelve guineas, which they objected to, and wished to see some others. I shewed them a hunter, which they objected to. I rang the bell for Mr. Viner, who was at ten - he came out, and among others shewed them the twelve guinea watch, and agreed to let them have it for less, which they seemed satisfied with, and said they wanted it for a lame brother, who was going to India; they said they liked it, and as soon as they had consulted with their brother they would return and settle for it. Mr. Viner went into the parlour, and in about a quarter of an hour he returned to the shop, and sat down to work; and in a quarter of an hour after that he asked if I had moved a gold watch off the glass-case on the counter - I had not noticed one there myself: we looked about, but could not find it, and suspected the prisoners; they did not return to the shop; they were not there above ten minutes. Mr. Viner was about five minutes with them. Nobody came into the shop after they left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Has your master any partner - A. Yes, I believe he has, but I do not know whether he has anything to do with the shop in Bond-street; but is in partnership with him at another shop in Sweetings-alley. I am the only shopman. They came between six and seven o'clock: they both spoke, and I think both went out to the window. I am positive they are the men. I found them in custody five or six weeks after.</p>
               <p>MR. VINER corroborated the statement of the last witness; but it appeared that the property stolen was only part of a watch, being without dial or hands, and otherwise imperfect.</p>

On the 26th of June, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came into the shop to look at some seals which laid in the window - I took out about six: they wished to see some more, but bought none; they looked at other things, and at last chose a pair of ear-rings, upon which they paid 2 s. 6 d. as a deposit, and said they would call again in the evening, and pay for them; they came to 6 s. 6 d.: they said they were for their little sister, and they had not sufficient money about them, and had to go to Westminster. They were nearly half an hour in the shop; and just before they came in I had been winding up all the watches, and am positive that the watch in question hung upon a nail, within their reach, when they came in - it had come from a lady to be repaired a fortnight before, and she was to call for it that afternoon. I had would it up ten minutes before they came in, and missed it about an hour after they were gone; nobody but them had been in the shop; other watches were also within their reach. The shop is very small indeed. I am positive that they are the men - they had called at the shop three days before, and looked out 16 l. worth of goods, and what then occured induced me to notice them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had seen them before, had you any conversation with them relative to that matter - A. No. Mr. M'Phale had cautioned me about them, and I was afraid to say anything to them. The watch belonged to Mrs. Baring, of New Ormond-street: it has not been found. I saw them in custody five or six weeks after. I did not leave the shop till I missed the watch. They must have got behind me to take it. The shop is very small.</p>

            . On the 20th of July I went to No. 8, Lambeth-marsh, and asked for two young men named Morgan and Sessions - the woman said two men named Brown and Williams lived there, but they were out; we went on the second floor, and saw a girl. I went on the roof of the house, and saw Sessions concealing himself, and took him; he had only his trowsers on: he dressed, and in going down stairs he rushed from me, and ran away,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160004"/>and was stopped near Astley's Theatre. He had asked if I wanted him for broad, meaning cloth; I said Yes - he was secured. I took him into a public-house, and handcuffed him with difficulty, as he resisted. I took him to the coach stand, and found Foster there with Morgan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was on the roof attending to his pigeons - A. There were pigeons there.</p>
               <p>- FOSTER. I am an officer. I went with Lee. I took Morgan at a plumber's-shop in Stangate-street - his wife denied him to me: I said I wanted him for the old game; he said,</p>

She came to live in my house about the end of July, to take care of an insane lady who lodged with us: she was about three weeks with us, and left on Monday, the 16th of August; I did not know that she was going, but missed her about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I went to my drawers in the back room on the first floor, and found them empty; I had been to them the night before, and put a handkerchief in, and saw my child's silk pelisse there - but in the morning that and the handkerchief were gone: the drawer was not locked. I missed a white petticoat, a white muslin handkerchief, and a silk pelisse of my own, from the bottom drawer; also a silk gown, which she had put on the front room table the night before - my bonnet from a box in that room, and a bundle of clothes from a basket in the kitchen, which were safe the morning before: there was a white muslin dress in that bundle. On Thursday, the 19th, I met her in the custody of Cass, with this muslin dress on, also my bonnet, a handkerchief, and a collar, which I had worn on Sunday. I asked how she could treat me in that way, when she knew I worked hard for what I had, and she left me nothing to put on; she said she was ashamed to see me, for she knew she had done wrong - I asked her where my pelisse was: she made no answer. The constable said in her presence that she had given a pelisse to Mrs. Green, as security for some sheets; she made no reply. I went to the watch-house: he fetched the pelisse from Mrs. Green, and it was mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me leave to wear anything of yours - A. I lent her the dress she has on now, and a silk scarf, to appear decent in. I do not charge her with stealing them. I lent her none of these things.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with us last winter, and continued till the 18th of August, when in consequence of suspicion I went to my cupboard to unlock a small tea chest, and found it broken open - there had been 8 sovereigns and a half in one paper there; 5 of the sovereigns were gone. I had seen that paper safe two days before; I kept the key myself. The cupboard is in the room down stairs, where we sleep - the prisoner had his meals there. I missed five or six papers of silver from the same chest - I had eight papers, each containing 1 l. in silver. The prisoner had often seen me go to the chest and put money there. He went out that morning, and I expected him back, till Anderson gave me information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not your street door unlocked several nights - A. Yes, for him and other lodgers to come in, but I lay close to the door, and nobody could come in without my hearing them. They must move a table to get to the cupboard.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 18th of August I had occasion to look for the prisoner - I met him in Field-lane, and told him I wanted him respecting the robbery at Odell's; he said he knew nothing about it. I asked what he had done with the sovereigns he had been shewing at the Bull public-house at Highgate, that morning - he said he had no sovereigns, and knew nothing about any. I and Kirby took him into a public-house, and searched him after his making great resistance, and found in his pocket two sovereigns, three half-crowns, four shillings, and 6 1/4 d. in copper. I said he had better pull out what he had got, as I was determined to see; he then pulled out a sovereign, and one half-crown (I cannot say whether he produced any shillings;) he declared it was all he had - this was before I searched him; I then found one more sovereign and the silver I have mentioned. He said he would not be taken, nor give any account how he got the money. I was obliged to go to the office for assistance before I could take him along.</p>

On Wednesday, the 18th of August, about half-past 6 o'clock in the morning the prisoner came in and had a pint of beer, and paid me in halfpence - he called for half a pint of rum, and threw a sovereign on the table; I took it up stairs to my master for change; I came down, and gave him 19 s.: after that he had a pot of beer. I saw two more sovereigns in his hand. He was not very sober when he came in.</p>

All the lodgers were at home but him on Tuesday evening - I heard him come in in the night, but do not know the time. I go out in the morning with milk, and left my little girl in the room; he breakfasted with me that morning - I left him in the room and returned in about two minutes, then went out with my milk, and thought he was gone, as I did not see him after I left him in the room.</p>

I went out, returned between eight and nine, and said if she did not tell me who she gave it to I would have her taken up, and take her oath - she then said she had taken it, and was very sorry for it. I said nothing else to induce her to confess. My sister came in; she told her she had pawned it, and was sorry for it.</p>

            . On the 21st of July I was warehouse-man to Mr. Lloyd, stationer, No. 116, Fore-street. The prisoners came to the shop together between four and six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160008"/>o'clock, and brought some wrappers, which were put on the floor - I do not know who carried them; I asked if they were for sale; Farrow said, Yes if we would buy them - Griffiths was close by him: I did not hear him say anything. I said we were in the habit of buying such things. Mr. Lloyd came to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Be cautious what you are doing, and take the men's address" - I think they must have heard that. I asked their address; Farrow came to the counter, and said,</p>
               <p>"No. 1, Castle-court, Lawrence-lane." Mr. Lloyd sent me down to enquire after the address; I think they were gone then, but am not certain. Lloyd paid 15 s. 4 d. to one of them - he is not here. I did not see him pay it, but heard him say,</p>

               <p>"Here is 15 s. 4 d. in part payment." He desired me to go and give information to the prosecutors, which I did. I delivered the wrappers to Harrison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you leave 
               <persName id="t18240916-14-person195">Lloyd</persName>
             the day after this occured - A. A few days after. He buys rags by the pound, or by the lot. I saw him to day at his own house, and told him he ought to come here - he made no answer. I only heard part of his conversation with the prisoners. Lloyd has been in trouble several times himself, which is the reason that he told me to be cautious.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has Farrow been in your employ - A. Above ten years; I had a good opinion of him once. (Looking at the wrappers;) they are ours - here are thirty-seven of them; they come to us with goods, and are charged to us if we do not return them; I know them by the numbers which the manufacturers put on them. Some of these we have paid for; I know one in particular. I believe Lloyd was bound over to come here. Griffiths was about nine months with us.</p>

I saw him in the shop some time, for he changed the cotton. A gentleman stopped him.</p>

            . I was called up on Sunday morning, the 19th of July, about half-past four o'clock - I went to my own wash-house, which is near Davis's, and saw a young man getting over the yard of an opposite neighbour; I then went over, and saw the prisoner's feet under a gutter of Mr. Davis's. I asked him what he wanted - he said he was waiting for a young man who was gone up stairs. I called to Davis, but he did not hear - I went up to Davis, and the prisoner ran away. I afterwards went down, and saw the watchman, to whom I spoke about it. The prisoner was taken about five o'clock, by the watchman, who brought the pigeons and the bags.</p>

I was up stairs; this watch had been hanging over the mantle-piece in the parlour; I had seen it at twelve o'clock, and the prisoner came in about half-past twelve; my street door was partly open. I came down in consequence of hearing it shut - the prisoner asked me to lend him 1 s. for his mother; I said I had none to lend - he said, what should he do, for his mother was much distressed; he then went away, and I missed the watch before one o'clock - I have not seen it since; he was taken up the same evening, and denied the charge.</p>

On leaving town for France about the end of June I left these articles in a trunk, to be carried to my uncle's house. I returned on the 1st of August, and missed them - my writing desk had been broken open, which was in the box, containing the linen; that box had been locked when I went away, and the lock had not been injured. I saw the prisoner on the 2d of August; I suspected him, and enquired when the trunk had been brought to my uncle's house, and found it had not been brought for three weeks after I left it. When I saw him I told him I suspected he had robbed me; he said he had not done me any injury; I then delivered him into custody. I have seen the property since, and know it to be mine. There were other things in the box, which he did not take. I cannot tell exactly how many articles I saw, but I am sure they were all mine, they were worth 4 l. or 5 l. I accompanied the officers to Fair-street, where the prisoner was in service, and in the pocket of a coat which he said was his was found a crystal box, which is mine.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the male prisoner at Lord Hutchinson's, in Bulstrode-street. I went with the Colonel and the prisoner to his lodgings in Fair-street. On searching his coat which hung in the room I found this box, which was immediately claimed by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160011"/>Colonel - the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I found it on your table Colonel." I then questioned the people of the house, in the hearing of the prisoner, and they said they had seen this box in the hands of a woman, called, the cook, but they did not know her name. I then went to a place where the male prisoner said she lived, but that was not true. I afterwards went to North-street, Manchester-square, and found the female prisoner; I told her James was in custody, showed her the box, and said, I was come for the rest of the things - she hesitated for a moment, and then put her hand into her pocket, and gave me two combs, a necklace, a pair of silver buckles, and two seals - they were claimed by Colonel Hutchinson. I went down to the kitchen, and in her box I found six shirts, eleven handkerchiefs, a compass, two other boxes, a silver pen, and a knife, which were claimed by Colonel Hutchinson. Most of the linen is marked H. H. H.; she said,</p>
               <p>"All these James brought to me this morning, and has brought me into this trouble."</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner FLATTERY. Some of this property is not Colonel Hutchinson's; some of it is my own - is this shirt the Colonel's? -</p>
               <p>COLONEL HUTCHINSON. Yes, it is to the best of my belief; there is the remains of H. on it.</p>
               <p>FLATTERY'S Defence. I lived with the Colonel about a month, and was discharged in consequence of his going to France - he took all his things except a portmanteau and a little writing case. He said,</p>
               <p>"James, will you take this writing case to my Lord's," and I did so - the portmanteau was left in his bed-room; I suppose it was locked. There was afterwards some dispute about the rent, and I said it was right that the portmanteau should be fetched away - there were several other persons in the house. One night when I came home I found a bundle of these things in a corner - I tied them up in a handkerchief, but I did not like to say anything about it; it passed on for two months - I never opened the bundle, and did not know what was in it.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT'S Defence. These things were brought to me about eleven o'clock in the morning of the day I was taken, by James - he said they were foul clothes. I had called on the female servant who lived in the house where James lived, and saw this little box, and she asked me if I would have it - I said I would not.</p>
               <p>COLONEL HUTCHINSON re-examined. I am certain the writing-desk was locked in the portmanteau, and that all the articles were in it when I left. There were some rings and money in the writing-desk.</p>

               <p>GEORGE ARNOLD. I am twelve years old. I had two pairs of drawers to carry for my uncle; they were under my arm, in paper. About half-past ten o'clock, just by Bloomsbury steps a man snatched them from me - I could not see who he was. I turned round, no one was near me, but we saw a man running, and pursued him - I did not lose sight of him till he was stopped by the watchman; it was the prisoner: he had not got them - they were picked up about twenty yards from where he was stopped. He did not say anything; I did not charge him with it. There did not appear to be any other person running in company with him when we were calling out Stop thief.</p>

I saw the prisoner, who appeared to be running from the cry, and several persons were pursuing him - I saw him stopped by the watchman, and went with him to the watch-house; I saw him throw the parcel down close at my feet - I picked it up.

I saw a light in the prosecutor's coach-house about a quarter past ten o'clock: I had no suspicion, but went on towards it, till I came about twenty yards from the door; the light then disappeared, and as I went on, about half way further, two men rushed out at the coach-house door - I sang out, and then ran; the first man ran to the wall, and got over - the prisoner was getting over, and I took him; he said nothing: he had knocked his hat off in coming under the bar which fastens the doors - the harness was lying in the door way. Mr. Armstrong came up, and the prisoner asked him for his hat; Mr. Armstrong said,</p>

               <p>"You are a pretty fellow;" but I believe he gave no answer. As we were going to the watch-house he put his hand into his pocket, and said he was going to get his handkerchief to wipe his face, and with the handkerchief he drew out some skeleton keys; and at the watch-house a phosphorus bottle was found on him.</p>

I opened the passage door, and saw the prisoner with them in her apron; she dropped them, and ran away - I went to the street door, and called to my man, who was at work opposite, to stop her; he pursued, and took her. I am sure she is the person who dropped them. The parlour door is always open, but there is a lobby or passage which is kept locked - hearing the street open caused me to run up stairs from the kitchen.</p>

            . I live in Plummer's-court, Holborn. I saw the two prisoners and two others going towards the prosecutor, who was sitting on a step in Holborn; they appeared all in company; I had seen him before they came up to him: he had his hat on, and was asleep, and seemed intoxicated; there was no one with him; I saw Lesley take the hat off his head, and walk away with it; the other three walked away with him. I followed them to see if I could find a constable to take them up. I do not know what became of the hat, for they were not taken till half-past nine o'clock at night; when Lesley was taken he said voluntarily that Hobbs had get the hat, and he lived in a house in Ormond-yard; it was found there: we went and found Hobbs in bed - the hat was at Hobbs's sister's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do when you first saw Lesley at his house - A. I laid hold of him, and told him what I took him for; he denied it, but afterwards at the watch-house told where it was; he said it publicly and voluntarily; I say that upon my oath. The prisoners were not walking arm-in-arm. I was on the same side of the way, and about sixty or seventy yards from the place; it was very wet, and but few persons passing. I followed them up Kingsgate-street; they walked quietly away. The hat was not found in the house where Hobbs was.</p>

I was just gone up to the room with his sister; Hobbs came up, and put the hat down, and went out - I did not notice whether he had a hat on or not. I lodge in Ormond-yard, but not in that house.

I said he might if he liked - he did so, and I went into a house at the corner of New-street, Brompton, and left my basket at the door with the 5 s. in it - he was with it. I did not miss the halfpence till about half an hour afterwards when I looked for them to pay away; he denied having them. I said there had been no person at the basket but him and me, and I would have him searched - he then ran away.

            . I am a watchman. On the 27th of July I saw four men in Mr. Austin's field, each man had got a load of lead on his shoulder. I came up and spoke to them - they threw down the lead and ran away - the prisoner is one of them. I took him in ten or twelve minutes. I took up the lead first. I lost sight of him while I secured the lead, but I found him again in a little market garden about one hundred yards off - they were all four in the garden and ran away. I pursued them, and the prisoner finding I came up with him jumped over a wall and got into a ditch, I jumped after him and secured him. I went with Jefferys to the house and tried the lead - it fitted exactly; there was all of it but a small piece in the middle of the gutter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. This was about what time - A. About three o'clock in the morning - it was quite light enough for any body see to a face one hundred yards off; it had rained, but it was then quite fine. When he threw down the lead I was not more than twenty yards from him. I looked at them all at once. I do not know whether I should know either of the others.</p>

            . I am night constable of Mile-end. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about five o'clock in the morning; there were some marks of clay on his jacket which corresponded with the marks on the lead - it appeared to have been thrown into some ditch. I went to the house, and compared the lead there; two pieces fitted every nail hole exactly - his clothes appeared as if rubbed by carrying lead; the morning was light enough to distinguish a person two or three hundred yards off.</p>

I asked him where he came from; he said from his aunt's at Winchmore-hill, and was going to his mother. I took him to the night constable, and gave the bundle to him - the counterpane was in it quite wet; he said it had fallen into a ditch, and that his aunt's name was Atkins. I looked at the initials, and they did not correspond.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 27th of July, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner coining from the back premises, about thirty yards from Mr. Selby's, with a basket, a bundle, and a blue cloth cap in his hand; I asked what he had been doing there: he said he saw the cap over there, and went to pick it up. I said,</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you have picked up something else" - he said he had not, and that he came from Clapton: I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got in this basket;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you" - I said,</p>
               <p>"I insist upon knowing;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Where is your authority, you shall not see without." I put my hand to the bundle, and we had a fall; I let him get up, and we then had another fall; he then

             a clasp knife, and said with an oath that he would be my butcher; he ran at me with it, to cut or stab me: I saw a man of the name of

About six o'clock on the 10th of August the prisoner came in, and bought one yard of printed cotton, for which she paid me - from her manner I judged she had got something: I put on my hat, and followed her out. As she passed the window I saw four or five more, about her age, ready to take anything of her. I brought her back, and she fell on her knees, and begged forgiveness; this property was found on her.</p>

On Sunday night, the 23d of August, I let down a fare on the Surry side of Westminster-bridge - I was a little intoxicated: as I returned I met a person who looked like a groom, and he offered me 6 d. to take him as far as I went. We had something to drink at a house in Long-acre. I think I had about 24 s. or 25 s. in my pocket. On the Monday morning I saw the prisoner at my house in Little Britain; he came about nine o'clock, and said he was one of the persons who assisted me in getting into the coach the night before, and that he was accused of having taking some money from my pocket; that he was innocent - but if it came before a Magistrate, as he was afraid it would, for he was spited by the other parties, it would be his ruin - but I could serve him very much if I would say I put the money on the seat of the coach. I told him I could not say what I had done with it.</p>

            . On Monday morning, 24th August, about two o'clock, I was on duty in Broad-street, St. Giles, I heard a rattle sprung - I went to the place, and found several watchman and the prisoner at the bar, and another witness; they all stood round Vane: I enquired into the case, and the people said he had fallen from the box of the coach; I told them to take him to the workhouse doctor; I then lifted him up, and he seemed to talk; the waterman said he knew the man - we then took him to the coach, and I said put down his feet, and somebody get in the coach with him. The prisoner went in the coach and assisted in getting him in, there was a good light from the gas lamp; I stood with one foot on the step of the coach, and saw the prisoner put his hand into the waistcoat or breeches pocket of the prosecutor, and take it out again, and heard some silver larger than shillings, chink, I said</p>
               <p>"D - n you, what are you about," I then took the watchman's lantern got in, and took the money off the seat of the coach, and said,</p>
               <p>"See what my own fellow-servant has been doing."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What situation is the prisoner in - A. He is a supernumerary patrol, and has been so about one year and nine months - I did not swear at the Police Office that his hand was in his waistcoat pocket; I said it was his waistcoat or breeches pocket; he had the man's body in his arms when he was helping him into the coach; there was quite light enough to see what he did; the prosecutors breeches were not loose, but I cannot tell whether the pockets were open or not - the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, but the night patrol did not take him in charge, but told us to go on our duty, and to appear the next morning at the office. He attended voluntarily at Marlborough-street; and said</p>
               <p>"I was mistaken, for the money fell out of his pockets in getting him into the coach" - this happened about two o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 23d of July, I was in St. Giles's; I went to the coach, and saw the prisoner there among the rest; I heard Price say as he was standing on the coach step,</p>
               <p>"What are you at," Price then got into the coach, and brought out five half-crowns, which he said he had taken from under where the prisoner had sat, on the seat of the coach.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160017"/>when Price first got in, he said</p>
               <p>"Here is money he has been robbing the man of," and he brought it out. Peperow said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Peperow say it had fallen out of his pocket - A. No, he said he knew nothing about it. I am a patrol, and have been so for three years; I never had a word with the prisoner in my life - he got into the coach first, and then helped to get the man in; I believe the man's feet went in first.</p>

            . I am the beadle. On the morning of the robbery, Price said he had a curious charge against his brother patrol; I said</p>
               <p>"This charge shall not be overlooked" I sent them about their business, and went to the coach, and saw a watch ribbon, I said</p>
               <p>"We will have the man out and properly searched" - I then found that his watch was safe, and in one of his pockets 9 s. 1 3/4 d., which I have here; his pockets were both buttoned when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When you looked at the man's pockets were they buttoned - A. I believe they were - I believe Price and the prisoner had been on good terms.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK to VANE. Q. Do you judge of what you had in your pocket, by what you took out in the morning, and what you took in the day - A. Yes; but I do not know how much I spent with the man to whom I gave the ride; I might have drank some more afterwards - my box coat was taken from the box while I was drinking with that man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I merely state that I requested Mr. Rowe to search me at the watch-house, which he refused to do; I was then called back and searched, and 3 s. 6 d. was found on me, that was all.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you ever say that you had had a quarrel with the prisoner - A. No. I never stated that I knew the different watchmen had a quarrel with him, and that they would injure him if they could, nor any thing at all like it.</p>
               <p>J. GOVEY. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Wild-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields; I have known the prisoner seven years, and never heard any thing against him - I have heard Suttie say more than once or twice, that the prisoner was naturally hated by the patrols, by making himself too officious - he said so about two months ago.</p>

He was a perfect stranger. The area gate was locked, but the area door open - he must have jumped over the railings. I took him to Marlborough-street. The butter boats are worth 45 s. or 50 s., and the spoons 45 s. also. My master's initials are on them.</p>

One Sunday morning, between three and four o'clock, I was in bed in the front garret, and heard my brother's voice down stairs, crying murder - I jumped out of bed, and ran down stairs, and in the passage I saw Hussey and his wife striking my brother - the prisoner, on seeing me, up with his fist, and knocked me down; Gannon, who was there, brought my brother up stairs, in less than two minutes, into the front garret - I followed him up, and on getting him into the room bolted the door - my brother was sitting on the bed, undressing, when I went in: I told him to take off his clothes, and go to bed, and we would leave the house as soon as the night was over. About ten minutes after I got into the room Hussey gave a blow with a hammer at the door, which opened, and he struck my brother with it on the left side of his head, over his eye, and knocked him down; he was on the bed, nearest to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. After he entered the room did anything happen before he struck him - A. No, my brother said nothing to him, nor did anything; he only kneeled down, and was bleeding. The prisoner then came and made a third blow at me - I grasped at the hammer to prevent the blow: we were struggling in the room for ten minutes, and then both got into the passage, struggling for the hammer. The watchman was on the landing place. Hussey pushed me, and knocked me down, put his knee on my chest, and kicked me - he then let go of the hammer. When I saw my brother bleeding I was senseless, and do not know whether I gave Hussey in charge or not. I took the hammer into the street, and whether I gave it to the watchman or not I do not know. Hussey gave charge of me - I went to the watch-house. I had seen the hammer before; it was kept in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160018"/>down hearing your brother crying murder, how many others were crying out also - A. None. Gannon, M'Grath, and one Gallaghan were present, also Hussey and his wife - I do not know who else; there were six in all I think. I saw the watchman coming in when I went up stairs. It was ten minutes before Hussey came up to my room. My brother died on the Tuesday morning, about four o'clock. When my brother heard the blow at the room door he stood up - he was taking off his shoes; he had only taken his jacket off: he sat on the bed, and began undressing directly we took him up stairs; he had nothing in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an iron rod in the room - A. I do not know; I never saw it. I was in the Compter all Sunday; Hussey was at liberty. I saw no marks, or blood upon Hussey. I did not beat him - if there was any blood on him it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you one question, and tell you I have a witness to call - have you ever said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know that Hussey did strike my brother first; but I will swear it, for I think it no harm to be revenged on him" - A. No, nor anything like it to any person. I know Conway, but said nothing of the kind to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said that if Hussey's friends would give you 10 l., you would go home, or to harvest, till this trial was over - A. No; I never said so to Green, nor that as they would do nothing I would do all I could against him, and give Green 2 l. to swear against him. I never spoke to him.</p>

             broke down under my arm, and went down - he wanted to go down again. I took Michael up to his room, but could not get in there, so I took him up to his brother's bed-room, and locked the door. One Galaghan who slept in the room was there also M'Grath - they were not in bed. I asked Michael to go to bed; he was very much intoxicated, and wanted to go down again, and said he would not go to sleep till he could be revenged on Hussey.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind what you say, remember you have given an account of this before which is in writing. - A. I will mind; his brother came up, I knew is voice, and let him in, he locked the door. Catherine, the servant, came up after that, and told us all to go bed, for the watchman had entered the house, and if we did not, he would take us into custody; I went to bed then without opening the door to her.

               <p>Q. Did Hussey say any thing when he kicked the deceased - A. He said there never was a man reared from his father that he would not serve in the same way. M'Grath (who is now in the hospital,) took the deceased into Mrs. Turvey's room, she attended to him; he was in a very bad state indeed, and said he should never get over it; the room was stained with blood; I observed a cut on his temple - I left the house directly.</p>

Between ten and eleven I think - the two Delaneys and a few more of the lodgers were with us; I went to bed in about an hour; I suppose they continued there four hours after. When I came down, Mrs. Hussey begged of me to take the deceased up stairs, that there might be no more quarrelling, he was very violent, and so were every one of them; they were all in a great passion.

             was as much inclined to fight as any of them, but he came up of his own accord afterward. I don't think one of them was sober. The deceased passion did not cool at all, when he got up stairs, and Hussey's passion seemed to continue. I saw an iron curtain rod in the room; I saw it in the deceased hand; he was doing nothing with it. I was sober when I first went down - Hussey was bleeding in the mouth.

               <p>ALEXANDER M'CROMBIE. I am a watchman. I was on duty on Saturday night in June, in New-street; my attention was called to the prisoner's house by a woman who lives there. I went, and saw three or four men, one on the top of the other on the passage floor. I endeavoured to separate them as well as I could; the landlord Hussey gave charge of one man, whom I took to the watch-house; Hussey accompanied me there; we returned to the house, the constable of the night and one or two watchmen came to my assistance. Hussey then came out of a little room with a hammer in his hand and went up stairs - we followed him up, and the first room he came to he burst open with the hammer; he looked in and said nothing, but went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160019"/>up to a room on the second floor, and burst that open, looked in, came out, and went up to the third floor, burst the door open with the hammer, and went in, but did not stop any time, and I did not go in (I said</p>
               <p>"Do not break the doors open, you should not do that;" he said the house is mine, and I can do as I please with it; this was while he was breaking the second door) he came out, and the deceased's brother and him were struggling, and fell down on the landing-place; we separated them, and took both down.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you know anything of what had happened in the room - A. No; we took them to the watch-house, and were going to take them to the compter, they wanted some clothes; I returned to the house, went up to the same room, and found a quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You and the other watchmen followed him up - A. Yes, close behind, he knew we were following him. I did not observe his mouth and face.</p>

               <p>MR. R. A. STAFFORD. I was house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on Sunday the 15th of June, 1823, about five o'clock in the morning, when he was brought in. I found his scull fractured on the left side - it was about an inch long and one deep - he was sensible; he died on Tuesday morning. His death was occasioned by inflammation of the brain caused by the fracture; that could be produced by this hammer. I think from the external appearance of the wound that the sharp edge of the hammer had done it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Might not the wound be occasioned by falling against the foot of a bedstead - A. I think not. I do not think that the force of falling would do it; the inflammation would certainly be increased by intoxication.</p>

On the 2d of August, about 9 o'clock at night, I was in the lane and heard a cry of murder, and saw the prisoner abusing Mrs. Shanks, who lived with the deceased as his wife - she was treating her violently, and after that she crossed to the opposite side. Simkin came out of his own door, and asked her if she had struck his wife; she said she had, and would serve him the same, and gave him a blow, which did not appear to me to be of any consequence - he had not touched her. He was very much in liquor and fell immediately he was struck; a mob came round and picked him up, and I saw no more - he was taken in doors. She was sober - she had thrown Mrs. Shanks on the ground.</p>

            . I lived with Simkin, and had a family by him. On the 2d of August, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I had some words with the prisoner about our children; Simkin was sitting in his room, and was a little intoxicated. The prisoner began the quarrel - there was a cry of murder, which brought Simkin down to the door. Harris was beating me; I was down, a man took me up and supported me; Simkin said</p>
               <p>"Don't kill the woman quite," and immediately the prisoner seized him by the collar, and gave him a push as he was coming to my help. She pushed him in the stomach, and said she would do the same to him if he came to my assistance. I did not see that it hurt him. I was taken up stairs, and saw him soon after in his own room: he went out, came home, and was in bed with me by ten o'clock, and next morning, when he awoke, he complained of a pain in his stomach. I got him some warm gin and water, which he drank. Mr. Jenkins, the doctor, saw him. He was ruptured, and had a gravel complaint; he died about half-past eight o'clock on Wednesday morning. I do not think the blow the prisoner gave him could have hurt him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Rosemary-lane. On Tuesday, the 3d of August, about the middle of the day, I saw the deceased, he was labouring under an inflammation of the bowels, and died on Wednesday morning. He appeared to me on Tuesday to have been drinking the day before. I opened his body with Mr. Canstall. The first morbid appearance was an inflammation in the intestines, called the choler; upon opening which, we found about three pints of liquid, the consequence of mortification: this may have been produced by intoxication, or violence; my opinion is, that external violence was used; it is impossible to say the cause of his death; he was the most healthy subject I ever saw, considering his age. If external violence produced his death, it would happen within the time at which it is said he received the injury. His lungs were perfectly sound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you form your opinion from your own observation, or from what you have heard - A. From observation; I don't allow him to have been a diseased subject. A cough could not produce such consequences. Falling on his stomach, in a state of intoxication, might produce it. I did not observe that he was ruptured; that would have no effect. If the inflammation was caused by violence, he would certainly complain of pain immediately. There was a blood-vessel broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard that he was ruptured, had a cough, and a complaint in the bladder; that he received a blow or push, not particularly violent, and fell, either from that or intoxication - Would a blow of that description produce the symptoms you saw - A. I think not. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160020"/>appears probable that external violence had been used, but such as described I consider not sufficient; and if there was no external violence, I consider that death must have arisen from internal causes. The liquor on his stomach appeared to me to be spirits.</p>

               <p>"Leave go my hand." I hallooed to know if any thing was the matter, and received no answer, but almost directly heard something smash in the water. I called the watchman; we proceeded to the spot, and found the prisoner leaning on the wall near the bridge; he said his wife was in the water, or words to that effect; we and some other persons searched in the water with a lantern, but not finding the body, we went with the prisoner to the watch-house; he was thirty or forty yards from where I was, when I heard the words which appeared to come from that place. I got up to him within a minute and a half or two minutes; he was leaning on the wall looking down to the water; it was too dark for him to endeavour to get her out; he appeared distressed, and was in liquor; he was secured directly. The woman spoke very loud, but not as if she was in distress or a passion. I heard it more than once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is this bridge - A. At the end of the Pimlico-road, over a creek. The wall is not part of the bridge, no body has any business there; a fence prevents people getting there. I hallooed to know if any thing was the matter; she gave no answer. There was quite sufficient time for her to answer before I heard the fall in the water.</p>

On the last day of July, I was drinking with the prisoner and his wife, at the King's Head public-house, at the foot of Chelsea water-works bridge, from half-past nine to eleven o'clock; while drinking he sung a song, all but the last verse, and that his wife sung, he seemed angry at that, and just tapped her over the cheek with the back of his hand, but did not hurt her, or seem in anger afterwards; we sat drinking till a quarter to twelve, when Rope came by, Marks asked him to go in and have half a pint of gin, and at last persuaded him to go in; his wife went in with them, but I went home. He is a labouring man, and lives at Westminster. He told me that he had a barge load of stones to look after in the cut, to see that no other barge ran against it, and knocked the stones into the water.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose service are you and the prisoner in. - A. My father, who works under Messrs. Johnson and Bruce; the bridge was in his way to the barge; he must get over the fence to get to it, and could go home that way; he is a good natured man.</p>

About a quarter to 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and his wife with Painter at the public-house door; they asked me to drink, which I refused three or four times; but he and his wife with a sort of push got me into the house, and called for half a pint of gin; we staid there a quarter of an hour; there was no words between them. I parted with them at the foot of the bridge, and saw them got about ten yards up the bridge; he shook hands with me, and waited for her while she did so; she then went after him and threw her arms round his neck; I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Catch hold of my hand," but saw nothing more; as I went home. He was employed at Mr. Johnson's; works under Painter, who employs barges; he told me he should be out all night; I saw the body before the inquest; it was his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Every thing was kind and affectionate between them. - A. Quite so - she offered to pay for the gin; he said</p>
               <p>"Do not break upon your house money, I will pay it."</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live at Bridge-wharf, Pimlico. On the night in question I was awoke between eleven and twelve o'clock, by a man calling out that his wife had fallen overboard; he seemed in great distress and anxiety. I went to my window, and saw several watchmen there - one of them expressed a disbelief of her being there, but the prisoner declared she had fallen in, and pointed out the place, and expressed a desire to get her out, or that they should get somebody to get her out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He expressed great anxiety to be allowed to assist in recovering her - A. Particularly so.</p>

            . I live at the foot of the wooden bridge, about forty yards from this spot. I heard the screams of a female; they appeared to come from where the prisoner was. I got up, and saw him in charge of the watchman. I did not hear a man's voice; I heard the the screams three times, close one after another. I heard nothing fall into the water.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Elizabeth-street about half-past twelve o'clock, and heard a dreadful shrieking and crying - I could not discern what it was, and while I was listening a rattle sprung - I immediately ran to the spot, and saw the prisoner in custody; I held my lantern over the wall, but could see nothing moving; I asked the prisoner if it was his wife; he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is gone, she is drowned;" he repeated that several times. I found the body about a quarter to four o'clock in the morning, in the creek, close under the wall, near the spot. I think there might be about five feet of water at the time of the alarm; when I took her out, she was covered with mud - there was so much mud the body would not be likely to rise at all; there is always water there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he seem distressed and anxious to search for her - A. He was in the hands of a stranger and appeared in liquor.</p>
               <p>JURY to ROPE. Q. How high is this wall - A. From the foundation to the top it is eighteen feet; it is about eighteen inches or two feet from the ground, on the land side.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that he desired his wife when they crossed the bridge, to go on and he would meet her, when he had looked after his barge, but she said he had no barge to look after, and caught hold of his hand, that he got from her, and soon after heard her scream out, and a plunge in the water; that he called out, and somebody caught hold of him, and would not let him look for her, saying that he would be drowned.</p>

On the 10th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and Whales beginning to fight - each struck but one blow; the blow the prisoner struck knocked Whales down, as if he was struck by a cannon ball, he laid as if dead: but previous to the fight, I saw them on the Regent's canal-bridge; and the prisoner seemed reluctant to fight; he said,</p>

               <p>"If I must fight, I will" - and when he knocked Whales down, he made an effort to get away, but was taken. I understand that Whales had previously struck him.</p>

            . I live in Globe-street, Mile-end. I was at my master's door by the bridge, and saw Nairey and Whales standing together; and saw Whales strike him several times - the prisoner came away, and asked master to see him righted; master said, as he was in liquor, he had better go home. They both stripped and went to fight on the bridge; both were in liquor; the prisoner hit the deceased under the right ear and knocked him down; he got up, and the prisoner struck him again in the same place, and knocked him down; he then put his clothes on and went away. He did not want to fight, but was aggravated to it. I did not see Whales strike at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner walk away and the deceased follow him - A. Yes; and then they fought. When he came to master, he walked on the bridge, and the deceased followed him; it is not two steps from master's house; the deceased stripped first, and had somebody as a second; the prisoner had no friend.</p>
               <p>JAMES STONE. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody; and took him to the deceased, who laid on the bridge. Nairey asked him if he had done him any harm, and put his hand out - Whales shook hands with him, and said, he had done him no harm, that it was a fair stand up fight, and it was his own fault - he appeared in a languid state. I took him to the Globe public-house; the prisoner was liberated, and surrendered to the Coroner's Jury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know when he died - A. Seventeen days after; the prisoner appeared exceedingly sorry for it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. I am a student at the London Hospital. The deceased was brought there on the 10th of July. One of the small bones of his leg was fractured, which was the only injury I could find. I attended him till the 23d or 24th, when he died. Symptoms of violent inflammation of the brain appeared about the second or third day, which continued till his death. I opened his body, and found marks of violent inflammation of the brain; he never complained of having received a blow on the head. I believe his death arose from the inflammation, whether that arose from a blow or a fall I cannot say; it might probably arise from a concussion of the brain, from a fall, which might be aggravated by his intoxication, or the the blow might produce it. I think the fracture of the leg with his intoxication might produce it, as it is always accompanied by fever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not most probable that the inflammation arose from fever, created by the fractured leg, aided by intoxication - A. I think it most probable.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The cause of his death was inflammation of the brain - A. Yes, my Lord; it might arise from the fever, caused by breaking the leg, the fall, or other causes.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160022"/>I think the irritation of the broken bone, aggravated by intoxication, the most probable cause.</p>

I followed him, hallooing out,</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" I was convinced that he had taken something, and pursued him for half a mile; he was brought back by a mob: I had lost sight of him several times - he called Stop thief! himself frequently. I returned to the shop, and missed a watch off a nail over the parlour fire-place - I had seen it safe at twelve o'clock, and I think at two. When he was brought back I said he was the man; I put my hands round him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Give me my watch, and go about your business" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got it now," or</p>

               <p>"There is a waistcoat I have taken, it is not worth above 1 s.;" it had laid on a bale of old clothes, on the left side of the shop. I think I have seen him at my shop once before, selling a pair of stockings; but am certain he is the man who ran out of the shop. I have not found the watch.

               <p>"Shop!" but no one answered. I came out, and she said,</p>
               <p>"There is a man come out of my shop; Stop thief!" I said I had stolen nothing - she followed me, and gathered a crowd. I met a friend, who said,</p>

On Sunday the 24th of July, a little after one o'clock in the morning, I was in <placeName id="t18240916-57-crimeloc306">Fleet-market, and just at the bottom of Fleet-lane</placeName>

I then caught hold of him with my right hand, and gave him a very hard blow on the head with my left hand; then another man (who I had not seen before) came up from the wall, and said</p>
               <p>"Bl - t. you we will have your money;" they then both caught hold of me and threw me down on my back. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I kicked at them, and beat at them as hard as I could. I saw another man standing on the edge of the pavement about five yards off, whether he was concerned I cannot say, but they all ran away together.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got you down, what did they do - A. Before they could get at my money, they hove me about, my apron string broke, and they got my money out of my pocket. I got up and missed my hat. I looked about for it, and before I could find it, they were gone with my hat, apron and all; they had dragged me along till my waistcoat was torn off. I had a half-crown, three shillings, four penny-pieces, and ten half-pence, in my pockets, they took it all. I lost my hat and apron, and handkerchief out of my inside coat pocket. I hallooed out murder twice - they then ran away; one said to the other</p>
               <p>"Come on, come on." I hallooed out when they were both on me; they gave me no blows, only knocked the skin off my back, by throwing me down; they caught hold of me and hove me up at arms length, and both came on me, the third man ran away with them; he is the man who said</p>
               <p>"Come along"; he said that when I cried out, and away they all ran in a moment. I lost sound of them before I could get up, or I should have followed them. I looked about a little, and told one or two watchmen of it; they said it was a wonder they had not heard or seen something of it. I lost them for that night, and on the Thursday morning following, I had been to the Borough-market to look after them, as they appeared men who lay about the markets, and about a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two more sitting asleep in the first recess on London bridge, nearest to the Borough, on the right hand side; I walked backward, and forward, looking at them, and was almost a mind to take the hat off the prisoner's head myself, I got up by the side of him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160024"/>noticed the hat he had on, and knew it to be mine by a cut and a hole in front of it, I went to the bridge-keeper and described my hat, and he went up and took it off his head, and said in his presence,</p>
               <p>"This is your hat sure enough" and gave it into my hand; and the prisoner went to snatch it from me, and said he had bought it on the Thurs day before, in Rosemary-lane, of a Jew. I had not lost it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the day - A. Yes, he said he bought it last Thursday, and this was on Thursday; I had not lost it till Sunday. I am certain he is the man, I should have known him if I had not found my hat on him, by his appearence, and a striped plaid jacket which he had on at the time, I firmly believe him to be the man; if I had not found my hat I should be of the same opinion; the other two made off directly. The bridge-keeper took the prisoner, and one of them was a little like one who was with him, but I was not certain of him, he had a black coat and waistcoat on, and was like the man who said " Bl - t. you I will have your money." I am convinced the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. If you had not found your hat, and met the prisoner at York, should you have said he was the man who robbed you - A. Yes; I saw his person by the light of the gas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to him before the Magistrate from the hat and his jacket - A. Yes; and his person too. I have a perfect knowledge of him without the hat or jacket. I first said I knew him because of the hat and jacket. The Alderman asked if I should know him without them; I said Yes, I could swear to him because I saw him by the gas light, and had a good look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were positive of him, why not say you knew his person - A. Because they did not ask me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife talked to you about being out late on that night; did she not ask you to account for the money you should have brought home - A. No; I always gave her a sovereign, and had been home and given it to her at half-past seven o'clock. I went out afterwards to meet a young man who was coming from the country, but he did not come. I had 7 s. 9 d. I was to meet him at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing from that time till two o'clock - A. I had a pint or two of beer and some tobacco - I had four pints of beer in all that night. By his appearance I thought him a chap who lays about the markets.</p>

            . I am keeper of London-bridge. On Thursday morning, the 29th, about seven o'clock, the prosecutor came and gave me some information. I was at the south end of London-bridge, and saw four men and a woman in a recess; he pointed the prisoner out to me, and pointed to his hat, which I took off, but before that the prosecutor had described it particularly; and when I took it off he said it was his (the prosecutor's). The prisoner said he had bought it in Rosemary-lane eight or ten days before, for 1 s. - that is what he said at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the moment - A. He said he was sure it was not the prosecutor's. I said I must take him; he said he would go any where. The prosecutor said he was the man - he really believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor said the hat was his, what became of the two other men - A. They all went out of the recess, and were gone when I returned, but I did not see any of them run away. I cannot say whether they ran or went away leisurely. I have had the hat ever since - it is broken in several places, and has no lining.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not say he saw the man who robbed him, but he had seen a hat, which he thought was his, on a man on the Bridge - A. Yes, that is what he said. He spoke to the man's person at the watch-house. There is no maker's name in the hat, nor any marks but cuts and holes.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. When he came to you did he say there was a man who had his hat, or a man who had robbed him - A. He said there was a man who had got his hat, and he believed the same man who had robbed him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You swear to the hat - A. Yes; it had a yellow silk lining, and the maker's name in it when he lost it; they are out now, but I know it by a cut in the corner - I saw him cut it with one of his tools when he was at work. He came home without one, and with his waistcoat all torn. He does not generally stop out late, except when he is out all night, and he has not done that for the last two or three years.</p>

He ran down Cree-church-lane, I followed calling Stop thief! the others put their legs out to prevent my pursuit; every obstacle was thrown in my way, and a very large dog, which must have been set at me, seized me and hung by my legs, for twenty yards, but I kept the prisoner in my sight, and he was taken without my losing sight of him for an instant. I am quite sure he is the man who took the watch - it was found near him.</p>

I gave him 6 s. 6 d. for it, and after he was gone, I found the key was gold - he said he was a distressed weaver.</p>

               <p>"No, you pay." I however paid, and drank a glass; she immediately knocked and shoved me down, and threw herself upon my right arm; she directly called to the other prisoner, whom I found in the room when we first went up - she was at the window; she said</p>
               <p>"Sally, come here;" she came, and threw herself on my left arm, so that both my arms were secured. Davis then snatched my watch from me. I had a guard-chain round my neck, and felt the tug - it was broken, and the watch gone - she broke the chain forcibly. M'Carty immediately got off me. I seized Davis by the left hand, and said</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me;" she said</p>
               <p>"Go and hang<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160026"/>yourself, I have not." I said</p>
               <p>"There is the watch in your hand now," and snatched at it, but she put her hand behind her, and gave it to M'Carty, who ran down stairs with it. Davis gave me a shove, got from me, ran down, and I after her, calling Stop thief! and saw them both turn into the next house; a watchman who lived next door came down to me. I went to Hatton-garden, and informed Read - they were taken in about a month on another charge. I had been looking for them during that time, with the officer, but could not find them. I was certain of them immediately I saw them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went with this woman at the first invitation - A. It happened so; I drank a little porter at dinner, and nothing after except a glass of gin in the room. I swear that I was perfectly sober. She said there were some young men drinking up stairs, which made the invitation stronger - I found nobody drinking there - she said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, they will be here presently." I went there to drink, and for no other purpose. I thought her a bad woman, but said to myself</p>

               <p>"If there are any men there, very likely I shall be safer." I was not playing with them at all.</p>

I was getting up to go on duty, and heard a running down stairs, flew to the window, and saw the two prisoners come out of Day's house, and run into the passage where I live; the prosecutor went down the court, and they went out of the house, into No. 12. I went to the window again before I finished dressing, and saw M'Carty going up the court, and the prosecutor running after her: he caught her just at the narrow part of the court - she said,</p>
               <p>"You - I have nothing belonging to you," and pushed him away. I went to finish dressing and they were gone. I told Ayton that I knew them both - he appeared to me a little in liquor, but very little indeed. I have known the prisoners living in this court three or four years. I never saw them afterwards till they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is a common house - A. Yes. The prosecutor was rather fresh; it was hardly observable. They were absent for a month - I used to see them going in and out daily before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and went up to the room. I saw the prisoner there, and told him I was sent for on suspicion of something being in his boxes; there were two boxes, one was a paper box with a pair of trowsers and a jacket in it. I looked out of the window, and saw the bundle tied up with a rope, on the leads of the next house. I sent the young gentleman to throw it down; when it was opened Miss Railton saw the goods, and claimed them as her brothers. The prisoner said there was 2 l. 10 s. in it, and I said</p>

               <p>"You had better take it out for you know where it is;" it had been a very wet night, and it was evident that it could not have been there long - these things were in the bundle.</p>

I went to the shed by myself; when I laid down to sleep, Linton brought me some hay to shelter me - I did not see either of the prisoners that night before I went to sleep. I took my purse and put it under me. I had been asleep some time, when Linton came and laid by my side was not so dark but that I could see him; he awoke me by feeling about me. I asked what brought him there, and would he not cover himself with the hay; he said he was warm enough; he asked me what brought me there - I said I had leave to be there; he said I should not be there, and gave me a shove. He had been at work as a haymaker. Some men then came round the shed, who had been at a public-house, and made a great alarm. Linton went out to them; some persons then came in and dragged me from where I had been lying. Linton was one of them, and assisted in pulling me out; I saw him searching under me. I could not distinguish who were the other persons. When we were before the Magistrate Linton was admitted to give evidence.</p>

            . I am a labourer on Mr. Wilkinson's farm. On the night of the robbery this man came into the rick-yard and enquired if he could sleep there. I said he might sleep in the shed. I generally sleep upon a rick.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160028"/>I went on the rick first, and then into the shed - I do not know for what reason. I did not steal his money, nor do I know when it was taken. I laid down by the side of Nash, and felt all over him to feel if he had any money; he awoke, and said</p>
               <p>"Who is here?" I appeared to be asleep, and he said</p>
               <p>"You had better lay some hay over you." I then got up and went to the yard, and saw Sanders; I said</p>
               <p>"Here is the Irishman," and then we went in, and I laid upon his feet and took hold of his hand, while Straw Joe (Sanders) tried to ram some hay into his mouth to prevent his crying out; and then the man in the glazed hat and Straw Joe searched his person, while I searched the hay; in the mean time Straw Joe struck him. Salmon was not then in the shed, he was outside. I then went out and met Salmon, and he went in and searched him, and I stood in the door-way - they came out; I went in, and Nash was enquiring for his coat; and as we were coming out Joe said to me</p>
               <p>"I have his money." We then agreed to go to Totteridge. I did not know what money was taken from Nash, but the half sovereign, the purse, and the buttons were given to me by Straw Joe. The buttons which were found on Salmon were those that Straw Joe gave me. I put them and the half sovereign into my pocket, and threw the purse into a pond. I do not know how the buttons came in Salmon's possession - I did not give them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Is this your first robbery - A. Yes, I went into the shed of my own accord, and fumbled about the man, but I did not take the money. I went there to sleep and to rob the man; I went to do both. I cannot tell whether these are the buttons or not; I think those I had were bigger.</p>

             re-examined. I had some buttons in my purse; I am sure this button is one; it is one of my coat buttons; I can read, but I do not know what letters are on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Linton was the man who came in and laid by you. - A. Yes, he shammed sleep; when I came out of the shed I saw the prisoners near it, and to the best of my opinion they had been in it; Salmon struck me when I came out.</p>
               <p>SANDERS's Defence. What they have sworn is false - when I was coming down to the shed, Linton and another came out; I never saw the prosecutor, there were from twelve to twenty persons about the ricks and barns.</p>

             re-examined. I did not see the prisoners in the shed, but they were in the employ of the same master. I had seen them before that day among the rest. I had been working there some time, and had slept in the ricks or in a barn. I cannot tell what time of night it was. When I got out I went to a public-house at Whetstone, and enquired at the gate for a watchman, it might be between ten and eleven o'clock; it was not very dark; I could distinguish one man from another, there were a great many round the shed when I went away. I had been showing my money in the yard the day before. The shed had no door.</p>

On Wednesday, the 23d of June, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, a witness came and gave me some information and directed me to go down the road; I did so, and saw a man running down Hart's-lane with these prints, which were not entirely covered. I could not get sight of his features sufficiently to identify him; I called Stop him! and he turned down Church row, threw down the prints and ran; there were five pieces, I had seen them in the shop four or five minutes before, upon a pile. I had not seen the prisoner's face, but I saw him at Lambeth-street on the 16th or 17th of July, and from his height, I have no doubt but he is the same man; they were on a chair two feet within the shop.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and live in Bethnal-green-road. I knew the prisoner perfectly well before this happened. On the 23d of June, between four and five o'clock I came down Ward's-row and saw him standing with his back to a post, looking towards me; the moment he saw me, he turned round and looked towards the road. There was another person standing against the post looking through Mr. Sexton's window; that man held his head down, and I did not see his face; I turned down Squirrel-street, and had scarcely passed a minute, when I looked round and missed the man from the post; I then saw him come from the shop with some prints before him, he crossed the way, and the prisoner met him, took up his apron and folded up the prints, and said</p>
               <p>"Come along;" the prisoner took the prints, and they both went up South-street. I immediately went into the shop, Box had turned round looking at the shelves; I told him to run on to Hart's-lane, and he would meet them; I followed, but could not run so fast; I saw the prisoner come out of Hart's-lane; he ran across the road and Box after him; he had a bundle. I did not see him drop any thing. On the 15th of July I saw him in custody. I am quite certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you were at Lambeth-street did you not swear that the man came to me and asked me to give him the ends of his own apron. - A. No.</p>

             accosted me, and asked me to take a walk with her - her sister was with her. I told them I would not have any thing to say to them - they then asked me to give them some gin; I said, I did not know that I should; but if gin would do them any good they should have it. I went into a shop with them - I am certain when I went in that my watch was in my fob; they called for three glasses of gin, and handed me one; I put it to my lips but did not drink it. I gave the landlord a shilling to pay for it; he gave me the change, and I put the halfpence in my left hand pocket. I staid there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes looking about, and thought it was a curious place; the girls wanted more gin, which I refused - but I gave them the halfpence. I went out as far as Windsor's the coachmakers' shop, about ten yards from the gin shop.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you sober - A. Yes; I never was drunk but twice in my life. I went that evening to the Coachmaker's Arm's public-house about eleven o'clock, and stopped there about three quarters of an hour. I had one glass of rum and water there; before that I had been at Mr. Gibbs's and had three-penny worth of oysters, one drink of porter - that might be about half-past ten; I had been before that in a public-house, in Brewer-street, Golden-square - I went there about twenty minutes past nine, and left at ten. I had 6 d. worth of rum and water before that; I have a tap at home, but I do not know whether I had tasted any that night - I had been at work till five or six o'clock, and to the best of my knowledge I did not eat or drink till nine o'clock - I was not at all in liquor. I was not going with them, nor bargaining with them - this girl had her hand in my breeches pocket, they then both ran away. I do not know how long it was before I took the prisoner into custody, it might be an hour; the robbery was committed upon Mr. Windsor's grating, there is a light there; I was rather in a flurry, and hurt to think that I had been robbed. I am certain I could not have mistaken one person for another; when I came back from the watch-house, this girl was a hundred and fifty yards from the spot - she said I was mistaken in the person.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner a few weeks back in the City-road; I told him I took him for taking the lady's reticule - he made no answer. Greening, his companion, was also delivered to me, and I took him to Worship-street, but the Magistrate let him go on his father's recognizance till the Sessions.</p>

In coming from Lower Shadwell I had missed my turning, and enquired my way; I thought I had been directed wrong, and was leaning against an iron post; the prisoner came up and put her hand into my pocket - she took out a key and six sovereigns: I desired her to put me in the right way, but when she took the money she ran off. I tried to take hold of her, but she got away; I pursued, and took her within thirty or forty yards of the spot; four sovereigns and the key were found upon her. I do not know what became of the other two. We both fell down on the pavement; the watchman came and pulled me off her. Her mother has since made me a present of two sovereigns.</p>

            . I live at Knightsbridge. On the 15th of August I met Smith and Harris in Oxford-street, as I was returning from an errand in London, which was the reason of my being out so late; it was about ten minutes past eleven o'clock; they were strangers to me, but I am certain of their persons. They enquired where I was going - I said to Knightsbridge; they said they were going there, and should they walk with me. I agreed, and we went down Park-lane, as far as Hyde Park-corner; they then invited me with them; I went to <placeName id="t18240916-77-crimeloc420">No. 11, Pump-court</placeName>

I put my small-clothes under the pillow with the watch in them. I awoke about five o'clock, and found them both in the room, and charged them with stealing it, which they denied - the door was fastened inside. They then went out of the room, and I said that if they did not give me the watch I would fetch a constable. I got one in about twenty minutes, but the door was then padlocked outside. I saw them at the watch-house, and was certain of them. I had given Smith 2 s. I was perfectly sober - I had had a quartern of gin with them in Oxford-street; that was all.</p>

I have known the two prisoners a good while; I was in another cart emptying a sack of peas; Morgan came up first, and then Hinton - one of them took one half-seive of currants and the other another - they went down Maiden-lane; I told Mr. Watts - he went after them, but they were gone,</p>

I went to Mr. Watts as soon as he came to the cart and told him of it; I have never got into any scrape. They were taken about half-past three o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORGAN. When you was at the office, you said Hinton took the first, and I the second, and that you jumped out instantly, and cried Stop thief! - Witness. I never said so at all at the office. I did follow them to the place where they put them, but did not cry out.</p>

            . I live in Little George-street, and am employed by the Imperial Gas Company, to light the lamps. On the 5th of July, I met the prisoner Gardner in Bedford-street, Bedford-square, with two pieces of pipe on his shoulder, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, and followed him into Dunbar's iron foundry, in Tottenham-court-road. I then went into Charlotte-street, where some pipes were lying, which I had seen in the course of the day twice, and found two of them were gone. In about twenty minutes, I came up the road, went into Francis-street, and saw him come out of Dunbar's foundry, which is three doors from Francis-street, in company with some other person, who soon went away to the corner of the street; the prisoner then picked up a piece of pipe lying at the corner of Francis-street, and carried it into the foundry - he staid about five minutes; he saw me when he came out, turned, and went up Francis-street. I followed him, he walked at a good pace, and then went up Gower-street, took to his heels, and ran away up the New-road.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the Imperial Gas Company, at the Pancras station. Some of their pipes have a fillet, or ridge, and others have the Company's initials - I have seen many pipes of other Companies, but never saw any with the ridge but their's - we were laying down pipes about that neighbourhood. On Saturday, the 10th of July I went to Dunbar's premises, and saw this piece of pipe lying in the foundry, exposed - when the officer came I directed him to search; we found nine or ten more; the bed-pipe was partly concealed amidst a heap of old iron, in a part of the premises nearest the street. All the pieces that were found had the fillet, and four of them the initials; they were all new. An iron-founder must know them from old pipe. They cost the Company about 10 s. per cwt.; the weight of this bed-pipe is about 1 cwt. Doubar came up while we were making enquiries - I challenged him with receiving stolen goods - he said he had bought them, and would buy them again; he said he did not know the persons who brought them, but thought he should know them if he saw them, and that he gave 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. per cwt.; I cannot tell which. I know this bed-pipe, because a connexion was making with the pipes in Russell-street, and the pipes were all cut before they went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell whether these pipes had been at Charlotte-street - A. No - there is no mark upon it but the fillet. There are fillets on all our pipes. What I call being concealed was lying amongst other pipes, in a mass of old iron - they were piled regularly in with the others. When Dunhar spoke of having bought pipes and said he would again I particularly spoke of this one. He said he had bought quantities of pipe from other Companies - I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you not had bills of parcels of them;" he said, Yes - that they were broken pipes, and the perquities of the workmen. I think them worth about 10 s. per cwt. - old iron is worth about 2 s. 4 d. per cwt. Broken pipes are not the property of the workmen.</p>

            . I was one of the Company's labourers. On the 10th of July I went to Mr. Dunbar's foundry, and saw one of these pieces of pipe lying as you go into the store-room; and upon looking about I saw others in different places; I know them by either the fillets or initials.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160036"/>I was talking to Mr. Dunhar, sen., and he said he had no such thing; the prisoner Dunbar then came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"What is all this row?" one of the men said,</p>
               <p>"These men have challenged us with receiving stolen goods;" he said he had bought them, and would buy them again.</p>
               <p>DUNBAR's Defence. This man brought some iron to sell, and I gave a fair price for it. I went into the counting-house, got the money, and he went away - I then took the iron from the scale, and put it into the stack; we had a great quantity of iron at that time.</p>
               <p>J - GOLD. I work in the foundry of Mr. Dunbar, sen., who is the prisoner's father; this young man is employed by his father. We melt about 18 cwt. of iron every day; it is principally old iron, brought from various places; we generally give 3 s. 6 d. per cwt. for it, and have on many occasions bought pipe from different Companies; we buy old iron of every description, and melt all we buy - we do not sell pipe at all, and have large piles of iron always ready for the furnace - we lay it one piece on the other, just to keep it up. I did not see this particular piece of pipe - I saw Mr. Dunbar weighing some pipe; the people were at work, and the gates were open; it was then about five o'clock, and we had not left work - we leave at six. The first witness came on the 10th; I was there: the iron was then on the heap, not a yard from the scale.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ADAMS. Q. Can either part of your scales be seen from the street - A. Yes, both parts can be seen, but they can see rather the most of the scale with the iron in it. New iron is all in pigs; the moment it is cast we call it old iron. We buy all iron brought by strangers; we never notice anybody's mark. I do not know that the Imperial Gas Company's pipes have any initials on them. I have seen the marks on pipes in the yards, but never knew the meaning of them; I have heard of such a Company, but I do not know where their station is - I have heard it was at Battle-bridge.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose I had furnished my house with cast iron grates yesterday, and brought them to you to day, what would you buy them as - A. Old iron. Some manufacturers have initials on their iron, and some have not - we often buy iron with initials upon it; country makers have their name at length.</p>
               <p>T - STEVENSON. I am an Iron founder. The fair price for old iron is 3 s. 6 d. per cwt. or less, according to its quality - I know Dunbar, sen.; he is seventy-two years of age or more; I have known him thirty years in that same foundry; the gates are always open, and every person can see in during working hours. If this pipe had been brought to my foundry, I should have considered it old iron; it is mutilated and damaged in the cutting - I should have taken it in and weighed it; according to my judgment, they paid a full price for it - it has been made of inferior iron, and will not do for that purpose again. I should have bought long iron pipes like these of any dirty fellow that brought them, whom I did not know; if I gave a full price for it and in the face of day. I have bought great quantities of pipe from agents and other persons. I should have bought this piece of that man, because it is mutilated old iron.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That pipe being broken would have been every where considered as old iron - A. Yes; I should have no objection to buy a single piece of such a man.</p>

            . I am single, and live in Gloster-terrace, Hoxton. On the 22d of July, a coach was taken for me by a friend in Sun-street, between nine and ten o'clock, the prisoner Booth, I believe, was the <rs id="t18240916-93-deflabel503" type="occupation">driver</rs>

I had the shawl on my shoulders when I went into the coach, but got out without it - it is possible I might drop it in getting out of the coach and going to my own door, because it was half off my shoulders and half on; I missed it within ten minutes after I got in door's, and I immediately went to the coach-stand at Shoreditch, to seek for the coach; when I got out my mother was at the door with a candle, and took the number of the coach; I then went to Shoreditch with my brother; my sister followed me. I found the prisoner at the Lying-in-hospital with his coach; I asked if he had seen my shawl, and said, I had left it in his coach; he recognized me directly, but said, he had not seen it, or words to that effect. I had not then left the coach half an hour; I left the coach after a little altercation, and saw the shawl again the same evening in my sister's possession - it is worth about twenty shillings.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was the shawl out of your possession - A. Not more than an hour and a half. Booth recognized me when I spoke to him; I asked him if he had got the shawl - I do not recollect his saying anything about taking it to the coach-office, as the law directs. He had charged two shillings for his fare from Sun-street to Hoxton; the shawl is not here, it was the property of a friend who is gone to Ceylon.</p>

            . I am sister of the last witness. I live with her, and keep a boarding-school; I was in company with my sister on this evening - we got out of the coach, the fare demanded was two shillings. Mamma thought it too much, and said, if he charged her sixpence too much, she would summons him in the morning; this induced me to look at the man, and I saw it was a little old man, but I did not take sufficient notice as to enable me to say that Booth is the man. My sister missed her shawl in five or ten minutes; I did not go back with her, but in about five minutes I went to Shoreditch, and they told me to go to the Lying-in-hospital, and I found the coach at the watering-house; I asked for the coachman, and Booth presented himself; I told him I had left a shawl in the coach, and no doubt he had taken care of it; I would thank him to give it me. I think he said, he had not seen it or had not got it - he told me to look in the coach - a gentleman who was stepping into the coach<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160037"/>looked for it, but it was not found. I was coming away without it, and when I got about six yards from the place some one tapped me on the shoulder, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come back, for the watchman has got your shawl;" I came back, and some person in the crowd handed it to me - I had asked Sapsud (who was the watchman) about it, and he said he had not got it - he said,</p>
               <p>"Search me" - he opened his coat, and I saw his pistols which frightened me. I brought it home and gave it my sister; a man named Taylor was there, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister wore this shawl and left it on the seat - A. Yes; I saw the watchman who showed me his pistols which frightened me, and some person in the crowd gave me the shawl; the coachman did not recognize me, as I had worn a light dress, and changed it for a dark one - I did not hear him say, if any property had been left in the coach, he should have carried it to the coach-office, as his duty.</p>

            . I am a woollen-factor, and live in Basinghall-street. On the night of the 22d of July, about ten o'clock, I came by the end of Old-street-road, near the watering-house; the coach, No. 720, was standing at the door, and one of these ladies (I think the last) was having an altercation with the coachman about a shawl, which she said had been left in the coach - Booth appeared as the coachman, and denied any knowledge of it - I understood him to say he had taken up a fare since he took her, and that if a shawl had been left in the coach that fare must have taken it away. The young lady said it was impossible that could be true, as the time was so short. There was a gentleman with one foot on the coach step, who appeared to be getting into the coach, and the coachman said,</p>
               <p>"If you suppose your shawl was left in the coach, you had better search;" I understood her to say she had searched before - I believe she searched it then; and just as she was looking into the coach the watchman Sapsud came up, I told him the nature of the charge, and pressed him to look into the business himself - he seemed rather unconcerned, but while the lady was looking into the coach I saw the coachman take off his hat in rather a peculiar way, drawing it down close to his breast - he then put it on again; by this time the watchman had got into the crowd, and stood at a little distance behind the coachman; while the coachman was putting on his hat again I saw his other hand pass behind him - a man named Taylor charged the coachman with having the shawl; he said,</p>
               <p>"By God you have the shawl" - he replied,</p>
               <p>"You had better search me, and see if I have got it;" I kept my eye upon them both, the watchman drew back at that instant, and went to a sort of shutter ledge, and placed his hand behind him in the same manner as the coachman had done before; though I had not seen anything pass between the coachman and the watchman, I felt convinced that the watchman had put something behind the ledge; I stretched my hand towards the ledge, and Taylor did the same, and we both took hold of the shawl at the same time - I gave the shawl to Miss Gibson. The two prisoners were charged with the offence by Taylor, but they were not taken up till afterwards. I have not a doubt of their being the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The watchman was at liberty, was he not - A. He was at large at that time. I did not go to the office till I saw an account in the newspaper. Taylor was near the shutter; he is a sort of labouring man: he was as near the shutter as myself; there might be about two dozen persons there. I saw the account in the paper, and then went to the office. I saw Taylor there, and he was bound over to appear, but he did not appear at Clerkenwell.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the two prisoners. On the night of the 22d of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went to the Star, public-house in the City-road, and there was some bustle, but I did not see it. When I came out the Taylor was accusing the watchman with taking a shawl, and hiding it behind the shutter; the watchman denied it - the young ladies were gone. Mr. Buckler was there, but I did not know the part he had taken in the business. Taylor was in the act of getting on a Paddington stage to go away; I said,</p>
               <p>"You must come back and give me your name, you have accused a man on his duty;</p>
               <p>"he then came back, and I said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say what you have said before;" he said Yes, and repeated the charge - the watchman denied it. I then took Taylor's address, as</p>
               <p>"No. 20, Lisson-street, Lisson-grove, Paddington" - he was an entire stranger to me; he then went away - I told him to come to Worship-street next morning - I did not detain the watchman, as I knew he had been there seven or eight years, and knew where to find him. Nothing further passed that evening; the watchman remained on his beat; I told him I should make it known at the office the next morning, and did so. Taylor came down; I was ordered to get the coachman and the watchman to the office; I told the watchman he must bring the coachman, as I did not know where to find him - he did so in a day or two, and then Taylor did not come - I went to Paddington with a summons for him, he then came, and gave his evidence, and was bound over.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is Taylor - A. He appeared like a carpenter; he did not seize the watchman. The cause was not investigated till a day or two after.</p>

            . I am a constable of Pentonville. I saw the prisoners on Saturday the 14th of August, about half past two o'clock in the afternoon, coming up Collyer-street together, they turned into Rodney-street; I was induced to watch them, having frequently seen them about the place. I saw Scott draw this spoon from his bosom; I went up to them, and Ritson said</p>
               <p>"Here is somebody coming;" I seized Scott and pulled him across the road, and then seized Ritson, they struggled, but could not get away. I found the marked spoon in Scott's hat, the other was dropped in the scuffle, and was brought to me as I was going to Hatton-garden. They had been together, and Scott seemed to be giving the spoon to Ritson, but seeing me, Ritson went across the road.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>SCOTT's Defence. I was going along, and saw a bundle of wood and a spoon.</p>
               <p>RITSON's Defence. I turned into Collier-street, and the officer collared this boy, I stopped to look, and he plunged upon me, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are one."</p>
               <p>JURY to REYNOLDS. Q. When Scott held the spoon to the other prisoner, did he offer to take it - A. No, he saw me so close that he did not offer to take it.</p>

            . I was in my surgery, reading the paper. on the 10th of August, the prisoner Brown came to the door after Mrs. Inman had given them an answer, and asked when I should have any liquorice-root. I said in the course of the day. I then saw Brown take a bottle from a shelf; I ran out and seized them both outside the door. Rutland made a very great resistance, and I was compelled to let Brown go, but he handed the property to Rutland. I sent for an officer, who took Rutland, and found in his hat my scales, and in one of his pockets three of my weights. Brown was brought to my shop next morning - I knew him, for he had applied to me several times for a situation; he said they had hid the shears in a bank, and told where they had hid the drugs.</p>

She came again next day, looked at some things, I missed a handkerchief before she got out of the shop and asked if she had it, she denied it several times, but at last gave it me from under her gown.</p>

On the 24th of August I was at a pawnbroker's, and saw Davidson bring this plane to pledge - I enquired if it was his own; he said No, but it belonged to a man where he lived; I told him I would see him. He then went out of the shop, and pointed to Corbet, who he said gave it to him - I left Davidson, and followed Corbet, and when I came up to him he had got this oil-stone, which he said he had had six months, and gave 9 d. for it.</p>

On Thursday, the 26th of August, about six or seven o'clock, I went to a drawer in my bed-room, and missed a sovereign, a half sovereign, and nine shillings in silver - I had seen them safe the Saturday before: the drawer was not locked: it was in a one pair stairs room; the door was locked, and I had the key in my pocket. I have since found that the key of the kitchen will open the bed-room door. I had left the prisoner in the house half an hour before I missed the property; he is my son, by my former husband.</p>

I hung a gown up on the 11th of September, on the left hand of the door, about eight o'clock in the morning - a person came into the shop about eleven or twelve o'clock, and said something; I then went out and stopped the prisoner; she had not got it; but I had seen her go towards a linen-draper's shop; I asked her what she had under her shawl, she said, nothing of mine, what did I mean by stopping her. I then went back to the shop where she had been, and found the gown lying in the door way - it was a stranger who told me about her taking it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Stop thief! we took the prisoner, and searched him, but found nothing on him. A gentleman told me to go back and look into the area; I went, and found a young man at the door with a light. I found the watch-case in one part of the area, and the inside in another.</p>

            . I had taken the prisoner before the others came up. I was passing Hind-street, and saw him running; he attempted to go down Mary-le-bone-lane; he then ran by me; I caught at him, but missed my aim: he went down Fair-street, put his hand over the rails, and then deliberately laid himself down, and put his hands through the rails. I followed to see what was done, and said to the watchman,</p>
               <p>"If you come with me I think we can find the watch." I went home with my wife, and then went to the watch-house, and it was too late; next morning: I went as soon as business would permit to the Magistrates, but it was too late.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street; on the 2d of September I met the prisoner in Oxford-street, in conversation with two others - I saw him nudge the one on his right hand, and take a watch from his pocket and shew it to them, observing that it was a nice one; I took him into custody, and the other two ran off; he said it was his father's watch, and he was taking it to his mother, at No. 22, Manchester-street; I asked where he brought it from - he said from the watchmaker's, in the middle of Long-acre. I said I should detain him and take him before a Magistrate, and as we went along he said he had stolen it from a house in Camberwell-grove, and then that he took it from a person in St. Pancras church; I had not threatened, or made him any promise to induce him to confess.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Secretary's-office in the Victualling-office. On the 15th of July, 1822, I received a letter, purporting to come from the prisoner, as purser of His Majesty's ship Liverpool. I hold it in my hand now; I think it contained an account, but am not certain - I made a mark on the letter with the account; if there was one in it, and it would be passed to the Medical, and Cash Committee of the Victualling Board, and would then go to the Impress department; it would be left in the board-room. I have no doubt but it contained an enclosure.</p>

            . I am Secretary to the Medical and Cash Committee. There is a reference on this letter in my hand-writing, to Mr. Richardson, to report on subject matter of the account alluded to (looking at the account) - this is it. After the arrival of the prisoner in England I saw him; a letter had been written to him requiring the original documents - from which he professed to have made up this account; in consequence of which he came to the office, and desired to see me - he was brought into the Committee where I was sitting; he stated that having been called upon by the letter before alluded to for the original documents, he could not produce them, having destroyed them. I said he must give a written answer to the letter - the Board had written to him. The documents required are the original memorandums, which he states in his letter to have been found after the death of Mr. Twynam, whom he succeeded as Purser.</p>

            . I know the prisoner's writing perfectly well - this letter is his writing (looking at the documents produced) - the signature to this account, and the heading are his writing, as also the letters produced.</p>
               <p>The letter enclosing the document was here read, it stated, that Mr. Twynam had left his accounts in a confused state, but the account had been made out by the prisoner from documents, then in his possession.</p>
               <p>MR. FAUCETT re-examined. I have made a memorandum on the letter of the date on which it was received - there is no mark of mine on the account; my belief is, that there was an enclosure, but I cannot identify it; if there had not been one, I should have noticed it, as I read the letter; I opened it on the 15th - Mr. Briggs has refered it on the 16th.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to MR. GOULD. Q. I have not understood who you are - A. I was midshipman on board the Liverpool at the time the prisoner was there. I think the whole of the account is in his writing, except the signature</p>
               <p>"J. B. Somerville." I was on board the vessel when Mr. Twynam died - the prisoner was at that time Admiralty clerk on board, and did the duty of Captain's clerk. Mr. Twynam was ill about ten days; and at his death the prisoner succeeded him - he also performed the duty of Captain's clerk, but had a person to assist him. He continued acting Purser nine or ten months - we were in the Indies all that time. I do not remember his being in bad health; he had the prickly heat, that is a sign of good health.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe when grog is stopped from the men, there is much dispute between them and the Purser about their amount of stoppages - A. Not when they are correctly paid, when the Purser is a just man. They either put their name or mark to the settlement.</p>
               <p>Q. If the duty of the ship calls them away, would not they say to the Purser</p>
               <p>"Put down my name" - A. I never knew it; the men stand on quarter deck, and write their name before the Commanding Officer and others. If they cannot write, they make a mark, and the Purser puts their name.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. This is done publicly on quarter deck; did you see any account of this done on quarter deck. - A. Certainly not; the whole account should be in his writing, except the signatures, which should be made by the parties themselves. I certainly believe the names in this column of signatures, are in the prisoner's writing, a little disguised, but Walker is evidently in his writing not at all disguised.</p>

            . In 1821 I was Lieutenant of the Liverpool; I joined her on the 14th of May. Mr. Twynam was then Purser; he died on the 31st of May; he was only ill five or six days. I was ill myself, and do not know who acted for him. About the 19th of September, an application was made to me as commanding officer. - A deputation of the ship's company came aft to complain that they could not get their short allowance money paid to them from the Purser; I sent for him twice or more, before he came, and at last sent a serjeant of marines with a file of men, who brought him on quarter deck. I was not present at any payment to the men after that.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the name of Somerville on this account, and say if it is your writing. - A. It is precisely like my writing, but I do not believe that I ever signed this document; I am unable to say whether it is my writing or not, the words Senior and Lieutenant are not my writing. I have no recollection of having seen such a document, or such a payment; had I witnessed it, I certainly should recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a knowledge of having signed any voucher or paper which the prisoner can have in his possession. A. I have a slight recollection of having signed some papers, but cannot say what they were; brought to me by him, and taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. He would then be in possession of your signature - A. Yes, the signatures in the column all appear would be in one hands but some are more disguised. I saw none of these parties sign their names, nor make their marks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was senior lieutenant at the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160047"/>A. Yes, I had to sign documents in the Captain's absence, but not frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. After the men made their complaint the allowances were paid. - A. I suppose so, as I heard no further complaint. I never witnessed disputes between the men and Purser. When I joined the ship Mr. Twynam was very busy in his cabin, at his accounts, and was told he would injure his health by confining himself so closely below. I heard him say every thing of material consequence was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a greater difference in the signatures than might be made by a man who wrote the whole account himself - A. Oh! Yes.</p>
               <p>ROBERT M'DONALD. I was steward to Mr. Twynam until the 31st of May, 1821, when he died, and then remained as steward to the prisoner for about a month - it was my duty to keep an account of the quantity of grog retained by the Purser, and not served out to the men. Mr. Twynam settled with the caterers of the different messes about five months before his death I think - I was present at that settlement; I cannot say when it was to a month or so. When he died he left his books and papers in his cabin - the prisoner took possession of them after his death. I made out an account of money due for stock grog, by order of Captain 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1093">Collier</persName>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Knight and Jones, Solicitors for this prosecution. I served the prisoner with notice to produce certain documents, on the 11th of September, in Newgate. I have a copy of the notice here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you that you had taken all the papers he had on shore, and all the rest were on board the Liverpool - A. No; he said he would attend to it.</p>
               <p>The copy of notice for the prisoner to produce a variety of documents was here read.</p>
               <p>ROBERT M'DONALD (in continuation). I do not think the account exceeded 30 l.; it did not amount to 40 l. I am confident. The money was paid the men by the prisoner shortly after Mr. Twyman's death. I believe the name</p>
               <p>"Robert M'Donald" on the account to be my writing, but not</p>
               <p>"Purser's steward," &amp;c. I remember Welb's writing, and believe his name in the column is not written by him. Reynolds's signature may be his writing, for he wrote a good hand - he is now at Bermuda. When I left the ship all the documents were left with Mr. Moore; when I left him the accounts were made out fairly, that was a month after Mr. Twynam's death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear that at Mr. Twyman's death the accounts were fairly made out? - A. I do; the account due for stop-grog was 30 l. at his death; all payments should be entered in the Purser's book at the time they are paid. Mr. Twynam entered them himself, the prisoner had the care of the books and the key was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. PLATT. Q. The prisoner took charge of Mr. Twynam's papers - A. Yes; he told me he had a necessary bill of 106 l. of Mr. Twynams, and that the money-bill amounted to 207 l., or 280 l. in all.</p>

            A. COLLIER. I commanded the Liverpool from 1818, to December 1821. The prisoner was Admiralty Clerk at the decease of Mr. Twynam; he had access to his papers. I cannot say who took possession of them; it is requisite for the Captain of vessels to certify documents as authentic.</p>
               <p>Q. On this voucher are two certificates purpoting to be yours - A. Upon looking at the signatures only, they are so like mine, I should almost say they were mine; but on looking at the document and the dates, I should not put my signature to such a document, because it says it is a payment made between 1818 and 1821, and between those dates short allowance money for stop and sick grog, payments had been made by Mr. Twyman, and it is impossible that some payments should not be made without a man coming to me to know why they were not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a certificate of the money being paid by the prisoner in the presence of yourself, were those payments made - A. Certainly not; he made a small payment after Mr. Twynam's death, but certainly not to this extent.</p>
               <p>Q. It states that the Purser has delivered you two accounts, &amp;c. - 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1096">A. </persName>
            He had the management of my accounts, and is the person who would transmit that account to the Victualling Office, he acted both as Purser and as my clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have known 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1097">Moore</persName>
             some time - A. I knew him from his joining the ship in 1818; he was Admiralty Clerk, and I do not hesitate to say, that since I have commanded a ship (which is from 1805.) that I ever had so good a clerk, nor ever had so little difficulty in passing my accounts at Somerset House, and never had them kept so closely as by him - he has had thousands of dollars which I was answerable for, and money of my own, all of which I always found correct; I had the highest opinion of him, he came to me with the strongest certificate of character.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left the vessel, were not his books left behind - A. I should think not; I do not know the nature of his accounts. I have signed some thousand documents while he was on board. During the time we were in India he was ill several times, and particularly after Mr. Twynam's death; we were sent to the Persian Gulph, and the illness was so serious he was alarmed, being a healthy man, and at times was quite childish, and crying; this was while he acted as Purser.</p>

               <p>Q. Was his mind in that state, that in making up his accounts it was very easy to make mistakes - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. Were any accounts sent to government at the time you were in the Persian Gulph - 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1098">A. </persName>
            No we had no means of sending; his illness was in August; we got to Bombay in September or October; then went to Penang, and there he left us; this was in November, 1821.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of July, I apprehended the prisoner at his lodgings, No. 4, Thanet-place, Temple-bar. I searched his lodgings three or four hours after, and found some papers there, which I wrote my name on before I parted with them (looking at them) these are the same - they were all in his bed-room, in one drawer; among them is a piece of black tracing-paper, and a long strip of paper with names on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that it was his bedroom - A. He said he lodged upon the second floor, and sent me there, and received the linen which I found there. I believe some account-books were there. I gave him every thing but these papers.</p>
               <p>MR. GOULD. I believe these papers to be Mr. Moore's writing.</p>
               <p>These were three accounts, apparently duplicates of the one set out in the indictment, but in the receipt column, some signatures appeared instead of marks; the sums varied; also the totals, as follow: - Bread 30 l. 17 s. 10 1/2 d. Spirits 71 l. 15 s. 3 1/2 d. Beef 12 l. 0 s. 9 d. Sugar 8 l. 17 s. 2 d. Total 123 l. 12 s. 2 d.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to MR. RICHARDSON. Q. Did you not in April last receive another document from the prisoner - A. Yes, (producing it) a letter accompanied it.</p>
               <p>A bill for 333 l. 10 s. 4 d., drawn by the prisoner, from Madrass, at thirty days sight, was here put in and read.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written affidavit, stating the account first sent was incorrect, being only a copy intended for his own information, which there being errors of 9 s. 5 1/2 d., 5 s. 0 1/2 d. 2 s. 0 1/2 d., and an omission of 15 l. 3 s. 1 d., which with 6 l. for the gun room; mess omitted made the difference, but the accounts were made up at the Persian Gulph at the time he was ill. He had the double duty of Purser and clerk to perform, that Mr. Twynam's accounts were in a very bad state, and the vouchers much obliterated and illegible; and it frequently happened that he was ordered by the men to write their names for them when they were called away to attend their duty.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDS. I received an account on the 28th of November, 1823, with 6 l. added for the gun room mess, the boys' savings are not added there; here is a letter I received on the 8th of April, 1824.</p>
               <p>(read.)</p>
               <p>This letter enclosed what is termed the nominal list, and stated that he had discovered the omission of the boys' savings, and requested Mr. Twynam's executors might be charged with the account, and that all the orders for the stoppage of grog being worn out, defaced, torn and rotten, it was found impossible to preserve.</p>
               <p>The nominal list being examined, tallied with the account put in of the amount of 123 l. 12 s. 2 d., the difference of that and of 101 l. 13 s., being accounted for by 6 l., for the gun room mess, and 15 l. 9 s. 2 d., omissions.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDS. The prisoner was apprehended on the 21st of July; enquiries had been making about his accounts from 1822. He knew the investigation was going on.</p>

On the 13th of July, about half-past seven in the evening, the two prisoners came to my shop; I was in the yard; my son called me to them. Sessions was the first who addressed me; he wished to look at a good silver double-case hunting-watch. I asked if they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160049"/>particular as to a hunter; he said yes, it must be a hunter, for it was for his brother in the country. I shewed them some watches, among which was the new case of a huntingwatch, the works not being quite complete. At that moment a gentleman came in to have his watch regulated, and I asked them to take a seat. I altered the gentleman's watch, and he went away; they both spoke, and made observations on the watches, and fixed upon a hunter, and asked if I could get it done by 12 o'clock next day. I said I would do my endeavours. I removed the silver watches on to the work-board. Sessions then said he wanted a a gold seal, key, and a steel chain. I said I did not keep jewellery, but they wished me to get it for them, as if they had it from me, they knew it would be good gold; I said I would procure them something which they might depend upon; they then left the shop, and were to call in an hour and a half to see the jewellery - it wanted a quarter to seven o'clock; my son went out after the jewellery, and in six or seven minutes they returned, and said, they supposed I had not got the jewellery yet; I said No - but it would soon be in, as my son had only to go to Leadenhall-street. Morgan then said, his mother had fixed that it must be a hunter, for his brother was so particular, and that it was to go a hundred miles into the country; he then looked about him and said,</p>
               <p>"My mother wishes to know if you have neat ladies gold watches - you seem to have some very nice watches." I took down the cases of two, the works of which were in a drawer, and said he could have one of those very soon, and I could recommend them. I then had a very fine double duplex watch in my hand; one of them observed, that it was a very handsome watch; he supposed it was gilt. I said it was gold, and the price 40 l.: they looked at it with the rest, and I put it down on my number-book, on the counter, with the two gold cases, and at that instant my son came in with the jewellery, and I removed the watch with the cases from the counter to the work-board, which is two feet eight or ten inches from where Sessions stood. I shewed them the jewellery; they said it was not what they wanted, their brother wanted a chased jud seal; my son instantly returned to fetch one, and at that time Sessions stood at the corner of the counter nearest to the work-board. Morgan placed himself at the end rather behind the counter, which I thought nothing of, as I had asked them to sit down before; and while my son was gone I proceeded to shew them the movements belonging to the gold cases they had been looking at. I had occasion to go about three paces from the counter to my desk; this gold watch, and some silver ones, were then behind me. I do not think I was at the desk more than a minute, when Morgan walked out of the shop. I saw him pass the window, but thought nothing of it, as it was a very opressive evening, I thought he went out for air. I proceeded to shew Sessions the movements of the watches; but instead of attending to it he said he was rather in a hurry, as he was going about some silk, and requested I would send the jud seal when it came, to their mother's, Mrs. Pratt, No. 1, America-square. I said if he would do me the favour to wait a few minutes, my son would be in, and he could see it himself; he said he could not wait, and walked out. My son met him on the threshold; he returned, and looked at the seal, and said it was just what was wanted, and if I could send it to his mother's; and saying,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Pratt, recollect No. 1, America-square - I wish you good night." He went out, my son came to the work-board, and we missed the gold watch. Nobody but them had been in the shop, and nobody else could have taken it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The place you moved it to was not convenient for them to take it - A. He could reach it with the greatest ease; it was between me and them when I went to my desk; his arm would have to pass me to reach it - it was a compleat watch; I have not found it. I never saw either of them before, but they were half an hour with me. I described them to a nicety to the officers. I went to Mrs. Pratt and found they knew nothing about them - if I had met them in the street I should have known them; I pointed them out in the lock-up-room mixed with others, six days after the robbery. My impression is that Sessions took it and handed it to Morgan as he went out.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the 13th of July, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in, and Sessions said, they were recommended to buy a second-hand silver hunting-watch - I immediately called my father from the yard; he shewed them several, and sent me to fetch one which he had lent to a gentleman; I returned and shewed it to them - Sessions said, if it was for him, he should prefer that; but his brother was so particular in his directions for a hunter, that he must have one. He mentioned about some gold seals, and then they left the shop. I went to fetch the seals, and on returning, they were both there - my father shewed them the seals, they wanted a jud one, and he sent me for one; and on my returning, Morgan was gone. Sessions was just going out, my father said,</p>

               <p>"Here is my son." I went round the counter and shewed him the seals; be fixed upon one, and said, if we sent it to his mother, Mrs. Pratt, America-square, they would decide on them and left; I directly after missed a gold watch which we should sell for 40 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you candles lighted - A. No; it was not dark - it was lighter than twi-light; I am certain of them.</p>

I went next morning with him, and he identified the prisoner, who was there without his coat; he was desired to put it on, and then he had no doubt of him.</p>

No; he said his brother was innocent, and his father could give nothing towards it; he called me to him as I was passing, I did not go to him.

            . I am a watchman. My beat is facing this field; between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the night of the 19th July, I was on duty there, and saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160051"/>prisoner - I knew him before personally, and cannot be mistaken in him. I saw him with a black poney - it had a bald face, and was about eleven hands high - it had a full eye and a wall eye; he had a birdle on it, and was leading it - he was in Green-street, three hundred yards from this field, leading it from the field, towards the New-road. I did not speak to him. I did not know whose pony it was, and have not seen it since; when I heard of the prosecutor's loss I told him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw it before - A. No. It was dark; I put my lantern up, and looked at the poney, so that I could pick it out from a thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not speak to him - A. His father and brother are in the habit of buying horses, I did not know but what it might be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you notice the poney - A. I knew him to be a suspicious character.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why not instantly say</p>
               <p>"Where did you get this poney" - A. I knew him well; I did not know whether it might be his or not: I did not speak to him. He came right past me, and I put my light right upon it as it passed by - he never stopped; my light shewed it as plain as possible. I did not know whether it was his or not, but I considered it my duty to take notice of it, in case it should be stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's father could keep a poney in the field if he chose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What light had you - A. A bull's-eye light, which is a very strong light; the horse brushed me - I was close to it. There is a bar across the road, and he brought the pony on the foot-path; he knew me very well, and saw me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he not time to put it back again before morning, as he saw you. A. He had - when I heard the horse coming, I hid my light, so that he did not see me till he came up; I thought it strange for a horse to come along there, as it is not a public road.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Which side was the wall eye - A. On the near side.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Sutton; on the 10th of December I bought a bay gelding of the prisoner; it was rather a dark bay - I gave him 10 l. for it - I have since shown it to Mr. Waterhouse and Mr. Holloway - I took a receipt for the money - this it (looking at it) read.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How near to Hounslow do you live - A. About a mile and a quarter - I had the gelding in my possession a month or more before the receipt was given - I had this and another of him - I paid for it on the day the receipt is dated; they were first lent to me to use, as they were not fit for coach work; I kept them for their use - when I had no further use for them I returned this one, and then he proposed to sell them - the proposition came from him - be fixed 12 guineas on this, and 5 on the other - I only bought this, and used it as occasion required, publicly; I gave a fair price for it; Mr. Waterhouse claimed it about July; I have known the prisoner ten years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the horse useful to you. - A. Yes, for slow work; I never communicated with Mr. Waterhouse about the sale of the horse.</p>

            . I carry on business at the Swan with Two Necks as a coach-master; the prisoner was in my employ fourteen or fifteen years - he conducted my business at Hounslow, where I keep from 70 to 100 horses, to forward stages to the west of England; I have stables there for their accommodation; he had no general power or authority from me to dispose of any horses, but has occasionally been directed to sell horses when they were unfit for my work; I have on some occasions fixed a price on them - I always fixed a price on each particular horse, not on a lot; he had no authority to sell any but what I directed and fixed a price for; I saw a gelding in possession of Mr. Cole, and know it to be mine; I never authorized him to sell it, nor did I know that it was sold, till about the middle of June; he had never apprised me of it, or sent the money, to account in any way whatever; I had seen him at least six or eight times between Christmas and June; I sometimes went to Hounslow, and he at times came to town; I never staid any time at Hounslow, and was never at Coles's except when I went to see the gelding - the prisoner lodged in a cottage of mine in my yard at Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you no partner - A. No, I have two sons who interfere in my business: they have no share in it. The prisoner was manager at Hounslow; there are six horse-keepers and two blacksmiths under him. I may have been there five or six times between Christmas and June. I did not miss any horse till June. My sons went down when I did not; but very seldom.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner been allowed to take a horse in payment of wages - A. Never. I have his accounts here. I have authorised him to sell horses for hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this; is it one of your orders - A. It is; it authorises the sale of a horse for four loads of hay. I think he left me the first or second week in June; every thing was settled between us, except some fixtures, and a small account he had against me. I had information about this horse after that; he claimed, for fixtures and other trifling matters, 22 l. odd., which I have paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these papers (producing them) are they not claims existing at present - A. They are not due from me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160052"/>I have no knowledge of them. I have paid White several bills for drugs and things which English has brought me. I never saw these before, to my knowledge. Good hay in December was about 1 l. a load. I have seen Mr. J. White lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him respecting some hay, which was delivered for this very horse - A. I had not - I recollect finding some very bad hay in my loft at Hounslow. White said he understood I had had some hay for this horse; my answer was, that I knew nothing of any being delivered to me for that horse, but that I had seen some very ordinary hay in my loft, and that on asking the prisoner where it came from, his answer was, that he had bought it of some person from a place called Firmly, and for which hay I paid him 7 l. I told White I had since been informed that no Frimly waggon brought it, but that they believed it had been sent from English's own field. White said he understood hay had been delivered for the horses. I told him I had been informed by a man in my yard, that four or five little one-horse jobs of hay had been brought; but I knew nothing of it myself: but it was from hearsay, not from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you told White you had only been told of it, not knowing it of your own knowledge - A. I said my man had informed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not asked whether you had been informed of it, but whether you told White you had been informed of it - A. I believe I did - I told him I had been told of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the management of the horses entirely in the prisoner's hands? - Yes, I went down five or six times to look over the stock, and see what condition they were in, if fit for work; but they were never all in the stable at once. I never enquired about those which were absent. The prisoner had 1 l. 1 ls. per week, and a house to live in; he frequently came to town for money; and if not it was sent down: he never told me he had sent this gelding to Cole, either to use or any other purpose. I paid him what he claimed after he left me; most of it was for fixtures, which he had bought several years ago in a house of mine. I have looked over his books; there is no account of any money received of Cole, or of hay being received and paid for by this horse. I never told him to swap the horse for hay. I have certain horses, but not this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long is it since this book was in the prisoner's possession - A. I believe he had it up to May last. When horses were unfit for work, it was reported to me generally by the coachman - it was not his duty to report them; there were generally twelve or fifteen extra horses at Hounslow. I never received an account of this horse being disabled either from him or the coachman.</p>
               <p>MR. COLE. I gave 10 l. for the horse, not hay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have been in the prosecutor's service twenty-four years, during that period I repeatedly sold horses, not only by desire of the prosecutor, but by the direction of his two sons. On the 1st of September, 1823, Mr. Joseph ordered me to sell the horse in question for four loads of hay, which were cut and sent from my place to the prosecutor's stable immediately after; not having immediate use for the horses, I sent them to Mr. Cole, who afterwards bought the horse in question.</p>

               <p>WM. BULMER. I have known the prisoner ever since he has been at Hounslow; he occupies several acres of land of mine; I do not know whether it is grass or arable; it is an enclosure on the heath.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I have been subpoened here on behalf of the prisoner. I remember his bringing a bay gelding to town in September; he wished to take it back to Hounslow to do odd work at my father's farm, and it was to be worked as a stage horse if it was wanted. I did not know of its being sold; it was brought to town to be sold, but he wished to take it back with another, that it might not be sold, as he wanted it for odd work - he never told me that he intended to, or had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he inform you that he had supplied your father with hay, and should take it for the hay - A. He did not. I did not learn that it was sold till after he left my father. My brother interferes very little, and has nothing to do with the Hounslow business, or with buying and selling of horses without my father's authority.</p>

               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Will you swear that you did not know of a bay mare being charged to him in the accounts - A. I do not know of any mare being charged to him, or his being debited for one. I gave directions for the sale of a bay mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this book, whose writing is it - A. It is all in the writing of Mr. Emans, my father's clerk, except the initials at the bottom, which are my father's. I know of no horse being sold to Howe in November last; he has at times had a horse or two, but I cannot speak to periods. I had a conversation with the prisoner about the two horses; I do not recollect putting a value upon them - we do not fix a price, but send them to the Repository for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say if four loads of hay could be got for these two horses it would do - 
               <persName id="t18240916-138-person1183">A. </persName>
            - I have no recollection of his saying anything of the sort, and have no hesitation in swearing that he did not. I should not have taken four loads for them, as I think them worth 25 l. or 28 l. The one Cole bought was worth 12 l. or 14 l. He never told me that he had disposed of this horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever directly or indirectly empower him to part with it for hay - A. Positively not; it is almost impossible to charge one's recollection; but to the best of my knowledge, I never gave him such instructions.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. COLE. Q. How far from Hounslow was this gelding kept - A. About a mile and a quarter - it was kept in my stables; it has been out in the field for the last two months - the fields join the private road, which is much frequented, and I used it on the public road, five or ten times - I knew that it was the prosecutor's; he said he had no work for it.</p>
               <p>MR. WATERHOUSE, SEN. When I wanted horses to be sold, I gave the prisoner directions for it. I have given him orders to sell five or six at least, while he has been with me.</p>

            , of Dean-street, Soho - it is partly let out in lodgings by me. I received the rents, lived and slept there, and do so now. I know the prisoner - in March last, he applied to me to let him have one room on the first floor, to place articles of his own trade in it - he is a <rs id="t18240916-139-deflabel758" type="occupation">builder, carpenter, and bricklayer</rs>

I saw some goods in the room four or months ago; there was woollen clothes and wearing apparel; and articles of his own trade, and carpenters tools. I think myself that all the property in the room then was worth 100 l., or a little more; this was about five months back. I had not seen the room for four months before the fire happened; I then saw these things in it - the fire happened on Saturday, the 14th of August, about ten o'clock at night. On the Thursday previous to that, I told him I wished to have the room to sleep in myself, and he must move his things to another apartment, or take them to his own lodgings. I said I should want it, and wished him to move his things on the Saturday; he said he could not take them to his lodgings. I said I had spare closets in the house, and he might put them there; he said the woollen cloths and things which he had would take up more room than I had, and the moths would get into them. It was at last settled that he should move them into some of the closets; he did not move any. This conversation took place at the Obelisk, in Surry, not on the premises. On Saturday evening, the 14th, I was at home, and saw him there. I went out about a quarter to ten o'clock, and left him there; he had been backwards and forwards for three or four hours in the middle of the day. He had been in the house one or two hours, when I went out at a quarter to ten o'clock. I returned about a quarter past ten: and in consequence of an alarm, went up to his room, and in the recess by the fire-place, was a jean coat on fire, and a sack on fire; the shelves, in the recess, were on fire, and the room full of smoke; one or two fireman, and others, were in the room. I assisted in extinguishing it, by throwing water on it, which people brought; I threw some into the recess near the fire-place. I observed the chimney jam, which is a partition of wood, close to the recess, and forms part of the room; that was burnt; the jean coat hung on a nail on the left hand side of the recess. I saw a sack on the chimney jam; that was nearly consumed; it was suspended from the jam by a bradawl. There were some oil and turpentine cans in the recess; nothing was in them, but I had used some turpentine sometime before, and knew that one was a turpentine can. There was a stone bottle, which appeared to have a mixture of oil and turpentine in the same recess with the cans. The room is about fifteen feet by twelve. I looked into the cupboard, which is in the cross corner, to the fireplace, and found a hat-box there, with smoke in it, and then I saw a waistcoat laying on the shelf, almost entirly consumed by fire; it had burnt the edge of the shelf. There was a loose board reared up from the floor to the edge of the shelf; that board was burnt, by being attached to the wainscoat, and the edge of the shelf. An oil cask was in the cupboard; it appeared to contain oil and turpentine - perhaps about a quart of it. The cupboard floor was covered with pieces of wood, shavings, and pieces of letters and papers, steeped in oil; there were a great many shavings and wood. I saw an apron in the cupboard about half-burnt; a sheet of brown paper was hung at the back of the apron, and partly behind, a pair of fustian trowsers, which hung up; the trowsers appeared to have been dipped in turpentine. The cupboard is on the side of the room near the staircase, and a crack in it was filled up with rag: if that had been left open any person could have seen a light in the cupboard if there had been one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe anything on the floor of the room - A. A pair of mahogany doors, which lay on the same side of the room, as the cupboard was scorched with rags, which had been laid on it, dipped in turpentine. There had been fire in the recess on the mahogany door, and the door of the room was blistered all over, but had no fire on it. There was also fire in the cupboard, and on the chimney jam. The four places where I observed fire were completly distinct from each other; a hole was boared in the ceiling of the room, four or five inches wide each way, and the laths exposed: there was a hole in the plaister in the side of the room, about the same size as the other, and the laths exposed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the room - A. A saw, a few planes, locks, and nails; the mahogany door, one pair of nankeen breeches, and a coat; the value of the whole is about 5 l. That is all that was in the room. Part of the floor was burnt in the recess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You yourself formerly lived in the Strand - Yes; I was unfortunate, and took the benefit of the Insolvent Act, and lived in the Rules of the Bench. I ceased to reside in the Strand in January. I was liberated in March, and then still lived at No. 97, Strand. This was about five months before the fire. I occupied all the upper part of the house. Wilkinson and Co., who were glass dealers, occupied the lower part of the kitchen; they continued there after I came back, till about two months before the fire. The prisoner did not reside with us; he had no other room, except that the fire was in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had bought the lease of the house and the fixtures for you, had he not - A. No; I stated to my assignees that I had parted with the lease for 50 l.; it is returned in my schedule; it is held for 50 l., but with no assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not sold the fixtures to the prisoner for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160055"/>25 l. - A. No. I had not parted with my interest in the fixtures.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this receipt - A. It is not my writing; there had been an execution put into my house, Mr. Eddes was the broker employed; he sold the goods under the execution, and the fixtures; that was about five months before the fire. Mr. 
               <persName id="t18240916-139-person1208">Preston</persName>
             the landlord did not live in the house. There might be 100 l. worth of goods in the prisoner's room in March.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a builder, and without improper motives he would be in possession of oil-cans - A. They were in his possession for that purpose, and had been so for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You took the benefit of the act in March, and returned to No. 97, Strand directly - A. Yes, and it was after that time I had conversation with the prisoner about the room; I have lived there, and received the rents from the lodgers ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not Ball give the receipts for the rent - A. Never; I always gave them. Wilkinson and Co. were to pay 130 l. a year, but never paid anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not understood that they were to pay it to the prisoner - A. Yes; because I employed him when I could not act myself to let that apartment to them; he was my agent, and was to receive the money from them if they had paid. Preston was the landlord.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I now live in Plumbtree-street, Bloomsbury. I work for Mr. Fearn, as a tailor. On the 14th of August I was working for him at No. 97, Strand, in the room over that in which the fire was; I had worked there a fortnight. The prisoner had the back room under where we work, and Miss Davis had the front. I saw the prisoner three times on the afternoon of the fire; he kept his room padlocked; I saw him first about two o'clock in the afternoon; he came up for a pair of pantaloons: he came up again about five o'clock, and staid with us half an hour each time; I cannot say whether he went into his room. He came up into the workshop again about eight, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well you are hard at it;" he had no light with him - I asked him to go down and ask Mr. Fearn for some calico - he said he would, and I gave him a bit of brown paper lighted, as he said he must have a light to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for the light before or after you desired him to go down - A. After; the paper was about six inches long; he went to the top of the stairs, returned, and said he must have another light, as that had gone out; I then gave him a strip of white breeches cord, about a foot long and two inches wide, twisted it round, and drew it through the candle, to make a sort of candle of it - I lighted it, and gave it to him - he went away, and I saw no more of him that night; he did not return with the calico. When he was gone we heard a rattling on the landing-place below; it was like a chain rattling; I remained at work till nearly twelve o'clock. About half-past ten my shopmate and I were very drowsy; I laid down on the board, and smelt fire and burnt wood - I got off, and looked under the board, thinking the fire was there, but it was not; I wrapped up my work, and was going down stairs: I saw Mr. Wood prizing the prisoner's room door open; I ran and brought up a pail of water: the door was then open. I did not go in, but ran and fetched another pail, handed it up to Wood or Skeel, and saw fire thrown out of the recess by some one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what time did he come up for the pantaloons - A. About two o'clock. He asked for a light when I desired him to go down; that was a little after eight; I asked him to go. Half a pail of water put out all the fire that was in the room when I was there, but I had brought up two full pails before, and Skeel fetched two, and the watchman some. I stumbled and spilled half of my third pail.</p>

The door of his room was kept padlocked on the outside. About ten o'clock on this night there was a smell of fire; I opened my door, and saw a light underneath the prisoner's door, and gave an alarm. Wood came up, and tried to break it open with a poker in two or three places before he succeeded; he went down for a pair of pinchers - Skeel came up, and at last they got it open; there was a deal of smoke.

I came home about nine o'clock, and about twenty minutes past nine Ball came into Fearn's room, where I was - Mrs. Fearn was there; he spoke to her, and then came in and sat down near to her; she observed what a smell there was of turpentine; he said he had been cleaning his coat, but it was some hours since, and he thought she would not have smelt it; he remained in the room about twenty-five minutes altogether; Fearn came in when he had been there about twenty minutes, and said,</p>
               <p>"Aye Ball, are you here non; at this time of night?" he said he had been to the coffee-shop five or six times that day, and had stepped in. Mr. and Mrs. Fearn went out of the room; he remained there, and said he wished he was where I had come from, meaning the Borough, where I work; he then went on the landing-place, and called to Mrs. Fearn to know if Mr. Fearn was gone out - she said he was, but he would return very shortly; he waited on the landing-place a few minutes, and then went up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Would that lead to his room - A. Yes. He came down in six or seven minutes; I saw him pass the door of the room I was in: he went down stairs. I did not see him again till about two o'clock in the morning. An alarm of fire was given about ten, by Miss Davis; he had then been gone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I went up to his room, and saw a light under the door, which was padlocked; I got on my knees to look into the room to see if he was there, and saw fire in the room, and smoke came out. I got a poker from one of the lodgers, and broke it into three pieces in trying to open the door: I went down got some pinchers, and opened it - the two Mr. Skeel's came up with me. On opening the door I saw fire in the corner, and immediately got water up as fast as I could; the smoke was very great indeed. I carried up three or four pails of water myself, and Skeel brought up more; several persons were carrying water. We put the fire out. I perceived that the recess next the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160056"/>chimney on the left side had been on fire, and several turpentine cans and oil jars there - the jam of the chimney and cupboard were burnt. When I opened the door I saw the jam, and the corner blazing. I saw a tub in the cupboard with a mixture of oil and turpentine; one corner of a wainscot was under the tub, and the other part hung down, and was completely burned. Some paper was in the cupboard dipped in oil, and a bonnet box was smoked in the inside, and appeared to have been washed in turpentine - it was a band-box, made of thin wood and paper. I saw an apron on the left-hand side of the cupboard; the edge of it was burnt, and a pair of trowsers in the cupboard appeared to have been steeped in turpentine. A large piece of wood stood up edgeways in the cupboard - it was burnt, if it set fire to at the bottom, it would lead to the shelf; some rag was found, steeped in turpentine. The property in the room was worth about 6 l.; there was a mahogany door, a saw, planes, and locks - there was no furniture, nor any woollen cloth or clothes, except an old coat. The cupboard shelf was burnt at the edge.</p>

I was in Mr. Fearne's house on this night - an alarm was given; I went up stairs, and broke open the door - the room was full of smoke; some water was brought to Wood; I took it from him, and threw it in, as I could see the chimney jam a light, though I could not enter the room for smoke; I threw it on the jam. I saw apparently a bundle of rags, or something nailed or hung on something against the wall, by the jam; they were a light also. I threw in one or two pails of water; the smoke then cleared away a little; we went in, and threw more water, and put the fire out. I looked into the closet; there was no fire in there then, but several marks of fire having been there - the cupboard door was shut - I saw some shavings; a painting brush was in the tub. I observed the room door - some of the stuff out of this tub appeared to have been smeared over it with the brush; I felt it, and it was quite wet, and came off on my hand.</p>

On the night of the fire, about ten o'clock, I was in the Strand, heard an alarm, and instantly fetched my engine - I got back in about ten minutes, and went up into the room - the fire was then out - I went to the recess, and found it very hot; part of it was burnt - two shelves in the recess were burnt; the chimney jam was burnt a good deal - I have it here (producing it;) the jam was about half a foot from the grate; there had been no fire in the grate, if there had been, an accident could not have caused the jam to be burnt. I saw the floor of the room in the recess; two boards of it were burnt; here is one of them - there had been fire in the cupboard; one place could not have set fire to the other; they were quite distinct. The things in the room were worth 4 l. or 5 l. Here are the remains of the trowsers, coat, and waistcoat; they were quite wet with turpentine, as if they had been put into it. A mixture of oil and turpentine was in the cask.</p>

             re-examined. I lodge in the house, and sleep with my brother William, who occupies the lower part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, it is unfortunate for any one to be accused of such a charge, even if found innocent, and if found guilty I am aware of the consequences, and therefore hope you will give the utmost consideration to the circumstances in which I am placed. The articles found in my room are articles used in my business; oil-cans and paint pots are common to every one who gets their living as I do - I brought nothing into the house clandestinely; what goods<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160057"/>I took out I took openly. It is not likely a man should insure six or eight months ago, and the goods of that nature, that keeping them would lessen their value - that I should keep them four months, and go to the office, and say,</p>
               <p>"Such a place is burnt, and I have so much goods in it;" the first question would be,</p>
               <p>"Where is a voucher - did you sell none of them?" would any office believe I could keep them six months, and never sell any. Mr. Fearn says I had 100 l. worth of goods, but I paid pawnbrokers 120 l. for these goods, and I sold them. The business I then intended to follow did not suit me, and when I had sold them I declined it. Now, about the things being sprinkled with turpentine; there were pots, jars, and all things; it was a lumber room, and it was not likely I should put broad cloth and clothes there when once moved out - but when they were moved, I put these things on; the reason I moved my goods from the premises was, that on the first night Mr. Fearn occupied the house I lost a cloth measuring fifteen yards; I sold the rest for fear I should lose more; I think the suspicion attached to their removal will be worn out in a great measure by the time I had them; I never pretended to have more - and therefore should never be such a fool as to attempt to impose on the Company, by saying I had such goods; the fire was discovered to have happened near the fire-place, and of all parts of the house that was the most unlikely to succeed; it is built of brick, and there is a small nook containing ironmongery, and this it is said I set on fire, when the other parts were timber; I was not in the room for two hours before it broke out, and the article described to be entirely consumed is a sack - is that a likely thing to be used for such a purpose? then a jean jacket is partly burnt - that paper was dipped in oil and mixed with shavings, and brown paper hung up; is it likely the waistscoat should be nearly consumed, and the paper at the back of it not touched, nor at all singed. Now it remains for me to account why the articles in the closet were burnt. - I built two houses in Bermondsey - and one evening a few shavings caught fire on the floor - to put it out I threw what first came in my way on it, and among other things, this apron and some other woollen things; a board is brought here from the closet - is it likely that it should be so much burnt, and the oil and paper among it not destroyed? - the fact is, they were brought from this house, and put into the closet; the oil and shavings, which are so easily ignited, are not burnt, and yet other things not so easily set fire to, are almost wholly burnt: I know nothing of the hole in the cupboard being stuffed up; the light was seen under the door, and any carpenter knows how to stop up the space under a door; although so careful in stopping the hole with rag, yet it seems I was so negligent as to leave the door where every one must see unstopped: when I got the light I went openly to the men who were going up and down stairs - I did not get a phosphorous box; they say they heard a chain jingle - when the asp of the padlock drops it will chink; I have been afflicted with rheumatism, and having left my stick in the room, I went in with this light for my stick: I blowed the candle out, and threw it towards the fire-place; if I had stooped to put it down, it would have inconvenienced me; in the fire-place were bits of cloth, which I had used to clean my clothes with, by rubbing them with turpentine: I used to sweep the pieces of cloth in, and seldom cleaned the fireplace - they being there, the fire might have ignited them, and the jam being only half a foot off, it could easily catch fire, and then set fire to the nook; but I positively state I had no such intention. As to the door beeing splashed, I had been in the habit of rubbing my paint brushes against it to get the oil off, when I wanted to clean them; the door and walls were rubbed in this way, and the brick work too - there was no wood work affixed to the jam, so that if it had burnt, the house could not have burnt; I now submit my case to your consideration, and declaring my innocence, I rely on your verdict.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market. On the evening of the 24th of March, the prisoner redeemed some property at our house - I believe he had bought the tickets - he paid 38 l. 9 s 6 d; on the following day he redeemed property to the amount of 2 l. 2 s, making 40 l. 1 ls 6 d with interest; he took out one end of cloth for 7 l.; I should think it worth 14 l. or 15 l.; they were pawned in the name of Matthews, the last witness; he is the man who pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner had bought the duplicates - A. I suppose so; I cannot state from memory what the transactions were, and I have not got my book here - I recollect his redeeming a large quantity of property - wearing apparel and cloth.</p>
               <p>- VAUGHN. I am a pawn-broker, and live in St. Martin's-lane; I do not know the prisoner; I delivered some goods to Matthews on the 25th of March.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not help to load some pieces of wood and rubbish into Lowe's cart, and send it of by Matthews - A. Yes; there were oil jars, paint pots, a band-box with papers in it - it was about the latter end of March - I do not know where they went to.</p>

            . I am the wife of Charles Bates - we live in Borough-road. On the 10th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner hired a truck of me for three hours, and said he was going to draw hardware in it - I said he must leave 1 s. deposit; he said he had not got one, but would go home and fetch one; that he lived at No. 15, Clifford-street, Blackfriars-road, and his name was Roberts. Seeing him a decent man I said,</p>

               <p>"Never mind, bring it when you return the truck; it is 3 d. an hour." He took it away, and said he would return it in three hours.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOSWORTH. I am a labourer, and live in Gray's Inn lane. On the 10th of November, between three and four o'clock, I was crossing Smithfield, and saw the prisoner by the Bear and Ragged Staff, public-house, with a truck, and asked him if it was for sale - he said he did not know, but he would call the person who belonged to it, and while I was speaking to him a man came up, of whom I bought it, in the prisoner's presence, for 15 s. The officer came up and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRANSCOMB. I am an officer. I was in Smith-field, and in consequence of information I went up to this truck; the prisoner and Bosworth came out of the public-house; I asked the prisoner if the truck belonged to him - he said it did: Bosworth said he had just bought it; I said I must take the prisoner into custody, and at that moment the man who I understood had received the money, ran out of the public-house, and escaped. Bates claimed the truck - his name was on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man who received the money persuaded me to borrow it for him.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with me - she came on the 10th of June, and on the 15th I went out at two o'clock in the afternoon; I left her and my daughter Charlotte Reed, in the one pair back room: the prisoner was to wait for me to go with her. I returned about ten minutes before three o'clock, and missed her, and the articles stated in the indictment. I afterwards went to Knightsbridge, but did not see her till the 17th of July, when I met her in the Park, and asked her to give me my things, and I would not hurt her; she said she did not know what I meant. I then asked her to walk with me to Piccadilly; she made some objections, and then ran away - I overtook her, and she walked with me a little way; I took her to the Curd and Whey house, and waited for an officer. I asked her if she would give me the things or the duplicates - she said she did not know what I meant - I told her the things were worth 4 l.; she said she had not a quarter of that money; she had laid them in the drawer shortly before I went out, and pretended to lock the drawer, and gave me the key, but I found the bottom drawer was not locked. I took my gloves out, and then locked them - when I came back they had been wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICH. Q. Where had the prisoner lodged before she came to you - A. With Mr. Shedding. I did not request her to come and lodge at my house - there was no application made by my daughter to her - my daughter did not ask me if she might come. I went out about two o'clock, and when I returned I was to go with her to meet some gentleman in Regent-street; I do not know his name; it was not Mr. Withnal. I came home about ten minutes before three o'clock. I found the drawer shut, but unlocked. I went to Knightsbridge, and saw Mr. Withnal, and told him to tell her to return my things, and that I would have some hand-bills printed if I could afford it, to have her taken up. I did not want her to give me 4 l., but I said the value of them was 4 l. I did not say at Marlborough-street, nor in the Park, that if she would give me 4 l. I would say no more about it.</p>

As I was going to work about twenty minutes before six o'clock, in the morning of Monday, the 16th of August; I saw a man go into Mr. Haddon's house, and two other men stood waiting for him outside. I stood talking to a shopmate of mine, and the man came out of the house again with a copper tied in a brown cloth, and the three went away together. I am positive to the persons of all the prisoners. I think Shields was the one who brought the copper out, he was not in the house more than two minutes; they all went up Baldwin-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160060"/>together. I followed after them, but did not raise any alarm; by the time I got half way up the street they were returning without the copper. I did not see were they had disposed of it. I did not speak to them. nor give any information till night. When I left work I then went and enquired who was the landlord of the house, and told the people at the green shop of it, and then went to Mr. Haddon and told him, when the prisoners returned. Avery had the cloth under his arm, which appeared to me to be the same that the copper had been taken away in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Where were you while this was going on - A. I was in the causeway talking to Hook; he is not here. We, each of us, had a load, and did not attempt to stop them. I told my shopmates of the transaction, and the next day I saw Avery and Battams passing my shop, and had them taken up. If I had stop them that morning I must have put down my tools, and might have lost them. I swear that it was a copper; it was not tied so close but I could see that.</p>

I had not seen the copper for three weeks or a month.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you given up this building to any one - A. No, nor assigned it to my one. I did not see it fitted, but every copper would not have fitted the place, because there are some indentures in it, which I had seen.</p>

I live in Old-street, about two hundred yards from Baldwin-street; it was brought between nine and ten o'clock in the day; I believe Shields to be the man who brought it.

I was called on Monday morning about ten o'clock, by the last witness, to purchase the copper - he is my shopman - only one man came with it. I asked Smith if it was fit for use, he said No, it was only old copper; he then weighed it - it was near 16 lbs., but there was a good deal of dirt and soot, which generally adberes to second-hand copper. I paid for 15 lbs. at 8 d per lb. the person gave his address</p>

            . I am headborough of Shoreditch. I found the copper on Tuesday morning, about half-past eleven o'clock. I was at a public-house, in Teuter-row, City-road, and heard that two men were coming down who had taken the copper. Fordham was with me and pointed out Avery and Battams to me. I told them they were my prisoners, and the charge was about a copper; they said they knew nothing about it. I took them to the watch-house - Shield was not taken till the second examination I went to Mr. Haddon's house, and in the kitchen there was a lid of a copper; the carpenter put the copper into the place, there was a little bend in the top of it, he turned it round, and it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The carpenter seemed to understand it very well. - A. Yes; the carpenter was at work, and the prisoner passed his shop, and then he came to me and told me of it: I saw the shopmate of the carpenter about a week ago, and gave him notice that he might be wanted here - he said he did not wish to trouble himself about it.</p>

            . I am a patrole.

               <p>"What are you doing with that property?" the woman said, his name is William, and he gave it to me to take care of; I said,</p>
               <p>"We will go back to William, and hear what he says;" I went and awoke him - he said it was his: Smith said,</p>

On the morning of the robbery, about half-past five o'clock, after I had been to the watch-house and left my coat, I met the prisoner in Kingsland-road, about half a mile from the watch-house, going towards London, in a direction from the prosecutor's house, with something in a bag on his shoulder - he was alone: I collared him, and enquired what he had got; he said</p>
               <p>"What is that to you" - I took him the watch-house: the bag had some lead in it, which weighed 53 lbs.: the edges were bright, as if fresh cut - it was afterwards claimed by Mr. Honeysett: I saw it placed in the gutter, and it fitted exactly: the prisoner gave no account how he came by it: there was some more lead found that morning; I had seen the prisoner at twelve o'clock, and again at three, with two others, coming from a ditch where some lead was afterwards found.</p>

            . I live with my father and mother in Queen-square. I came home on this Sunday night, but I cannot tell at what time; my brother was in bed first. When I came home I let myself in, and asked my mother whether I should fasten the door - she was in her bed-room, but awoke, and answered,</p>
               <p>"Yes, they are all in." I had been at Hoxton Academy-chapel, and then went with some young men to take a walk, and then met some young women, and went home with them; but I am certain I got home before twelve o'clock. I awoke the next morning, when my brother was dressing, and asked him what time it was: he looked at the watch, and said it was not five. I cannot tell whether he had been out before; I did not know of his being taken up till Wednesday or Thursday. I think it was my sister who told me, when I enquired on Tuesday morning why he had not come, she said he had slept at his master's. I came home on Tuesday night, they were all in bed: I did not enquire on Wednesday morning, because they were not up when I went out. On Wednesday night I asked where Samuel was; they began to cry, and then told me he had been taken up. I think it was impossible he could have gone out without my seeing him - I had double-locked the door, and put the key in my coat pocket; there are not two keys to the door.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Allen; the barn was robbed on Monday night. I had seen it all safe the night before; between two and three bushels of wheat was stolen. I saw the prisoner the same night close to the barn; he appeared asleep - I had seen him about six o'clock in the evening, when I left the barn; it was locked outside, and pinned within - the thief got in at the window, which I found open.</p>

I ran in the direction Mr. Cartwright told me, and caught sight of the prisoner; when two hundred yards from my master's shop, he was then alone, and had the carpet under his arm; I did not lose sight of him until I stopped him, when I called Stop thief! he dropped it. I am quite sure I saw him drop it; I held him untill my master came up, and told him to take up the carpet and carry it back to the shop, which he did. I had seen it about ten minutes before in the fore court; he said,</p>
               <p>"For God sake let me go."</p>

I am certain I had it when I went there; I awoke about half past seven, and she was gone, and my watch also, which I had put under the pillow. I did not see James M'Carthy till he was at Queen-square; I saw the watch on Tuesday morning; I made known my loss in the house; I did not know the prisoner's name at the time, but I have no doubt that she is the person; I cannot exactly swear it. I spoke to no other woman in the house but her, the door was locked inside when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time did you go there - A. About half-past eleven o'clock. I had nothing to eat nor drink there. I went to sleep soon after, and did not awake till half-past seven. I was sober enough - I had not had two pots of beer, nor any other liquor - I had had half a pint of ale; I was to sleep at my master's stable. I gave her 6 s. When I awoke the door was shut, but not locked, and she was gone. I cannot swear that the prisoner is the person I slept with.</p>

            . I live at No. 50, Whitcomb-street. The female prisoner did not live there. I had known her six months, and had seen her at the house several times. I saw her in the prosecutor's company on Sunday night, the 25th July. I am servant in the house. Mrs. Curry keeps the house. I showed them to a bed-room, and left them there. Brown went away about seven o'clock in the morning; I am quite sure she is the person who came with Black; - he went away about half-past seven o'clock, and complained of losing his watch. There was no other person in the house, and no one had been there from the time Brown went till Black complained of his loss. When he came in at night I saw the ribbon of his watch. There was no other person went in or out of the house from the time they came in at night till Brown went away the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What, are you servant of all work - A. Yes; there had been visitors in the house in the evening, before they came in. I sleep in the three-pair of stairs, and Mrs. Curry in the back parlour. I opened the house just before seven o'clock, and saw Brown go out. We shut up between eleven and twelve. There is no other door to the room. I have seen M'Carthy before, but not on that day. They have been to our house together before.</p>

            . I am a watch and clockmaker, and live in Great Chapel-street, Westminster. About six o'clock on Monday afternoon, the 26th of July, M'Carthy offered me a valuable silver watch for sale; I do not think it had any appendages but a ribbon; he wanted five sovereigns for it; I told him I did not want it, and did not ask how he came by it. I have not the smallest doubt of his person; he was then in his regimental dress, as a drummer. I saw him in custody next morning, and was positive of him. I afterwards saw this watch at the Police-office, and have no doubt of its being the same.</p>

My son asked me to look at it; I asked what he wanted; he said 3 l. I said whose property is it? he said it was his own. I said I knew it could not be his own, it was stolen property. I sent for an officer, and gave charge of him. The watch was produced at Queen-square, and sworn to by Black. It is worth seven guineas and a half, or 8 l.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the woman on Tuesday morning, the 27th, and asked if she knew M'Carthy, the drummer; she said she did not. I asked where she lived; she said she would show me, and took me to several places. I searched her, and found twelve duplicates; one of them was for M'Carthy's Waterloo medal. I showed Brown to M'Carthy, and asked him if he knew her - they both said they did not know each other. She had a gown on, and when M'Carthy was searched at the Hoop and Grapes, public-house a piece of this gown was in his pocket, and in her box another.</p>

Bryan then went into another haberdasher's shop and staid a few minutes - then came out; they joined again, and when they got to Well-street Cane took off his hat and Bryan took something from his apron and put it into the hat. I, with some assistance, took them into custody - and from Cane's hat I took this scarf and shawl.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre. On the 2d of September, I saw the prisoner with another man, the prisoner had a sack of fat on his shoulder. I followed them up Sharpe's-alley - they rested under the gateway, and seemed to look to see if any one was following them. I saw the prisoner assist the other up with the sack - they went into White-horse-alley. I then stopped the other with the sack, and took hold of the prisoner, who struggled so, I was obliged to let the other go.</p>

On the 13th of April, I was sitting at dinner with my brother; who, being an invalid, invariably has pudding for dinner, and a desert spoon is laid to him only. The prisoner was in the room; I thought I would have some pudding, which I seldom take. I called for a desert spoon; instead of which he brought a tea-spoon; I said,</p>
               <p>"Is there no desert-spoons in the house - what do you mean by this?" He went out of the room, and returned in four or five minutes, and laid a spoon on the table; which upon looking at, I discovered not to be ours; it belonged to Dr. Tweedy. I said,</p>
               <p>"Hallo! what is all this? what have you done with the plate?" he immediately bolted out of the door without his hat, and ran off. I did not see him again till last Monday fortnight, when I found him at the sign of the Exeter Arms public-house. I had advertised him, and taken every step to find him. The moment he left, I examined, and missed plate to the amount of 20 or 30 l. at least. I have found most of it in pawn. I had given the plate into his care, when he came into my service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. I believe Ely-place is extra parochial - A. It is considered so; we pay for lighting, paving, &amp;c. ourselves, but we consider ourselves in St. Andrew's parish. They call on us occasionally for particular rates; we are exempted as belonging to the Bishop's Palace; Ely-place and Thaves-inn are both in the the same situation; we pay no poor-rates. The prisoner was about a year and a half in my service.</p>

               <p>HENRY BROOKS. I live next door to Mr. Scott. I concealed myself under his kitchen-stairs to watch about ten o'clock, and about half-past ten o'clock I saw the prisoner come out of the shop, down the kitchen-stairs into the yard, he began whistling very loud; he then came to the back door, and seemed listening; he then pulled off his apron and shoes and made off up stairs, I slipped out of the closet, and stood against the kitchen window. He came down to fetch his shoes from the yard, and I laid hold of him, and fetched an officer who searched him.</p>

            . These sovereigns are mine, and are part of the 25 l., I only missed two. I have a mark on them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. He had an opportunity of taking them all? - A. Certainly. He was about twelve days in my service.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he an opportunity of going up stairs twice, and taking a sovereign each time? - A. That is impossible; he came about seven o'clock in the morning; I was in the shop with him all the time, and kept my eye upon him all the morning; he was not out of my sight till he went down stairs, and in five minutes he was taken. My box was not locked.</p>

            , and live at Wattleton Farm, Beaconsfield. On the 7th of September I had a bay gelding for which I gave 20 l. I was called up about one o'clock in the morning, and went to the meadow where my horse was placed overnight. I found the gate of the meadow broken, and the horse gone. I immediately went home, saddled a horse, and started instantly in pursuit of it. I took the London road, and came up with the prisoner on Ealing Common, 17 miles from Beaconsfield; he was riding my bay gelding, and leading a black poney; mine was the largest horse of the two. This was about half-past three o'clock; I had started from Beaconsfield at two; I had rode very hard all the way: the knees of my breeches were left unbuttoned in my hurry of dressing. I asked him if he was going to London; he said he was. I asked where he came from; he said from below Birmingham. He seemed to look a good deal at the knees of my breeches not being buttoned, and noticed me. He then began to say that he had not had the horses long in his possession; that a gentleman on an iron-grey horse put them into his hand. I asked where he was going to take them; he said to the sign of the Nag's Head, in Oxford Street. I had not told him that one of them was mine, as I wished to keep him in conversation until somebody came to assist me. He drew on one side of the road, and observed that he taken some beer at Uxbridge which did not agree with him, and he must get off. He jumped off the horse: I wheeled round and caught him by the collar. He struggled a good deal. I told him he had got my horse; he being on the ground, got me off the saddle; I continued to struggle with him, I was obliged to loose him, and while I was recovering my seat, he mounted the black pony and went off at full speed. I followed, and when he got about two hundred yards. I caught him by the collar. I drove him into Acton; he then turned to the left up a bye road. I caught him by the tail of his coat, and should have pulled him off the horse, but the tail gave way; his coat came off in my hands. He went off again at full speed, and got into the turnpike road again. I kept close to him all the way; I caught him by the collar about two hundred yards from Acton; he instantly dismounted and jumped over a hedge into a field; I got off my horse and caught him about forty or fifty yards off; and gave him in charge to the watchman of Acton. I am certain the gelding he was riding is mine, it is now at home. I bought it in August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Do you live with your father? - A. I do. The horse works in his business, and eats his corn; but I bought it with my money, intending to sell it. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the night did you see a parcel of horses running about the street - A. No; the man who called me said there were horses running about. My horse was too heavy to leap, and not likely to attempt it; if he did he might break the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not likely if he heard horses about that he would jump over after them - A. He was not likely to leave the horses in the field which he was accustomed to. When I came up with the prisoner, he was going at a jog trot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he was to have 7 s. for taking them the sign of the Nagg's Head public-house. - A. No. When I seized him, it was evident that I was going to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that if you enquired at the turnpike, you would find he had come through alone? - He said nothing of the sort in my presence. He said he did not know the man who gave him the horses.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Rolfe's, and take care of the horses; on the evening of the 6th of September about seven o'clock, I put eight horses into my masters close; this bay gelding was one of them. About two o'clock the next morning, I went to the close, seven horses were there, but the bay gelding was missing; the gate was broken in two in the middle at the top bar; it was locked the night before. There is a high hedge all round the field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The top bar was broken; if an awkward beast tried to get over, he was very likely to break it? - A. Yes. I saw the gelding again next day; it was brought home. Beaconsfield is on the Birmingham road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say if you enquired at the turnpike, you would find he came through alone? - A. No; he said a man employed him to take the horse and pony to the Tagg's or Nagg's Head public-house, he did not know which, and he was to have 7 s. for it. That he had never been in London but once, which was about four years ago. There is such a parish as Ealing or Zealing in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Birmingham to town. I rode from Oxford to Wickham; the coachman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160070"/>went on and left me there.

I went on; a post-chaise overtook me, and I rode to Uxbridge - walked on about four miles by a hay cart; a gentleman overtook me, and we fell into conversation. I said I was a horse-dealer; he said he wanted to buy a horse; I asked him where he lived, and I would bring him one; he gave me his card. He left me, and up came a man with three horses, and asked me to take them on with the cart. I said I did not belong to the cart, but that man did; he said he would treat me with a pot of beer, and the man took some with me. He gave me 7 s. at the public-house door, leaving the two horses with me, and went on on an iron-grey one, and in about half an hour the prosecutor came up and asked about the horses, and when I got down he went to catch hold of me, and when he took me into custody, the watchman came; I said if they would let me stop outside the door, I would shew them the parties who could prove it when they came by.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and builder, and live at No. 5, Gloster-place, Vauxhall-walk. On the 6th of September I was coming from Uxbridge towards town, and overtook the prisoner; I believe he is the man; he was walking alongside a hay cart. I did not know him before. I got into conversation with him; he said he was a horse-dealer; I said I wanted to buy a horse, but was in no particular hurry. I gave him my card, and kept with him till he came to the toll-bar; he had no horse with him then. They called to a man to open the bar, but I walked on, and stopped at a public-house at Ealing, I think it was called the Green-man; and while I was in the room, the prisoner came up to the house; he took some beer out to a man who was there with two horses, and rode another; they had some conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out to see what sort of horses they were? - No; it was not my business. I was at the door, and had some porter with them there. I heard the man say he wanted the horses sent to town, and saw him pull out a red bag, and give the prisoner some money; the prisoner took the two horses. I walked on and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the prisoner an old acquaintance? - A. I never saw him in my life before or since. He said he was coming to London, but did not say where.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him with two horses, did you not say,</p>
               <p>"You may as well let me ride one?" - A. No; I am not fond of riding bare-backed horses. I should know the man again who gave him the horses. They were talking together before I went to the door; but the moment he got the horses, he finished the beer and rode off. I had no further conversation with him. The other man went in the same direction. I have not seen the prisoner since until to-day. I gave him my card, and said I wanted a horse about thirteen hands high; and if he should have one, I would see it. The prisoner was by the side of the hay cart, and the driver on the top of it. I am a master builder. I wanted a horse to draw old materials. I had a cart and horse last year, and sold it in October, as it was a bad one; and was without one after that. I gave him a written card which I had about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is this the card you gave him? - 
               <persName id="t18240916-184-person1552">A. </persName>
            (looking at it) It is my writing. I forgot to tell you, that the prisoner, when the man gave him the horses, told me he was coming to the Nagg's Head, Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say a few minutes ago, that you did not speak to the prisoner after he got the horses? - A. I said not a moment after. I had the beer in my hand when the gentleman rode off; he then said he was going to the Nagg's-head; I wished him good bye, and walked on; he told me it was the Nagg's-head. When I first saw him, he was about a mile and a half from Uxbridge; he was then walking by the side of the cart. A man was laying down in the cart; he is not the man who gave the prisoner the horses. I walked with him by the side of the cart, about a mile; he had no horse then. I was in the tap-room of the public-house; he came into the passage; the gentleman was at the door, and did not come in. The prisoner came and asked me to come and have some beer with them; they were drinking at the door. They had been in conversation (before I came to them) about taking the horses to town; the man on horseback said,</p>

               <p>"Very well then, it is all settled; and I now give them up to you." He then pulled out a bag, and gave him some money; I did not see how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of the two horses saddles on? - A. I do not know.</p>

On the 25th of August, about a quarter before ten o'clock in the forenoon, I was up in the back bed room with my mistress, whose name is Rosa. I heard Harrison, my fellow-servant, scream out. I went to the front room, looked out of the window, and saw her in the front garden holding the prisoner by the tail of his coat. I ran down immediately, but he had then escaped and got into the street. I ran after him, crying</p>

               <p>"Stop thief!" until I lost sight of him. I then waited until two men, who pursued, brought him back, and in consequence of what Harrison said, I asked him where the spoons were? he said he had not got any. I returned home and searched the cupboard; two desert spoons were gone; I saw them taken from him at the watch-house; they were up the sleeves of his coat. There is a front garden to the house. The street door was latched, but not locked. I am sure it was latched ten minutes before, when I went up stairs with my mistress.</p>

            . I am a servant to the prosecutor. I was sweeping the parlour, and heard, as I thought, the rattling of spoons. I looked round to the parlour door, and saw the prisoner on the second stair. I went and seized him by the collar, and asked him what he wanted? he said he had come to do a job. I asked, what job? He said he had seen my fellow-servant, and she told him to go up stairs, and that his master was waiting outside. He went out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160071"/>street door, which was open, and seeing the gate open, I rushed by him and shut it, and held it fast. He tried to escape over the railing, I seized by the tail of his coat. He then struck me over the left side of my face with his fist. I then called for assistance; he escaped over the rails; my fellow-servant then came to my assistance. The cupboard the spoons were in is in the passage, by the side of the parlour door. I had been in the parlour about ten minutes. The street door was shut then I am sure, and nobody came in, to my knowledge, after I saw it shut. He must have opened the front gate also, for my fellow-servant had come in five minutes before, while I was in the parlour, and she shut it. I opened the door to let her in, but that was not the front door. The prisoner came in at the side door; that was also shut, but has a latch outside, and he went out at the side door; it opens into the washouse. There is a door which shuts the passage from the washouse, and he came in there. He came first into the washouse, and then in at this door; the washouse door was open.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with us on Tuesday night, the 31st of August and left on Saturday morning, the 2nd of September about seven o'clock. My husband had gone out about a quarter to six o'clock. Before the prisoner went out, I heard a noise in the room where he lodged, like a box being broken open. I got up, and went into the front parlour, and waited there until the prisoner came down stairs. I saw him at the foor of the stairs, with a large bundle in his hand, and asked him what it was; he said it was a bundle which he had brought with him the night before. I said he had brought none on the night before, for I had met him in the passage, and gave him a light and he had none. I took the bundle out of his hand, and on his turning to go out, I saw my lodger's waistcoat in his pocket; his name is Cartwright; he slept in the same room. I bolted the street door to prevent his going out. He went up into his own room, and I saw him take out of his pocket, Cartwright's handkerchief, waistcoat, and a pair of blue stockings; and he had Cartwright's trowsers on over his own; I saw him take them off. I went next door and got two young men to my assistance. There was two coats and a shirt in the bundle. One coat belonged to my husband, and all the other things to Cartwright, who had lodged nearly five years with us. I know his things; he had slept there, and gone out at half past six o'clock. I looked at his box, and found the lock broken open. I went for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge with the property. My husband's coat had been in Cartwright's box. I had washed his linen several times and knew it well, and the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I took the lodging did I not refer you to persons who knew me? - A. He referred me to his uncle, but we did not enquire till the day of the robbery. The property was in a box, which has a moulding round the edge of the lid; I believe it is called a lipping, which came about half an inch over. He made no particular resistance; he ran up stairs when I bolted the door. I saw the waistcoat hanging out of his pocket, and saw him take it out; also the handkerchief and stockings.</p>

            . I am a tailor and have lodged in Richard's house nearly five years. On the morning of the 2nd of September, I went out about half past six, and left the prisoner in bed; he slept in my room. I had a box there, it was locked on the Tuesday night; I did not try it afterwards. I had left a coat, trowsers, shirt, waistcoat, handkerchief, and stockings in it; and a coat of Richards's, which I had made for him: he did not want it, and so it was left in my box.</p>

I did not miss this money myself, but my wife said something to me. I went out and found him in Smithfield. I ran after him and caught him in Long-lane, and took a bag from his pocket, containing 13 sovereigns and 12 s. 6 d. I knew that some money was laid by for rent.

               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am an officer. On the 20th of August, in the afternoon, I was in Smithfield-market about half past five o'clock, and was informed a man was offering a horse for sale, for less than half its value. I turned round, and saw the prisoner with a horse-dealer, and heard the horse-dealer say,</p>
               <p>"I will give you all the money you ask for the horse, if you will go with me to the book, and bring some person who knows you." He then said, that a young man lived close by, who knew him, and he would fetch him. He was asked where he got the horse, and said his master sent him to sell it; that his master was

He then went to fetch the person who knew him. Marchant, my brother officer, watched him. I met him and Marchant in St. John-street, about half-past eight o'clock, and he still gave the same account. I offered to go Islington-hall: but he said nobody knew him there. I locked him up. He was remanded to give him an opportunity of writing to his master, and at the next examination, he said a man, who he had met in the street, was to give him half-a-guinea to sell it. It was advertised, and owned on the 3d of September by Hart.</p>

            . I am an officer. I followed the prisoner. He went into the Ram and put on a long blue coat; he came out, and the hostler collared him in the pig-market, and demanded 1 s. I told him to let him go, and followed him to the Angel public-house at Islington. I then asked him where he was going; he said to Mr. Wilson's, a little farther on. I followed him to Highburybarn. I enquired, and found Mr. Wilson lived there. I rang the bell, and told him to ask what he liked, and instead of asking for Mr. Wilson, he asked for a servant who did not live there.</p>

Two young men followed after him; he turned to go into Petticoat-lane, and they also; and by the time I had got up, the two young men turned and said he was gone round another way into Whitechapel. While I was hesitating, an officer came up with Marks in his hand, but nothing was found on him. Next morning I found both the prisoners at the Mansion-house, and my watch also. I am certain that Marks is the man who snatched it; I never doubted about him; I could not see his face, but he was stouter than the others. There was nobody in the yard but them. I think Allen is one of the two who ran after him. It was dark.</p>

               <p>"Stop thief!" Marks immediately ran up, and I stopped him; two others were behind him, and the prosecutor behind them. I took them to the watch-house; returned to the spot in a quarter of an hour, and saw Allen putting something into his breeches pocket. I collared him, and he dropped the watch, and said he had picked it up. The prosecutor said he could not positively swear that Marks was the man who had taken it; but he was the nearest man to him, and the person who ran from him.</p>

I had been to meet a friend at Somers Town, between ten and twelve o'clock, but he did not come till one o'clock. I was quite sober. The prisoner enticed me home with her: I said I only wanted to lay down to rest; she said if I gave her 1 s. I should sleep in her room as long as I chose. I gave her a 1 s.: she wanted more, and said she would give 4 d. towards a pint of gin, and was going out for it, but she turned round, and said, she could make more of the room, and I must give her another 1 s. I was going to give her a sovereign by mistake; I returned it to my waistcoat pocket. She said I had better give it to her; and in four or five minutes, she untied my apron, put her hand into my pocket, took the sovereign out, and run down stairs. Another girl came up and said she was gone. I ran part of the way down after her, but heard the cry of murder, and was afraid; the officer came after another girl, in a few minutes, and I told him.</p>

            . I live in Beech-street, Barbican. On 21st July, the prisoner came into my shop between eight and nine at night, and asked me to let him leave a small parcel, and before I gave an answer, he left the shop. He returned for it in a quarter of an hour, and seemed in great confusion; Passingham followed close at his heels, and said,</p>
               <p>"What are you going there for?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir." I gave the parcel to Passingham; it was an hydrometer.</p>

On the 17th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners Fenn and Masters, came to my shop with two hats, one was finished, and the other only wanted ironing; they are both called hats. Fenn asked me to buy them. They produced them, and asked 30 s. for them, which is the trade price; but not knowing the boys, I said</p>
               <p>"I will give you 16 s. for them," they went out; Masters then brought them in, and said</p>
               <p>"Will you give 18 s.?" I said,</p>
               <p>"No." He said,</p>
               <p>"then give me 16 s." I then asked how they came by them: he said, they belonged to a boy. I went over for Marchant, who lives opposite. Fenn directly went away. Marchant came over and questioned Masters about them. He said, they belonged to the other boy. I said no doubt they were stolen, for the materials would cost more than what they offered them at. Marchant fetched Whitehead the officer, but just before he came, Higgins came in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Will they do?" I said</p>
               <p>"The hats?" I asked if they belonged to him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." I asked how he came by them. He said</p>
               <p>"Very well." I thought that a strange answer, and said,</p>
               <p>"Very well." He then turned his conversation, as if he had come to buy a hat. Whitehead came in and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Higgins was not in the shop with the other boys - A. While Masters was there he was. I had one of the hats in my hand when he came in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do these belong to you?" pointing to the other on the counter. I did not intend to buy them, and offered a low price; and thinking them not honestly come by, I sent for an officer. One of them only wanted ironing, the other is not finished, having no lining or binding.</p>

               <p>"Go back and slog him;" I understood that to mean, ill use me; he was returning to me and I put my watch chain between my flap and my breeches, he then struck me with a stick across my neck, I was making a grasp at the stick, and he struck me under the ear, and knocked me down, and then made a snatch at my watch, one of his companions said,</p>

               <p>"Have you got it;" he said</p>
               <p>"It is stowed away;" I then received two violent kicks at the back of my head, there were two other persons near me, but it was the prisoner who felt for my watch; my wife came to my assistance, and I raised my body up; I should not think the attack lasted, more than five minutes; I am positive he is the person who attacked me; when I got up I saw both the parties assaulting my wife, I called for assistance but could not get it; when I saw my wife the prisoner had hold of her bundle, and one of the others was beating her, she cried murder, and they ran away; I should know one of the other two if I was to see him; I was following the prisoner when I was fetched back by a gentleman who said they would murder me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Could you not get any assistance - A. No, I do not know how many people might be there. I did not take out a warrant for a common assault, upon my oath. I told the officer that the prisoner tried to rob me, but the officers told the Magistrates that if they would give them a warrant for a common assault, they would take them easier; I was by the side of the wall of the East India Warehouses, opposite the house of a man of the name of Mendoza.</p>
               <p>- HARRISON, the City officer was now sent with the prosecutor to ascertain whether the assault was committed within the City of London.</p>

            . I have been to the spot, and find that where the prosecutor was first assaulted, was in the City, but the spot where they attempted to rob him, was about four feet within the Country; I have known the City boundaries these thirty years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the wall in the City - A. Yes, the spot which is close against the wall is in the City, but the place where he fell is the corner of Tripe's-yard.</p>
               <p>M. POYNER re-examined. I have described the place where I was knocked down - the second time I was assaulted, and the attempt made to take my watch.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you not say this occurred against the wall of the East-India warehouse - A. I said the first assault was made, but the attempt to rob me was in the kennel. I did not even return a blow; he did not complain that I had pushed him, or assaulted him at all; he said, at Worship-street, that I had rubbed against him, but he was on one side the way and I on the other - several persons came out of their houses - I know one of them, but he is afraid of his name being known. No attempt was made at the watch till I was down on the ground; my wife's bundle contained a pair of trowsers - it was in a yellow handkerchief. I had no money - I did not strike any body. I told him at the time of the first attack to go about his business - I had not insulted him.</p>

               <p>"Whatever you do, do not follow them." The prisoner first came up to us, on the side of the wall, but my husband was not down till he got on the opposite side; we were walking along, and the prisoner threw mud in my husband's face: he told him to go about his business - the prisoner put his stick across my husband's face, and said he would cut his head off as clean as a whistle, and make mince meat of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the India warehouse wall, and the prosecutor pushed me off the footpath; I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't do that again;" he said he would if he liked - he slapped my face, and I held up my stick - he knocked me down first.</p>

I went to bed, and put my breeches under my head, and bolted the door. I was awoke about five o'clock by the servant of the house; the prisoner had then left the bed, and was dressed. I had given her money before I missed the note; the trowsers had been pulled from under my head, and lay on the top of the bed. I offered her a sovereign to give up the note - she denied knowing anything about it. I had written the letter B. upon it; it was produced at the office. I am quite sure I was sober at the time.</p>

We were talking about my horse - the other party joined in the conversation; I had given the notes to Ifould to count, and he put them into the bag again, which drew up with a string - I put it into my right hand breeches pocket, but one end of the string remained out of my pocket; the two male prisoners went out with me to the door; one was before, and the other behind me - the one behind me shoved me, and I made a little bit of a slip; the other pretended to save my falling; I did not see him pull the bag from me, nor did I feel it go, but I am certain I had put it into my pocket the minute before I went to the door - I came back to the room in about five or seven minutes, and missed my money soon after. I had received all the Bank of England notes from a person of the name of Jones, at the Coopers' Arms, public-house, West-street, Smithfield. When I returned into the parlour the prisoners were gone. On the Wednesday following I was at the Police office; I saw the three prisoners there. I heard Osman say that the woman was his wife. The Uxbridge note was 5 l.; there was one 20 l., four 10 l. notes, and two 5 l. Bank notes; the Uxbridge note had</p>
               <p>"Five Pounds" in letters, in blue ink, upon the face of it - this note I have in my hand, for 5 l., No. 16,915, is one of those I had from Jones; it was in the bag. I got it last from the Bank of England, on the day the prisoners were examined - it has Jones's hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You produce this as a 5 l. note that was in the bag - A. Yes; I did not take notice of the number, but it has the name of Smirke in Jones's hand-writing. I know that note very well. I was not in liquor when before the Magistrates, but I was rather fresh on the night of the robbery; I was sober enough before I went into the house - but I got a little there. I was there an hour and a half before I went to the door. I had been in the parlour about half an hour before I pulled out my notes - I was not very fresh then. I put the purse into my pocket about an hour before I went to the door. I only drank with Mr. Ifould - I did mention his name before the Magistrate; there were four persons sitting together, and two of them went out to look at the horse, and I went with them - they went out with their hats on. There are two or three steps at the door. I was in the house after I went to the door for about three quarters of an hour. Mr. Baker was in the room when I came back, but he soon withdrew, and so did his companion - he was gone before I missed my money. There were other persons in the room - I suppose ten or twelve: it was the time of Bartholomew fair.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160079"/>Baker did not tell me that night that he saw the notes taken. I missed my purse seven or eight minutes after I returned to the room. I am a discounter of bills, not jointly with others, but to serve a friend. Baker came to my house on Tuesday. I told the Magistrate it was Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. I was not quite certain which day it was: Baker came down without my sending for him; I slipped on the top of the steps in consequence of the man pushing me - Baker was not at the door at the time I slipped: I did not go out at all with them - when I returned to the room Baker was there, and about two yards from the - he did not come nearer to me - I am positive he was not within arms' reach of me: I sat in the parlour, on the right hand of the door, and their table was on the left, where Baker was: when I came into the room, the table he was sitting at was about two yards from me, and there was a table between us - he appeared to be looking at the horse when I came in; there were curtains to the windows, partly drawn, but not wholly; he could see the horse through the aperture - I did not say that other persons went out at the same time, and one of them had a sustain jacket.</p>

On the 3d of September I accompanied Fulwood to the George public-house; there were persons at the top of the room smoking and drinking - and he pulled out a canvass bag; I cannot state that the prisoners were there then; I counted the notes - there was 75 l.; I recollect there was a 20 l. Bank note, and a 5 l. Uxbridge note; the others were Bank of England notes, but I cannot recollect what they were; I put them into the bag again, and returned them to him; it was a white canvass bag, drawn with a string; I was sober when I went in, but after taking a glass or two of gin-and-water, I fell asleep: I had counted the money before I went to sleep.</p>

               <p>"You have made 10 l. too much;" he counted again, and it was 75 l; the top note was printed in blue ink - Fullwood remained there about an hour afterwards; the prisoner went out - White stood on one side of the mare and Osman at the hind part - they went out about five minutes before Fullwood: I was sitting close by the window, which was up, when Fullwood went, a man in a fustian jacket, who was with them, followed him to the door, and then gave him a push: Osman lifted up his right arm, as if to save the man - Fullwood was then just off the step of the door; White was four or five yards from him; the man in the fustian jacket laid hold of the bag, and whipped it out of his pocket, and then they all ran away together - the man with the fustian jacket was drinking with the prisoner before they went out, and seemed to be acquainted with them: I saw all the prisoners next evening at Barnet fair, and I saw

               <p>"I know I am a thief, and live by thieving, and like to encourage rogues:" I never said so to anybody in my life, upon my oath - I did not speak to Mr. Fullwood at that time, because I have seen persons ill used for interfering in such matters: Mr. Ifould came to the table, and counted out the notes - I never had it in my possession, or I could have told it; Mr. Fullwood and his friend night have been in the room half an hour before they came to count the money; I will swear that the prisoners did not go out ten minutes before Fullwood - it was five minutes as near as I can tell - I saw the man in the fustian jacket at Barnet fair, beating and ill using a man - he had his fist up to knock a man's brains out; I have never seen him since that - I saw the two prisoners at the fair; I did not find them out on the night of the robbery, and demand money of them; I did see them at the

He produced a 20 l. Bank of England note. I afterwards changed the 5 l. note. He came to my house again on the Monday morning, about ten o'clock, and said he came to ask what note he changed with me on the Saturday night, whether it was a 5 l. or 10 l.; the box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160080"/>was searched to find it, and he said the person from whom he had taken it said it was 10 l., and he wished for the note to convince him that it was 5 l.

               <persName id="t18240916-214-person1775">Thos. Baker</persName>
            . I have heard him say that he once was a regular prig, and lived by prigging; he told my man so, and the man told it to me and my wife and to two officers. He said it to me when I lived with him as journeyman, eleven or twelve months ago. I left him in January last. I would not believe him upon his oath, and no man in London would ever say that Mr. Baker would take an oath without it was a great falsehood. I left him because he charged me with stealing a pig's head, when I only asked him civilly for my wages; and he said, if I would confess it, and go away, he would say no more about it; I would not, and he then sent for an officer. I then lived with Mr. Robinson, in Brick-lane, about three weeks, and then set up for myself in Old-street, as a pork-butcher, about two hundred yards from Mr. Baker. I know nothing of either of the men at the bar; I do not think I ever saw them in my life. I never was in custody except on Baker's charge. I have seen Vann several times, but was never in his custody. It was not for stealing sausages that Baker turned me off; he gave me a character to Mr. Robinson nine years ago. The last time I was at Mr. Baker's is about six weeks ago; I saw him last night; I did not tell him that if he came to this trial I would try to transport him, but I told to Mr. Brough's man, and to Baker's man, that he once tried to transport me, and said if he came here to-day, I would be here, and tell the truth. I lived with Mr. Stoke's, of Aylesbury-street, and left him because I was sweeping the floor and found 6 d., and went with his nephew and spent it. Mr. Stokes did not charge me with robbing him of silk. I bought some, and gave it to his wife that he might give me a good character, which he did.</p>
               <p>By the COURT. Q. When Baker charged you with stealing the pig's head, did you go before a Justice - A. Yes; but they dismissed the charge. Fordham was the officer that took me.</p>

I said to Mr. Wooley's; she said she had just come from there, and had been to my mother's with some dirty linen, and I was to give these things to her, as she could make more haste than I could. I gave her the basket, and watched her as far as I could down Park-lane, and then I went to my father. I never saw her before, but I noticed her, and am sure she is the same person. I told my father what sort of a person it was.</p>

I took it from him and let him go. I brought the things back and gave them to the owner. I am certain he is the man. I looked in his face, and let him go in consequence of his age.

            . I am a licensed Hawker - I had been travelling with my cloth, in a pack from Kensington to Hammersmith on the 6th of September; there were some navigators sitting on the side of the road at their dinner; they told me to let them see a piece of cloth, and the prisoner asked for a piece to look at; he said,</p>
               <p>"Let me show it to this woman," and ran across the way with it. I could not run after him, as my pack was loose, and I was afraid the others would take the rest of the things - it was dowlas cloth.</p>

            . I was at work at Kensington, near Lord Holland's, with the prisoner, and near one hundred other men. I was sitting down, between twelve and one o'clock, having my dinner; the young man was coming down the foot-path, and one of the men asked him to let us look at his cloth, and he came and handed his cloth to me and another, and gave a bit to a man whom we called Lankey, he is about five feet ten inches high; he took it to show to a woman, and never came back - not even for his money; his money is now in Mr. Wood's hands - I saw the young man give the cloth into his hands - the prisoner was not there, he came a few minutes after.</p>

I neither threatened, nor made him any promise. I asked if the horse was his; he said it was not; I asked who it belonged to - he said to a man, but he did not know his name, nor where he lived - that he met with him on the Tunbridge-road, and he was bringing it to London, to sell it. I took him to White's place: Hunter gave me the horse at White's stables, in his presence, and Green saw it at Hatton-garden; it was then taken to the Ram inn.</p>

A coach passed, and two of them broke from the halter. He asked me to go with him, and I did - I left him at Hyde Park-corner, and on Monday morning I met him; he asked me to go with him to fetch a horse that was coming from Tunbridge - I did so, and met a man; he gave me a direction to sell the horse at Hunter's.</p>

            , of King's-street, Snowhill, one of the petitioning creditors under the Commission against the prisoner. I know of transactions between him and the prisoner. (Looking at two bills of exchange for 78 l. and 40 l.) These are drawn by my uncle upon the prisoner, whom I saw accept them. I gave him his account, and he gave the bills in consideration for that account. I know that my uncle furnished him with goods to the amount specified in those bills before they were accepted. I tendered his account to him, and wished for cash, which he could not give, and I 
               <persName id="t18240916-232-person1920">drew</persName>
             these bills, which he accepted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who was the money due to? - A. My uncle, and his late partner, Mr. Ricardo. The debt was contracted during their partnership. They dissolved partnership after Christmas, 1823. I came into my uncle's service in March, 1819; I was articled to him only. I know that Mr. Ricardo was a partner; he lived in Weston-street, Pentonville. I manage the concern, and have seen their partnership agreement, though not read it. Mr. Ricardo acted as a partner, and was generally there every day for two or three hours. The partnership ceased in the beginning of 1824; I think about February or March; it was advertised in the Gozette. The goods for which the bills were given were sent to Hastings. I saw the prisoner look out about 78 l. worth, the rest were ordered of our traveller.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you went into your uncle's service did you see Mr. Ricardo? - A. He became a partner about the beginning of 1823. He generally posted the books, as he knew nothing of the business, which takes some time to learn; - it is manufacturing portable desks, &amp;c. We always sign bills, Smith and Co., which means Mr. Ricardo.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did he act as partner? - A. He did; he had the management of the business. He ceased to attend about the beginning of March I think.</p>
               <p>Mr. CONSTANTINE. I am solicitor to Mr. Smith. The partnership ceased the beginning of the year by a notice in writing signed by them both. I know that before that they agreed to dissolve. Mr. Ricardo assisted in winding up the books. They instructed me to prepare an advertisement for the Gazette, which I did. They signed a paper empowering me to do so. This was before the issuing of the Commission.</p>

               <p>MR. RUNDER. I am an acting assignee under the Commission, and was present on the 15th of June, when the prisoner's last examination took place. I had two books in my possession - I do not know how they were marked. They were the same books as the bankrupt produced. I looked over them, to see if there were any small debts which could be recovered. They were produced to me four or five days before the, last meeting, and left at my house. I took them to the meeting, and gave them to my co-assignee, or Mr. Lewis's, the accountant. I did not look over them carefully - I do not know what has become of them.</p>

            . I am an accountant, and was employed by the assignees to make up these books - the bankrupt attended me for that purpose; the accounts were made under his direction, from bills handed to me by the assignees. The books were not produced to me. I saw him produce a book marked A, at the last meeting. The last time I saw it was in Mr. Runder's possession - the bankrupt was asked for them at the examination on the 15th of June, and said Mr. Runder had them. Mr. Runder came without them, but went home and brought, I think, only one - it was handed in with the accounts. I sat within half a yard of the bankrupt - I do not know what became of the books.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Upper Eaton-street, Pimlico. Glasspoole is my cousin, and lived in Three Tunn-court, Borough, in April last, with her mother. On the 4th of April, at ten o'clock at night, she came to my father's in a coach, and brought two small boxes, covered with carpet. They were put into a cupboard under the china press, in our front kitchen - she went away; the carpet was sewed round them with pack-thread - one was moved into a closet under the stairs, and the other into a closet in the area. Three of the creditors and a messenger came on the 10th of August and fetched them away. I saw the prisoner three doors from my father's house, in the street, on the 10th of August, when he was taken. Glasspoole was at my father's house that morning, and Evani knocked at the door, which I answered; he asked for Miss Glasspoole - I said if he would walk a few paces from the door I would send her to him, but I said nothing to her - she went out. I did not observe where she went to - she returned in about five minutes. I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160087"/>not see Evani again - she staid about half an hour, and then left.</p>

             the 13th, about half-past nine o'clock, I went to the Coach and Horses public-house, Dover-street, Piccadilly; and about half-past ten o'clock the prisoner came in - the officers were in waiting - he said to me,</p>
               <p>"Sir, the boxes and property do belong to me."</p>
               <p>Q. What boxes did he mean - A. I cannot say that he meant these boxes; they were then in possession of the creditors; I had never seen them in my father's house myself; he said the boxes belonged to him, and if I would give them up he would give me every satisfaction that they belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said to him to produce this conversation - A. The boxes had been the cause of much conversation between Glasspool and me. I did not mention her name to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how the conversation began - A. He addressed me nearly in those words: it was merely a plan for his apprehension; I therefore seemed to agree with his proposal; he inclined his head on the table, and said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, my head is under your arm;" the officer with a creditor then came in and took him.</p>

On the 12th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, when my cousin Glasspole was leaving our house, I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way; she had come about half-past eleven o'clock; and when she went out, he was standing opposite the door; she went down by the public-house to go down Arabella-row; he walked very slowly after her while I had the door open, but I pulled it open again, and saw him walking very fast after her, and crossing over: on the following morning, about seven o'clock, Glasspoole came again, and I saw the prisoner walking about for a considerable time, and about eight o'clock he knocked at the door: I was at the foot of the stairs, and heard him ask for Miss Glasspoole, my sister, who opened the door, told him if he would walk a few paces Miss Glasspoole would come to him; we went down and told her; she went to the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the man?" my sister pointed to him, and she went out immediately: I saw the boxes on the night of the 4th of April, but was out when they were brought; I saw them next day in the china press, covered with carpet, and sewn with pack-thread; I saw Searle take the same away: I had moved them from the china press.</p>

I do not mean to say I recollect it by the number alone, but by the appearance and number also. I have valued them at the wholesale price. I should take off 15 per cent. for profit.</p>

               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know him before 1821 - A. Yes. I should think he was not in a situation to borrow small sums of money.</p>
               <p>The affidavit was here read, in which the defendant deposed as follows: - That he had personally known R. C. Mullett for several years, and was acquainted with his pecuniary circumstances, and confidently believed him to be generally poor; so much so, that he had, upon repeated occasions, prior to the year, 1821, borrowed of the defendant, various small sums of money; but although repeatedly applied to, invariably failed in making repayments, urgently pressing for further indulgence upon the ground of poverty; and that the defendant had, at the request of the said R. C. Mullett, sometime back, lent him his acceptance for 23, upon a solemn pledge, that the amount should be deposited to meet the bill when at maturity: which the defendant had, however, been compelled to pay: that the amount of the different loans and goods sold him, exceeded 40 l. which had been due since 1820; all of which remained unpaid; and that the defendant had arrested him in Michaelmas Term for the recovery thereof, which action remained unsettled: also, that the defendant had heard, and fully believed, that the said R. C. Mullett was at present indebted to Mrs. Week, of Kennington, between 400 l. and 500 l. which she had repeatedly declared her utter impracticability of obtaining payment and her apprehensions that she should lose the whole."</p>

            . On the 30th of January kept the Spur Inn, in the Borough. I had been an auctioneer, and lived in Blackman-street and King-street, Borough. I tendered myself as bail in the action in question; I have known the defendant about seven years, but have never borrowed money of him at any time whatever, nor did I owe him any money in 1824. He brought an action against me in November last, but it has never been tried; notice of trial has been given and countermanded; it was brought in Surrey, in Michaelmas Term. I have appeared to defendant, but it has never been tried; I certainly do not owe him any such sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bill transactions with him. - A. I drew one bill of 23 l. on him, and 2 s. for the stamp. He came to me at the Spur Inn, where I was sitting, and said he had met with a misfortune and broken my chaise at Bexley, and as it was in price to him before, the best way would be for him to buy it. I had asked him 25 guineas for it, and at last agreed to take his acceptance for 23 l. and that is what this bill was given for, and for no other purpose. I never promised to take it up; on the contrary, it was for the chaise; it was duly paid; it was payable at Sir

               <p>Cross-examined by ANDREWS. Q. Who delivered the chaise to Mr. Munk - A. He came and took it while I was absent. I had bought it of Mr. Ingram. I was not concerned in the bankruptcy against the defendant, except being employed to take an inventory. I swear distinctly that the bill was given for the chaise, and not accepted for my benefit, or for me to take up.

             re-examined. In March, 1820, I was dining at the Spur-inn with Mr. Mullett, and recollect the defendant coming in, and stating that he had had an accident with the chaise, he had borrowed of Mrs. Mullett's wife during his absence. It was ultimately agreed that Munk should pay a bill of 23 l, and give a gallon of brandy. The bill was drawn and accepted; I got a friend to discount it for Mullett; 2 s. was added for the stamp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the gig - A. Often, when Mullett and when Munk had it. I have acted as attorney for Mullett, and put in a set-off.</p>
               <p>Q. I this it - (producing it) A. Yes; there is a charge made for the gig and harness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Before you delivered that set-off, had he delivered his bill of demand, charging this bill of 23 l. - A. Yes; and we gave that in answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you put that in the set-off by consent of your client - A. I think I told him, I intended to do it, as we might be excluded from proving it, unless it was inserted in the set-off.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the set-off made by Mullett's express direction - A. Certainly not. I exercised my own discretion, with his consent.</p>

            . I am the defendants sister, and lived with him until I was married, which is four years ago next November. Mr. Mullett was then in business, as an auctioneer, and lived in King-street, Borough; he was in the habit of borrowing small sums of my brother; it might be from 5 to 20 l. He was in the habit of coming in, and saying,</p>
               <p>"I am short of money, can you lend me some?" This may have happened two or three times a year, in the way of business.</p>

            . I am also the defendant's sister, and have lived with him until within the last seven months. He was in the habit of lending Mullett different sums, at different times some years ago; sometimes 5 l. and sometimes 4 l., or it might be more; I suppose it was paid again. One morning, as I was at breakfast, Mr. Mullett came in, and wished Mr. Munk to lend him his name for 23 l. as he was rather pressed for money, and it would be of service to him, as he could immediately get it discounted. My brother lent him his name without the least hesitation. He mentioned 23 l. and said,</p>
               <p>"I will make it a few shillings more, because it won't look so much like accommodation." This was in the spring of the year 1820. He said my brother need not give himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160089"/>any trouble about it, he would find the money, Mullett was afterwards at our house, and my brother blamed him for not taking up the bill, Mullett wanted to turn it off to a chaise my brother had bought of him. My brother said,</p>
               <p>"No; you know you owe me the amount of the chaise in spirits and wine; I will not set the chaise against that" They had a quarrel about it. I knew myself of wine and spirits having been delivered to him. I sent them myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister was present at this conversation - A. No. It happened at my brother's parlour in the Borough. He kept a wine vaults.</p>

            . I was attorney for the plaintiff Stackhouse. I saw Mr. Mullett when this suit was pending, (about February last.) I believe he called Munk a great scoundrel and a rascal. When Mullett appeared to justify bail, it was settled that the attorney should produce to me proof of Mullett being possessed of the property he stated, and if I was satisfied, he was to justify. I saw Mr. Oakley; he said, I might depend upon it, that Mullett had the property sworn to, and I think he added,</p>
               <p>"but I will not say, it is not mortgaged for its value.</p>

               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not oppose the bail any further - A. I thought it unnecessary as I had two others.</p>

I am a Thames police-officer; I saw the three prisoners watching about Mr. Ferguson's shop; I stood opposite them on the other side of the way; I was called aside by a gentleman, and while I turned my head, I missed them, and saw them going up the Highway; Carter was putting one of the shoes under his jacket; I followed till I got some person to assist in taking them; I stopped Carter and found one shoe on him, and at the watch-house I found three shoes on Harris; I asked Carter where he got the shoe, he said his father gave it him, he was a shoe-maker, in Rosemary-lane; I said I would go to his father; be then said he had no father, and that Jones gave him the shoe; Jones denied it at first, but at last said he had, and would not have taken them if he had not been hungry.</p>

I had been suckling her between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 5th of August; she then went into the field, and I missed her at five the next morning. There is a large hedge round the field. The gate was closed. I saw the cow again on the Saturday evening at Mr. Lansdown's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was this a good milch cow - A. Yes; she was worth 5 l. or 6 l. to us, but would not fetch more than 3 l. 10 s. in the market. The boy who has the care of the field generally pins the gate; he is not here. I did not put her into the field, nor go in again that night. I have known the prisoner some time, he is a man who sells cows and calves; we have had dealings in that line together. I have known the cow and had the care of her for fourteen years.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Coach and Horses, public-house, on the Hounslow-road. I saw the prisoner at our door with a red cow, with wheel horns on the 5th of August, about twelve o'clock at night. Our house is five or six miles from Littleton. He asked me if there were any Chertsey people there; I said there was Blake and Turner there; they are butchers of Chertsey. He said,</p>
               <p>"I believe I shall not stop, I shall go gently on - good night."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say, tell Blake and Turner I am gone - No, he did not tell me to tell them, or not to tell them. I went into the house about twenty minutes after, and told them what he said. He did not say what road he was going, but he went up towards London. He had got the cow in a string; he was not more than two minutes with me. I saw that it was a red cow, with wheel horns - there are many cows of that description. I have known him twelve years. He always had an honest character.</p>

            . I am a butcher of Chertsey. I was at the Coach and Horses on the 5th of August with Turner. I left about half an hour after the hostler spoke to me, a little after twelve o'clock. When I got to Smithfield in the morning I saw a cow there, about five o'clock, and the prisoner near it; it was a red cow, with wheel horns, and a large udder of milk. The prisoner came and pocked me in the pole. I said</p>
               <p>"What have you got here." He replied,</p>
               <p>"A great red cow; I have sold her to Mr. Lansdon for 3 l. 5 s." I asked him where he got it. He said he bought it of Mr. Dover, of Napp-hill, which is about six miles on the other side of Chertsey, for 3 l. He said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160091"/>had bought her a week, ago but had not brought her up till yesterday. Napp-hill is sixteen or seventeen miles from the Coach and Horses. When I got back to Chertsey, hearing that Mrs. Rutter had lost a cow, I had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he know that you was a Chertsey man - A. Yes, he told me at once who the person was to whom he sold the cow - he knew I was going back to Chertsey. I never bought a horse in my life that was claimed afterwards. I have known Rolfe twelve years; he is a jobber in calves and cows. I never heard but that he was a very honest boy. I took the prisoner at Chertsey on the same day we left Smithfield; on Friday, the 6th of August.</p>

            . I am a butcher at Chertsey. I was at the Coach and Horses with Mr. Blake, and then went on to Smithfield. We did not overtake any cow on the road. I saw the prisoner at Smithfield; he said.</p>
               <p>"Good morning to you - have you got your cart here?" I said, Yes. He said,</p>
               <p>"I shall stand a chance to ride home" - I said</p>
               <p>"It will be a poor chance, I am afraid, for if we have luck we shall buy calves enough." I saw the cow go down to the slaughter-house with two drovers, and I ordered Mr. Lansdon's man not to kill it, for I thought it was stolen. I went to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is a large cow you have brought up, she has plenty of milk;" he said her udder is only corey; she has not been suckled for a fortnight - that he had bought her of Mr. Dover, for 3 l. 6 s., and had had her at home for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you stop in the house after Curtis told you what he did - A. About half an hour - the public-house is about nine miles from Hyde Park-corner, and three from Brentford - we trotted on to Brentford, and then walked the rest of the way. I saw the cow and the prisoner in the market. I did not see him pay 15 s., to anybody. I saw him taken to prison by a man of the name of Purser.</p>

On the 27th of August, about twelve o'clock I lost twelve yards of muslin - I had just brought them home and marked them. I left them on the counter, and went into the garden - my wife called me back, I came, and found some of my goods were gone. I followed the prisoner, and overtook her about fifty or sixty yards off. I charged her with the robbery; she said she had not got any thing. I told her to come back, and the piece of muslin fell from her in walking - it was one of those I had just brought home. She broke from me, I called Stop thief! and she was taken in my sight.</p>

            . I live in Parliament-street, and am night constable of Westminster-bridge. Last Sunday week, in the evening, as I was returning from a place of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160093"/>worship with my mother, my handkerchief was in my right hand coat pocket, I felt the coat lifted up, and turned round and saw the prisoner with it in his hand - I stumbled in turning, and he gave it to another boy about ten yards from him, who immediately ran off with it. I searched for it, but have not seen it since. A man knocked the prisoner back into my arms, as he was running away - there was no other person that could have taken it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had it in my hand - it was another boy took it and gave it to another boy - he was not dressed at all like me.</p>

            . I am a builder, and live in Old Cavendish-street. I know the house inhabited by Mr. Steele - I had repaired it for Mr. Johnson, who sold it to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18240916-252-person2107">Steele</persName>
             about two years ago. The prisoner Bowler was at work for me, and had been so about three weeks as a bricklayer - I gave him no orders to do any work at Mr. Steele's. On the morning of the 20th of July I heard Mr. Steele's house had been robbed of some lead; Bowler was at that time at work for me at No. 14. Mr. Steele's is No. 17; there is a communication from one to the other over the roof - I said nothing to Bowler, but went up to the top of No. 14, and saw the lead had been stolen from No. 17; it had been cut, and partly torn from a dormer flap - it appeared to have been done with a trowel. I got an officer, and charged Bowler and Welch, his labourer, with having stolen it. Bowler called me aside - I told him it would be better for him to tell what he knew. In consequence of what he said we found the lead at the house of Quinland in the afternoon of that day, or the day following; Bowler was with us, and we told Quinland that we came for some lead which had been stolen; he keeps an old iron shop in Oxford-buildings, Oxford-street; we found a number of pieces of lead under the counter, and among others three pieces of about 48 lbs.; we asked Quinland where he got it; he said he bought it, and mentioned what he gave for it; we then took the lead to Mr. Steele's house, and it fitted the dormer exactly. I have not the least doubt but it had been stolen from there - the edges were quite fresh, and it must have been lately taken away.</p>

            . I am an officer - I apprehended Bowler between twelve and one o'clock; he denied the charge most positively - I afterwards went to Quinland - Bowler went before us, and went into the house; I said we had a search-warrant for some lead that had been sold to him by Bowler, pointing out Bowler; he said he had bought some lead, and pointed to where it was; there was a large quantity of lead; we selected the pieces which fitted the dormer - it fitted exactly, and appeared to me to be taken from it, the edges were quite fresh cut.</p>

I saw the lead fitted, the edges appeared quite fresh. Quinland said he had bought one parcel, and his wife the other, and gave at the rate of 14 s. per cwt. I think he stated the date, but I do not recollect it. I asked if he had any book for lead he bought - he said No; he was taken to the office and admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Quinland put in a written defence, stating that he was a young beginner in business, and bought the lead openly, and gave it up without reserve, when it was asked for.</p>

On the 17th of July the prisoner came into our shop with a woman between five and six o'clock in the evening, he went behind the counter, where some watches were hanging. I was in the parlour, but could see what was done in the shop; he said he wanted a silver watch - I showed him one, and he did not like it. I showed him three others - he at length fixed upon one for 3 l.; he offered me a farthing for a sovereign, and then said he would go to his shipmates to give him money to purchase it. I did not miss the watch till about two hours after he was gone - it had been on the counter with some others for him to look at - they were then hung on a nail behind the counter as they were before. I have seen it since at the office, and am certain it was one of those I showed him - there was no person behind the counter - we had not one customer in the shop from the time the prisoner left till the watch was missed; I saw him about ten minutes after at a tobacco shop opposite us, but he did not come to our shop again.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK NICHOLSON. I am a pawnbroker - I have a watch which was pawned by the prisoner about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of July, for 10 s.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner about nine o'clock on Saturday evening, the 17th of September, in a pawnbroker's shop; I searched him, and then let him go. Mr. Farrar came up and said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got that man in charge." I then took him again, and on searching him I found a silk purse and a farthing, and a row of cornelian beads. He was a little in liquor, but not much; he knew perfectly well what he was about.</p>

My handkerchief was in my hat, which was lying by the jacket. I received some information, and laid hold of the prisoner in an adjoining field; I charged him with stealing the jacket and handkerchief - he said he had done no such thing. I took him to the watchhouse. As soon as he saw me in the field, he dropped the articles, and went on. When I saw him first, he was rolling them up, and then ran away. I am quite sure he is the person. The field is about a quarter of a mile from the place where I was at work.</p>

            . I live in my brother's house. This entry of the 29th of July is mine - (reads) -</p>
               <p>"928 yards Irish, at 2 s. 1 d. a yard; 466 yards at 2 s. 2 d.; and 41 l yards at 2 s. 6 d;" these goods were ordered by Stevens for Watkins and Thompson - he told me he had those customers for them: I entered their names in pencil - I put them in a truck myself, and the porter and Stevens went with them.</p>

             RICHARDSON re-examined. These other figures in the entry are mine; they are</p>
               <p>"6 - 4 - 10," which imports that the 928 yards had been sold to Watkins for 2 s. 6 d.; 466 for 2 s. 4 d.; and the 411 at 2 s. 10 d. to Thompson. In consequence of information, we made enquiries of Stevens. I called him up stairs one Saturday, and asked if he had sold some stockings to Mr. Bowen - he said he had. I asked if he had sold any at less than they had cost - he said No; he had sold every thing to Mr. Bowen at a profit - he stated that all the entries which had been made in our books, to the amount of some thousands of pounds for other persons, were for Bowen, and the Irishes had likewise gone there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you make him any promise or threat - A. No; I told him there was something wrong, and I had no doubt we should get at it - I had no positive knowledge of these things at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you know that Bowen lived in Jermyn-street - A. Yes; Mr. Morley, Mr. Andrews, Ballard, the officer, and myself, went there - Bowen was at home. I asked where the Irish was which he had received from Stevens - he said a man of the name of Shillitoe had taken it away that morning, and he did not know where; we had a search warrant: we proceeded to search, and found some other property - we found some Irish, but not that stated in the indictment; when we found these things, Bowen stated that some articles, eight pieces of Irish, and some long cloths that were there; he had not purchased, and we might take them away. A great deal of conversation took place; we then went up stairs, and found some more Irish, and some books in a drawer, under a sort of desk - we asked what they were; he said, know Shillitoe's direction, but his wife could tell if she his little account books, and said he had no secrets to keep. We waited till Mr. Shillito came: Bowen said he did not was at home - he had done business with him for ten years. Shillitoe came home in a horse and cart - he hung up his coat and whip, and was coming into the back parlour; we asked what he had done with the Irish which he had taken that morning - he said</p>
               <p>"What do you want to know for" - but at last said he had taken it to the house of White and Greenwell, in Blackfriars-road; we went and found the whole was from our house - the whole one thousand eight hundred and five yards, with my marks upon them were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I think you said it was in January that Stevens came to you - A. Yes; and soon after he was entrusted to dispose of goods, and to enter debits in our book to a very considerable amount - there are persons standing as debtors to a very considerable amount in our books whom I never saw.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Had you any conversation with Bowen as to where he had met with Stevens - A. Yes; he said at a pawnbroker's - I said it was my opinion he had bought of Stevens, because he thought he could get rid of them at a small advantage; he admitted that to be the case.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are there not many persons standing on your books as debtors with whom you never had any communication on the subject - A. Yes; Bowen is our debtor to the amount of 525 l. I never had any communication with him, because I had confidence in Stevens; he had never come to our shop to pay money, but Stevens had paid money on his account, and he had paid ready money through Stevens, in sums of 25 l or 30 l. - the whole perhaps was 200 l. or 300 l. His name appears several times. I never myself went to his house to make enquiries, but it was through the representation of Stevens that goods to that amount were delivered to him; he represented that they had a shipping order - there are other debtors to considerable amounts placed here by the same means - the whole may amount to 1700 l. or 1800 l. I never had communication with them - they were all done by Stevens: the entries are in the ledger among others, there is no mark to point out which were brought by Stevens. I did not say to him</p>

               <p>"You have nearly ruined us, we may as well know the worst of it." I said</p>
               <p>"You might have ruined us." I went to Mr. Bowen's with the officer and two other gentlemen. I believe the officer went in first with Mr. Andrews, and then Mr. Bowen said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160096"/>he had no secrets to keep; we found some linen and long cloth in his back parlour, which he stated he had not purchased; there was no concealment - there were several whole pieces of Irish in a box, and some remnants - the box was locked. Bowen offered every facility in the search. I went up stairs after the officer, and saw the box broken open - I do not know whether Bowen gave him any iron to open it. He did not say that Shillito had left Oxford-street, and gone to Russell-square; he said he did not know where he lived at all; we said we must know, and at last he said he believed near Russell-square - I do not know whether he said he had been in the house or not, but he said he did not know where it was. Linen cannot be bought for the same price on credit as for money - the advance is 1/2 per cent. per month; our purchases were at seven months, which would have been 3 1/2 per cent. - that is the usual discount allowed by the trade. We have two houses, but there is no property common to the two houses. Malcott and James are names which I put up, for reason which I could explain; they are two of my own names. The other house is in the name of J. Williams, only - we have no other house, Bowen's is about ten minutes walk from our house. I never on any occasion authorized Stevens to go and dispose of any goods, without expressing any particular customer, or knowing who the purchaser was to be. I never stated to him that I had bought some black cloth at 15 s. a yard, and desired him to go and dispose of it. We have a day book, which is kept by my brother Charles, I am not aware that any entries are made to Stevens. The goods are put down to the name of the young man who carries them out, as we do not know whether they may all be sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Have you any interest in any commission shops - A. No, none whatever. We waited several hours for Shillitoe to come home, and then we told him we came for stolen property - he told us where it was taken, and we went and found it. I do not remember his saying that he did not know them to be stolen; he said he had sold them, but did not say for Bowen. I did not state to Mr. George that Shillitoe had independent property to the amount of 300 l. a year, and I had endeavoured to get him detained, in hopes that sooner that be ied at the Old Bailey he would come to some terms, or anything to that effect. I will positively swear that I did not, neither in presence of Mr. George, nor Mr. Blackman - I believe I did say to some person that I believed Shillitoe had property to the amount of 300 l. a year. I remember Mr. George and Mr. Blackman being at the office, but in my presence nothing was said of the kind. Mr. George is a linen-draper in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you ever in any one instance debited Stevens - A. No. When we put down goods to a clerk it is only a check upon him. These are the accounts which Stevens told us were all fictitious. Every body I deal with knows me by the name of Richardson - my goods are purchased in the name of Williams and Richardson, and are sent to No. 211, or 78. Our bills of parcels are in the name of Mallcott and James, or Williams and Richardson - all those entries are to my young man Stevens, but it is merely to know who took them out. If I was to send goods to you I should put down the clerk's name, and your name in the day-book.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. As this was entered to the clerk in the first instance, shall I afterwards find it in the ledger - A. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that -

            . I am an officer. I went with a search warrant to Bowen's, with Mr. Richardson and Mr. Morley; it is a sadler's shop. I saw some of the shopmen, and asked for Mr. Bowen: I went into the parlour with him, and told him I had a warrant to search his house for linen, the others were then following me: he admitted that he had the goods I mentioned, with others. I saw some linen drapery lying about, which we took when the other gentleman came in, we asked what was become of the linen that was taken the day before; Mr. Bowen said that a person of the name of Shillitoe had taken it out, he had taken out seventy pieces: he said he did not know where Shillitoe lived, nor where he had taken them to but he had lent him a horse and cart, and it was his in-, variable rule to bring them home, he expected him home that day: he said he had bought the things in a fair way: I asked when and where he became acquainted with Stevens; he said in Jermyn-street: I said</p>
               <p>"Was it not at a pawnbrokers shop," he recollected that it was: he only stated while below, that he did not know where Stevens resided: Bowen then said there might be some things which his wife had taken up stairs, and he supposed she had taken the keys: there was a box which he said he had no objection to my opening; I forced it open, and found some linen in it; in the parlour we found some books, the small book Mr. Bowen produced himself; and said they were Steven's own entries, and he had signed his name to the cash received.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Then Mr. Bowen conducted himself to you in a fair and honourable way - A. Yes, he said he considered Stevens as a job dealer, that he had been referred by Stevens to a person of the same name in Regent-street, before he dealt with him, but he did not make any enquiries there.</p>

            . I am partner in the house of White and Greenwell, Blackfriar's road, on the morning of the 31st of July, I saw Shillitoe at our house; he came with some samples of Irish linen; I purchased of him to the amount of 161 l. 1 s.; they are here, I bought the goods by sample and they were delivered the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. These goods came in broad day - A. Yes, I gave three different prices for them, one was 20 d., one 21 d., and one 2 s. a yard; that was a fair price. I have been a linen draper sixteen years; it is common with them to turn stock into money about that time; I have not known Shillitoe more than three or four months, he was sent to me as a job dealer, he made no secrecy, and always dealt on fair terms; he gave me references who gave him the highest character. There is no linen here which I would have given 2 s. 6 d. for, I could have bought it for less; I have some of the same as this fine linen which I gave 2 s. 4 1/4 d. for, on regular Irish credit, from seven to ten months; I produced them as soon as I was called upon; I mean by a regular price, the market price, not from a jobber, there is no regular price exactly. I considered Shillitoe as a jobber, he said he lived in Foley-place, I never went to enquire.</p>

            . I am a wholesale hosier, and live in the City; I went with the officer and Richardson to Bowen's; I think the officer went in first; there were several pieces of Irish and some silk; they asked him for the Irish, silk, and different articles, which he had bought of Stevens, he very readily showed the goods, and made no objection; in fact they were about the room, some of them in boxes, and there were some books and papers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He gave every information in his power - A. Yes, there was one box or two to which he could not find the key. I did not go up stairs, the goods below were lying in the back parlour; he said he bought them of Stevens, but did not know where he lived. I did not hear any thing about a reference to Stevens, the boot-maker, in Regent-street, he said that was where he was to find him, but he did not know of his living in Oxford-street; there were four men in the shop, and these things lying publicly in the room; I am not certain whether there is a glass door between the shop and the room. Bowen went into the coach with Shillitoe and the officer, I walked with Mr. Richardson; there was a warrant to search the house, but I do not know whether there was one to take them.</p>

            . I am a porter, and live in Nevan-court, I do jobs for different persons; I have done a good many jobs for Stevens; the chief part of them was to Mr. Bowen's; once or twice he told me to go to particular places, and then countermanded the order; the last time I went to Bowen's I took a parcel; I cannot tell what it was; it was on the 29th of July, in a truck; I made a memorandum of it at the time. I do not recollect any particular direction on that day; when I went there I had a strap with the name of Malcott and James on it. I should think I could not deliver any goods to Bowen without his seeing it, but I cannot tell; it was a broad strap with the letters inside; when it is pulled off, any body. I should imagine could see the name. I do not know that I ever carried goods before eight o'clock in the morning, or after four in the afternoon; I delivered them in the shop where the men were at work, and sometimes they helped them in and I went away; I was called in from the street sometimes by one, and sometimes by another; Mr. Richardson has seen me three times out of four: Mr. Stevens paid me once or twice; I have been told to go to some other place, and then countermanded in the street, and told to go to Mr. Bowen's.</p>
               <p>BOWEN'S Defence. The purchases made of Stevens were without a guilty knowledge. Though I am a sadler it is well known that I have been in the habit of buying and selling goods, by which I got a profit. Stevens first applied to me in March last, and gave me reference to Mr. Stevens, of Regent-street; I went there, and made enquiries, which were satisfactory. I bought the goods at a fair ready money price, and sold them again at a small profit; this went on till the end of July, and up to that time I had no idea but that he was what he represented himself to be, and I was confirmed in it by having sent letters to his uncle's and having answers to them I always considered him to be the agent of manufacturers, or dealers, and as such I dealt with him - if I had not, is it likely I should have carried it on, in the view of workmen and servants, and of everyone entering my house. When I was called upon by the officer I did not attempt to oppose him, but gave him every assistance in my power, and acquainted them that Shillitoe was out, and would return in the afternoon; I gave up the goods, and requested the officer to break upon the boxes and drawers. Should I have done this if I had possessed a knowledge of the theft? rather, should I not of had recourse to every method to have concealed them? The very fact of my purchasing such a quantity of goods will, I think, acquit me of any guilty knowledge of the charge, when I must have known that it would be discovered. I have made advances to Stevens for the purpose of purchasing goods, as will appear by a letter I have, in which he requests an advance to be made. I lent him 50 l., and however in cautions I have been I have not done it with a guilty knowledge. I cannot but lament that the prosecutor did not call upon me earlier, or send to me for the debt which stands upon their books; had they done that a considerable part of the debt would been saved to them.</p>

The prosecutor took me there himself, on Tuesday, the 10th of August - I found his wife there, and in a bed-room up stairs, in the closet, I found eleven rows of pearls in a piece of paper, in a pickle jar, concealed behind some rags. I had been fetched to Sparrow's, and found the prisoner there - I asked if he knew any thing of the pearls; he said not: I searched him and found one string of pearls in his shoe. I then told him I had been to his house, and that there was a considerable quantity more lost - he said all the rest were between the rafters and tiles in his wash-house - I went there, and found three ornaments.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday evening, the 1st of September, I apprehended the prisoner coming through Smithfield, riding on an ass. I took him to the watch-house, and asked who the ass belonged to; he said to a man in Turnstile - he afterwards said, voluntarily, that it was his own - that he bought it for 30 s. I found 13 s. on him, and asked him where the rest of the 5 l. was; he said he had bought a saddle and bridle for 16 s. 6 d.; also six trusses of hay, and had paid a month's rent for a stable for the ass - that he had changed the note at King's, and bought the ass with the money - I have the note.</p>

I asked to see them. He showed me four, and wanted 10 s. for them. He put some more things out of his bundle - petticoats and other things. I said they were of no use to me; he then said he would sell me the whole bundle for 2 l. I said I had but 30 s. I bought them of him for that. I was in bed on the night of the robbery.</p>

On the 26th of August, about a quarter or twenty minutes after ten o'clock at night, I saw Shannon go out of doors with a small bundle in her hand, Pickering followed her with a quart or pint mug, which, I cannot tell. Pickering put down the mug on the stones, and locked the door, and tried it after her: she went a little way, returned and looked through a little crack in the shutter, Shannon stood still until she came to her again, she said something to her, and they both went away together: three or four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160101"/>minutes after they were gone, I was at my window up stairs, and saw a light through the crack in the shutter, it appeared to me for about half a minute to be gone out, and then to increase a great deal: my son was coming down the street, I called to him to go over and look through the crack, I saw nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Shannon was Pickering's servant - A. I do not know, I have seen her there. Persons have collected before the house and broken the windows; that might be about three weeks before the fire: I do not think it happened more than once: the officers were there several times, through disturbances between Pickering and her sister. I have seen the neighbours about; the windows up stairs were all broken.</p>

            . I am the last witness's son. On the 26th of August, about a quarter past ten o'clock, I was coming from work; my mother was looking through the window, and in consequence of what she said I went over and peeped through a crack in the shutters of Pickering's house, and saw a blaze in the room. I crossed over to my own door, and looked through the shutter again, and could see the light in the room - I immediately crossed again to convince myself whether it was a fire or not; and seeing that it was, I knocked at the door - no one was there to answer; some young men were talking at the corner of the street. I gave the alarm of fire - they came and broke the shutters open, and broke the windows. I ran home, and got nine or ten pails of water and threw it over the fire. Deadman broke the door open with a crow-bar. I went into the passage with a pail of water; the watchman shewed me a light while I broke the door open, and entered the room. There was a little bag of paper shavings on fire in the cupboard on the first shelf, and an old pair of bellows and some rags in the cupboard were also on fire. One or two of the cupboard shelves were on fire: there was no fire any where else. There was no candle or lamp there - a bed laid on the floor close to the cupboard. I did not notice whether the cupboard was a fixture, or whether it was built with the house - it had no door to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been there before you went over - A. Directly. I threw the water in from the street. The cupboard was close to the fireplace, and had no door to it; all the windows in the upper part of the house were broken a fortnight before. I have seen one or two hundred people making a disturbance before the house. I cannot say how often it was - I will not swear that it was ten times. Perhaps I have seen it six or seven times.</p>

            , and live at No. 3, opposite to Pickering's house. On the evening of the 26th of August, I saw Pickering standing at her door; Shannon came up to her in a few minutes with a pot in her hand - it wanted about ten minutes to ten o'clock; they both went in, and shut the street-door after them - waited five or ten minutes, and then opened the street-door, and stood in the passage, and said something to each other. They then shut the parlour door - one of them had a bundle and a pewter pot on the pavement at the street-door. Then both came out - Shannon took up the pot and bundle and went on a little way, while Pickering locked the door, and tried it, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is quite safe." She went on to overtake Shannon - returned again, and looked through a crack in the shutters. Shannon returned, and took hold of her, and with a horrid expression, said,</p>
               <p>"Are you going to stay here all night? - I myself have made all that right." They had not been gone ten minutes before, I saw a glimpse of light through the shutters as I stood at the door. Stacy's son went and broke the shutters open, and gave an alarm. I did not go over - it is a narrow street, they talked loud enough for me to hear them on the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you and them particular friends - A. Not particularly good or ill friends; if they had looked over, they must have seen me. Mrs. Stacy was at her window up stairs; there were often mobs about the house. I have often seen the officers there, but it was not owing to any of the neighbours; there was a gas lamp against their passage, which enables me to see into the passage.</p>

            . I live in Turnmill-street. On the night of the 26th of August, I heard a cry of murder, and went to Castle-street. I went into the house after it was broken open, and saw a fire in the cupboard; there was a bed and mattress against the cupboard, and some shavings in the cupboard. I broke the shelves down - I saw no fire when I was in the house, but had seen it when outside; the rags and shavings had burnt as they laid at the bottom of the cupboard - the shelves were burnt: I knocked them down with a shovel. I do not know whether the cupboard was a fixture or not. I went up stairs, and found a deal table placed against the first floor door, outside; there was nothing in the room; some furniture was on the second floor, but none in the lower room that I noticed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What furniture was there - A. I saw a chest of drawer, a mattress and bedstead on the second floor, and there might be chairs and tables. The table was put against the door, to prevent any one from getting in, as the windows were broken - they had been broken two or three weeks before.</p>

            . I live in Turnmill-street. On the 26th of August, I was at my door; an alarm of fire was given. I broke the street-door open with a crow bar, and found the shelves of the cupboard burning - I have been at the house before. I think that the cupboard was originally built with the house, as it communicates with the wainscoat - all the shelves and the side of the cupboard was burnt. I pulled it down; the shelves were fixed to the wainscoat, either by nails or screws; there was cuttings of paper, old rags, and a pair of old bellows, part of which were burnt - the mattress laid on the floor. I had seen it three weeks before precisely in the same situation. I put my hand to the grate, the ashes were quite cold, and there was not the least appearance of fire having been there that night - the fire had gone no farther than the cupboard; there was a table in that room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. A rag merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean a dealer in marine stores - A. You may call me so:</p>
               <p>"Dealer in marine stores" is written over my door; I call myself a rag merchant: I deal in iron and lead. I have seen persons collected round the house several times; when I went there a fortnight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160102"/>before, there was a mob. I think I told the Magistrate that the side of the cupboard was burnt. The paper cuttings were white slips: I cannot say whether they are what people put into grates in the summer.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard an alarm of fire, and went to the house about twenty minutes after ten o'clock, and saw fire in the cupboard in one corner of the room, the whole cupboard appeared to be on fire; it was rather abated by water being thrown on it. I got a lantern, and saw a bed and mattress on the floor, with one laid against the cupboard. I took a small heap out of the cupboard on a large shovel; it happened to be some paper shavings, a pair of stays, and the wood of a pair of bellows, they appeared all to have been on fire, but put out by water. On the morning of the 26th, to the best of my recollection, about a quarter or ten minutes after five o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Turnmill-street; Pickering seeing me, came over and said</p>
               <p>"Watchman, people may think I have been out all night, being out so early in the morning, but I have not; I have been sleeping at a house which I have lately taken, for there is a bad lock on the door, and I was afraid to trust it, and now I am come down to see how this house goes on, for I have 200 l. worth of property there." Between a week or a fortnight before that, I saw some furniture carried out of her house early in the morning, it was loaded on a cart or van, she helped to carry some things; Shannon was with her. I went off duty, returned in about twenty minutes, and the cart was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it on the morning before the fire that you saw her in the street - A. To the best of my recollection it was, but she told me before the Magistrate that it was Sunday. I have seen a number of persons collected round her house. The paper shavings were like some I have seen in grates.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night of the 26th of August, as soon as the fire went out, I went with Rice to No. 15, Slade's-place; Pickering had taken that house, she was going to bed there - she asked what I wanted her for, I said I would tell her as soon as she got to the watch-house, and when we got there she asked me to be as good as my word. I said she was charged with setting her house on fire; she seemed much alarmed, and asked for water, and before that could be obtained, she went into hysterics. I went to the house next day, and brought away the cupboard, shelves, some burnt paper and rags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is Slade's-place from the house - A. Three or four minutes walk. I knew where to find her.</p>
               <p>RUEBEN RICE. I was with Clark, and apprehended the prisoners - they had lived in Slade's-place for nearly a fortnight. I have the cupboard shelves, stays, bellows, a gown, and pieces of paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The gown is a stuff one - A. Yes - it is not a thing which easily burns. She had slept at Slade's-place for a fortnight before the fire, and had moved part of her furniture there. I saw Pickering in Castle-street between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the fire. I have frequently seen persons collected before the house, and she has sent for me to disperse them - she was obliged to move in consequence of it.</p>

The prisoner superintended my business at Hounslow, where I keep seventy or one hundred horses; the prisoner generally bought the hay for them by my directions: it was his duty to buy hay when I directed: he has done so for twelve or fourteen years; he told me I should soon be in want of hay; I told him to look out for some, and he wrote me a note, which I produce.</p>
               <p>This note was here read. It was dated the 2d of February, and stated that he had bought ten loads of the best meadow hay of Mr. Buckland at 4 l. 10 s. a load.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this - A. I cannot say whether I wrote or sent to him - (looking at a bill of parcels) - I have paid Mr. Buckland the amount of this bill; I directed the prisoner to have this hay delivered at Hounslow - I cannot say whether it was verbally or by letter; my stables were formerly known as the Old King's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160103"/>Head: I had no horses any where at Hounslow but there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What other establishment for horses have you - A. One at Staines. Buckland lives at Rainsley; ten or eleven miles from Hounslow. I expected the hay to be delivered the beginning of last February. I cannot say whether I sent him a message that it was to be delivered at Hounslow, or whether I wrote him or told him verbally. It was his duty to buy provender when he knew I was in want, but he generally informed me what he wanted before he bought.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Under your directions he was to buy hay and straw for you - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know that he bought any for Dallimore - A. No; I accused him of buying straw for Dallimore, being informed that he had, and he said he had. I said I would suffer no servant of mine to buy hay, straw, or corn for anybody but myself, and if he did so again, I should dismiss him - this was a year and a half ago: his reply was, that he could not get paid for what he had bought, and should buy no more.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. After this hay had been bought of Buckland, did the prisoner see you, and say anything about it - A. He said it had been delivered. He bought hay occasionally for the horses at Staines. No hay of mine would be delivered at the Lion and Lamb stables. My eldest son at times goes down and gives orders, but very seldom, for he lives on the North-road, and had been extremely ill for three months about February.</p>
               <p>VIRGO BUCKLAND. I sold ten loads of hay to the prisoner for Mr. Waterhouse, at my house at Ranislury. The bill produced is what I delivered for it. The prisoner ordered it of me for Mr. Waterhouse. He told me to send it to Hounslow, two loads at a time - the two first were single loads. It was all delivered from the beginning of February to the end of March. I sent most of it by my man Rowe. Jackson is the boy who goes with him. I desired the carter to deliver it at the prosecutor's stables at Hounslow.</p>

            . I am carter to Mr. Buckland. In the early part of this year I was employed by him to deliver some hay; and one day, when I was going with some to Mr. Waterhouse's the Old King's Head, the prisoner met me by the gateway of the Lion and Lamb, and told me to leave one load there - he saw me do it, and pitched it into the loft himself at Mr. Dallimore's stables. I took the other load on to the Old King's Head. The prisoner was there, and saw me deliver it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Dallimore lives at the Lion and Lamb - A. Yes; the prisoner counted the trusses.</p>
               <p>MR. WATERHOUSE. The prisoner never accounted to me for any hay delivered at the Lion and Lamb. I had forbidden him to sell any for himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All your money transactions with him will appear by your books - A. He paid me for no hay. My cash-book contains no money transactions with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose your stock of hay to be suddenly exhausted, what was he to do - A. To look out for more, and inform me; but we never run our stock so close; if such a thing should happen, (but it never did) he would go to respectable farmers, and could always get hay on my account: I know of one instance in which he bought hay, and told me of it - I paid him for it; and have been told that he has some land on Hounslow-heath: I never authorized him to sell me hay.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he ever sell hay for you - A. I never authorized him to sell any at all, and never understood that he had sold any of that bought of Mr. Buckland; nor did he ever state that he had sent Dallimore any in re-payment for any he had borrowed, in a case of emergency; it is not at all probable that we should be out of hay.</p>

We had bought some of a jobber for 5 l. a load: there were four or five bad trusses among it - the man changed them, and moved from my stables, and English bought them of him.

On Tuesday, the 16th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I missed a coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, and a black silk handkerchief, belonging to another son of mine; they were safe the evening before. My cellar window was under repair; if any one had got in there, they might have got to the parlor, where these things were. The prisoner was brought in, and searched, in my presence. We found duplicates of the clothes, and 35 s. in money on him. He said nothing about the clothes; I got them back, and they are here now, The coat and waistcoat were in one place, and the trowsers in another.</p>

I came down, went out, and when I returned, I found he had gone out. He did not return. I searched the premises and missed the articles stated in the indictment; he had had them in his care. The gig harness is worth more than 40 s.; but it might have been taken separately, and the pieces would have been under that value.</p>

               <p>CHARLOTTE HAWTHORN. The prisoner slept at my house on the 8th of September, and had been there a week. I went out that day about two or three o'clock, and left her with my child; I returned in about a quarter of an hour; I searched my drawers, and missed three shirt bodies and a pair of stays: I had locked the drawer when I went out; I had seen them about a fortnight before.

            . I am a tailor. On the 31st of July, I was in my shop in Great Crown-court, and saw the two prisoners facing my house, near Mr. Clough's shop. Burn went into the shop, and immediately returned, folding something up in her apron; I looked out and saw them running; I went over to the shop, and asked if they had lost any thing. I could not follow them, because I had no person in my own shop. I saw Malony distinctly, and am positive to her person.</p>

            , he came on a visit by the invitation of Mr. Askew; I am quite certain Mr. Askew invited him. Those letters are Mr. Askew's writing (looking at them) I know his writing very well; indeed when Mr. Bertrand came, in the latter end of April, or beginning of May, 1824, he placed some money, and some French Billet Banques of the Royal Bank in my hands. I went to Cheltenham on the 4th of July; the prisoner and I were then on very good terms. I did not take all my property to Cheltenham; I left the bills in my chest of drawers in the bedroom; they were in a piece of whitey-brown paper, together with this letter, which is from a nobleman. I know a gentleman of the name of Hubert, but I never told him the signature of this letter before he saw it. I also left all the property stated in the indictment. (enumerating them.) Mr. Bertrand had put the promissory notes into my possession, to take care of. All the jewellery was given to me, but two rings, which I bought. I went to Cheltenham on the 4th of July, and received all these letters from Mr. Askew. I remained on good terms with him until about the beginning of August, when a disagreement began, of which jealousy was the cause. I received a gold watch from Mr. Askew, as a present, a fortnight before he had me arrested; he arrested me on Saturday, the 14th of August, for the money I had received for him at Cheltenham, which amounted to 55 l. he at that time owed me about 70 l. I gave the 55 l. and 10 l. to gentleman who arrested me. Mr. Askew came down to Cheltenham, and caused me to be arrested himself. He turned me out of the house on Saturday evening; he signed a paper before I went out of the house; this is the paper (looking at it.) It was signed at the desire of my attorney at Cheltenham.

             J Askew." At the time he signed this paper, he owed me 70 l., which he has never paid me. I returned to London on Monday, and made application for my property to Mr. Askew, with a witness - (Mr. Hutchings,) but I never got it. When I went to Cheltenham, I left my drawers locked; I left an inventory of some things, but not all: this is it - it was written by Mr. Bertrand before I left Paris. In consequence of this refusal to give me my property, I sent Mr. Hubert for my property; Mr. Askew said,</p>
               <p>"I have no objection to deliver to you your clothes, which are in the drawers, but not the bedstead and chest of drawers;" he said my clothes, were a few stockings and a few shifts, which I should have, but the furniture was not mine. I went a second time with Mr. Hubert, about three weeks after. Mr. Askew then said he would not deliver anything without his attorney; he did not deliver anything then to me. About a week after that, part of my property was brought by Mr. Hubert - a pair of diamond ear-rings, some stockings, and a few dresses, but no shifts. I had no other jewellery; the earrings were in the inventory; they are worth about 5 or 6 l. I was not present at the opening of my drawers. Before Mr. Hubert went to Mr. Askew's, I described to him something that was in my drawers; I told him there was a letter from a nobleman; I did not mention the inventory, I did not know that it was there; I received these ear-rings on the Saturday, about six o'clock in the evening, and made the complaint on Monday. I went to the magistrate with Bertrand; the magistrate decided the cause at the second sitting; my attorney was there and counsel, and Mr. Askew had advice likewise. When Mr. Hubert brought this property, I did not tell him that was all that I had left; I was very much hurt; I have never got my property; I am sure I left the bank-bills wrapt up in a paper with this nobleman's letter; I gave Mr.

            . He desired me to direct to him as His Excellency. I never heard him called by any other title but Excellence or General. I did not bring all these things from Paris: Bertrand brought some things. The clothes were not all included in the inventory which Bertrand made out in Paris; there are some things in Paris still. Bertrand brought me 29 shifts from Paris, a black silk dress, and some jewellery; the comb, the cross, and the small chain, the opera glass, the three spoons and three forks, another gold chain which I now have, and some other things which I cannot recollect: that is not all the linen and clothes he brought over; he brought over a lace veil. I never made an inventory of the things he brought over. I lived at No. 4, Rue de Grenelle, at Paris, when the prisoner came and engaged me. This letter is Mr. Bertrand's hand-writing (looking at it;), the direction is his writing.

            ; she was brought by Mr. Askew as a witness. That letter has never been in my drawer. This is also Bertrand's writing;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160106"/>it is a declaration to Mr. Abraham, an attorney, who lives in the City, near Temple Bar. He told me he had written it; I was close by him when he wrote it, but it was not by my direction; he did not read it to me. I saw Mr. Abraham several times with him; I don't recollect that I ever read it or saw it till now; I swear that; I don't recollect hearing it read; I don't know when it was written; it was written since my return from Cheltenham: I think it was before I employed Mr. Hubert. I had been con sulting Mr. Abraham about Mr. Askew's not delivering to me my chest of drawers and all the furniture of my bed-room. I went to Mr. Abraham before I employed Mr. Hubert. I don't know whether this paper was written to Mr. Abraham as instructions what he was to do; there is no part of my writing on the outside of that paper. I applied to Mr. Abraham perhaps about a fortnight before I went to Mr. Hubert, to whom I was recommended by the French Consul. I never mentioned to any one about the 9500 francs as being too much for me to lose: I mentioned it to Mr. Hubert when I begged him to apply for it. I never mentioned to Mr. Abraham or his clerk the particular things that were in the drawers. Mr. Abraham gave me an order to fetch my things from Mr. Askew, but not the jewellery: he was not employed for the jewellery, but for my agreement and the furniture of my bed-room. I may have told him about the jewellery, but as I expected to get the furniture, I thought I should get that. I don't recollect that I told him about it. I told him of a bill which I had paid Mr. Askew for my furniture. I don't recollect whether Mr. Abraham asked me for particulars, that he might make a demand; I can't swear it. This is the list I made out for Mr. Hubert to make the demand; part is my writing and part Bertrand's Mr. Bertrand lived in the Rue de Grenelle, No. 39; he is no relation of mine; he was a grocer; I have called him my brother by the order of Mr. Askew. Mr. Askew told me so in the carriage from Paris to London. Bertrand was not coming to England then, but he was invited to England by Askew. Mr. Askew gave me a particular reason for calling Bertrand my brother; I used to write to him very often: Mr. Askew desired me to call Bertrand my brother, for the reputation of his house, after Bertrand arrived in London, but not before; I said so at the Police Office; but the first time he told me to call him my brother was in the carriage. He then gave me no reason at all for it. I had never called Bertrand my brother before I came to London, but always spoke of him as such at Mr. Askew's. Mr. Askew told me in Bertrand's shop,</p>
               <p>"My desire is to make you happy when you come to London, and Bertrand will be there by and by." Bertrand gave me the Billet de Banque in the beginning of May; he brought them with his own things in his trunk, which was locked: it was kept in my bed-room, and I always had the keys; there were two locks, one was a padlock. Bertrand had been in London but a few days when he gave me the Billet de Banque; I was in my bed-room when he gave them to me out of his pocket-book to keep for him. Mrs. Hudson saw them one morning, and Bertrand came in and scolded me for it; that was about a month before I went to Cheltenham. Bertrand had some French and English gold beside. He never borrowed any money from me or any body to my knowledge. He had some bills which were not Billet de Banque, and I think he had some other Billet de Banque; he gave me more, and he used to go to the drawer, and take out what he wanted. I will not swear that I have seen him with any other Billet de Banque; I do not recollect when Bertrand came to England. He used to sleep in a warehouse at Mr. Askew's house; he removed from there about three weeks before I went to Cheltenham; he went to live in Berwick-street, at Mrs. Broadfoot's; Mrs. Askew took the lodging for him. I have sent him sometimes little different things, when he used to give me the money; Mr. Askew gave me permission to do so; he had a quarrel with Bertrand before I went to Cheltenham, and Mr. Askew forbade him the house, but gave me permission to send him some victuals; after I was at Cheltenham, Askew told me that he continued to send him things, and wrote so to me. He continued to lodge at Mrs. Broadfoot's, and I lodged there on my return from Cheltenham. Mrs. Broadfoot had never turned him away up to the time I left London for Cheltenham. Although Bertrand was not in the house, I continued to supply him with provisions, but not at Askew's expence: Bertrand paid very dear for it; the Billet de Banque were left in my possession because he went into furnished lodgings, and they are not always very safe. I told Bertrand on the Saturday evening, that I should bring them to him on Sunday morning before I went to Cheltenham, but did not, because we went too early - myself and two young ladies. I went on Sunday morning; I knew that I was going on the Thursday; Mr. Askew had before desired me to go, but I always refused, and even on Saturday night, when my box was packed up, I had not agreed to go. On the Thursday, or the day before, Mr. Askew returned from Cheltenham, and said he had taken a house, and he hoped I would go to oblige him, but I had not agreed to go; I was very cross with him on Saturday night; I had been to Bertrand, and promised to give him his billet de banque on Sunday morning; I saw him between ten and eleven o'clock at night; he lives but a little way from Mr. Askew, who lives at No. 85, Oxford-street, nearly opposite the Pantheon. Mr. Askew went to Bertrand for him to come again, and persuade me to go to Cheltenham; he had before talked of taking a house in the country, and wanted Bertrand to go and keep it for him; I did not, upon my oath, see Bertrand on the Sunday morning, before I set off; I went at six o'clock, and it was a wet morning, which was the only reason I did not give him the Billet de Banque; I had to dress myself and to breakfast, I never left any direction with Bertrand to go and take any of these things. I never took any account or number of these bills - it is not the custom in France. There were some of them like this one, but I cannot tell whether they are all alike; I did not look at them particularly. I did not take many white stockings to Cheltenham; I took five or six pair, and was obliged to buy some there. Mr. Askew told me not to take much with me, because unless it pleased me, I need not stay there. I did not take even a white dress; I was obliged to buy some. I did not write to Mr. Askew for any of my things; I was afraid to give up my key, because I had some money and some jewellery there. Some people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160107"/>have seen my jewellery; I have worn the ring bearing the portrait of the Emperor of Russia, but I do not know whether any body saw it. I had another ring of somebody else. I never wore any diamonds since Mr. Duland was here; I would not dress myself like a lady to be in the showroom; Miss Hudson saw some of my jewellery in my drawer; I may have taken her to show it her, but I do not recollect. I had a coral neck-lace, but I never said or swore that it was one of the things that was taken from me. I have said, that Bertrand had some other Billet de Banque and some gold. I live now in Berwick-street, at Mrs. Broadfoot's house. I never told Mrs. Broadfoot that I was married to Bertrand; but she is a woman to swear that which is untrue, because she is paid for it: I know it, a man told me so; I do not know his name, but it was the man that arrested us for the lodging; it was a distress, and my attorney has been kind enough to pay, because Mr. Askew has taken my all. The day Mr. Askew was taken to the Office, Mrs. Broadfoot's young boy was there, and said all manner of things. The man said that he saw another man who came to Mrs. Broadfoot's house, and spoke to Mrs. Broadfoot, and she said she would swear anything against me. Mrs. Broadfoot's son said he got 5 s. and his mother 5 s. and their victuals, and a coach to fetch them, and so they would swear any thing, and that is the truth. Mrs. Broadfoot never asked for her rent until Mr. Askew was arrested; that was in the presence of Bertrand; it is since Mr. Askew went to Newgate. I have not told her upon any occasion that I had 15 l. in my drawer at Askews, and with that I would pay her; but when we came from Cheltenham, Mr. Bertrand said, we have no money, but if she would be kind enough to let us into her house, we would pay her in November, or when we got our furniture and things from Mr. Askew's. When Mr. Askew had refused to deliver my things, I have said</p>
               <p>"That is 15 l. out of my pocket;" because Mr. Askew had not delivered to me my furniture, which was worth 15 l.; I paid for it, and have got my receipt. I have said to Mrs. Broadfoot</p>
               <p>"I will pay you with 65 l. which is in the hands of a man at Cheltenham." I had a letter from Mr. Askew, communicating the contents of this French letter, and I was afraid of it; it was not a long time before he was arrested; it was before I sent Mr. Hubert to demand my goods, but after I applied to Mr. Abrahams. The night that I came from the Office, I saw Mrs. Broadfoot at her house; it was on the 15th of September Mr. Askew was committed; I saw her every night. I never said,</p>
               <p>"I will have my revenge; I will hang him," though he has robbed me, it is not my wish to hang him. I never said to her,</p>

               <p>"Askew has gone to Newgate; I will have my revenge! I will have his life!" Mrs. Broadfoot did not say,</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop, not so fast! he is not tried yet." I know Mr. Unit, but I never told him that Bertrand had brought over 2,000 francs only, and had changed them at a shop in Regent-street; but I told Unit, to prove that Bertrand had brought some money with him, that I myself had changed 200 francs for him in St. James's-street. Bertrand never told him that he had brought over 2,000 francs only; but he told him, in my presence, about the 200 francs. I did not tell Unit that the produce of these 200 or 2,000 francs was locked up in my drawer at Mr. Askew's, nor did Bertrand; but I said I had exchanged 200 francs about three weeks ago. Mr. Askew said, his reason for forbidding Bertrand his house was, because Bertrand was my friend, and it was on account of jealousy. I had none of the jewellery at Cheltenham.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You said to Mr. Adolphus that you had lost 15 l. through not having the furniture; is this the receipt for it? - (Looking at it) Yes. I told Mrs. Broadfoot, after I had a letter from Mr. Askew, that I would pay her in November, with the 65 l. in the Sheriff's hands at Cheltenham. The letter from Mr. Askew is not signed, but his own servant brought it; here is a translation of the French letter. I went to Cheltenham in July; Mr. Askew and I had quarrelled. Bertrand was then receiving things from Mr. Askew; he was still trying, notwithstanding the quarrel, to get 
               <persName id="t18240916-272-person2324">Bertrand</persName>
             a situation. In July, when I went to Cheltenham, I had but one key to my drawers, and I took it with me. I am sure I left the bills and jewellery in the drawers. When I was with Bertrand on Saturday night I did not know I was to go so early as six; Askew never told me the hour. Mr. Abraham never got me any thing, and then the French Consul recommended me to Mr. Hubert, and I employed him. Some of the jewellery was not in the inventory in the drawer; it was only of the things I brought with me to London. I heard the Russian gentleman called His Excellence, and that is why I called him a Nobleman. When I was travelling in the coach with Askew, he was very kind and attentive to me, and I objected to it, because, I said,</p>

               <p>"You are married, and I am engaged to Mr. Bertrand." I used to write to Bertrand very often, and Mr. Askew said,</p>
               <p>"You must call him your brother." I said,</p>
               <p>"He is not;" and Mr. Askew said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, you must call him so." Miss Dulan came with Mr. Askew; I did not desire it. I don't know whether she was examined on my part or not.</p>
               <p>A. WATTS. I 
               <persName id="t18240916-272-person2325">drew</persName>
             this agreement (looking at it), by the mutual instructions of the prisoner and Miss Perrot; Bertrand was there but gave no instructions. It was left in the possession of Miss Perrot; there was a copy of it, which Mr. Askew had. I don't know whether Miss Perrot had it then; for while it was in our custody, a message came from Mr. Askew, not to deliver it. That was about two days after we had it. It was five days or a week before Miss Perrot got it: she had called twice in that time. I mean positively to swear that there was a copy of it, and Mr. Askew had one part of it at the time of the execution, and I think he put it in his pocket. I am not certain whether I took it away with me, or it was given to us afterwards by some other person, one of the parties. I do not know how many times Miss Perrot and Bertrand called for it before they got it. I will swear they did not use threats to get it; there were two parties to it. Mr. Askew had one, and the other party one; it has not been altered in any way since I wrote it.</p>

            . I came to England in the end of April this year. I know Miss Perrot. Three or four days after I came to England, I put into her hands seven billets de banque, of 1000 francs each, and five of 500 francs each, to take care of. I have never got them back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Are these your handwriting (handing some letters.) - A. I think they are; but I do not very well know my own hand-writing. I have known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160108"/>the last witness four years. I do not know how many times she has seen me write; I have written many letters to her. I came from France in the month of April. I am sure I was not here in March. I did not make any memorandum of the notes I brought with me; it is not the custom in France; they were of the Bank of France; I do not know what Bank they were. The bills for 1000 francs were the same as the 500 franc bills in all respects except the amount. The 1000 franc billets de banque were like this one. I was a grocer at Paris. When I came here I left the business; I do not now carry it on. The bills I left with Miss Perrot were seven for 1000 francs, and five for 500 francs; I do not know whether I left more with her. I made an inventory for her when I was in Paris. I do not recollect whether I told her the amount of the bills; I gave them to her all together to take care of, in her bedroom. I have seen her open the drawers in my presence. I recollect they were put into a drawer; but I cannot tell what drawer. There was a box in her bed-room. I have no doubt that this is a translation of one of Miss Perrot's letters, made by herself - (looking at it) - I was at Mr. Askew's house at the time I gave the bills to Miss Perrot, and continued there about a month. I gave her the bills to take care of for fear of losing them at my furnished lodgings. I am not sure whether my box was in that room then. I did not put the bills into the box, because it is not comfortable to put them in with clothes. I received the bills in my shop. I cannot say that I took them all in the shop, but when I got 500 francs I have exchanged them in the Rue de Banc. I cannot tell the name of any one person from whom I received any one of them. I have been to an agent of exchange several times, but I do not know his name. I received one 1000 francs bill from a servant of the director of the prisons, Mons. Ronne; he is not a changer of money. I had more money in England. I had one more 1000 francs bill; I changed that near the Haymarket three or four weeks after I came here. I have not changed any other French paper money. I have not frequently received money from Perrot: I have never received any of her. I never received any communication respecting a situation as teacher, through a person named Pascan; I do not know the name. I never received any communication respecting my becoming teacher of French in a school, or heard any thing of it; and never applied for 30 l. to enable me to take it. When I became acquainted with Miss Perrot she was a very respectable person. I never went to her drawers to take money. It is possible I might have her keys, but I do not remember it. I had some French gold in the drawer. Sometimes I went to her drawer - very seldom - two or three times. Mr. Askew told me I should pass as her brother: he did object to my intimacy with her; that was always the subject of our quarrel. I have lodged in the same house with her, at Mrs. Broadfoot's. I did not say to Mrs. Broadfoot yesterday, that if she proved any thing against Miss Perrot or me, I would say she had asked me to sleep with her. I have said to her in her house,</p>
               <p>"Your conduct is abominable; you send your son to the Magistrate and destroy my character, and you know what I know, and what I can say." Mr. Askew took the lodging for me in that house; I had no quarrel with Mrs. Broadfoot till I found she was to be a witness against me. I was once going up stairs at Mr. Askew's, and Miss Perrot was showing my bills to Miss Hudson, and I said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you show them?" Miss Hudson was then in the room or on the same floor: Miss Hudson has told me she has seen them. I never said at Cheltenham, in Miss Hudson's presence,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Askew is a very bad man, and I will bring him as low as the ground." I never had any thing good to say of him. I have conversed with Mrs. Broadfoot, but won't undertake to state what I have said of Mr. Askew; I have always looked at him as the dirt. I never said I was married to Perrot, or that we were man and wife, nor has she in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When you intended to come to England, did you keep a sum of money for that purpose - A. Yes. I brought near 11,000 francs. I gave some gold to Miss Perrot; I have been to her drawer for it. The Bank in Paris is a public Bank; I did not know the name of any person there. The gentleman who's servant brought me one of the bills, is a director of the prisons. I had never quarrelled with Broadfoot, till after Askew was complained of; on our arrival from Cheltenham she treated us as her children.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I was engaged by Miss Perrot about the 1st of September. I went by her direction to Mr. Askew's, and demanded the property, of which she had furnished an inventory; this is the inventory; I believe I did not produce it the first time I went, but I requested a settlement of accounts between them; I claimed upwards of 70 l. for wages, and also the property she stated to be in his possession. He said what property she had was locked up in her chest of drawers; he said he had great complaints to make against her - she was a bad woman. I asked him how he could convince me of that; he said he had documents in his possession which would prove it; I requested him to show me them; he said</p>
               <p>"If I knew you better I would." I said</p>
               <p>"One document would be more convincing than anything he could say." Before I went to him, Madamoiselle Perrot had described a certain document which she said was in a chest of drawers, and when I asked Mr. Askew to show me the document on which he relied, he went up stairs, and brought down a letter; I read it two or three times. He said, perhaps, I did not understand the French language; he had a translation of it. I did understand it, and I said it was extremely extraordinary that he should be in possession of a confidential letter, and asked him how he had obtained it; he said it was of no consequence how he had obtained it; but he had got it. Madamoiselle Perrot had described a letter from a foreign nobleman, as being in her drawer, and this is the letter; the translation corresponds with the letter; the signature had not been told me; Madamoiselle Perrot said it was in French; she told me the name of the person who wrote it, but there is no name on the letter, nor does it appear to have come from a foreign nobleman. Nothing further passed about it, and soon after I went away; this was on Saturday, the 4th of September, and the next time I saw him was on Tuesday, the 7th of September; I had in the mean time seen Miss Perrot, and she had given me a document, which I have now in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160109"/>hand. I see by an indorsement on the back of this paper, that it was the first time I saw him that I showed it him, and demanded the property. On the second interview, I waited on him with Miss Perrott, and requested him to pay her the wages which she claimed; and also, to deliver the property in her chest of drawers; and I said I thought, as the parties had complained against each other, the best way would be for him to give up the property she claimed, and then I should advise her to have the agreement given up, and it should be cancelled. He said she had already broken the agreement. I said I would not discuss that subject then. He said he would do nothing without consulting his solicitor; I then left him, requesting him to name an early day to settle the business; he named the next day, at four o'clock, but I did not go, in consequence of some intimation from Madamoiselle Perrot, but I went on the following Saturday alone. I had met him in the morning in the City, and it was agreed, that I should wait upon him at four o'clock. I requested that she should go with me to identify her property; he strongly objected to that; I urged it several times without effect; but he said, if she would write an order for him to deliver the property to me, and give me the key, it should be delivered to me. I am quite sure he mentioned the delivery of the key. I went at four o'clock, and took an order which I had written, and Miss Perrot had signed. I had shown him the inventory on the first occasion. At the third interview I was shown into the room, but just as I had opened the drawer, he went away. I believe there were two ladies and a Gentleman in the room. I did not find the goods corresponding with the inventory, but I found some of them, and I made an inventory of what I did find. Here is the inventory I made. I found a pair of diamond ear-rings, which are these, but no other articles of jewellery. I found an inventory in the drawers, in French: here it is. I did not search the drawers for any other articles than what were in the inventory she had given me. I could find no Bank Bills or the confidential letter she described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. When did you see Mr. Askew first on this business - A. On the 4th of September; I had two interviews with him before I saw Etherington and Gregory. I did not leave the inventory or a copy of it with him, nor a demand in writing, but read the articles from the inventory. I said, I came from Miss Perrot, and the Consul had written me a letter on the subject. I did not say, I came from the French Consul. He afterwards showed me the letter; it was the third interview, I had the key, and went into room, but at the the first interview, he produced the letter. When I demanded the goods, at the second time, I proposed that they should give up the agreements, and they should be cancelled. If Miss Perrot had received her property and wages, we should have had no ground of complaint. I read the letter twice over: it was such a one as, perhaps, a Lady would not like to have made public; I should think it was of a nature to irritate the mind of Miss Perrot; she has been very much vexed at its being in Mr. Askew's possession; she has not expressed to me that it has been shown to other persons. I went before a Justice, about the beginning of September. I cannot recollect the date when I was requested to attend at Marlborough-street, by Miss Perrot. I saw Mr. Conant on the subject; it was before the goods were delivered up to me, I believe, but I cannot swear it.</p>

I had left that shop a few minutes to go to the other, and on returning I saw the prisoner coming out of the back parlour; he came into the shop and asked for something, but what he I said don't know. I enquired what he wanted there; he said,</p>

            . I am a veterinary-surgeon, and live in Grosvenor-mews. I saw the prisoner at Wreckin-tavern, in Covent-garden, and had some business with him - he deals in horses, and lives at Kensington. He said he wanted a horse for a gentleman at Streatham of the name of Sewell; I said I had a very clever horse in my stable, if he would give the money; he said that would not be an object if he liked him. I said I could not well send it, but a porter came from him next morning, and I gave him a note to go and get the horse. I was to meet him in the afternoon, at his stables, to settle about it - I met him, and he said he it was a likely horse; he thought it would suit Mr. Sewell, who he expected every moment to try him; I said I would call about one or two o'clock, which I did, and found the prisoner, but the horse was gone. He said the gentleman had rode him, and liked him - if I would meet him at four o'clock he would settle with me. I met him at that time; he said,</p>
               <p>"I can't do it now, I have to go into the City," but if I would meet him at twelve o'clock next day he would settle it; I went, and he again said he was going into the City, I must call at two. I went - he was not ready then, but said he was going to his brother at the Stock Exchange, to receive the money, and if I would meet him at four o'clock he would settle it: he then put me off till six o'clock - I went at six, but he was not ready - I told him I suspected he was not doing right. He then wanted me to wait till Monday, which I refused, and he put it off till the next day, but I did not get it then. I then went to Streatham, but could find no such person as Mr. Sewell.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you not state to the prisoner that you wished to do business with him, and to begin in a small way - A. No, I swear that; it was the first time I talked with him. I have met him there several times. I had some dealings and conversation with him about two horses of mine: he said he had had horses of Pennington, but I did not say I should be glad to deal with him on the same terms, nor that that was a month's credit.</p>

            . I have seen Mr. Powis and the prisoner together, in conversation, about Mr. Powis's mode of dealing with Mr. Pennington - it was before the prisoner had Mr. Price's horse. Mr. Powis said that if the prisoner could let him have the money in a month or six weeks he should be perfectly satisfied, and it would be better to begin with one or two horses in a small way; this was the first week in 
               <persName id="t18240916-275-person2351">August.</persName>
             I have a distinct and perfect memory about it. I know of no dealings that they had had before.</p>
               <p>CHARLES GIBLING. I am servant to the prisoner. In August last I was present when he talked with Mr. Powis about two chestnut horses. I went with a note to Mr. Powis and fetched them without money: we had them a week or ten days before they were parted with. Mr. Powis came almost every day to see my master. I was sent for to the Wreckin-tavern, where Powis and my master were at dinner. I got an order from them when they were at the Wreckin, and the next morning I got the horse. Mr. Powis came to our stables, I think the next day; he asked how the horse was; I said it looked very well: he said it was seventy-five guineas; the horse was then at the stable, and they talked then about it. There was no other bargain made; it was to be sold by my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. A. When you went to the Wreckin, your master and Mr Powis were at dinner - A. Yes; I do not know what was said before - I do not know Mr. Sewell of Streatham; I went soon after six o'clock next morning, and delivered the note to George, his man; he gave me the horse; it was then put into our stables, and stood there a good while; it never was sold.</p>

Yes - his cousin; I live at No. 9, Regent-street, Charing-place; I lived before that at Park-street, Kennington-cross: I was at Mr. Wetenhall's house at the time of this conversation: on the 1st of September there was some talk about a horse being sold for seventy-five guineas - the subject arose about three horses; Mr. Powis said he wanted the money for his horse - the prisoner said he was going out of town, but if he could wait a month he would give him the money; Mr. Powis said he should be quite satisfied. On the 2nd of September my cousin went down to Kingston: he continued there till the Monday, when he and his wife returned to town; he has been in town ever since.</p>

On the 7th of July I went to see the review on Hounslow-heath, and staid there till late in the evening. I was in a booth at the time this happened. I had taken a little drink, but swear that I was quite sober. I went into the booth between nine and ten o'clock with a young man who works with me; he is not here - and in a quarter of an hour, as I was coming out of the booth, (it was light,) I put my hand into my pocket, and took out half a crown to pay for some beer; and when I had paid the reckoning, some person struck me behind on the head - it was a severe blow; I could not see who it was - I was then dragged by two persons out of the booth - one of them laid hold of my arm. I had about 12 s. or more in my pocket. About twelve people then came and formed a circle round me, and I was shoved from one to the other for two or three minutes, and then the prisoner came up on my left side, and put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and then into my trowsers pocket. I had two half-crowns in my waistcoat pocket; I put my hand to it after he had taken his out, and found the money was gone. I could not make the least resistance; there were so many people about me - I was afraid to resist. After he took his hand out of my trowsers pocket, I received a severe blow in the face, which knocked one of my teeth out. I was knocked down on the ground, and received several kicks. I got up, and then my coat was taken off my back. I then made towards the booth to save my life; they got between me and the booth, and prevented my getting in, and hawled me three or four yards from the booth. I was again knocked down on the ground - and one of them came and jumped on my legs, sprained it (I was under the doctor's hand with it) my waistcoat and shirt were then taken off my back, and the handkerchief off my neck, and the shoes off my feet - an umbrella was taken from me at the time; they took my coat - I was left naked all but my trowsers and stockings - my money was all taken.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner you say is one of the party who illused you, and took your money? look at him, and say if you can safely swear that he was one of them - A. I can, my Lord; he kept staring me in the face before this ill usage began. I had observed him staring at me, and can safely swear that he is the man - he was a stranger before. Nobody came to my assistance; and after my clothes were gone, I was naked. I was hopping about towards the barracks, calling</p>
               <p>"Murder;" they all left me when they had stripped me. I called</p>
               <p>"Murder" while they attacked me also; I made it known next morning, but did not go before a Magistrate till evening, in consequence of my leg being so bad. I went before Mr. Trimmer at Histon, and was obliged to apply to the overseers of the parish, being so ill, and went into the workhouse to be cured; I was fetched from the workhouse about a week afterwards, and saw the prisoner in custody, and was certain of his person, and stated so to the Magistrate. I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not your name O'Sheehan - A. No. I had drank part of three pints of beer, and had some bread and cheese between me and another man that day, and I had part of a pot of beer with another man at six o'clock that evening, and about seven I had about three pints in a booth, and had nothing more all day. I went to the review at twelve o'clock, but did not go to drink till half-past four, when it was over. I drank nothing else. None of my companions were drunk while I was with them. I was a little fresh, but nothing to affect me. This happened about half-past nine o'clock, it was light. I did not see the prisoner till I came out of the booth; he was not one of the three who first came up. They did not shove me about till he came up; they surrounded me, and then he came up to me. I did not observe him before. I was frightened - for I had cause so to be. There were at least twelve people around me: I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>JURY Q. Was it a rainy day - A. It was a rainy morning before the review commenced; it cleared up between three and four o'clock, and did not rain again.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and was at the review, acting as servant to Mr. Cook, who keeps a booth. This happened thirty or forty yards from our booth. I heard a cry of murder between nine and ten o'clock and came out of the booth, and saw a party of people a little way from our booth; I went up, and saw them taking hold of Sheehan, and were dragging him on the ground. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160112"/>forced an umbrella out of his hand. He got up, and I saw him knocked down. There were twelve or thirteen people surrounding him, and all going on ill using him. They then got his coat off his back - he attempted to keep it under his arm. He made his escape into a gingerbread stall with the coat under his arm; they rushed after him, and took away his coat. I saw him bleeding at the mouth, he walked very lame, and appeared to be hurt in the leg. They all came again, and took him from the stall round to the back part of a publican's booth; I could not see what they did there, but in five minutes I saw him without shirt, waistcoat, and handkerchief; he had nothing but his trowsers and shirt, and appeared to have been much hurt. I could distinguish several of the persons. I saw the prisoner there; I am quite certain that he is one of them. I was afraid to interfere to assist him. It was light - I could very easily distinguish a person's features. The rain had cleared up about three o'clock, and it was a fine evening. I attended before the Justice about a week after, and saw him in custody, and am certain he was one of the men. I swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go up into the crowd while this was going on - A. I was not in the crowd; I was looking at it; I heard murder cried, and went to see what it was. Every time they took anything they ran from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not run to some house and give an alarm - A. If I had run, very likely I should be attacked by some of them; I did not leave till they left him. I heard them say they would go and have something to drink; I ran up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, you cannot go in here, there is nobody there; master is not there;" the booth was pinned down. One of them was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you give information at any place about this - A. About four o'clock in the morning. There were twelve or fourteen booths on the beath, but I was afraid to move to give information. It might last altogether about an hour and a half, but I was not there at the beginning. I was there for three-quarters of an hour, and had drank nothing that day but about a pint and a half of beer; and a gentleman, whose horse I was minding, gave me two glasses of stout.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the cry of murder, why not go and give information, instead of going to the place - A. I went to see what was the matter, and when I got up I was afraid to leave: I said nothing to them - they went down the course, and I after him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in the slightest degree intoxicated - A. I was not; I was frightened.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 14th, I apprehend the prisoner at Monlsey Hurst - I told him it was for ill using and robbing Sheehan; he at first said he was not there, and then that he was there; I put him into the cage at Hampton-court, and took him before Mr. Trimmer, at Heston, next day. The prosecutor saw him that evening; he (Sheehan) was at that time very lame; indeed, I found him at the workhouse - he could just put his foot to the ground, but could not walk without a stick; he was examined before the Magistrate, and the prisoner committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. He at first said he was not there, and then that he was - A. Yes; I had old him of the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. He said he was not at the robbery - A. No; he said he was not on the heath at all, and then said that he was; three more persons were taken, but could not be identified.</p>
               <p>JURY to SHEEHAN. Q. Do you know the man who was drinking with you - A. Yes; his name is Evans; he works with me; he went away about four minutes before this began.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; the officer asked me, as we went along, if I knew any of the people who were there; I said I knew nothing of them, but should know them if I saw them again, and that I had heard two men in the morning say, that two of them worked in a brickfield.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On the the 24th of August, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to pawn a gown; but having had information, I stopped it; he ran out, leaving it behind, but a watchman was coming by, and stopped him; and in about three minutes a duplicate was brought to me belonging to Graham and Co.</p>

After I was in bed I was alarmed by a noise below, like a person attempting the house; I listened again, and heard a noise such as I could imagine might be that of a door being attempted to be wrenched, upon which I sprung a rattle.

            . I am the watchman. In consequence of some alarm while I was crying the hour of three o'clock; I came to this house, and Low came with me; I went to the back of the house, got a ladder, and got over the wall; when I came to the back door of the house, I tried, and found it open; I heard somebody walking in the passage, I asked if that was Mr. Treacher, a man's voice answered Yes, I then went forward and saw a man, I said</p>
               <p>"You are the man I want," he went up stairs and jumped out of the staircase window; I returned to the back door, thinking he was gone into the garden, but he had gone into the next garden; I went after him but he escaped; I heard some other persons in the house, but could not see them. I am sure there was more than one; I afterwards went round to the front of the house. I took Martin about six o'clock the same morning on the road going towards town, about sixty yards from the house, he had no hat on; I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you lost your hat," he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he had been in an affray about three hours before, and lost it;" I took him to the watch-house, he did not say where the affray was. I went back to the house as soon as the patrol had taken Richards to the watch-house, it might be then about four o'clock, the thieves were gone. I found the front door open, and this dark lantern near it in the passage; this part of a centre bit there, and another part of it in the back garden; a crow bar was in the stair-case window. I found two hats in the passage, and a shoe on the landing place; one hat I have brought, the other I gave to Martin, as he came to town, because it rained; he claimed it as his own, at Queen-square. I believe what he said was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it you who addressed this young man about where he was going - A. Yes, he was about sixty yards from the house; he said he had been in an affray, and lost his hat - he openly owned it; it was then day-light. I was crying three o'clock when I was first called; it was last Saturday morning, and was very foggy. I do not know that I should know the features of a man ten yards from me.</p>

            . In consequence of some alarm, I came to the house about three o'clock. I went to the back of the house, and also to the front of it. I saw Richards and some other man come out of the front door. I got over the rails, between the two persons, and secured Richards. I asked him if he knew the others, he said that it was all right. I went back to the premises - went in at the front door, and through to the back door. I saw they had broken the door with a crow-bar. I tried the bar, and it corresponded exactly with the mark in the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which did you apprehend - A. Richards. I do not know that I had ever seen the other man before, but I have seen him since. I was half a minute securing Richards, and the other ran away instantly - I could not swear to his person.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I went to the house about three o'clock. I saw Price the patrole there. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160114"/>at the front of the house when the two men came out - I saw Price take one. I ran after the other across the road - he got into a ditch close to the hedge; he then got out of the ditch and ran. I picked up a stone and knocked his hat off. I took up the hat, and a phosphorus box was in it. Martin afterwards owned the hat. I carried it into the house, and put it into the passage. About six o'clock I found a handkerchief against the street-door, outside - Martin claimed that also at Queen-square, before the Justice, while I was there. I was present when Martin was taken, close against the Hand and Flowers public-house. Jenkins and myself went across to him - Jenkins asked him where he had been, and what he had done with his hat - he said he had lost his hat in an affray at a lady's house - he then went to the watch-house, he had not any hat on at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Jenkins hear him say this - A. Yes; I am sure he said he lost his hat at a lady's house - he spoke loud enough for Jenkins to hear him; he is one of the men who I pursued. I am certain, I saw him by the gas-light, and knew him directly I saw him in the morning. When he was running from me his back was to me - I had observed him for about five minutes; he ran across the road, about twenty or thirty yards. I picked up a stone to knock him down. I saw his face by the gas - he came full in my face coming over the pales.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave Richards a good character; and one deposed the same for Martin.</p>

               <p>"I have got an apron;" the prisoner who had a knife in his hand to prepare hung-cloth with, came out of the store-house, went past Jones up to

            , and without saying a word, took hold of his apron and cut it nearly across - he then cut a second time, and the deceased threw his apron back, to prevent his cutting it; the deceased then took hold of the prisoner's white apron, set his foot upon it and tore it; nothing further happened at that moment. I turned my head aside, and heard a witness say</p>
               <p>"Good God Brown, what have you done." I turned round, and Scott was shaking his left hand, which held very much indeed, Scott turned to Brown, and said</p>
               <p>"If you have any malice against me, don't cut me, strike me;" he then hit Brown with his right hand. Jones said to Scott</p>
               <p>"Put your hand into the liquor-stand" - he did so. I said to him</p>
               <p>"Take your hand out and go to a doctor;" we took up the bits of apron and tied up his hand; the prisoner with others went with him to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner went with him to the doctor - A. Yes; there was no expression used but what I have stated; he cut the deceased's apron for a piece of bung-cloth. I did not see how the wound was inflicted; the aprons are made of the same cloths as hung-cloth.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Reynolds. On the 9th of August, the prisoner asked me if I had any bung-cloth. I said No; Scott was coming up the yard, and said</p>
               <p>"What do you want, bung-cloth?" he said Yes; then said he</p>
               <p>"Cut Jones's apron," Brown said</p>
               <p>"I may as well cut yours;" he passed by me and cut off a piece of Scott's apron with the knife. Scott did not seem to like it; he laid hold of Brown's apron and tore it off. Brown looked very savage, and took hold of Scott's apron again. Scott went back that he should not get his apron. Brown cut at the apron again, and cut Scott's hand - some of the blood came in my face. Scott said</p>
               <p>"If you have any animosity against me, don't cut me, strike me;" he then struck Brown with his fist. I said</p>
               <p>"For God's sake take him to a doctor," and Brown and Henniugton took him; they had had a few words a little time before. Brown was fond of giving a joke, but could not take one - they had a few jokes together. Brown said he did not mind me or my partner; but he would not put up with Scott's jokes, and would serve him out; but whether he meant to give him a thumping or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Did he cut more than once at the apron - A. Yes; he cut one piece off at one chop, and then cut properly at the apron all the way.</p>

            . I am a drayman in the employ of Mr. Reynolds. I saw Scott lay hold of Brown's apron and tear it to pieces under his feet - after which Brown took hold of his apron, cut at it several times with the knife; the deceased, in attempting to pull it back from Brown, snatched at it, and received the cut. I saw Scott strike Brown - it was not a very severe blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In endeavouring to pull the apron back was the time he received the cut - A. I think it was the knife went against his hand. In my opinion it was quite an accident.</p>

               <persName id="t18240916-284-person2417">August. He</persName>
             died of a disease in the chest in about three weeks after he came. I have no doubt that the wound of his hand hastened his death. He died of inflamation of the lungs. He was opened, and the state of his lungs lead me to say this - there was an appearance of disease of the lungs before he received the wound; it was most likely excited by the wound, which otherwise might have remained quiet. The loss of blood was very considerable, which, with the irritation of the constitution, no doubt excited the complaint. I believe he would have died of the disease eventually, but he might have lived several years. I cannot say that the lungs might not have been excited by anything else - a cold, or other things, might have done it.</p>
