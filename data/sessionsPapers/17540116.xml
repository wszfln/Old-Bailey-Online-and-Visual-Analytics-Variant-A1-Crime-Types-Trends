            . I live at Twickenham, and was sent for by the prosecutor to Reading, as I had lost a mare at the same time. I went, and saw the prisoner there in the Compter. Coming from thence I saw Sandey the younger come gallopping hard up the town on the prosecutor's mare. The prosecutor came, and he, I, and Sandey, went to the prisoner, there they both charged him with stealing the mare; but the prisoner said he bought her, and owned he sold her to Sandey; and Sandey said he gave him six guineas for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he bought her of?</p>
               <p>Hide. He said he bought her of the man that lived at the George at Old Brentford. But I knew there was no such sign there. The prisoner had got my mare there, at the Black Horse, which I had again.</p>

               <p>John Jervas. I let a ready-furnish'd lodging to the prisoner the 6th of last month. She went away the 13th in the evening; not returning, I went into the room the next day, and missed the goods mentioned in the indictment, [ naming them all over.] I took up the prisoner, and charged her with taking the things; she told me where they were, saying she had sold some, and pawned the rest, and by her direction I went and found the curtains, blankets, vallens, saucepan, and looking glass, at Mr. Shilingworth's, in Water-lane, Black-friars, where she had sold them; he delivered them to me. The sheets, candlesticks, flat irons and teakettle were at a pawnbroker's and were deliver'd to me also.</p>

This was betwixt four and five o'clock; we heard a great noise, and my mother ordered me to open the door, which I did, and saw the prisoner stand on the other side of the way with a piece of brick bat in his hand; his wife was near Mrs. Norman's door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from his wife at that time?</p>
               <p>Lane. About nine or ten yards, the alley in which they were is about two yards broad. His wife saw Mrs. Norman put her head out at her door to see what was the matter, and cried out, For God's sake take care. But before these words were well out of her mouth the brick bat hit Mrs. Norman on the forehead, and then bounded into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any words between the prisoner and his wife before this?</p>
               <p>Lane. Before I opened the door I heard his wife say, You Dog, I keep you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the noise you before heard a noise of quarreling?</p>
               <p>Lane. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the kennel from the door?</p>
               <p>Lane. A little above a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the brick bat?</p>
               <p>Lane. It is a quarter of a brick. It was produced in court. This is it. Mrs. Norman clapped her hand to her forehead, and said, For God's sake send for Mrs. Willis; for I am almost killed; then the deceased's husband took him, and carried him into Mr. Norman's house; they asked him how he came to throw that stone? He own'd several times that he threw it, but not with a design to hurt that poor woman; meaning Mrs. Norman.</p>

They sent for an apothecary, who said the place was very bad; the prisoner said, he threw it at his wife, but did not know he had hurt any body; this he said several times. I had heard much talk between the prisoner and his wife. She said, You rogue, don't I keep you? and such aggravating words. The witness Charles Lane is my son by my first husband.</p>

               <p>Willis. She died on the 5th of December. This was on the 12th of November. I attended her, being a neighbour, all the time of her illness; she found herself as well as could be expected the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160006"/> fortnight, afterwards complained of a pain shooting thro' her head; then her stomach fell off.</p>

            . I am husband to the deceased. On the 12th of November I was sitting by the fireside, and heard a great noise by a woman; my wife being washing in the house, she opened the door to see what was the matter. She had not opened it above a minute and half before she said she was almost killed. I got up and went to the door; there was Charles Lane standing at his mother's door, I said, Who threw this? and he pointed to the prisoner; there was none but him near. My son and I then went and laid hold on him, and brought him into my house. He told me he did not throw it at my wife, but at his own wife. His wife came in, and he said, This comes by your tongue, this is all along of you, and was going to beat her. I asked him where he lived; he said, he was out of business, and could make no satisfaction. I took him before Justice Withers, and a surgeon giving an account that the wound was a very bad one, he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she die?</p>

             the fifth of December. She kept her bed for about a week; we were in hopes, for near a fortnight, that she would have recovered. She always complained of a very great pain in her head, and that when she bent her head forward she had a violent weight upon the forepart of it. I judge that was the cause of her death; for she was in good health before, and was then a washing.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. What was her opinion of it?</p>
               <p>Willis. She often said this wound would be the death of her; but she was of opinion, from his words, that he did not intend to throw it at her.</p>

            . I am daughter to the deceased, and was standing by my mother when she was washing. Hearing a noise, she opened the door and looked out, and in about a minute the brick bat cut her in the face. I saw the brick bat fly from her face to the kennel, which is about a yard and half. She turned into the house, and put her hands to her forehead, which was covered with blood. The prisoner was brought in, and said he flung it at his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Charles Lane. How far was the prisoner's wife from Mrs. Norman's door?</p>
               <p>Lane. Not a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Have you heard your mother say it would be the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>Lane. She always said she thought it would.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and attended the deceased. I was called in that day to dress the wound. I found a pretty large one across the right eye-brow, and the upper part of the skull was quite bare. I could find no fissure nor fracture. A fissure is a crack like a hair, and we try it with ink. There was a large effusion of blood from the wound, and she complained of being very faint and weak. The next morning she told me she had had a good night, and there were no fever or bad symptoms for about a fortnight. My man attended her two days. I went next day, when she complained of a pain in her head, back, and neck; she had a fever coming on, and her pulse was quick. She continued growing worse and worse for about a week, and then died, which was in the morning, the fifth of December. After her death, I opened her head before the coroner's jury. Upon taking off her scalp, we found the member that closes the brain quite free from any coagulated blood. When we came to divide the dura mater, we found a collection of matter on the right side the head, the same side the wound was given, but the left globe of the brain was in its natural state.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, what in your opinion was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Riley. In all probability it might be from a rupture of a small vessel, which might be occasioned by the blow given, from the concussion of the brain. Such a concussion of the brain is much more dangerous, than if the skull had only been broke. When she was so well as I have mentioned, Mr. Norman applied to me to certify to the Justice she was out of danger, to get the prisoner out of Jail. The deceased said she thought it was an accidental thing, that she unfortunately opened the door, and the man threw the stone at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned that fever?</p>
               <p>Riley. It is my opinion it was from that eruption of the brain.</p>

            . About eight days after this accident I went to the deceased's house in behalf of the prisoner, and the surgeon was there, who said she was in a fair way of recovery. She said she was better, but in pain, and was very willing to let the man out of jail, but her husband was against it, and wanted five shillings per week till she could work, and to pay all charges. She said to him, let him out by all means, as it was an accident, and was not flung with an intent to hurt her, and his abiding in jail will be no satisfaction to her.</p>

I said to Perry, if you have the watch, give it him; she replied, you fool, the soldier has got it; upon whic h he delivered it.

The prisoner brought this parcel to sell, [ taking up a parcel.] Dec. 31, about eight at night, it weighed 11 ounces, and the prisoner had fivepence halfpenny for it. As it was patterns and suspicious brass, my master blamed me for buying it, and the prisoner coming by the next day, we took him.</p>

            . On Christmas Friday a woman came to me in Cheapside, and said, she had found a chain of a watch. She said, she wished the right owner had it again; I gave no heed to her, the prisoner was with her just behind me. I put my hand in my pocket, and missing my handkerchief, said somebody had got it, and then turning about, saw the prisoner drop it out of his hand on the ground. I got assistance and took him before my Lord Mayor, where he denied it.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of December, about six at night, I walked side by side with the prosecutor and seeing him drop something, said, I believe a dozen times, Why do not you pick it up? The prisoner was coming along, but made a stop, and a woman in a black bonnet and scarlet cloak came by and took up a handkerchief, which she gave to me. He then flung his basket from his shoulder, and taking the prisoner by the collar, said he had picked his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Beecher. I did, my Lord. He asked me to help him along with the sheep; I asked him where he brought them from; he said from Cattery. I ask'd him where he was going with the sheep, and he said to Mr. Boreham's at Hodsdon. I took one of the sheep by the horns, and dragged her about twenty yards. Finding the other would not follow, I went in and called two dogs, which I set upon them; then they parted into three or four parts, the biggest whereof went thro' Hertford for London. I and master went away to Hitchen market, and heard no more of the prisoner till the Thursday following, when two men enquired after such a parcel of sheep, saying they were stole from Mr. Rant. I then took a horse, and going to him, told him what I knew.</p>

I went there, and the prisoner agreed to sell him a score of sheep for fifteen guineas. I asked him whose property these sheep were, and he said, they were his father's.

            . I met with the two prisoners on the 15th of January, about four in the morning, in Russel-Street, near a night cellar, where I was going to drink. Moreover, there was a young fellow with them, who asked me where I was going, and I told him. Moreover, the girls asked me to give them something to drink; I said they should be welcome. Moreover, we had a pot of hot on the steps, for the people would not let Brown go into the cellar. We then went to Mr. Tooley's in <placeName id="t17540116-22-crimeloc123">Covent-Garden</placeName>

After this Cooke lifted the window up, and took the goods out, of which these are a part. They were packed up between two boards. We went home, and parted them betwixt us. Cooke pawned one in Chick-Lane, at Mr. Keys's; the next day he went and sold some of them, and afterwards shewed me the money. After that he sold a parcel more, which I think was either in Bishopsgate-Street, or Aldersgate-Street. This was all in one day. The next day he sold some more, and shewed me the money. I went not with him at any of the times. The next day he sold some more, and bought the cloaths he has on now.</p>

There was Bird drinking with some women of the town, I took him, and carried him to the Roundhouse. I was told there was a little bundle dropt under the table, then I returned, and found this handkerchief and six new ones tied up in it. I took them, went back to the Roundhouse, and shewed him this old handkerchief; he said it was his; I replied, then what was in it must belong to you. Upon this he confessed, that he and

There I was sent with a search-warrant, and found some more concealed in a bed. Cooke was taken up by another constable, but he told me that Bevil Bird had given him five of the handkerchiefs to dispose of, that he had disposed of them, spent some of the money, and was debtor to Bird for the money.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 21st of December I was within the shop, about two or three yards from the door. I saw a man's face, and two hands take a truss of stockings, as it stood on the bulk, and put it on his head. I was surprized, and could not speak, but ran out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man in the shop?</p>
               <p>Harrison. No. He took it from the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that bulk part of the house?</p>
               <p>Harrison. It is. When we shut up our windows that place where the truss stood is shut in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you reckon it part of the shop?</p>
               <p>Harrison. We do. The prisoner was walking softly along with the truss on his head, and I laid hold on his arm. He turned about. I said, You have stole these stockings out of the shop window; he then threw them down, and said, I have taken nothing of yours, stop me at your peril, and would not go back with me; upon which we had a struggle, and he got about four or five yards from me. I got hold on his collar again, and he tore his shirt, and got away again, and went about four or five yards farther, when I again took hold of him, and kept him till I had assistance. We then brought him, and the stockings also, to my master's compting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you so much sight of the face, as to know it again?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I can't say it was the prisoner's face.</p>

             sprung away from me out of the shop, and looking out at the door, I saw him struggling with a man. I made up to them, and picked up this truss of stockings within about four yards of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. Whereabouts did you first seize the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harrison. It was about four yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Evidence continues. I brought the truss into the shop, and calling to my master to come into the shop, immediately went to assist Harrison; I believe they were about twenty yards from the door. We had several people come to our assistance, we brought him to my master's compting house, and there I left him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As I was going along Fenchurch-street, near an open bulk, the goods were seemingly piled one upon another, and no grating. A porter was going along with a hamper, which took hold of this truss, and pulling it down, almost stunn'd me. I took it up, and called after the porter, saying he had dropt something; but he kept going on. I had put them on my head, in order to carry them after him, when this man came and laid hold of me. I said to him, They are none of yours; he took hold on me, and I cleared myself of him as well as I could. They then called, Stop thief, and I came back, and went into the shop.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to Mr. Winter, a clothworker. On the 22d of December I went to the Cock and Magpye, a publick house. The two prisoners at the bar brought in this piece of woollen cloth, which they had in a basket, and offered to sell it to any body in the house. A piece was produced, which Mr. Barnet deposed to as the property of Mr. Howel. I went and looked on the cloth, and asking the price of it,

I suspected by the price it was not honestly come by, so gave her a shilling to bind the bargain, till I could get a constable to take them up. I went out to see for one, but not being able to find him, I then went to a justice of peace, who was not at home, but the clerk telling me that I might take him up myself on suspicion, I went back and told the old woman, if they could make a proper title to it, I'd give her the money before the justice. She was willing to go along with me. I carried them to the constable's house under a pretence to have a pint of beer. He was then at home, and I charged him with them.</p>

The prisoner said something to me when he stopped me; but they gave me no time for an answer; they put me in fear, and took from me eight shillings in money, a silk and cotton handkerchief, and a linen blue check one.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence did they take them?</p>
               <p>Colter. The handkerchiefs were taken from out of my coat pocket, and the money from my breeches pocket. As soon as they let me go I ran in at the Ship alehouse, which was directly before me, and not twenty yards off. I asked for the landlord, who was not at home; I told the landlady I had been robbed near her house, and desired her to assist me by sending for a proper officer; she sent for a constable, and I looking round the house, saw

A woman looked out at a house near where I was robbed and said, The house is beset. I directly went in with the constable, and in a lower room there was a woman, a boy, and a child. I said none of these were the people I wanted. I went up stairs to a room, but the people within refused to open the door. We then returned into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body within that room answer you?</p>

He is not here, he said, his name is Dolphin. I went then immediately home, for fear of being ill used. The next day I went and inquired about, and having got the name of the prisoner and Merrit, I had the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took your money and handkerchiefs from you ?</p>

There I took him aside, and questioned him. He told me then where to find the two women that were concerned with him.

I held him fast, and called out I have lost my watch. A gentleman took the prisoner by the right arm, and my friends came to my assistance: We took him to the Wind-mill Inn into a room and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you secure the man he gave it to?</p>
               <p>Minett. He moved off directly. We asked the prisoner where he lived, but he pretended to be dumb, and in hammering out words he made us understand he lived in St. John's-street: A gentleman said, then you may soon send for some body to your character. When the constable came he said the prisoner did not live there: Then he hammered out he lived in Spittlefields, and by pulling out a piece of rag and a thimble, he by signs and broken words signified he was a taylor. We examined his finger, but saw no mark of that trade on it; after which we took him to New-Prison. Powel the constable dropped us going along; for which reason the turnkey would not take him in. Then I sent for another constable, and he was taken in. After which we took him before Justice Fielding; his wife was there, and said he had lost the use of his speech.</p>

               <p>Minett. Here are people here that know I had it in my fob just before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your watch which you saw?</p>
               <p>Minett. I know it was my watch, it was what I saw and felt. It was done at the cry Make way, and there was at that time a sort of an opening near me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he hammered out words, could you understand him ?</p>
               <p>Minett. He spoke several words which I could understand very well at the Windmill inn.</p>
               <p>Q. If you could well understand him, how came he to pull out this thimble and cloth to shew you he was a taylor?</p>

I stood at his right shoulder, and his left hand came up to the prosecutor's side. Immediately he called out I have lost my watch. I seized the prisoner by his right arm, which at that time was in motion, and the prosecutor had him fast by the left hand wrist; we carried him to the Windmill inn, where some gentlemen in the room wanted to have him searched, but the prosecutor said no, no, there is no occasion for that, for I saw him deliver the watch into another man's hand. Somebody asked the prisoner where he lived, he said St. John's Street in a very bad manner. I said, do you mean St. John's Street? he replied, a, a.

            . I went with the other witnesses from the Ram in Smithfield to Hicks's Hall at the close of the poll, and standing next to the prisoner of the bar, the yard being very full, Mr. Minett hit my shoulder, and said I am robbed of my watch by this fellow. I immediately took him by the collar, and we carried him to the Windmill inn; there we asked him who he was, and where he lived; he pretended to be dumb, but with great impediment he said St. John's Street, so as I could understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have understood him to have meant St. John's Street, had not the word been repeated to him again by the other evidence?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I should. After that he said he lived in Spittle-fields. Mr. Powel the constable was asked if he knew him; he replied, the prisoner did not live in St. John's Street, and added to the prisoner, Did not I tell you to get away? have not I seen you all about here this afternoon? We took him to New Prison, and Powel dropt us at the gate. The under turnkey said he would lay a guinea to a shilling he knew who had the watch, but that this man had not got it.</p>

            . On Friday the 4th of this instant my servant, going to shut up the counting house and hall windows, observed the padlock was broke off the cellar door, which is just under the hall window; he came and acquainted me with it. Upon this I went with him to inquire into the cause of it, and found a very large bolt withinside was wrenched off; then I went down into the cellar to see whether I had lost any thing, and I missed one cheese off from a hanging shelf; I then went to examine the door, that goes out of the cellar into the house, and there I found somebody had been wrenching with a crow, that the lower bolt of the door was broke off, and that they had cut away the rabbit of the door, to strain it inwards, because they could not get it open the other way; but that would not do, for there were two screw bolts on the other side. I then went out into the street, and desired my servant to shut the door as he found it; he did, and I observed several places where they had put the crow through; upon this I thought they did not want to steal cheese, but to come to my counting-house. I then sent for a person, whose name is Kiddel, to sit up with my clerk, myself, and servant; they in the counting-house, and I above stairs in the dining-room with my wife, who was very much frighted. He came between nine and ten o'clock, and they began watch about twelve. They had a candle shut up in a closet, so that it could shew no light, and I armed them with a brace of pistols among them, and a sword each, charging them not to stir, nor make the least noise. till they heard somebody in the cellar, and that then they should rush out into the street, and I would come down and screw the cellar door upon them; which I thought was a very good trap. A little after two I heard the street door open, (I had left the window-shutter of the dining-room open, in order to call assistance ) I threw up the window and looked out; there I saw my men struggling against the cellar door, and from the inside I heard a noise of thumping against the door with an iron instrument, in order to make their way out, and before I got down stairs, I heard a pistol go off. Upon the pistol's firing, and my man's calling out for the watch, some of my neighbours got up. I went down stairs into the house, but did not go into the street, not knowing what number there were; and my neighbours coming. I sent down to the watch-house for the constable of the night, but he was gone home to bed; they sent home to his house, and got him up, and he came in about a quarter of an hour's time to my house. There were two watchmen came in before he came, but when he came, the man that I hired, and my own servant, went down to the cellar door with the constable; the man that I hired took the prisoner by the collar, and brought him into the hall. When he came up, I was surprized to see him, I knowing him very well. He is a <rs id="t17540116-34-deflabel180" type="occupation">master carman</rs>

As soon as he saw me, he begged of me to be merciful to him, and said he could be of very great service to me in making discoveries; I asked him what he could discover; he replied that there was one Peters, a carman, (whom I find since was a partner in the business) concerned with him; that he and Peters had been there the night before, and broke off the lock from the cellar door; and that they stole a cheese; which was all they did take. I then said to him, As you took the cheese only, what was your intent? his answer was, No good, Sir, you may be sure. I then said to him, Had I heard you in my house, and come down to you, what would have been the consequence? for you know that I knew you, and you me, you would have murdered me. No, says he, upon the honour of a man I did not come for murder. I asked him again what he did come for; his answer was, Money. He then fell down on his knees, and begged of me to be merciful to him, and let him be admitted an evidence. I then bid the constable and my men take him away, and they carried him to the watch-house; but I forgetting to examine him before he went away, sent a man to desire they would bring him back, or examine him there, and they brought him back again. I searched his pockets, and took a very large knife out of his coat pocket, and with the knife there was a very large saw, which shut up together. [The knife produced in Court.] In the other pocket I found a tinder box, the matches and steel were not in it, but they were found afterwards on the cellar stairs. I asked him whether he had any other tools; he replied he had an iron crow with him, which he dropt in straining against the cellar-door to get out. The crow was found by my servant, and this is it, producing it. [It was a band crow about eighteen inches long.] My servant also found the dark lanthorn; producing it. [It was a small one, fit to carry in the pocket.] After I saw all these things, I desired they would carry him away to the Compter; they did, and the next morning I was with him before my Lord Mayor. There he owned the taking of the cheese, and said that these tools were his. I went to the prisoner's house on a search-warrant, which one Mr. Pope had got, who had had his counting house broke open a little before, and there I found my cheese.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pelton, a cooper in Wood-Street, and on Friday sev'nnight I was sent for to Mr. Tree's. When I went in, he told me what had happened, as that he had had his house broke open, and a cheese stole out of the cellar, and that another door was wrenched at the top of the cellar stairs. I bargained with him to sit up. He brought us two pistols and two swords; I had one of the pistols, and loaded it with a ball. We went into the counting-house about eleven at night, and the candle we had we shut up in a closet, so that there was no light to be seen; we sat there till twelve o'clock, and concluding we were not near enough to hear if they came to the cellar window, we agreed that we should go out one at a time, and so take it by turn, to watch at the bulk of the cellar window. We did, and we watched till pretty near one o'clock, when we heard them at the cellar window and hall door. I cannot tell who they were. They tapt at the hall door with their knuckles, which I apprehend was to see whether there was a dog. I stood quite still at the door, the others were in the counting-house, and they thinking I knocked for them to come, came softly to me; I desired them to go back; they did. Then they tapped again, and said we are all right, or it will do, I cannot say which. I was not a foot from the door at that time. I then went back into the counting-house to them, there we resolved for us all three to go and stand by the bulk; we did, the clerk stood at the door with a sword in his hand, and in the other hand the latch of the door, I stood next to him, and the footman next to me, and on a signal I was to give to touch the clerk, he was to open the door, and I was to go out. We stood there till two o'clock, and just as the clock struck two, we heard somebody come to open the cellar door, the watch not having been gone by but a very little time; he was not got a hundred yards. We stood still for near five minutes, when I heard somebody at work in the cellar, as though they were breaking the door open; I laid my head down on the bulk to listen, and heard something break. Upon this I bobbed the clerk to open the door, and went out immediately, the footman following me, and the clerk after him. When we came out, we found the cellar door shut, and the bar upon the staple, in the same manner as it was left the night before, which a little surprized me. I had hardly recovered my surprize, before the prisoner at the bar came up to the door, and knocked the bar off from the staple, and the door a little open; I ran directly to the door, and laying hold of it, clapped my knees to the door, and forced it too again. Both the clerk and footman assisted me to keep the door shut. The prisoner made a strong resistance, and got the door open so far, that I could see the head of a man, but not to know him. We shut it too again, and kept it close. The prisoner then beat out part of the bottom pannel of the door, and got it partly open again: he continued forcing, and trying to get out, and with the forcing I slipt, and fell upon my knees, and the others with me; I got up again upon my legs, but before I could get up to the door to shove it too, the prisoner struck me over the eye with some instrument he had in his hand, (he said at the watch-house he believed it was the iron bar he took off from the cellar door) which partly stunned me. I thought I should have fell backwards, but the clerk being near me, saved me from that, and I fell down on one side; I soon recovered myself, and getting upon my knees, I turned my eye towards the cellar window, and saw the prisoner getting out. I then fired a pistol at him, which missed him, and afterwards forced the cellar door quite too again. I then heard no pushing, nor any noise, for the space of two or three minutes; presently after we heard a sudden noise against the door again, upon which I called to the footman for his pistol to fire at him; he made answer he would fire at him himself, and presented the pistol to him, which did not go off, but only flashed in the pan. We then got all to the door, shoved it close upon him, and called out for more pistols. I asked the prisoner if he would surrender, and he said he would; I then put the bar up which goes across the window, and put the footman's pistol in the staple, in order to fasten it; I then bid the prisoner put his hands through the hole that he had broke, that I might tie them, and he put them out. I then said, Take your hands in again, I will not tie them, but I will come down to you the other way. Just about this time some watchmen came to our assistance, (all the while before none came, though we were continually calling out for them) and I charged one of them to aid and assist me; but he said it was out of his beat. Out of your beat! says I, stir at your peril, for here is a thief in the cellar; then some watchmen came from Queenhithe watch-house, and the constable being sent for, the watchman brought word back there was no constable there; then two or three more watchmen went and fetched the constable. I would have gone into the cellar before, but I was advised not to go down till the constable came; when the constable came, he and I went down into the cellar;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160024"/> I took the key and opened the cellar door, the constable being behind me on the stairs. As soon as I opened the door the footman went in, and I followed him; the footman had the candle in his hand, but did not see him: I went in, and turning my head towards the cellar stairs, I saw the prisoner sitting upon them. I had a pistol in my hand, and as soon as I saw him, I cocked it, and said, You, Sir, come down; Sir, says he, I am coming. He came from the stairs, and got upon a stand which they put beer upon. I then laid hold on his collar, and asked if he had any thing in his hands; he opened his hands, and said, No, indeed. I asked him whether there was any body else in the cellar with him; he said no, there was not; then says I, Come along up stairs; he came with me and the watchman to the foot of the stairs, and then the watchman and constable took charge of him. I have known him these eight or nine years, but I did not take notice who he was at that time. After he was taken up stairs, we went into the cellar to see if there was any body else; we found no body, but looking about, we found a dark lanthorn and a carman's white apron, both which we carried up, and gave to Mr. Tree. We then brought the prisoner to Mr. Tree, before whom he fell on his knees, and begged for mercy. I was present at that time. He said his poor wife was brought to bed, and in the straw at that time; adding, that it was one Peters that had brought him to it, who, he said, was with him at that time. Mr. Tree said to him, You are a pretty fellow, what was your design? No good, Sir, says he, to be sure. Then says Mrs. Tree, I suppose you would have murdered all you came near. No, indeed, Madam, replied he. What was your design? said Mrs. Tree. My design was, answered he, for your money. He then said he could be of great service to them; that one Peters had brought him to ruin; that Peters and he were there the night before, and that Peters broke the lock off the door, and took away a cheese. He then desired Mr. Tree to make enquiry after Peters. We went down to the watch-house with him; there he said he believed Peters was gone to the stables, and that we should find him there in the hay loft. Some watchmen and we went down to the stables, but could not find any such person; we returned, and told the prisoner so. Then he desired we would go to Red-Lion-Street, Holborn, and there we might find him, because he kept house there. The prisoner was then brought to Mr. Tree's house again, and was searched. I was present then, and was close to his pockets; in one of which we found a large knife with a saw in it, and a tug pin. He was then carried to the Compter, and the next morning before my Lord Mayor; and we also carried the things we found before his Lordship. There he owned that the iron crow, and the rest of the things, were his.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the night was this when you heard him come to the door, and say we are all right?</p>
               <p>Kiddel. A little after one o'clock. They went away and came again afterwards, but I don't know who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition was the prisoner in when you found him in the cellar, was he sober?</p>
               <p>Kiddel. I really believe he was.</p>
               <p>Philip Richbill and William Tarver confirmed the testimony of the two former witness; only Tarver said he did not remember any thing said about the cheese to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in a surprize when I was brought out of the cellar, and did not know what I said. The gentleman asked me if I was there the night before, and I said yes; but I was not, for I was in bed by ten o'clock; and the cheese that was found at my house, was brought by Peters. The next morning my horse-keeper saw him come in with it; and he coming up for a candle, saw me in bed.</p>

               <p>Hup. He was in bed about four o'clock, when I went up for the keys. I always carry hsm the keys the last thing I do at night, and fetch them the first thing in the morning, and when I went to fetch the keys, he was at home in his bed. I went into Peter's stable to light my candle, and I found him lying on some sacks, which I took particular notice of; and there was a carman's apron tied up, which lay just by his head, and which to me seemed much like a cheese.</p>

            . I had four ewes, one lamb, and eight rams in a field, on the 28th of December, and on the 29th they were missing, and the gate of the field was taken off the hooks. I had them advertised, and gave out bills the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your field?</p>

There I saw three large pair of lamb stones. I said to the prisoner, Your meat is very bad, but these stones and a bit of bacon will do. Then he took down a shoulder of lamb, a very good one. I agreed with him sixpence for the stones, and fifteen pence for the shoulder of lamb. I said, Bring them to the alehouse, and I'll pay you for them. He brought them, and his countenance changed very much before I said any thing to him about the affair. I then charged the constable with him on suspicion of stealing my sheep. By their size I judged these stones to be taken out of some of my rams. He had a stable, which was shewn to me, and before I came at it I found the cracks were stopped with straw, some of which I pulled out, and looked thro'; there I saw a sheep with but one horn; that, I said, was one of my rams, whose horn was broke by fighting in the summer. I saw also four or five more. The prisoner's wife came, and I asked her for the key of the door, which she said her husband had. We found we could not get it, so the constable broke open the door, and there I saw seven sheep alive, of which I swore to six, but to the other I did not. I asked the prisoner what was become of the skins of those he had killed, and he said he had sold them at Uxbridge the week before. I said, What have you done with the skins of those which you have killed this week; he said, they were gone, and would say no more about them. He was taken before a justice, and his mittimus made for Newgate. From the justice's we took him to the constable's at Acton. There he owned that very sheep which I would not swear to was mine, and that the lamb stones, and the shoulder of lamb, which I bought of him were mine. There was in his shop, a sheep hung behind the door, which was skinned but not cut down; that, he said, was one of my old ewes. The next day I had an information that the skins were in the same place where I found the sheep. I got a search warrant, and going there found eight skins, four of which I then swore to. [ He produced a pair of rams horns branded with I. M. on each horn; these were taken off one of the skins we found, and belonged to one of my rams.</p>

            . Mr. Marsh is my brother-in-law, and lives near me. He came and told me he had lost those thirteen sheep he has mentioned. On the Thursday following there came one Adams, a salesman, and said he could give him some intelligence about them, adding, there was such a parcel of sheep drove through Norwood-green that night they were lost, and that there lived a man at Hesson who had a very bad character, and was suspected of doing such things. Upon this the prosecutor and I went there to one Mr. Priest, and he said there was such a parcel of sheep drove thro' there the Friday night before, and told us of a butcher who had a bad character, and was likely to do it. The next morning we went to Hesson, to one Mr. Westbrook's, and Mr. Marsh went to the butcher's shop, to see what he could find to eat; he came running over again and said he believed he was right, for he had seen three pair of lamb-stones, which he suspected to be his. He sent for a constable and went over again, and dealing for a shoulder of lamb and the lamb-stones, he brought them over to a room in the alehouse where Mr. Westbrook and I were; the prisoner came also, and Mr. Marsh charged the constable with him on suspicion of stealing his sheep; after which Mr. Marsh and Mr. Westbrook went out, and returning said, they had found seven sheep, six of which Mr. Marsh said he'd swear to, which he afterwards did. The prisoner pretended he bought them of two men, that the name of them was Chapman, and that he met the other by chance upon the road; he was after this in several stories, but at last said these two men, named Chapman, and he agreed to go and steal these sheep out of the field, and drove them on the road, and that at such a place he took them and drove them home, and that they had had it in their heads two or three days before.</p>

She bid me so low I could not take her money, and went out of the shop. I miss'd the piece directly.</p>

            . On the 8th of December I was at home. Being constable, the prosecutrix sent a servant to me, who said she had been robbed. By that time I was got there, the prisoner and another woman were brought to her house. As we were going to the justice's, the prisoner said she'd confess<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160027"/> if they would take her back again. We took them back, and she then confessed that she took the handkerchiefs, and that the other woman was innocent. This also I heard her say before the justice.

I sent for Mrs. Vincent, who described the handkerchiefs before they were opened. We took the woman to the house of the prosecutrix, where were the other two; the cloak was shewn to the prisoner, who owned it as her own, and I delivered it to her; but upon her re-examination she denied it to be hers. Before the justice she owned the taking the handkerchiefs, and that she had delivered them to a woman in a linen gown and scarlet cloak, but did not mention her name. After she had acknowledged the robbery, she told Mrs. Vincent, that if she would forgive her, she would never come there again.</p>

               <p>When I came out of the alehouse about twelve o'clock I was fuddled, and went into that yard to lie down on the straw; there was Richford, who came to me with a pig in his hand; I said, Where had you it? he answered, What is that to you. He then went and fetched two more, and I went with him into Whitechapel.</p>

            , and two or three more. The prisoner all of a sudden started up in the next box to us, saying, I will fight the best man in the house for a guinea, and threw down a shilling; then the deceased threw down another, and they agreed to fight the next day at two o'clock. The deceased went out to fetch his child from White-Cross-Street, and before he came back, the prisoner had been to fetch one of his masters out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160029"/> Fleet-Market. The master said a guinea was a great deal of money to them, and that if they insisted upon fighting, they had better fight for a leg of mutton and turnips. Moss did not come back while the master was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Moss ?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He was a <rs id="t17540116-40-viclabel215" type="occupation">chairmaker</rs>

The next day he and I went to the same house, and staid there till a quarter after twelve o'clock, at which time he sent a porter for the prisoner; he came, the deceased drank to him, and they shook hands. He asked the prisoner if he would be as good as his word; to which he answered yes. The prisoner went out again. Then Moss, I, and several more, went to White-Conduit-Fields, the place appointed to fight, and in about ten minutes after we got there, we saw the prisoner. The deceased met him, and shook hands with him. Afterwards they went into the White-Conduit-House together, and there they agreed to fight for a leg of mutton and turnips; then they went to the bar, the deceased drank half a quartern of brandy, and the prisoner I believe drank some wine. After this they went from the house about two hundred yard, there they stripped, and fought for a long time. I believe very near half an hour. When it was over, Moss laid in a very bad and bruised condition upon the ground (though he had the better of it for about the first fifteen minutes ); we took him up, and carried him into White-Conduit-House. The blood ran out at his ears and mouth; we kept wiping him, and thought he had been asleep, he snoring pretty much. The last words he spoke were, I will fight. This was when he was taken up before he fell the last time. We could get no coach in Islington, so we took him on our backs, and brought him home. There were seven or eight of us. We put him to bed, and I got a man to bleed him, who after pricking him, he bled two or three drops.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He was dead then.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. How long did the deceased lie on the cold ground before he had his cloaths on?</p>
               <p>Johnson. We could not get his cloaths on till we got him to the Conduit-House. Four of us lifted him up as soon as we could.</p>

               <p>Oakman. I cannot say whether he was or not, for I did not see him before he started up. The deceased also started up, and looked over the settle. Then the prisoner said, You are counted the best man in the house, I will fight you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any quarrel between the prisoner and deceased before this?</p>
               <p>Oakman. No, there had not. They agreed to fight, and each put down a shilling, and gave it me to hold till next day. The next day I went there about a quarter after twelve, and we got to White-Conduit-House before two; there they agreed to fight for a leg of mutton and turnips, and a little beer, to the value of a crown. The deceased drank half a quartern of brandy, and I believe the prisoner drank a glass of wine; then they went out and stript, shook hands, and fell to fighting, and fought about half an hour. I saw no foul play. When the deceased was incapable of fighting, the prisoner asked him if he would fight any more; he answered, he would fight; (he was then standing on his legs, with his hands hanging down) then the prisoner struck him one blow, upon which he fell down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the deceased seem, when he said he would fight, to be capable of fighting?</p>
               <p>Oakman. To me he did not seem capable. I believe he was unable to hold up his hands at that time, for after he fell he never spoke more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you talking about fighting at the Fighting Cocks before the prisoner got up?</p>
               <p>Oakman. No, we were not, we were making merry, and singing a song.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did not your wife fling some gin in the fire?</p>
               <p>Oakman. She came in, and because I was at the alehouse, she flung some gin in the fire.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and was sent for on the second of January to examine the body of the deceased. He had received several considerable bruises, but the chief of them were about the head and face. Upon dividing the scalp, and taking off the skull, I found a great quantity of extravasated blood thrown out of the vessels, by their being erupted; upon dividing the two membranes that cover the brain, between the membranes and the brain, I found a quantity of coagulated blood; so that I imagine, the blows he received were the cause of his death.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of December, at night, I was eating<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160030"/> a mouthful of victuals at the Fighting Cocks in Fleet-Lane with a few friends, and we had a pot or two of beer. Oakman's wife came in, and threw some nasty gin into the fire, and scorched all my face; I said she was guilty of very ill manners. One Stevens a chimney-sweeper, in company with me, said that was nothing to what he was served the last night; saying that he was slapped in the face, and spit on; I said I should not like to take such an affront. The deceased started up and said, If you take it up, I will serve you so. I smiled to myself, and said I had rather he would let it alone. He flew out of the box and came to me, and holding his fist up to my nose, asked me whether I would fight; I told him it was not a proper place to talk about that, to disturb the company, and desired he would defer it to another time. Afterward he came to me again, and pulling out three halfpence, said, I will fight you for a guinea. I never got off my seat, but said three halfpence is nothing to bind a guinea. Then he up with his fist to my face again, and asked me whether I would take the law of him or not; I said no, I would not. He went and got a shilling, and said, You talk of your money, put your money down; I said I shall put none down, but on his aggravating me, I flung down two sixpences.</p>

            . I was at the alehouse at this time. The prisoner and deceased were in two different boxes, with several others, and one of their wives came and flung half a pint of gin in the fire. After that, the prisoner said something had catched hold of his coat, and pulling out two sixpences, said he would fight the best man in the room for a guinea. The deceased made no answer at that time. I said that was nothing to what was done to me the last night, for I had my face hit and spit in. The deceased went up to the prisoner, held his fist to his nose, and said if he would not take the law of him, he would strike him. After that, the deceased said he would lick him and his second too, and also his master. Then the man that held the stakes went out about four or five minutes, and came back with a shilling, he put it down, took the prisoner's up, and put it into his pocket. After that the prisoner said he was not willing to fight. The deceased came up to him again, and said if he would not fight him for money, he would fight him for love. He made an offer to pull off his cloaths, and to go out at the door. The prisoner said he would fight him for love, but they prevented their fighting then. I saw the battle the next day, and it was a very fair fight.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Did you see the deceased hold up his fist to the prisoner's nose?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Oakman to that question. He did not hold his fist to his nose, or give the prisoner any affront. And I am sure it was not upon the gin being flung into the fire, that the prisoner got up to fight.</p>
               <p>Elick Ennis. On the 28th of last month the prisoner came to me, and told me he was going to fight, and asked me to go along with him; so I went with him and his master. I was to be his second. The deceased met him in the field, and lent him a hand over a stile, and said, You are a man of your word. They went to the Conduit-House and drank, and the deceased's master said they had better make it up, but the deceased said he would not. Then the master said, Fight for a leg of mutton and turnips, and a gentleman said he would be answerable for the deceased. Then they stripped and went to it. They fought ten or twelve minutes, and were both beat very much. The deceased was held up by two men, and was asked if he would fight any more, (he was then standing on his legs) and he said yes; then they had another fall, and his second saying he should not fight any more, we came away. After that they let him lie ten or twelve minutes before they took him off the ground. It was a very fair fight as could be.</p>

            . The prisoner worked with me as a porter. He came to me on the 27th of December at night, and said he had been used very ill by a man at the Fighting Cocks; I went with him to the house, but the deceased was not there. I endeavoured to prevent their fighting, and said they had better fight for a leg of mutton and turnips, as they were poor men. The next morning the prisoner came to me, and desired me to go with him to White-Conduit-Fields. When we came there, I said, Where is the man that is to fight you? the deceased started up, and said I am the man. I said as they were hard working men, they had better desist, but the deceased said he would fight, and that the people should not be baulked in their pastime, so they went out of the house to fight. It was a very severe battle, and it was the opinion of most that the deceased would have beat the prisoner at first. At last the prisoner got the advantage of him pretty much. The last time the deceased was on his legs, I said to him, You<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160031"/> are much beat, take my advice, pray give out. He insisted upon fighting, and said, I have not enough yet. Then the prisoner and he fell down both together, and there it ended. I believe there were not fix blows struck on either side, but what were about the head. They let the deceased lie four or five minutes on the frosty grass, I believe. They then brought him along in such an uncommon manner, that he must have been killed, had he been beat but a little. They laid him on a table in the Conduit house, and then brought him away with them. I have known the prisoner some time, and never knew he was a quarrelsome fellow in my life. He told me at White Conduit-House, he did not know what was the matter. for he was not for fighting.</p>

            . I live in Brooker's alley, Drury-lane. Last Monday was se'nnight, in the morning, I went to Mr. Burry, and asked him to go along with me to Edmonton. We set out in a chaise, about twelve or one at noon, from Hatton-garden, and going to the Bell at Edmonton, staid there very near three hours. We went to inquire for a man whom I wanted to see, and set out between five and six to come home. I got out at the Plough in <placeName id="t17540116-41-crimeloc222">Tottenham</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17540116-41-crimeloc222" type="placeName" value="Tottenham"/>

Mr. Burry desired me to walk a little, to see how the horse would go, and I believe I did walk about a quarter of a mile; he then called to me, and said the horse went very well, and he believed I might get in. As I was going to get into the chaise, two fellows came round me and said, You shall not get in, we must have what you have. One of them held my arms, and taking a great knife out of his pocket, said he'd stick me, and that fellow in the chaise too, if I spoke a word. The other took my pocket, in which was a guinea, half a crown, two shillings, and a trifle more. They then ran away, and I stood by a post, not being able to stand for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this to the chaise?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was just by the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. He is the man that held the knife to me and said, You old bitch, if you say a word, I'll run you thro', and the man too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had time enough to see his face; it was a very fine moonlight night, and as light as day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd ?</p>
               <p>Jones. He had a white waistcoat, coat and a flannel cap. The other had a blue coat, and a great slouch hat. Mr. Burry called to a man that was coming by, and desired him to help me into the chaise. I got in, and we then went on to the Cross keys, where we had a glass of rum, and at the turnpike were told, that two men had run thro' there as fast as they could, and that they had been thereabout for two or three nights. Mr. Burry pursued them as fast as he could to Newington, where he inquired after such men, and the patroles answered that two men had run by. They were then in my sight, and I desired them to stop them; one of the thieves jumpt the ditch and got off, but the prisoner was taken. This was at the farther end of Newington, and we took him to a public house a little way from the town. He was in the same dress as when he committed the robbery, and he owned every thing, saving another man brought him that way, but he did not know for what, and that he was not the person who took the money. He owned he held me by the arm, and that he pull'd out a knife upon me. He confess'd the same before the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business at Edmonton ?</p>
               <p>Jones. I went there to inquire for a man who owed me money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with Mr. Burry?</p>
               <p>Jones. Many years.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this robbery?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was between five and six, near six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever robbed before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, never in my life.</p>

We set out from thence about six o'clock, and coming back the buckle of the strap had got thro'. and the horse fell a kicking up much, on which I desired her to get out; this was near the Plough at Tottenham, where we drank two pints of rum and ale; there was another man with us. I desired her to walk a little, till I saw how the horse would go. She walked about a quarter of a mile, and then I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175401160032"/> said to her, You may get in; but as she was geting in, two men caught hold of her; the prisoner was one of them. His stockings were tied below knee, and he had a white waistcoat on. I believe it was the prisoner who held a knife to her, and said, You old bitch, if you make a noise, I'll stick you, and the man in the chaise too. They took her away, and the other person took her money. This was just facing the seven trees, called the Seven Sisters. I being lame, could not get out of the chaise; then they ran as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take her money?</p>
               <p>Burry. I saw them put a hand to her pocket, and I know she had that money about her when she came out of the house. I got a man to help her into the chaise, and we called at the first house on the left hand, where we had a quartern of rum. I drove along, inquiring of every body, and at Newington called at a house, and told them how we had been served; a man came out along with me. I asked the patrole if they saw such persons, and at about 20 yards distance I saw them both running; this was before we came to Kingsland turnpike. The other man got over a ditch, and the prisoner was taken. We carried him to a house on this side the turnpike. I said, How could you take the money from this poor woman? He said, he did not take the money, but only stood by. We then had him before Justice Withers, and he there said his name was

He left me in October last, since which he has several times called at my house, and as he behaved well, I used to treat him with respect. Last Saturday was se'nnight he came in and called for a pot of beer, and staid there, I believe, two hours. He went away about twelve, or a little after. My servant going down about eight on Sunday morning, found a candle burning in the bar, and came up to tell me. I went down and found it so, with the door in part open. The street door I found unlocked and unbolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fast over night?</p>
               <p>Upton. I don't know of my own knowledge that it was. I was not up last; but it was usual to lock and bolt it when we went to bed. I went out into the lane, and there saw that the outward cellar window was removed the space of three yards from its proper place to the other side of the way. Then I went into my bar, and there missed the till in which I usually put my silver. I then went to the cellar head, and found that the lock was wrenched from the cellar door; from whence I concluded, that the person who had done me this injury came in at the cellar window.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you miss?</p>
               <p>Upton. I miss'd a 9 s. 6 d. piece of gold, and a guinea and half in silver. I immediately concluded it must be the prisoner who had robbed me. I resolved to go and seek after him. I went to an acquaintance of mine, one

               <p>Court. Mention his words.</p>
               <p>Upton. He said, Lord, Sir, I did do it indeed. I told him I missed a guinea and half in silver, and a 6 s. 9 d. piece. He acknowledged he took out the till, with the money in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge he broke your house?</p>
               <p>Upton. I did not ask him that. He said he had bought a pair of stockings, and a shirt, which he then had on, with some of the money; and that the money found in his pocket when taken, was mine. I said to him, How could you be so barbarous as to leave the door open, and a candle burning, thus to expose us to danger at that time of night, meaning three o'clock? He said, Lord, Sir, it was a deal later than that when I came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that till locked that he took away?</p>
               <p>Upton. I did not lock it, but believe it was. He behaved as well as any lad in London could do when he lived with me. I would speak this in his favour, that joining to the till I lost there was another till with halfpence in it, and near that another with seven silver spoons in it, and a silver strainer; near this, on a shelf, was a silver milk-pot, and up one pair of stairs he might have come into a room, by only turning the handle of a lock, and have taken away a hundred pounds worth of plate; he knew this well, but did not meddle with these things mentioned. He went from me to sell milk about, and I told him then, that if it did not answer, I'd take him again.</p>

            , who told me there had been a house broke open that morning, and that he believed he knew the man that did it, as also that he had been applied to by the gentleman that kept the house. Burry, his son, and I, went and found the prisoner at a House on Saffron Hill, and took him in a coach to Mr. Upton's house; there he was taken up one pair of stairs, and his master and mistress came to him; they desired him to let them have the till and money again. Mr. Burry said, You had better go into another room, and talk to your master; then his master and he went into another room, after which Mr. Upton came out, and said the prisoner had confessed; and he afterwards owned it before as. When I took him I searched him, and found nine shillings in silver, and two fixpences. He confessed in my hearing, that was part of the money he had taken out of the till. I asked him how he got into the house, and he said he got in where they put the butts of beer down.</p>
               <p>Q. to Upton. Did you hear this confession of getting into your house ?</p>
               <p>Upton. I believe then I was gone down stairs.</p>
               <p>Ind. I asked him what instrument he made use of to get the place open, he said nothing but this knife, [ producing a long clasp knife ] which I took from him.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday was sev'nnight I was at a publick-house on Saffron-Hill, when Burry and that thief-catcher came together, and asked me to drink; I said I did not care if I did, so I drank the beer up. At last Burry asked me when I saw my old master; I said, I was there last night; then this man said he had got a warrant against me for breaking open my master's house, and that he must search me; I let him, and he took ten shillings out of my pocket. I had a knife in my pocket, which he took, but I think it was not so big as that which has been produced. They took me in a coach to my master's house, we went up stairs, and he asked me if I knew any thing of the robbery; I said I did not. They say I confessed, but I know nothing of it. I was in liquor I believe.</p>

               <p>Campbel. No, my Lord, it was not. I suspected the prisoner, because he went away before daylight. About twenty days after I saw him in New Prison, and charged him with robbing me. He told me he had sold my coat and waistcoat, and four shirts, to Thomas Stanley, in Old Gravel-Lane, and that he sold the green lapel waistcoat and black breeches at the Shoeing Horn in Rosemary-Lane. I went to Justice Burry's, got a search-warrant, and searched Stanley's house, and at the Shoeing Horn, but found nothing; and I went to the next house to the Shoeing Horn, and there I found my black breeches. Produced in Court, and deposed to.</p>

            . Seven weeks ago last Sunday I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; [naming them over] after which I was told by Anne M'Parson, the prisoner had delivered them to her, and that they were at Mr. Pardey's, a pawnbroker, near the Seven Dials. I went there, and found the breeches and waistcoat; then I took up the prisoner, and had her before the Justice; there she said she was very sorry, and if I had given her more time, she should have said more about them, and have let me known more.</p>
               <p>Anne M'Parson. On the fourth of December, the prisoner desired me to go for the breeches, and say they belonged to my husband. She had carried them, and they were stopt at a pawnbroker's near the Seven Dials. I went and asked the pawnbroker how he came to stop these breeches, saying they were my husband's; he asked me if they were plate or mettle buttons on them; I said I could not tell; then he bid me go about my business, and not trouble myself about them. When I returned, I asked her where she had them; she said she went through the house where her husband lodged, went up into the room where he lay, and took them from off a bed; then I went and gave the prosecutor intelligence of it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. There was a woman came, I think on the third of December, and brought me a waistcoat, on which I believe there were two shillings and three pence lent. I think the same night the same woman came and brought a pair of old leather breeches, and asking some trifle upon them, (I seeing there were silver buttons on them) asked who they belonged to; she said to her husband. I asked what were the buttons on them, and threw them by; she said she imagined they were horn; then I bid her send her husband. She went to fetch somebody of credit to prove they were her husband's, and brought the other evidence, who demanded them in the name of her husband, saying that he was a gentleman's servant towards Hyde-Park-Corner. I asked her whether they were silver or mettle buttons, but she could not tell. The next day the prosecutor came, and I delivered them to him. I cannot take upon me to say the prisoner is the woman that brought them.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There was a man amongst the mob, who said the man that came down stairs was in blue, but he looked as if he belonged to the prisoner. The prisoner is the man, and was all bloody from the blow I gave him when he was brought in again.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bisborn. On the 26th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went up to my room where I lie. I had locked the door, and had the key in my hand, but had not put it into the lock to open it. I found the door broke open. I had a candle in my hand, and hearing something rush behind the curtain, I asked who was there; then the prisoner turned out from behind them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>M. Roberts. No, not to my knowledge. I asked him how he came there; he said he came to see for a young man of his acquaintance: He ran down stairs, and I after him; he fell over the shafts of a waggon, but recovered himself, and ran into the street. I alarmed the people, and they pursued and took him, and brought him back. I went to look in the room, there the sheets of my bed were brought down to one corner, and the blankets were turned off on one side, not quite off the bed. I had lain in it the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made the bed that day?</p>
               <p>M. Roberts. No, I had not. [She produced a staple.] This is the staple in which the bolt of my door shot. This I found in the middle of the room, and the bolt of the lock was shot out as at other times when it is locked.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Garland, and worked the oats out of the vessel into Mr. Garland's lighter but the Monday before, and brought them to Atkinson's Wharf, and gave him an account of them. When I came down in the morning, my master's prentice told me they were robbed of four sacks of oats, and that the skiff was gone from the lighter's stern. We went and searched about, in order to find them out, and we found the skiff at Puddle-Dock; we then went to Puddle-Dock lime-wharf, and we searched the barges that lay there, but could not find them; we then went into the barge belonging to the prisoner, there I found some oats scattered about, I took some up, and said I believed they were there. I opened the cabbin, and the prisoner came up in a great tremble; I told him we had been robbed, and heard that the oats were in his barge; he denied that they were, or that he knew any thing of them. I pressed him hard, and told him a lie, saying. I have a witness that will prove they were brought into your barge; he then owned he had them. I looked into the cabbin, and saw they were there. I then said to the prisoner, George, I could not have suspected you would have taken my master's sacks of oats; he said a man brought them there, and that he was to have four shillings to carry them up to Brentford. We sent for a constable, and charged him with the prisoner.</p>

A man came then, and calling out, Bargeman, Bargeman, I awaked. He said, Be so good as to let me leave two quarters of oats in your barge, and I'll come for them at four in the morning. I said he might if he would, and he got one out of the skiff himself. I told him I had ne'er a tarpaulin, but he might put them in the cabbin; he did put them there, but I know nothing more of the man than I do of a stranger. I might have seen him before, but I don't know, nor do I know but that they belonged to himself.

I frequently trusted him with things of value, both money and goods, and he discharged his trust like an honest servant, till the 27th of December last, when I sent him with a gold watch to lend a lady in Arlington-street, while hers was mended. I also sent by him, at the same time, two guineas to pay to two of my workmen, and never heard any thing of him till the Sunday following, which was the 30th. Then Mr. Welch, the high constable, came and brought the watch to me, having secured the prisoner.</p>

            . I keep a public house in Drury-lane. Last Sunday was three weeks the prisoner came into my house, and called for a pint of beer. He pull'd out a gold watch, and asked me to lend him thirteen guineas upon it, saying he had been at St. Albans. (He had boots on.) I told him I seldom lent money on goods, but I had a watchmaker who understood those things better than I did. I suspected it was not honestly come by, and went to Mr. Welch, the high constable, who came, and we took the prisoner backwards, where he confess'd the fact. We then took the prisoner before Justice Fielding, and he there owned that he lived servant with a watchmaker in Fleet-street, whose name I have forgot; that he sent him to a lady in Arlington-street, and he had not been there with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask my prosecutor, and Mr. Gladman, as to my character.</p>
               <p>Colley. He always before this discharged every thing with a great deal of honestly. I agreed with him but the hour before I sent him on this errand to raise his wages ten shillings a year. I believe he had been in liquor all the time he had been from me.</p>
               <p>Gladman. During the time of his living with Mr. Colley, I believed I have delivered several hundreds of pounds to him, and he always discharged every thing in a very just manner.</p>

            </rs> the indictment.</p>
               <p>After which the council for the prosecutor moved in the following manner for judgment:</p>
               <p>My Lord,</p>
               <p>This is one of the most wicked conspiracies that ever appeared before this court.</p>
               <p>The design of the conspirators was, by an unjust accusation, to extort money from Mr. Delafont, a worthy gentleman of the bar, and if they failed in it, then to revenge their disappointment by an unjust and malicious prosecution, that might endanger his life.</p>
               <p>Tho' nothing can be offered to your Lordship in justification of the part this woman was to act in this horrid contrivance, yet there are some circumstances which plead in mitigation of her punishment, and I have the prosecutor's authority to mention them.</p>
               <p>It appears, upon the face of the indictment, that she is a conspirator with her husband - If there had been no other defendant, the court could not give any judgment against her, as no woman can conspire with her husband alone, they having but one will, and the law supposing her under the influence of her husband. - In the present case, indeed, there is another defendant, which will warrant the court's passing judgment against her; but yet her husband's being one of the defendants, is a circumstance which speaks a little in abatement of her guilt.</p>
               <p>Besides, my Lord, this woman, a few days ago, voluntarily sent Mr. Delafont a full account of the particulars of this dark conspiracy; and tho', from the discoveries we had before made, we did not stand in great need of it, yet her account has led us to the knowledge of one very material witness against one of the other defendants, the contriver of this wicked scheme, and by whom this unhappy creature was only made use of as a necessary tool to accomplish his cruel purposes.</p>
               <p>There are some circumstances, my Lord, which may incline this court to mercy; she has been confined for two months in Newgate, without any thing to lie upon but the bare boards, or any thing to subsist upon but the goal allowance; she has had all this time the goal distemper, and her life is in great danger. - However necessary it was that the prosecutor should bring this unfortunate woman to justice, he would yet be sorry that the consequences of it should be the means of taking away her life.</p>
               <p>Under these circumstances, my Lord, I have his commission to request of the court to pass as mild a sentence upon her crime as the nature of the case will admit.</p>
               <p>Upon which the court desired an apothecary who was present, to see what condition she was in, and he having, upon his oath, declared that she was dangerously ill, and not in a condition to undergo any corporal punishment, and that a long confinement would, probably, deprive her of her life, the <rs id="t17540116-62-punish315" type="punishmentDescription">
