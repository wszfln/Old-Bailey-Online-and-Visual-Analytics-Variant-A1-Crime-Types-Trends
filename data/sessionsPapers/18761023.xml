"What is the meaning of this?"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I said "Well, I will. let you know something about it directly"—I took the goose into my garden, and when I came out the prisoner was running down the street, and I never saw him any more till he was taken into custody—I had occa<lb/>sion to go that day to Mr. Lewin, a customer of mine, and he gave me a box of cigars to look at—they had the Enchantre brand—Mr. Lewin also produced this invoice; it is the prisoner's writing.

Mathieson Howell, of Kew, and drawn by yourself"—he said "Oh, that is the bill in dispute"—I said "I shall have to detain you"—he wished me to send to the prosecutor; I did so, and Mr. Clarke arrived and charged him; he then said he wished to see Mr. Mills, if he could see him the matter could be settled—Mr. Clarke said Mr. Mills was out of town.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Miss Mathison has a banking account—she is not inter<lb/>ested equally in the business with me-we are not partners—I said before the Magistrate "Miss Mathison is equally interested in. the partnership with me". We have never signed any bill of exchange as partners. There was no agreement; we carry on business jointly; we are friends. I did not bring any capital into the business; a great portion of the capital was brought in with the prisoner's money. He lent it—to her, and he bought the furniture for her, and a great portion of the stock, from Moore Cope<lb/>stake's "—I don't know that he took the house, Miss Mathison took the house—she had some money in the bank-we started the business together—there was no money in the bank at first, she was not able to have the money when we first went into business—I know that the prisoner paid 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stock bought of Moore Copes take—I am not aware of the amount he, paid for gas fittings, but I know, he bought them—I know that he pur<lb/>chased furniture and goods for the purpose of the partnership to the amount of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I can't say how that was paid, I know it was paid by small payments—we had a plate on the door with "Mathison Howell" on it—we have since removed it because everyone that passed by looked at the house, and our names had got so published that we thought it had better be taken down—it was taken down by ourselves, by bur direction—Mr. Gosnell does not live there; he had nothing. to do with taking the plate down that I know of.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner about eight or nine years—on 19th November, 1874, I took the house 5, Northlake Terrace, Kew, in my own name—I have here the agreement and my. receipts for rent; I paid the rent myself; the prisoner paid for some furniture on my account</p>

               <p>when I took the business there in November, 1874, he did not pay for it down then, it was paid by instalments, he became liable for the furniture—I paid some of the instalments, I have the receipts here—he also paid a bill at Messrs. Copestake's of 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that must have been paid somewhere about December, 1875—I think it was the 28th December—he also paid for the gas-fittings, I don't know how much that was; I never saw the bill for them—I did not pay him back any money; he never demanded pay<lb/>ment from me, it could, have been arranged to have paid him had he done so—I had a banking account,! have the banking book here—after the Christmas quarter, 1875, I removed with Miss Howell (to Sandringham Villas—I think I have seen Mr. Tarrant twice during the year, that is all, I think that was about the time, I don't remember seeing him more, two or three times—I signed a bill of exchange, I suppose it must have been in January this year—I signed it in my own drawing room at Gunnersbury, Mr. Tarrant was there, he brought the bill there—he brought me a slip of paper which I did not understand; I asked him to explain it to me—he said "Oh, it is nothing, you would not be able to understand it if I were to do so, I am in a little difficulty, and I wish you to put your name across it"—I refused to do so at first, and then Mr. Tarrant wished me to do so as he could then tell some one, a friend of the family, of the way that he had supplied the money to me, which I wished to be a secret; that was the way he made me sign the bill; he could say it was money I had borrowed from him, but he had never asked me for it; I then signed the bill—I could not exactly say the amount of it, I think it was for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not say any<lb/>thing about when it was to be paid, but I thick I saw on it "four months"—I either signed it E. Mathison, or Emma Mathison, but I rather think R.—I spell my name "Mathison"—I have never spelt it differently that I am aware of—I never saw the bill afterwards—I never signed "Mathison I Howell" to a bill of exchange—that was the only bill I ever signed—I think I I saw the prisoner between that occasion and the early part of June, he came I to our house I think twice after that, when he came in June he did not say I anything about wanting me to sign any other bill—he never mentioned anything about my allowing him to raise money for the purpose of his dif<lb/>faculties—I never saw' this bill until it was shown to me at the police-court I—I never gave him any authority to sign that bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He is no relation of mine—I did not go to him and state that I had no capital and would he help me to go into business; it was not that way it was said at all; he was to lend me the money, he volunteered to lend it me, because he knew that he could be paid back I again, first of all if I had succeeded in business, and if not it would have been paid back as well by a certain person—I did not give any paper writing to that effect, he took it from me by word of mouth—I did not pay back any, except about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have paid part for the gas-fittings; they were so badly done that I had to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so for that-this is a bill that I have paid for the gas-fittings; it is not a receipt, it is simply the invoice for it—I can't say exactly how much I have paid; I have not paid the pri<lb/>soner anything, except about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because he never asked for it, he never applied to me for the sums I owed him, I don't know what I do owe him, even now—the bill I signed was in January and was a four months' bill—I have never paid that bill or anything towards it, I have, never seen the bill since-at the time it was drawn nothing was said about the handwriting—after I had written it the prisoner used the pen I had, but I don't know</p>

               <p>what he did to it—I did not say to him "As the things—here are all yours, you may as well sign it yourself", because all the things in my house are not his, certainly not—I said before the Magistrate "He altered the signature in my presence; I don't know the alteration that he made", that is the same thing as I am saying now—somebody else besides the prisoner advanced me money towards the stock at the time I went into business; I shall not say bow much, you have no right to ask me.</p>

Came up they all stood in a dark place, where the shops were shut up, just above the Penitentiary, on Pentonville Hill—Mr. Gurney passed into the road, and immediately he did so Ennis walked after him and hit him behind the head which made him stagger-Saunders ran up to him, caught him by the shoulder and put his leg between prosecutor's legs and threw him in the road, King ran up, felt him all round and put his hand into his right hand trousers pocket—I ran to his assistance-Saunders had hold of him—I took King into custody—when I had got him a few yards across the road he turned round and said "If I had known it was you, Mr. Gurney, we would not have done it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer in Lupus Street, Pimlico—I received instructions from the representatives of the late Rev. John May to sell the contents of his place, The Heath, Hanwell—the sale took place on the 26th September last of which this is a catalogue (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I employed the prisoner as a porter on the sale, his duties were to assist in lotting and bringing the goods up and showing them to the persons—the lots bore numbers in the usual way—if anything was not lotted he should have spoken to the manager or to me about it at the time—he had no authority to remove or sell anything—it was not contrary to the rules that he Should become a purchaser; he purchased Lot No. 4, a hair mattress, and lot 24, four blankets and counterpane, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lot 142, under carpet, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 235 drugget and hearth rug, fender and fire irons was sold to Mr. Batty for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not know at the time they were lotted that there was oilcloth in the library under the drugget—lot 111*, page 9, is three blankets, sold to Mr. Ray for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 197, page 13, I dozen table napkins, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sold to Mr. Hansom—lot 31, a quantity of dimity bed furniture, sold to Mr. Garnham for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lot 61, two blankets, sold to Miss Groves-lot 57, 4 1/2 feet iron tester bedstead and vallance, to Mr. Golding, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 96, page 7, bedroom No. 7, two dimity curtains, four post bamboo painted bedstead, sold to Golding, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—lots 6 and 7, sold to Miss Groves for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two feather pil<lb/>lows, blanket, and one quilt—I was not present when the things <hi rend="italic">were</hi> deli<lb/>vered—on going down in the afternoon after the clearing day I went up in one of the upper rooms and found a cupboard locked—I opened it with a key from my pocket and to my astonishment I found a lot of goods; I did not know by whom the cupboard had been locked; I found in it two blankets, two of the best counterpanes, linen quilt, three linen pillow cases, toilet cover, some dimity furniture, in fact, a quantity of bed furniture, one of the best towels, and a dinner napkin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I recognised the dinner napkin as being one of the twelve I had sold—the bed furniture was the lot I had seen on the bamboo bedsteadthe blankets I recognised as having seen—I had gone through these things before and I believe they were in one of the top bedrooms—I am quite sure that the blankets were not those sold to the prisoner in his lotthe vallances are the same as those described in lot 57 as sold to Mr. Golding, and the dimity bed furniture is that sold to Mr. Garnham; the quilt, I believe, is the same as that sold to Miss Groves—I was afterwards shown three blankets which did not form any portion of those sold to the prisoner, but were those sold in lot 111* to Mr. Ray—the pri<lb/>soner asked me if I had broken open the cupboard, and I asked him what he knew of the cupboard-this was on Wednesday afternoon, the day after the sale—he said there were only a few things there which he had bought—I said I have taken possession of them and shall require an explanation"—I saw him afterwards taking the mattress and the blankets hanging from it towards the station—I followed him and went by the same train to Padding<lb/>ton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187610230043"/>
               <p>—on getting out at Paddington I went to him and said "I require you, Merriman, either to take those goods to the department here or straight to the office, for I must know what you have there before you take them any<lb/>where else"—he said they were only what he had bought, his mattress and blankets—I said "You. have other goods there", and he said "Yes, I have some fire-irons and I have some china"—I said "Where did you get the fire-irons from?"—he said "I bought them in the village"—I said "Can you tell me who you purchased them from?"—"No", he said, "I don't know who it was"—he then tried to get away from me and turned down towards the Edgware Road—I still persisted in following him and he went across to the corner public-house—I went and stood there and insisted that he should either take the goods across to the office or leave them somewhere till it was properly investigated—he then promised he would go with me and take them to the office—we went to Broad Street Station and took the tickets to Victoria Station—I stood with one foot on the step of the carriage and the other on the platform till I saw him put the goods in the train—the guard came along to shut the door and I got in—the train started and I saw the prisoner deliberately pull the things out again and I was obliged to go on and could not find him afterwards—he never said anything about the oil cloth which Mr. Batty took—the full value of the goods I have seen is about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know what the <hi rend="italic">goods</hi> were which he took out of the train—I saw the mattress and blankets—I did not charge him with taking those; I charged him with stealing the oilcloth—I brought a charge against him before the Magistrates, which was dismissed, and I afterwards brought this charge—when the charge was taken I had to give him into custody for stealing the oilcloth; all the other goods were taken to the station and were there at the time of the trial—there was only one charge preferred on the charge-sheet—he commenced some civil proceedings against me by serving me with a writ, the Monday after he was committed on this charge,' which was on the Saturday—I did not say when the Magistrate dismissed the former charge that I would make it hot for him—I was not at all hot myself—I have a great many sales; I have been in business as an auctioneer for three or four years; before that I was an ironmonger—I presume I know what a sale porter's duties are—Mr. Deakin was the manager; he is my sale clerk—I do not think he is here; I understand he has met with an accident since 1 came here; I took steps to get him here-Deakin engaged Merriman and paid him his wages—Skinner would be the leading porter; I believe he is here—I have not taken an opportunity of seeing him; I believe my solicitor has—there was another porter engaged on the sale; I don't know his name—there were about four porters altogether—Skinner had the lead of the sale; he would tell the others what to do—Deakin put the things into the catalogue—there was a number of duplicate lots; it was rather a hurried affair—there were other things put into the sale at the request "of the family, not forming part of the estate, to make the sale more attractive—I did not mis<lb/>lead the public by putting at the top of my sale catalogue a formal announcement as if I were selling by the order of the Chief Clerk in Chancery, and put goods in which were no part of the property; what was done was done at the request of the solicitor—the people had the oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing the goods the day before; it was a public auction—they could judge for themselves whether the goods were worth the money or not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187610230044"/>
               <p>—in a sale like this of 348 lots where things are put in, Mr. Deakin might leave out something in the catologue-none of the things which I say have been taken by the prisoner were left out of the catalogue to my knowledge—I always go myself after the sale to see after the money, and see if the house is properly left so that I may hand over the keys to the parties—it was about 4 or 5 o'clock the next day that I went to the house, all was cleared then, with the exception of some few things that had to come to town purchasers, and which were waiting for the van-Mr. Deakin was there, I drew his attention to the things in the cupboard—it would not be his duty to leave till I had gone down—I first heard of Mr. Garnham's complaint; I could not go all over the country to find the purchasers—a complaint was made by Mr. Hansom to Deakin—he bought a dozen table napkins and had eleven delivered to him—I could not say whether Skinner or Merriman delivered the napkins—I did not say Merriman delivered them—I don't know that any of the sale porters besides the prisoner are here—I had no chance of getting them—I do not think they know anything about it—there were a great many cupboards upstairs—I bought one little lot of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the sale, I think—toys for my children, and an aluminum watch for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave to my boy, and I bought one lot of oilcloth in the passage—there were two boxes of toys locked up in the cupboard-when I buy I have to make the offer the same as anybody else-if my clerk is knocking down anything to myself, I say "George"—that is my name—I should say my porter would not know that—I was surprised that the toys should be taken such care of; the things he had bought were not in the cupboard—he took them away which he had a right to do—I did not see him afterwards till I gave him in custody on Saturday night—I know that two of the blankets produced are Mr. Ray's, because they were the best blankets in the house, and they came out of what I think is called "Mr. John's room"—my attention was called I to them—Mr. Ray gave 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the blankets; there were three—the goods I found in the cupboard were taken to my office; nothing else that I am aware of—there is some wine still down there belonging to me—I have never got into difficulties occasioned by my conducting sales in this way; there were not things in two cupboards that I am aware ofthe toys were locked up in the cupboard I opened—the blankets in the catalogue, sold to Mr. Ray and Miss Groves had been taken out and sold to the publican—three were taken and sold to the publican the moment after the sale, and others substituted to the party who had purchased them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The majority of the articles in the catalogue belonged to the estate—I should say out of the 350 lots, possibly twenty were added—I the wine consisted of three dozen claret, and one dozen champagne—adding I lots to a sale would increase the value of and competition for the other lots, I I should think—I took my order to sell from the solicitors—I stated in the sale "By order of the representatives of the late Rev. John May"—the parties considered I had not delivered them the proper lots, and of course it was doing me a great deal of harm.</p>

He put the blankets in the kitchen and went away; I cannot say whether I paid on Wednesday or Thursday. Deakin was in the house when I paid Merriman".</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Elcho Street, Park Road, Battersea—I was formerly member of the same trades union as the defendants, the Amalga mated Society of Carpenters—up to January, 1874, I was in a situation at I Brade Co.'s, builders, as foreman of the joiners—the prisoners were employed as joiners until the 4th October; on Wednesday, 4th October, discharged them; I had authority to do so as foreman; that was about 2.55 in the afternoon—they would be paid for their work up till 5 o'clock—they would be able to draw the money at any time between 3. and 5 o'clock—I saw them between 3 and 5 o'clock in Messrs. Macefield's, the ironfounders—I had a conversation with them, but do not recollect what it was—I was I standing in the roadway outside the building—there was an excavation in<lb/>side the hoarding about 10 feet deep, 4 feet wide, and 12 feet 6 inches long it was for the purpose of drainage—there were boards laid on the ground, and one man was working in the hole at the time-near to this point George spoke to me—he said "You are a pretty b"—I said "As that is such an old tale I do not want to hear any more of it"—Williams then said You have no order to discharge us"—I said "No, foremen seldom have—Williams asked me then what I was going to do with the job they had started on—I said "Do not trouble your mind about that, I have some one else to do it"—George said "You could not do it yourself"—I said "I don't know that I am required to do it,. but whatever I have attempted I have accomplished"—I said "I want to get my bag and get away home, I want no more to say to you"—George advanced ahead of me, and Williams stepped towards the end of the hole, George passing up the side, and I after him-Williams stepped after me, and as we were about the centre of the hole Williams suddenly seized me by the shoulders and threw me down the hole, and said "Go down there, you b"—I made a catch at George, but</p>

They would not have to pass this place; there was a nearer way for their tools, but one way would be past this hole-before the Magistrate I said I smiled in one part of the conver<lb/>sation—there are planks and scaffold boards on both sides of the hole—I said I did not believe Williams struck his foot against the plank; to the best of my belief that is so.</p>

When the policeman came up I did not tell him to take Williams, and say nothing about George—I said to him "Please take that man's address"—I know Robert Lowe, he is a labourer in the employment of my employers—I have not heard Lowe give his evidence, except on the second occasion—George asked Lowe questions in his defence, he asked mostly all the witnesses—I heard Lowe say "Take that man Williams, you need not say anything about 'George"—when I grabbed at George, I did not nearly pull him into the hole—I could almost swear he was not in the hole—I remember George saying when the con<lb/>stable came up "You nearly had me in the hole"—when in the hole I saw. them start to run away—the hole was 10 ft. deep, I could see a man start<lb/>ing to run away—I cannot say whether George would have partly fallen if I had not grabbed him—by the expression George used at the time "Now you have got your deserts, "I did not think that George did so to save himself from falling into the hole—I cannot say if it was necessary for him to push me off, he was standing on the plank—what was done to me was done suddenly from behind in such a way that I threw out my arms and grabbed at something to save myself, and in doing so caught hold of George—I cannot say if George would have fallen into the hole if I had not grabbed him; the action made by him would have been with the intention of saving himself if he had been in front of methe words he used were after I had tried to grab at him to save myself, and after he shook me off, he struck me with his arm.</p>

I live at No. 6, Little College Street, Wapping, and am a shipwright—I have known the prisoner since 1866—he is a house and—, estate agent—in 1875, he was carrying on business at 37, Essex Street, Strand—in that year I entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with him—by that agreement we were each to advance 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to be put into the bank in both our names—I paid him the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 23rd of January—he gave me the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid it in Bank of England notes, which I had got from the West of England Bank—he did not pay his own 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him several times, and he said "It's all right"—the memorandum at the end of the agreement was made about two days after he had received the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Mr. Ewens, I must look after your protection, as I am in partnership with Mr. Spiers—I wish to do you a good turn, and I must have this for your protection," and he said "You. will</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief waiter at the Rautzenkrantz Hotel, at Eisenach—I recollect the prisoner coming there on 24th November, 1875, but I saw him about three weeks before that, when he came to make inquiries and engaged three rooms—he signed the visitors' book on that occasion; I produce it—he signed it as Count von Howard—about three weeks afterwards he came to reside at the hotel with a lady who passed as his wife; they occupied the three rooms, a bed-room, a sitting-room, and a study or writing-room—I have been in the writing-room about twice, to ask him questions; I always saw. him in the sitting-room when I wanted to see himthe writing-room opened on to the passage; the door was always locked, and the key was in the sitting-room—when he came, he brought fourteen or sixteen portmanteaus; they were all kept in the writing-room—letters were never delivered at the hotel for him; he always went to the post-office to get them there-two days after he came, the postman brought some letters, and the prisoner sent them back to the office, and said "I will come down and fetch them"—during the time he was at the hotel I some<lb/>times saw him bring in newspapers and letters; they were small letters—he had no visitors while with us—on 21st February Mr. Schmidt, the burgomaster, and Mr. Weller, and a police-officer came and asked for Mr. Howard—I took them to the writing-room; it was then unlocked—they went into the room—the prisoner was sitting at a writing-table; he did not understand German very well, and I interpreted what was said—I said to him in English "The gentlemen want to speak to you about your passport"—he said "I have not got any passport"—the burgomaster afterwards took him into custody, and he was taken away—I believe Mr. Schmidt locked the portmanteaus and also the room, and put the key in his pocket—he returned in the afternoon with the Judge of Instruction and Dr. Baltzar, and went into the writing-room; no one had been into that room in the meantime; they took possession of all the papers and portmanteaus—whilst the prisoner was with us he used to go away early in the morning to different places, and come back late at night—he did not say where he had been; he did that about once a week.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not pay particular attention to the date when I first saw the prisoner, but I remember seeing him once going out in a sleigh, therefore I suppose it was about Christmas time—I took my dinner at the same hotel where he was lodging, and I think I have seen him there on repeated occasions before that—I did not see him in the spring of 1875; I am quite certain about that—I don't know whether I saw him that summer—we had received from England an impression of a seal, and I found a corresponding seal in the prisoner's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Philosophy, and reside at Eisenach—on the afternoon of 21st February last, I went with Mr. Schmidt and other persons to the hotel at Eisenach—we went into the writing-room—I saw papers on the table, and also remarked the box of seals—there were about silken or seventeen; some had three sides and some two; altogether they would make forty-five or fifty impressions—I looked at the papers in the room by the order of the Judge of Instruction—I recognise these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as being on the table. (<hi rend="italic">This was a Utter dated 14th February</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Thornewell, on the fly-sheet of which was some writing in red ink, and an unfinished letter headed "Strictly private and confidential," and a piper containing the name of "Richard Harvey" and various other names</hi>.) These two books were also found in the room; I have had them at my house several days and examined them-at page 189 I find "Richard Harvey, Castle Baynard, 13, Upper Thames Street, and Carnousie House,—. Turriff, Aberdeenshire, 15/1/75;" at page 191, "J. Harvey, legacy, 30/1;" 192 "J. Harvey, A B letter"; 196, "J.

Harvey, <hi rend="italic">tin</hi>, 8th May, Saturday, Stuttgart "-Stuttgart is twelve or fifteen hours from Eisenach—there are a number of other entries of "J. Harvey" at different dates, and at 201 there is "J. Harvey, final <hi rend="italic">coup"</hi> written in Greek letters, "17/8,. Tuesday"—I also find a number of similar entries against the name of "C. H. Williams"—in this other book all the various items under the head of "J. Harvey" are posted up; I also find a reference to C. H. Williams and Thornewell-amongst the papers I found some envelopes with" the name of "Judford, to be forwarded," written on them in pencil; I saw a</p>

               <p>great many such in a portmanteau—I saw a large number of letters which purported to be written by Mr. J. Harvey; there were many like those in the portmanteau, a dozen or more by Mr. Williams, and a large number from other persons; from more than forty different persons-these two, numbers 76 and 77 were on the table; on one of them is written in red ink "Copy, and for general use"—I saw the War Office seal and sixteen or seventeen others, also this letter dated Southampton, 23rd April, 1874, addressed to Captain Howard, Passas, Bavaria," signed "your affectionate wife, C. H."—at page 24 of this smaller book I find an entry relating to Colonel Murray and a request to forward enclosed letter; there is no date to that entry—I also found some envelopes with the words "On Her Majesty's service."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I met the burgomaster and the public accuser at the hotel at their request and went with them to the prisoner's room—we looked over everything that was on the table, and we looked into the large port<lb/>manteau that contained the letters, but I did not see everything then, of course; they were all brought to the Court-house, and these two books and the letters were sent to my house by the Judge of Instruction perhaps two or three months later—I don't recollect seeing the books or the pencil enve<lb/>lopes when I went to the hotel—there were papers and envelopes not written upon, large ruled sheets of the same sort and colour as these produced—I think there was also note paper and envelopes; I don't think any of those were sent to me.</p>

Neumunster, Canton Zurich, Switzerland—on that letter there is now some writing in red ink which was not there when I sent it, it is a summary of the following letter that I received; the envelope is also written on, it is in red ink "J. Harvey, Esq., Castle Baynard, Upper Thames Street, London," and some Greek characters, 8, 12, 30, 1—on 21st January I wrote this other letter in consequence of the address of the first letter; I sent that in the same way—I registered every letter I sent—I sealed the envelope which had Mr. Judford's name on it—I find on that a note in red ink "I regret the error of the address"—I next received this letter of 1st February at my London address; it has the London post mark S.E. and the penny stamp with the same seal; this purports to come from Judford, and informs me that the will in question was the will and codicils of Richard Harvey, who died on 6th July, 1870, by which I was to have 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the value of the freehold, and cancelling a prior will—on 2nd February, 1875, I wrote this answer directed to Herr von Howard, Zurich, enclosing in it and. in all the following letters an envelope directed to Judford—these envelopes addressed in pencil are some of them, with my seal to them—on that letter of 2nd February there is also some red ink writing containing the substance of a reply—all the letters I received were addressed to me at Upper Thames Street with a penny stamp on—I received all these letters up to, No. 13 and</p>

Bank of England note in a calico cover for security, and inside was an envelope directed to Judford; I registered that letter at Cornhill—I now find on that letter the draft of a reply which I afterwards received informing me that no one else was interested in the will—I received the letter of 4th June in the same way through the English post, and on 9th June I received in the same way this letter acknowledging the receipt of my letter containing the half note—on 10th June I wrote this letter, which is dated in error 10th July, in which I enclosed the halves of three notes, one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I received an acknowledgment of their receipt, dated 16th June—on the 17th June I sent the remaining halves of the notes, making up the 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I registered that in the same way at Cornhill, and addressed it to Urach; this is the receipt for the registration of that letter—I afterwards received this letter acknowledging the remaining half notes; that letter purports to be written from Morton Hampstead, near Exeter—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the notes I sent—I did not receive the will—I received and wrote these other letters (<hi rend="italic">looking at several</hi>), one of them, dated 21st July, 1875, intimates that Mr. Howard was going to travel in Spain, Portugal, and various places—I wrote to some of those addresses and my letters were returned through the Dead Letter office—I was a month or six weeks after that without any communication from Judford—I had a letter addressed to London which had gone to Dusseldorff and had been a month on the way home; in that he told me to put an advertisement in she "Courier" under the, heading of <hi rend="italic">Ego Potomi</hi>—I did so on 2nd, 9th, and 30th October and 11th and 27th November—I afterwards received this letter of 20th Decem<lb/>ber addressed to me by Judford with the same penny stamp on it-previous to that I received a letter, which I have lost, telling me that the holder of the will, not having heard from me so long, had deposited it with a relative or some lady, the soul of honour, who would not give it up—some time after that I communicated with the police in Scotland Yard-in the early part of this year I heard that a Mr. von. Howard was in custody at Eisenach and on 30th March I obtained a warrant from the Lord Mayor for his arrest that was put into the hands of the police—I afterwards attended at the Mansion House when the prisoner was brought over—before that I received this letter, dated 10th July, 1876, signed Howard, purporting to come from Eisenach—I knew nothing personally of Mr. Richard Harvey, of Greenway, Dartmouth, who is referred to in these letters—I am not related to him that I know of-when I sent the Bank notes I believed that the letters I wrote addressed to Judford were received by Herr von Howard and forwarded to to Judford in London, that he was a solicitor, and was acting for some client—I believed all the statements contained in these letters; unless I had believed that I would not have sent the Bank notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman belonging to the Metropolitan Brigade, stationed at Hackney—on 9th September, at 1.44 a.m, the prisoner came to the station in a very unconcerned manner and said that his house was on fire.—while we were getting the engine ready he said that his wife and children</p>

               <p>were all right, he had got them out-we started from the station three or four minutes afterwards and he wrode a on the engine—when we got to the corner of Glenarm Road I saw some firemen's lamps and said "The volun<lb/>teers are there, I think"—the prisoner said that he thought the house would have been burnt down by that time—I saw Dupree outside and the police—I could not discern any fire from the outside—we got in by going the next house and into the back yard and over the wall-Dupree showed us the way—the first door was locked and bolted' and the shutters also; the back door was bolted and I had to burst it in, carrying away the bolt—after going into Dupree's kitchen I began to smell paraffin and other oil which I took to be boiled oil, and the two mats were alight—on opening the back parlour door I discovered a large amount of oil strewed all over the carpet which was just alight with a flickering flame all over the top of it and open<lb/>ing the door blew it out—there was so much oil that I could scoop it up in a handfull—the stair carpet on the first floor was saturated and part of it was burnt through—I asked Dupree and the prisoner how they accounted for it—they both said that they did not know how it came there—after the engineer took Dupree's particulars of insurance the prisoner said that he was insured, and I was ordered upstairs by the engineer to show the pri<lb/>soner a light to get his receipt or policy—I went to a bedroom, and the first thing I saw was a cash-box on the drawers—the prisoner stated that there was nothing there of any consequence as his wife had got everything away with her—after some time he opened the cash-box and produced a receipt for the policy and said that he did not know where the policy was, it was mislaid, or his wife had got it—I examined the bed, there was no impression of anybody lying there, the bed clothes were just thrown, back and the pillow had a slight indenture in it—I asked the prisoner how he could account for the fire—he said that he heard a noise on the landing, a rumbling, like something being thrown downstairs, and he jumped up, dis<lb/>covered the fire, rushed for a jug of water and threw it down the stairs—I found a pint jug lying at the bottom of the stairs burnt both inside and out—this tin bowl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was quite wet with paraffin and it had about half a gill left in it, it was outside the window—I asked the prisoner if he knew whose bowl it was and how he could account for it being there—he said that he did not know who it belonged to or whether it was his or not—I found a bowl in the sink which Mr. Dupree said was his, it contained two or three pocket handkerchiefs in water which looked as if they had been put in soak over night—I found a shawl outside on the slates, and this can in the prisoner's kitchen, with oil running down it, aud alongside of it a gallon can, which is not here, it was quite dry and I could not discern that anything had been it—this other tin I found in the kitchen cupboard quite empty and wet, the cork was alongside it—I asked the prisoner if they were his cans—he said "Yes," he brought them there every night—I asked him whether he used oil on the premises—he said "No," only at his place of business—he did not complain of having lost anything when I was in his bedroom, he told me he had nothing there of any consequence.</p>

I am a builder and decorator and agent to the County Fire Office—the prisoner was a stranger to me, but in April last he crossed from the opposite side of the way to me as I was walking along and said "Good morning, I believe you are Mr. Wareham"—I said "Yes"—he said "You are agent for the County Fire <hi rend="italic">Office</hi>, will you insure me?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I am a painter over there, you see"—he was paint<lb/>ing a house—I said "How much do you wish to insure for?"—he said 300?."—I said "That is a large sum"—he said "Yes, but I have married into a respectable family, married a young woman who has money"—I asked him where he lived and whether he was insured in any other office—he said "No"—he said he had a musical instrument and some jewellery; those were embodied in the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I sent him the policy by post—I said "Shall the insurance commence at Midsummer?"—he said "No, something might happen, I prefer it at once," and I ordered it to commence on 6th May—I afterwards saw him at work and called across to him and said "You have the policy"—he said "Yes, I will call this evening," but he never called—after three months I sent a collector for the premium, but he brought back no money—some time in August the prisoner came to my place and said "<hi rend="italic">Well</hi>, I have another policy, I don't want two policies, two policies are no use to me"—I said the insurance offices only pay <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi>, as is seen by this fourth clause—the premium was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he promised to bring the policy back, but did not.</p>

I did live at 40, Ash Grove, I now live at 20, Bonner's Row—I am a boot finisher, and work for Mr. Ayres, of 343, Hackney Road—on Monday afternoon, 18th September, about 3.30, I was coming out of Mr. Ayres' shop and saw Dilworth standing outside; the shop <hi rend="italic">goes</hi> back with a garden, I suppose he must have been about 18 yards from the shop, on the pavement—I had never seen him before—he said "Shopmate, do you know that the shop is on strike"—I said "No, I was not aware of that"—he said "Are you going to work for Mr. Ayres"—I said "Yes, if the work and if the price suits me, I shall work for Mr. Ayres"—I had done a sample pair for Mr. Ayres, and they suited him and the price suited</p>

               <p>me, and I had brought the work out—nothing more passed then, I went away—I saw him again in the evening, outside Mr. Ayres' premises, in the same place, about 7.30 or 7.40, I was going home from Mr. Ayres' shop, where I had gone about, an hour before—I had gone the same way to the shop, and he was then in the same place, he did not speak to me then-as I came out he said "Well, shop mate, are you going to continue to work for Mr. Ayres"—I said "Yes"—he said "If you continue to work for Mr. Ayres we shall reckon you as a b——<hi rend="italic">scab</hi> on the shop"—there were two other men with him, I don't know their names; I had never seen them before—that was all that passed that evening; I made no answer to him—on the afternoon of that same day there were three men with Dilworth, and they asked me if I would go in the public-house and have a drop of ale—that was when I first saw him, they were strange men, they were two different men that were with him in the evening—I went and had a glass of ale with the three men, Dilworth remained behind, they tried to persuade me to join "the trade"—I did not join it, I told them that I did not care about being in the trade, I mean the Trade Union—they asked me if I would join it if they gave me a shilling a day so long as the shop was on strike, but I could not afford to lose my time for that, I refused—on the inert day Tuesday, the 19th, between 11.30 and 12 o'clock, I went to Mr. Ayres for some work, and as I came outside I saw Dilworth—he said "What are you going to do with that workshop mate"—I had some work in my hand—I said "I am going to take it home and finish it"—he said "Well, you ought to be d—well ashamed of yourself, if I see you with any more work I shall break your b——arm"—I walked on, and did not say nothing—Mr. Morgan, Mr. Ayres, manager, was by at that time, his trap was waiting outside, and he was just getting up in the trap, and he came up and said to Dilworth "You must be careful of what you are saving"—I don't know whether Dilworth made any answer, I went away, I did not stop, and Mr. Morgan saw me home to Ashgrove with my work, to see that it was all right-at the first interview on the Monday, Dilworth said to me "I know where you live, you <hi rend="italic">live</hi> at 40, Ashgrove, I shall send Mr. Richardson, the secretary round to you"—I believe Richardson is the secretary of the Trade Union, or represents himself so—I was really afraid after all this—I changed from 40, Ashgrove, to other lodgings, I left Ash<lb/>grove, on the 25th, on account of the man where I was sitting to finish my work on the Monday morning, taking all my work back, and I had nowhere to finish my work, and altogether it upset me—it was not my <hi rend="italic">lodging</hi>, I never lodged there, I only sat there to work, and the man said he would not allow me to sit there because I was at work for a shop that was on strike—I had paid him for being allowed to work there—I have been, working for Mr. Ayres, ever since, I send for my work; it is a usual thing to send for it, I never worked in his shop, I always brought the work home—sometimes Mr. Ayres sends my money, and sometimes I send for it.</p>

               <p>Sutton's goods and I said "Yes", I was guilty of it—I worked twice for Mr-Branch, after March and before Christmas—I illegally pawned there and also at Mr. Pearce's; the reason I pledged them was because Mr. Pearce made me pay for some boots and likewise he owed me some money; he has never I paid me—I think the goods are in pawn now, but the manufacturers can't claim them now, because it is over six months—I worked for Mr. Moore, not for Mr. Pearce, that was in August this year, I think—I pawned Mr. Moore's work illegally, but he gave me work after that; all the three of them employed me afterwards.</p>

I am a bootmaker, and live at present at 40, Ann's Place—I have worked for Mr. Ayres—on 19th September I was outside his shop, I saw the prisoner and Baxter there, and Mr. Morgan at the same time—I saw Baxter come out first with some work under his arm, and Mr. Morgan came out afterwards, followed by young Mr. Ayres, and got into a pony and trap—I was standing by the side of Dilworth, I could see Morgan distinctly; I suppose I might be touching Dilworth—I had been walking up and down with him, I was in company with him—the only conversation I heard pass was "Shopmate," that was all Dilworth said to Baxter—he did not say "What have you got there"—I did not hear Baxter reply "I have got work," or Dilworth say "Are you going to do it"—I think I should have heard it if he had said it—I did not hear Baxter say I am Dil<lb/>worth did not say "If you do you are a d—<hi rend="italic">scab</hi>, and if you take out any more work I will break your b——arm "Morgan went into the trap, and when Dilworth said "Shopmate" he said "Don't insult him"—he said "I have not insulted him"—he said "Yes you have, and I shall have you"—he said that in the trap—I remained with Dilworth after that—I saw Baxter go up the road—Mr. Ayres was not there at this time; young Mr. Ayres had come out with Mr. Morgan, and he was inside the trap with Mr. Morgan at this time, he remained in the trap-since then I have measured the distance, and it is between 16 and 17 yards from where Dilworth was standing, I should not think any one in the trap could have heard what Dilworth said, not beyond the word "Shopmate"—I saw Mr. Morgan get into the trap, it was said when he was in the trap; he was in the trap all the time, he did not get out, he turned round and said "Don't insult him, I see you and I shall have you"—he sat in the trap all the time he said that, and as soon as he finished he drove off—I did not see him go with Baxter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was close to Dilworth—I don't believe Mr. Morgan could hear what Dilworth said—I heard what Morgan said, because he sat in the trap and Dilworth had got back again—when Baxter came out with the work he walked up the road, we were marching up and down of course, the same as a picket should do—I measured the distance from Mr. Ayres'</p>

On Tuesday, 19th September, I remember hearing that one of our workpeople had been molested—I was not in the trap with Mr. Morgan that morning, not at any time that morning to my knowledge; I don't recollect, I may have been in the trap by myself, but I don't recollect being in it with Morgan that morn<lb/>ing—I was not present when any conversation passed between Dilworth and Baxter outside our premises, I believe I was standing at the door when Morgan went up to them; I did not hear anything that passed, they were too far away from me; the house stands a long way back; they seemed rather angry, having words, I thought, but what passed I did not hear—I don't remember whether I afterwards got into the trap when Morgan drove away—I believe he got out of the trap and spoke to Dilworth; I should think I was about 10 feet from them, I was standing on the threshold of the door, and there is a bit of garden in front and there are railings; I did not hear anything that was said—I am in and out of the trap all day long, sometimes a dozen times a day, sometimes with Morgan and sometimes by myself—I was in the trap that day two or three times alone, it may have been before or after Morgan came back; I was in it early in the morning and in the after part of the day; we both use the trap and my father also—the distance from the shop to the footpath may be 20 feet—I was about 10 feet from the railings, but I daresay 15 or 20 feet from where they were—I have not measured the distance.</p>

I reside at Mulgrave Place, widow. The deceased was my husband, John Dorman, aged fifty-eight years; a labourer. I was present at his death, which occurred at 9.20 p.m. yesterday, 2nd August, at Mulgrave Place. On Thursday night, 27th July last, the deceased was at home with me. John Gordon, who lodges in the house, was going out to fetch a pot of beer. I was sitting down on the door<lb/>steps, and Gordon came prancing and dancing around me and pulling my dress, which I did not like. He put his foot against me and tumbled me down the steps. I got up and went in and told my husband what he had done, and I said to him (my husband) 'I might as well have no husband.' My husband got up and went into the passage. Gordon was there. I saw my husband thrown down by Gordon in the passage and Gordon standing over him. I helped my husband up and into his room. Gordon went out and shortly returned to our door. A tumbler was on the side table by the door. 'Gordon took up the tumbler and threw it with violence towards my husband, who sat in the chair about 3 yards off, and it struck him on the temple and the tumbler was broken. My husband neither spoke or moved, blood flowed from my husband's head. Gordon went into his own room. The police came and took Gordon into custody. My husband followed to the station.</p>

Twelve months ago he had a fall and cut bis head; he had been drinking then. He had a fall four months ago; he had a slight scratch then. Gordon and deceased were the best of friends. Gordon and deceased had both been drinking on the 27th. They were both in the Royal Artillery service together. The deceased had I been twice out that day to the Queen public-house. A staff stick is kept in my room. The stick produced was thrown into the room. I did not tell my husband to go and knock Gordon's brain out. He remained in bed till his death, except for about two or three hours on Monday last when he went out. I said to Gordon before he died I would make it up, and so my hus-band did. After the injury my husband had no drink, no beer', he had three glasses of port wine in the five days; he had nothing to drink after his pension day. I did not strike my husband with a buckle. He was not subject to fits; he would fall occasionally and that would be from overflow of blood to the head. <hi rend="italic">The mark of Eliza Dorman.</hi>

I am a labourer, of 53, Mint Street, Borough—on 24th September I was with Mr. and Mrs. Butler in their first-floor front room, 5 Vine Yard, St. George's, and two other persons—we went in about 11.30 p.m.—we had about half a gallon of beer, and were thinking of going home, when a knock came to the door—I, being the nearest, got up to answer it, but just as I put my hand on it it was pushed violently open and a man's hand came in with some weapon—I gave way, and the prisoner stood over me with something in his right hand and struck me in my right eye—I said that I was hurt, and Mrs. Butler came and took a piece of a knife out of my eye—I gave the prisoner in custody—I bled—a good deal and taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had only seen—the prisoner once before; I had had no quarrel with him—this was Sundry morning; I had been in a public-house five or six times till 9 p.m.—I was not drinking heavily, because I had a bad hand and I thought it would not do me good—I was reading the paper—I drank four pots of beer during the whole day; I was quite sober—I left at 9 o'clock and went to the Grapes; I was there half an hour and had two glasses of ale—I left at 11.30—I may have said before the Magis<lb/>trate "I had just taken about as much as I could properly do with."</p>

I am the wife of William Butler, of 5, Vine Yard—early on this Sunday morning my mother, my husband, and Mr. Barnes were in our room—the prisoner knocked at the door, Barnes went to open it, and the first stroke came against the wall—the prisoner pushed the door open and said "You b——s—, I mean killing one here," and struct Barnes in the eye—he said "I am stabbed"—I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—I took this piece of a table knife out of Barnes' eye and gave it to the sergeant.</p>
