            . I am a constable. I was walking along the stations in the morning the first of October, about eight o'clock; I saw Evans standing pretty near the bags. I came, and the other prisoner came again between nine and ten; I gave my partner notice of them. Evans set himself down on a bag, and was a pilfering out of it. I saw him put some ginger into his pocket; then he got off the bag, and Potts came and did the same; then we took them directly. It is the common way of such, to take about a pound at a time, and go and unload, and come again may be 20 or 30 times in a day. We searched them, and took black ginger from each of them. This bag was whole before; we observed it was cut where the ginger was taken from, and we found a knife in Potts's pocket.</p>

            . On the 17th of last September I was in bed; the prisoner at the bar came and took my breeches from under my head, when I was betwixt sleep and awake, and took out half a guinea and seven shillings. He disturbed me by taking the breeches from under my head. I asked him what he wanted; he said nothing at all, but he was coming to bed. I saw him put the breeches down. I asked him what he had in his hands; he said he had got nothing. I examined his hands, and found half a guinea and seven shillings.</p>

            . I saw Mr. Harris bring the prisoner down stairs, the money in one hand, and him in the other. He then said the prisoner had taken it out of his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received half a guinea of the porter that afternoon about four o'clock, I, being not well, went out to get a bottle of stuff. I paid away about 3 s. 6 d. I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock; the prosecutor had a candle burning at his bed's head. I was taking a little money out of my pocket, telling it over; he jumped up and said, you are picking my pocket; he said, what have you got there? I said, nothing of yours. After that, he took his purse out, and told over some gold; then he took me down stairs, and he beat me. On the Wednesday I got a warrant for him, for beating me; then he got a warrant for me, and had me before Justice Fielding, and I was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. What, was you at the Bagnio?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I keep the books, and attend in the Bagnio; and the prisoner was under porter.</p>

               <p>Mr. Glasby. I live at the Rosemary Branch, Islington. This horse was at grass with me; I had him between six and seven months; he was taken out of my ground either the 10th or 11th of February last; he was in the field the 10th at night; we saw a great deal of corn scattered about, which, we supposed, was to catch him; he was hard to be catched.</p>
               <p>Q. Whhat colour was he?</p>
               <p>Glasby. He was of a mouse-brown colour, about 14 hands and an inch, or rather better; comes five years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a horse, or a gelding?</p>
               <p>Glasby. A gelding; he is in the ground now.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Glasby. I never saw the prisoner before I saw him at the justice's house; he there owned he sold the horse to Mr. Punnet. There was a man came to me about five or six days after the horse was missing, and asked me, if I had lost such a horse, saying, there was such a one offered to sale at the Blue Bell, near Rochester. I went, and found this horse was sold to one Mr. Punnet, an attorney at law, at Maidstone; and that he had bought him of the prisoner at the bar for seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Punnet. I bought a horse of the prisoner at the bar [he answers to the description before given] for seven guineas; the prisoner was to call on me again; and, if I liked him, I was to give him another guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before ?</p>
               <p>Punnet. I had heard of his name before, and saw him before; he offered me a horse once before this; he is a Welchman, and used to travel that way with bullocks; and, before this, bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy him?</p>
               <p>Punnet. On the 17th of February, my lord; and on the 24th Mr. Glasby came to me, to demand the horse, saying, he was informed I had bought such a horse, and desired to see him. He swore, before the mayor of Rochester, the horse was his property, and also he had been his six months before. But this seems to me to be a mistake, not done with any design; it appears this horse is Mr. Demock's property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Glasby. Is this the horse you say is Mr. Demock's property ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170004"/>Glasby. It is, my lord; I brought him to Mr. Demock, at his own door, and he is in my ground now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Demock, Was that your horse Mr. Glasby brought to your door?</p>
               <p>Demock. It was, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. to Glasby. How came you to swear this horse was yours ?</p>
               <p>Glasby. I did not read the affidavit when it was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I paid 7 l. 4 s. for this horse.</p>

I can't remember all the things; they are here; the pawnbroker can give a better account.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were all these goods?</p>
               <p>Garnet. They were taken out of my house; the prisoner acknowledged the taking them out, she was my servant, and went along with us to the place where she pawned them. I live in <placeName id="t17501017-4-crimeloc19">Woodstreet, Westminster</placeName>

            . I am servant to Mr. Johnson, a pawnbroker, the corner of Russel-court. The prisoner at the bar brought several things to our house to pledge in the name of Mrs. Garnet. The silver cup, gold buttons, several spoons, the rings and cloaths; she had some away, and brought them again. The rings and buttons were taken in the 17th of September, we had had them before several times.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. When did you miss the rings and buttons?</p>
               <p>Garnet. I missed them the 21st of September; I took out a warrant, and she was committed on the 22d.</p>
               <p>Alison. The cloaths she pawned were taken away to the justice, and I don't know them again.</p>

            . I live in Long-Acre, servant to Mr. Rawlings. About the middle of June, the prisoner came to our house, and brought a pair of gold buttons. I asked her where she lived; she told me her husband was a carpenter, and lived in Westminster. About five or six days after, she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170005"/> them away again. She has brought several things since; she once brought some rings, and redeemed them again. About the 13th of September she brought a shirt; she also brought, at another time, a marrow-spoon, two tea-spoons, and a strainer.</p>
               <p>Q. to Garnet. Had the prisoner these things in her care?</p>
               <p>Garnet. She had the keeping of the plate and the linen. I once missed the cup, and she brought it again the next day, or the day after. I once missed a pint pot; that was put before me the next day at noon. Thus I was deceived. The things were produced in court; they were found at the three pawnbrokers houses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What was pawned was for money for housekeeping; when I have asked him for money, he'd say, what have you done with the money you had before? when I told him it was laid out, he would say, why, if you have not money, you have money's worth in your hands.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you ever give these, or any of these things to pawn?</p>
               <p>Garnet. No, my lord, I never did; I believe there are people now in court know I live in better reputation.</p>

I went to break the door open, there I found the key put in on one side the door; when I got up into my room, which was a garret, I found the child crying, all black in the face, weakened very much, and lies in a dangerous way now. I went to my drawer to examine my cow-keeper's money, and I found but 23 s. instead of 45 or 46 s. I pay my cow-man every Monday morning. Besides this, there were 7 l. all but 5 s. two gold rings, and a watch. She took 15 s. out of that, and I believe out of the cow-keeper's money she took upwards of 20 s. then I ran again to her mother, and told her; she said she was told she was gone with two girls to Cold Bath-fields; I went to meet them, and found them; I took hold of her, and said she had robbed me; we brought her towards Bridewell, and near the gate she said she had taken out a handful of all silver, and did not reckon it, and that she had wrapt it in a paper, and hid it under the step that goes up into Faulcon-court. This was a place near our own door; when we came there it was gone.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I have known the prisoner something above five years, she is about 14 years of age. I keep a chandler's shop. On Sunday was fortnight I was sitting by my own fire, I heard a noise, and got up to hear what was the matter; the prosecutor said the girl had robbed him; we took her into a neighbour's house, the girl very much denied it; we all thought to make it up, he said he was willing to make it up, if he could tell where to have his money. Then they took the girl away towards Bridewell; the prisoner's mother was there, she much desired her mother to pay the money, but still said she was quite innocent of it. Her mother said it was not in her power, and bid the girl tell where it was, if she had it. When we came to Bridewell-gate, she said, master, if you will not put me to Bridewell, I will confess what I have done with it. She said she drew the staple and took the money out, and was afraid it would be found upon her; so she put it under a post at the steps going down Faulcon-court on the right hand side. I did not go along with them to look for it, but they came back again, and said it was gone.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Woodward Harlow. The prosecutor had got hold of the girl at this time, and sent for me; I came, the girl denied it; at last, by his threatning and her mother persuading her to tell, she did confess; then she was brought back from Bridewell-gate to our shuffleboard-room. I went with the girl to the place where she said it was; we went to the step and could not find it. The girl in coming back said to me, because I was good-natured to him, and would not trouble him, he now would put me to trouble, saying, her master had ravished her, and given her the foul disease. I told him what the girl said; said he, the girl used to lie at the foot of our bed with my wife and I, and that once when she got out of bed he did take hold of her hand, and would have pulled her into bed, but as to ravishing her he never did. At this time the girl indeed confessed it, because her master promised not to send her to gaol if she would; this she said before her master's face.</p>

               <p>George. I thought she was going to carry it to Mrs. North.

I went into the other room and drank part of a full pot of beer before I went out at the door. I want to know why they did not follow me and take it away from me?

            . There were two purses with money in each, I cannot say how much; there were some other bills and notes, but I don't know justly what. When the prisoner was taken he deliver'd to me a purse with three guineas in gold, and another with 17 s. and 4 d. in silver in it; there was also a bag of halfpence in the desk, but I do not know how much; I can swear the two purses are mine, and that they were in the desk, and the prisoner said the money was mine.</p>

               <p>Palling. On the account of Mess. Freame and Barcley's sending to me and telling me they had got my note, and believed the man, the next day after the prisoner left me; immediately I went thither, and they shewed me the draught: they shew'd me the man who brought it; I said it was not my servant. I said to the man who brought it, Unless you show me the man who gave you this draught I'll prosecute you. He said he receiv'd it of a man at the ship at the Hermitage, and also he would go and shew me the man. I took with me a witness<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170008"/> that is here, and went with the man to the house, and did not take the note from him, when we came to this ale-house. I had neither a warrant or constable, the man who keeps the house let us come into the house, but when we came to go up stairs he refus'd us, but let the porter go up whom I had detected: he went into the room and bid the prisoner fly for his life, for there were people out to take him. I had some struggle with the landlord, the prisoner got out on the back part of the house over the houses, so I came down stairs again, but I had seen him on the dock. I call'd out stop thief, I saw the prisoner on some coal lighters just by the wharf; there he was taken. By that time we had got a constable, whom we order'd to search him; but without that he delivered me up one purse with three guineas in it in gold, and another with 17 s. and 4 d. in silver in it, and the draught upon Freame and Bercley for 20 l. These he deliver'd in the street, and he said the desk, with other notes was in the room. The bills and other papers he said were wrap'd up in an apron, and sew'd together, in order to be sent back to me, and that he was about writing a letter to me to send with the parcel, and I found it pack'd up as he said.

            . I was at Mr. Palling's the next day after he was robb'd, the 25th of Sept. last, he told me how he had been robb'd the night before by his servant; I had not been there above two or three minutes before Mess. Freame and Barcley's servant came in, to tell him he believed he had got the note, and also he thought the man. Mr. Palling desired me to go along with him, I did, there we saw a man, not the prisoner, it was a watchman we were inform'd afterwards; we ask'd him how he came by the note, he describ'd the person of whom he had it, and told us where he was. I, Mr. Palling, and one Mr. Newman I believe his name is, went together to the ship alehouse by the Hermitage bridge; when we came there we imagin'd the prisoner was below in the house, but he was up stairs. We were going up, the landlord refused us so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the landlord's name?</p>
               <p>Hartshorne. His name I think is Bercley, he said he was in his own house and would do as he pleas'd; he let the watchman go up. I told him I would fetch a constable, the watchman had the note then; we deliver'd it back to him before. I was inform'd there was a constable in the neighbourhood, I went out to see for him. While I was enquiring for him, the prisoner got out of the window backwards, so when I came back to the Ship they had taken the prisoner, he was taken on the coal barges; we took him to another publick house just by; I enquir'd for a constable, there was one in the room; we desired him to search the prisoner, to see if he had any arms about him. He deliver'd up two purses to Mr. Palling, I saw three guineas in one green purse, in the other there were 17 s. and 4 d. in silver, there was a little silver 4 d. and a crooked shilling amongst them. Then he told us where the things were; we took the constable to the alehouse where we first went to; we found the little desk, it was produc'd in court, it was broke open. There were some papers sow'd up in a bundle, I saw them after it was opened. There was a note for 108 l. odd money, I believe it was a joint note of hand. Twice the prisoner confess'd he stole these things out of Mr. Palling's house, and that he was persuaded to do it by a taylor, a soldier that lives in Charles-street Westminster; after that we carried him before a justice, and he committed him to Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I ask'd my master's brother leave to go out in the afternoon this thing was done; I saw a friend of mine and got a little in liquor; I after that met with a man whom I was acquainted with, his name is Cannan, a soldier, who persuaded me to do this thing; I came to the door that night, he bid me take it away, I being a little in liquor was easily persuaded, brought it out, when he was gone. The door shut too and I could not get in again with it, so I went to his house; his wife brought a hammer and open'd it.</p>

            . I live in St. Martin's-le-grand. I have known the prisoner about two years and half. He came first to me through an acquaintance of mine, a brother of his who is now in Jamaica. I knew the prisoner when he was with Mr. Waite. He went down to Galway in Scotland about nine or ten months ago, I believe with a design to have staid there, but one Mr. Curry of that town sent up his son, who brought the prisoner up along with him; he applied to me to get him into some business in town. This was some time about last April.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you stop to drink by the way?</p>
               <p>Mullings. I did not, I had nothing but a 6 d. in my pocket. She began to make a great noise; said I, take the 6 d. and give me the 3 d. she went off, I never saw her more till the 4th of this month; then she came to my door and knocked, I opened it, she told me it was six o'clock, she had not been there a minute before the clock struck seven, [this was in the morning ] she came in, I insisted upon her going out of the room; she said she was come to make a return for running away with my 6 d. I told her she might go about her business; then she insisted upon my going to drink a dram with her; I said I never drank a dram in a morning; she said you shall; I said no; I dressed myself; my wife was out of town; I bid the prisoner go about her business, and turned her out of doors; then I never saw her again, till I saw her at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. I am wife to the prosecutor. I was nursing a gentlewoman that was sick ; I had been out ten days; I happened to come home that Thursday morning; my husband says she was in with him; I found my door broke open, it had been double locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the whole house?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. Only a lower room; the house is let out in tenements ; I found the staple burst out, and a looking-glass was broke with forcing the door open. I went into the room; my neighbour told me the prisoner (naming her name) had come out of my room dressed in a white gown, with a great bundle in her hand before her.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention what goods were lost.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. There were a blue silk gown, a white gown, a quilted petticoat, two linen aprons, a red short cloak, a shift which she has on her back, four caps (the goods were produced in court) I went to the brandy shop near Newgate, and gave it out there I had been robbed; from thence I went to my husband and told him my room was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. He was at work in Lime-street; this was about a quarter before eight in the morning; my husband gave me the key of the door, he had that in his pocket. I went the same night to Newington-green ; then there was a porter came to me and told me the prisoner was taken; I came to town again; we took her out of the Compter, and carried her to Goldsmith's-hall, and from thence to Guildhall. Some of the things were found upon her, and she told us the other things were at Harris's in St. Bride's-lane. She had on a white gown, a linen cap, and a white quilted petticoat. The constable went with me to St. Bride's-lane, there I found the blue silk gown, six yards of fustian, and a white linen apron.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you lock the door when you went out?</p>
               <p>Mullings. I did, my lord, and had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. I live in Crown-court, Butcher-hall-lane. On the fourth of this month I saw Mr. Mullings go out about seven o'clock, and about half an hour after I saw the prisoner go out dressed in a white gown, a red cloak, and a bundle in a handkerchief, she carried it before her.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time was it betwixt Mr. Mullings and the prisoner's going out?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. It was a full half hour, that I am very sure of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170010"/>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor said he was a barber and perriwig-maker. I am an unfortunate girl; he carried me home, and gave me that white gown; if it is the same, it is dagged at the tail [she takes it up and looks on it] it is the same ; he gave me a silk gown, and two yards of fustian ; he lay by himself; he has carried me home nights after nights, and I have lain with him; he desired me to carry these things to pawn to Mr. Harris's, in Bride's-lane, which I did for 8 s. That milk-woman saw me carry them out, and the gown he put on my back. He broke a glass in pulling them down; then he locked me in; I was there four hours; then I took a poker and drew the staple and let myself out. This is true, and there are no witnesses on his side or mine. I have been with him a great many and a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you give the prisoner any of these things?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, my lord, I never did; the looking-glass was hanging up when I went out.</p>

            . I was on the top of the cart that the prosecutor drove. The prisoner came up to him and said, d - n you, stand, and give me your money. Foscue said he had but a few half-pence ; then the prisoner d - d him and said, I'll have your coat, or I'll shoot you dead (I think he said he'd shoot him dead three times over) then Foscue called out to me; I came down to his assistance, I did not know which was uppermost; but when I came to them the prisoner was underneath; we secured him, and took him to Paddington. The prisoner said nothing daunted him more than when Foscue called out to me; we charged a constable with him, searched him, and found a knife in his pocket, but neither the bag nor money. Here is a witness here who went back to the place and found the bag and a vial, which the prisoner owned; he said the stuff in it was to black the stick and make it shine like a gun. The prisoner desired I would hang him up without carrying him any farther, saying, he knew he should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his hand in the prosecutor's pocket?</p>
               <p>Hargood. It was too dark to see that; we carried him before justice Fielding, and he was committed. When he was at the house at Paddington, he said if that blow had hit Foscue he'd never have known who hurted him.</p>
               <p> - Price. I went back with a candle and lanthorn to the place where he was taken, not far from Paddington. The prisoner had had some flower in his bosom, for by tumbling about it came out and lay upon the ground, near which I found the purse and four-pence halfpenny; there were two farthings among it. I found likewise a vial, which the prisoner owned to be his, in which he kept oil for his piece, he being a soldier. The purse was open.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Was your purse open?</p>
               <p>Foscue. It was, my lord.</p>
               <p>Price. It was found near the three mile stone: there was too much dust and gravel in the road, we could find no more money.</p>

When we were at Paddington the prosecutor was complaining how he went to strike at him; the prisoner made answer, if that blow had hit you, you had never been here to have told who hurted you.

            . On the 22d of September, about three o'clock in the morning, I was going to my cows that lie at grass at Kilbourne, I had my man and a great dog with me; I heard a cart stop in the road, and by hearing some words I thought the cart was in the ditch; we went on and heard words increase; said I, it is either a cart in a ditch or a robbery. I heard one say get down, get down, he says he'll shoot me, so we ran on; when we came there the soldier was down, and crying out for mercy. I asked what was the matter; the countryman said, this man has robbed me, telling me the same he has here. I bid them take him to Paddington, and charge the constable with him. I thought the soldier had drank a little that morning; he desired they would not use him ill, and said, he would not run away, saying, he knew he should be hanged, and wanted them to hang him up then. He said his life was a misery to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live at the Turk's-head near Clerkenwell-green; my father lives at Kingsbury-green in Middlesex; I was going to see him. I set out between 12 and one in the morning, I was a small matter in liquor; I had a piece of link in my hand to light myself as far as Marybone, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170012"/> it went out. I went through Paddington, and between that and Kilbourne in the road I met this man, and push'd against him; he struck me; I made a return as soon as I could; that mop-stick I had in my hand to keep me from falling; in the fight I lost that bottle out of my pocket, and the man said he lost his money. I am as innocent of robbing the man as the child unborn, I was much beat and abus'd. Said I, you had better hang me outright, than use me so. They said, they did not fear hanging me for the reward.</p>

Mr. Sparks, whom I was shaving, has got the things, and was to have been here as an evidence, but he is engag'd at this time; the prisoner fell on her knees, and ask'd me to forgive her; I ask'd her how she could go up into other people's apartments in such a manner? she said it was necessity that drove her to it, she and her child wanting bread. She offer'd me a shilling for a dozen of beer to let her go, saying, her father was a very honest man in the neighbourhood.</p>

Then I told him the third yard was not paid for, said he, you are quite right; then he paid me for that; then he turn'd about to John and said, well John, I think I shall ruin myself in buying ribbons ; no sir, said I, four or five ribbons will not do that; no no, said John, master, if you lay out that, you know where to get more; said he, now my hand is in, I'll buy you a ribbon John for your wife; master, said he, you are joaking with me, what should she do with that? There lay a white pair of cotton stockings by, said he, I had rather you'd buy me such a pair of stockings as they are; while he was disputing what colour to buy, I shew'd him brown, scarlet, one colour after another; then he left it to me to chuse what colour to buy for the man's wife. At the same time my husband came in, who saw the prisoner put some ribbons in his pocket; he said to him, friend, that piece of ribbon you have put into your pocket, is not your own; the prisoner said, d - mn you for a villain, I have none but what I paid for; my husband put his hand into his pocket, and took out these two pieces of ribbon; they were produc'd in court, one of scarlet, the other green; one was 9 or 10 yards long, the other 18. I was doubling up the 4 yards he had bought at that time, he had paid me for them, but I had not delivered them to him; the prisoner strove to get away from my husband, he draw'd him as far as the street door; then he swore d - mn you for a villain, if you don't let me go, I'll kill you on the spot; then he took out a long knife from his left side, and open'd it over my husband's head ; when I saw that, I cry'd out, for Christ's sake let him go. He cut my husband over the eye, and cross the nose; I was so affrighted I saw no more; he got away, and our neighbours pursu'd, and took him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor; on the 8th of Aug. about 2 o'clock I was coming home, I saw this man at the compter, and another staid at the door; I being in a red coat they might not imagine I belong'd to the shop; he at the door did not get out of the way to let me in, so I went to the other door, and came through my parlour, the parlour door faces the compter. At coming into the shop, the first sight I saw, was the prisoner putting a piece of green ribbon into his pocket, in the inside his coat under his right arm, which he took from off the compter; I went up to him, he made me a bow; I told him what he had put there was not his, but my property; he d - n'd me for a villain, and said, he had none but what he had paid for; then the servant ran away, and we saw him no more. I took out two pieces from that pocket, one green, the other scarlet, and flung them on the compter, while we scuffled together; said I, you have more in your pocket, and you shall not go away with them; he swore he would murder me, and endeavoured to get away; he took a knife out of his last hand pocket, and gave me this cut on my forehead; the scar was just above the eyebrows, about 2 inches long. I was blind for 5 days; then he d - n'd me again, but I laid hold then on his shoulder, then he gave me a cut on my left hand and disabled me. It was a long cut down the back of his hand; by the scar it seem'd as though it had went through, into the palm of his hand; and in the hualing, the palm was draw'd together. My surgeon is now in court, who computed I had lost a gallon of blood from these wounds. I belong to the army, but now am not capable of doing duty more; he got away, I call'd out stop thief; many of my neighbours went in pursuit of him.</p>

Last Friday morning he breakfasted in my house, and he kept close in all day; his partners went out and came in again, one of them called for some beer, I carried them a pot of beer; they began to quarrel; they knocked one another down, and drove one another about. Coppinger, it seems, had got up stairs, and got this box and money away; then he went out and came again with a watchman without his hat, and said he had been knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the box?</p>
               <p>Flannigin. No, my lord, I did not see him take it; the room was broke open, I looked about and found the prisoner; after I found I had been robbed, and charged him with the watchman, he turned out his money, there was a silver 3 d. that was in my box, fell upon the floor; he denied he ever had such a piece in his custody. I took him at the Rose-and-Crown in St. Giles's Church-lane. I never could see O'Brian from that time to this, or any of his gang.</p>

I went to bed about 11. Some time after my master called me and said the box was gone; after this the prisoner was brought into our house, and the 3 d. found, it dropped from him in searching him; my mistress made a 3 or a 4 upon it with a pin because she would know it, when she put it on the child's neck; I fetched this 3 d. from a pawnbroker's once in Denmark-street, it was a King William and Queen Mary's 3 d. I carried it to a pawnbroker with 5 s. in halfpence; after that my mistress said, go back and fetch the 3 d. I'll keep that for the child's neck, he looked into the box and gave it me.

            . I am foreman to Mr. Delamare; on the 3d of Sept. last the prisoner came to our shop along with Mr. Rottenbury, who is my master's journeyman; this man brought a letter to Rottenbury, to help him to a man where he could buy such goods, so he brought him to my master's, so they both together chose the goods, which were green, and pink-colour'd; I said, the price of the pink was 12 s. and 6 d. an ell; the green 12 s. the prisoner told me if I'd carry them to the 3 Cups in Bread-street, there was a gentlewoman there, would give me the money for them, or I should carry them back again; then I acquainted Mr. Delamare with what pass'd between us, and I desir'd he'd cast it up for me; I told him the length of the pieces; my master cast it up, and gave me the paper in my hand; he wrote, so many ells came to 45 l. 8 s. my master bid me take care of myself, for he did not half like the man. Then I went to the back warehouse again, and put the two pieces into a bag, and carried them to the 3 Cups with the prisoner. When we came there, he said the gentlewoman was not come from dinner, and desir'd me to wait a little time; we went into the Tap-house, I laid my two pieces down upon the table, and sat dow n near it, he sat down on the other side of the table, and call'd for a glass of wine. Then I had not sold the goods to him, and he had told me going along, he had nothing to do with the goods, the gentlewoman was to pay me for them, if she lik'd them. As I was waiting for this lady, he took them up hastily, and went away so quick, that I had not time to run after him. I ran without my hat to the corner of the street, but could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing when he took up the goods?</p>
               <p>Freemont. I think he said, I'll go and shew them to the lady. He did not ask me leave.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say when he took them up?</p>
               <p>Freemont. I said, I would not have my goods tumbled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mean he should carry the goods to the lady, and you to walk by?</p>
               <p>Freemont. Yes, if he did not go so fast; he was so quick upon me I had not time to speak.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in that room together?</p>
               <p>Freemont. About a quarter of an hour; he sat and read the news.</p>
               <p>This evidence allowing, he was willing the prisoner should carry the goods had he not went so fast away; it did not appear to be such a taking and carrying away as lodg'd in the indictment, so he was acquitted, and an indictment order'd to be prefer'd against him for a fraud.</p>

On the 13th of August last, about five in the afternoon, my wife rang the bell, I came down, the prisoner said, your servant, sir; said he, I was here some time ago to buy a few handkerchiefs, but I had no money then; but now if you and I can bargain, I'll lay out 10 or 15 l. with you; then I reached out some goods in order to shew him; he said, let me see some of your best, I shewed him as good as any I had; he asked me the price, I said, sir, you know silk is risen, and they cannot be bought at the former price, said I; I must have 46 shillings per dozen, for these goods: said he, I cannot say but they are very good; Can't you bate something? I said no; he said, take two pieces out, a dozen of a piece? then he took half a dozen of another parcel; then ten handkerchiefs from another parcel; which were all the goods, 3 dozen and 4 handkerchiefs. Said he, I wish you would be quick, for my horse and wife are at the King's Arms, and make a little bit of a memorandum of them, for my wife is a better judge than I am, and I hope what she don't like you will take back again. I tied them up in a handkerchief; said I, if you will excuse me 5 or 6 minutes I'll bring them myself; he turn'd about and look'd at the clock, and said, my wife and I should have been at another place; I wish you'd let your wife go. Said I, I had rather go myself; he said again, let your wife go; my wife took them under her arm, and the prisoner went along with her to Mr. Wood's at the King's Arms; I went no further than the door.</p>

Upon Mr. Hill's demanding the money, I told him I had just paid it to one Elizabeth Davis; upon which he gave for answer, he was very sensible, if there was another power of attorney, it must be a forg'd one; I desired him to go to Mr. Tiscoe's, and if she had not been there to stop her; about one o'clock she came there to receive the money; Mr. Hillwas there; the letter she brought was read in court, signed

            . I had been merry-making with a ship-mate; coming home between twelve and one, between the 6th and 7th of May, the prisoner picked me up in Cable-street, and carried me into Carlow's house; she asked me to go to bed; I said, yes; accordingly she got a Candle, and we both went up stairs: said she, pull off your cloaths; I laid my cloaths on the bed, and my breeches under my head; we both went to bed immediately; after that I went to sleep. I had 10 guineas, and half a crown in my pocket, when I went into the room; I had told it that very same evening; I awaked between 4 and 5 o'clock, and look'd about, and found the prisoner was gone. I put my hand under the pillow, and felt my breeches, but the purse and money was gone; then I went to feel in the right hand pocket, and the half-crown was gone; so I had nothing but 3 or 4 pennyworth of halfpence left; I told the man of the house of it, he was much affrighted, and said he would not rest till he found her; he found her two days after, she was carried before Justice Manwaring, and sent to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was she not tried before now?</p>
               <p>Wittnell. The evidence was out of the way, and I was very ill; so I could not find the bill before; she was then discharg'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your money again?</p>
               <p>Wittnell. I never saw purse or money since; after I got well, and a little money, I thought proper to take her up, to do myself and my country justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk at this time?</p>
               <p>Wittnell. I was not, nor near it.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said, he was coming from Ratcliff Cross at this time; that he did not fall in with any other company; that Carlow never applied to him since, about the prisoner.</p>

She laid the watch down, and the shoe, and did not take the buckles; she said she was a-dry, and ask'd me to go with her, which I did, as far as White Lyon-street, almost a quarter of a mile from Carlow's house; she shew'd me a little purse, tied with two strings, with 5 guineas, and a new half crown in it; she said, if he did not pay her, she'd make bold to pay herself; and told me, as I was bare of cloaths, she would take me to Monmouth-street, and buy me a gown.</p>
               <p>On her cross Examination she said, she never saw any harm in Carlow's house; she had seen men and women go to bed together there; that since this affair there has been a prosecution against the house, for a disorderly one; that Carlow apply'd to her, to be an evidence now; and that the prisoner had been an evidence against Carlow, in the other prosecution.</p>

He call'd the other person Bourne; then he call'd for some oysters; he had a halfpenny worth of bread,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170020"/> and paid for it; then he call'd for some gin to treat a lodger of our's; then he ask'd Bourne if he'd drink any more; then he said, bring a pint of beer, and half a quartern of rum, and put them into the tankard; it was a silver 3 pint tankard; he gave me a shilling, and I gave him change. I went into the bar; all the company that had been in that room, but themselves, were gone; then I saw Bourne go out with a pipe in his mouth, about half an hour after nine o'clock; after he was gone, I saw the tankard standing upon the end of the table; then I was call'd into another room to take my reckoning; I staid about five minutes; when I came out again, the prisoner and the tankard were gone; they had had three reckonings, the time they had been there; I search'd directly for the tankard, but could not find it. When the young man came that had drank a dram with him, I ask'd him if he knew the prisoner; he told me a house where he us'd to drink, at the Blue Anchor, in Goodmans-fields ; I went there the next morning, the man said he had not been there for a fortnight, but directed me to the Crown and Thistle in Ailoffe-street. I went and got a warrant, and constable; he was taken there, and brought to the Red Lyon, in Red Lyon street; there I was sent for; he was taken before Justice Rickards, but would not confess any thing.</p>

I left five people in the house when I went out; particularly one was a constable. The next day they came to me at the Black Lyon in Ailoffe-street ; Mr. Harding came up first, and wanted me to make it up; and said, if I would not, he'd swear against me; I knew he was no friend of mine. I saw the constable coming towards me, I had been inform'd Mr. Newman at the Anchor and Crown had a warrant against me; so upon my seeing them I ran, and Mr. Harding came, and laid hold of me.</p>

            . On the 9th of September last, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor was coming up Saffron-hill, Pryor clapped a pistol to his head ; they demanded his money; the prosecutor took his money out, and Odel took it of him. Buridge catched hold of his collar and d - d him, and said he would have his handkerchief; the gentleman said it was not worth taking, so he let it alone. I stood on one side and took his wig and gave him mine; I saw no copper, only three shillings.</p>

            . On the 5th of this month I was coming from Kensington to London, I went into a publick house and drank two or three pints of beer, this woman happened to be in the same house; dropping into company I staid longer than ordinary; I pulled my money out at that house and said I was going to London to buy me a new hat; I went from thence to the halfway house betwixt that place and Knightsbridge; there I drank part of two or three pints of beer; finding myself a little later than ordinary I had a mind to go back again ; I went back again to the house in Kensington where I came from; there I put my hand into my pocket for my bag and half guinea, but could find neither; the landlord was gone out; the prisoner came in with the bag and half guinea; I can swear to the bag; she was in company with me when I lost it, and when I came back the pretended to go along with me to take care of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you count you lost it?</p>
               <p>Saunders. between eight and nine o'clock at night; then she gave me the drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the woman put her hand towards your pocket?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to be thus long in your company?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I cannot tell that, I never saw her in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I was very sober.</p>
               <p>James Hill. I keep the Thistle and Crown at Kensington. This woman works in the king's ground; the prosecutor came into my house to drink a pint of beer, and she came to ask my wife to trust her for a halfpenny worth of gin; the man owed me a shilling, over night he pulled out a bag with a half guinea and some silver in it; I saw him put the bag into his pocket before he went out of my house. After that I went to Smithfield; when I came home this woman came into my house and asked for a pint of hot; my wife went and made it; then she wanted change for a half guinea; some of my lodgers said, such a man was robbed of a half guinea on the road; I locked the door and kept her in custody, and sent for the prosecutor; he came; we sent for a constable and searched her and found this purse upon her (it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170024"/> produc'd in court, the prosecutor depos'd to it: in the struggle the half guinea fell from her; but we never saw it after that; before the Justice she said, she found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober when he went out of your house, to go towards London?</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe he was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in that gentleman's house; I call'd for a pennyworth of beer, but I never drank with the man; I was coming along towards Knightsbridge ; this man came along and said, dame will you go and drink? I said, I had no money; he gave me part of three pints of beer, and a quartern of gin; then he insisted on my going back with him again, to see him safe home ; going along, he wanted to lie with me; he wanted to give me some money, and I would not take it; and after the struggle, I found this bag in the high road.</p>

             was committed by Justice Fielding, as an outlaw'd smuggler; upon this commitment he was put into a room in the Press-yard, which I thought to be as well secured as any place in the goal; there were double bars at each window. He escap'd from me the 23d of August last. When we came to be alarm'd of it, about 2 o'clock in the morning, we found the bars of the window cut; one of them was produc'd in court; it seem'd to be done with a watch-spring saw. Clark and the prisoner at the bar were both gone; we found the machine fix'd with two wooden screws to the window where they got out; the machine were pieces of wainscot about nine inches long; each piece fitted with a half round into the next, where was a hollow to receive it, as the edge of a folding table, screw'd together through plates of iron, with four nuts on the opposite side, so secured as to make it stiff and stronger than a solid plank; the other end of it had a cushion fixed to it, so lowered down upon a neighbouring house; then they tied some sheeting and blanketing cut in long slips together, and fastened them to the window-bar, and carried it quite over the top of this house, so let-themselves down by it into Phoenix-Court, which comes into Newgate Street. Mr. Ackerman paid the reward for the re-taking the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't desire to give the court any farther trouble, I am guilty of it, I assisted in putting the machine out of the window, and cut the sheets and tied the pieces together.</p>

             and Little John in Broad St. Giles's, and kept what we call in the vulgar tongue, a bawdy house, a night house for all sorts of people whatsoever. The first time I went in tansiently as I passed by to have a pint of beer, I knew nothing of him at that time; I happened (to tell the truth, my lord) to meet with a sweetheart there, so I went there several times after that; sometimes I staid all night, as he furnished me with a bed and female bedfellow. There were ladies of all tastes, both for soldiers and sailors. One time I had but a shilling, and some halfpence about me. I told him I did not want to wrong him, telling him what I had about me; he said, don't mind that, you shall not want liquor; there came in a young gentleman, about 5 feet 11 inches high, dressed well, with velvet breeches, a large hat, with a feather in it, silk stockings turn'd up his knees; he was pleas'd to call me a clever young fellow; I did not think I was, till such time he told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first time of your going there?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, sir, this was after I had been there several times; about the 4th or 5th of June the prisoner ask'd me how I lik'd the guards; before I belong'd to the guards, I belong'd to the regiment lately commanded by General

            ; said he, I remember when any of the guards get into trouble, they stand a chance to be whip'd by a cat o'ninetails; said I, so they do very often, but I never was whip'd with a cat o'ninetails yet; said he, I can put you into a better way of living; 4 s. 6 d. per week does not go a great way in London, without a man has a trade, or some other way of getting money, besides his pay; said he, you had better take a little of my advice, and go where I desire you to go, it will be to your profit. Said I, I'll go; where is it? said he, if you'll go into the French service, you cannot be liable to any punishment, without you be a thief, or a rogue; but for getting drunk, or a little small fault, he is never punish'd. I went to bed then; the next morning he ask'd me some more questions; said he, I'll tell you how it is, I can get you out of these guards; said I, if you put me into a better way I'll hear it; he shew'd me about 14 or 15 different coats, some marines; some soldiers, of marching regiments ; said he, go down to Dover, to the sign of the city of Calais, and I'll send a guide along with you; there you shall be kindly receiv'd by two persons, Russel, and Purcel, but the principal was this Purcel; Russel kept the house, and Purcel was one that was prosecuted last Assizes ; said I, I cannot go out of London with my regimental cloaths on; said he, I'll give you a frock, and a hat; leave your's with me; which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree with him to go?</p>
               <p>Carnes. I did, I was to have 25 crowns paid me at this sign of the city of Calais.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon this set out?</p>
               <p>Carnes. Yes, sir, I did, and a guide which he sent along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this guide?</p>
               <p>Carnes. It was a lady; I deliver'd my coat, waistcoat, and hat, to him, and we set out pretty early in the morning, the 13th of June; she had money plenty of the prisoner, to carry me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Carnes. She told me so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170027"/>Q. Did you see the prisoner give her any ?</p>
               <p>Carnes. She shewed me gold, and I saw him give her money for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, he did not; he gave me victuals and drink in plenty. She went down along with me as far as Sandwich in Kent. The prisoner gave me advice, when I went out of London, not to pass any of the great towns but in the night, for he said he had several times gone down there with the French ambassador's livery upon him, and passed back in the night time with persons to go to serve in lord Ogleby's regiment in the French service. When I got to Sandwich, then I began to think of the evil I had done; I left my female guide there, and went right on to Dover-Castle, where there were two companies of Scotch Fuzileers, and I went to a relation of mine, whose name is Hope, and told him what I had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go into the town of Dover?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, I did not, the Castle is out of the town; I went also to a serjeant-major of the Scotch Fuziliers, and told him I belonged to the third regiment of foot-guards commanded by the earl of Dunmore. I desired him to write back to the regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider well; did you agree with the prisoner to go and enter into the French service?</p>
               <p>Carnes. I did agree with him so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he gave you liquor? did he give you that to encourage you to undertake this?</p>
               <p>Carnes. It was for no other intent. The woman bore all my expences, I was not one farthing out of pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in going to Sandwich?</p>
               <p>Carnes. We lay three nights by the way; one place where we lay was about half way betwixt this and Rochester, 15 miles from London.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the woman's name?</p>
               <p>Carnes. I don't know that, she was one of his ladies that attended the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had the money, she bore your charges withal, of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carnes. His intent of giving her the money was in case I had been taken up, then I might say I never received a farthing of money from him; this was to keep him free of the law. He told me on our setting out she had plenty, and I should not want either victuals or drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he told you this ?</p>
               <p>Carnes. He told me so a great many times, and when we went out of his house in the morning, after we had drank two hot pots together, he opened the door, and wished all good fortune, and said don't be afraid, this woman has money enough, and when you come there you shall have money enough; so we went on together, and passed as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree with him, or was you to agree with Purcel ?</p>
               <p>Carnes. I agreed with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How happen'd it you went first into the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Carnes. As I might in any other house in Lon don.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know it was a bawdy house?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, not at first going in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he begin this conversation, at your first going there?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, not till I had been there three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for the sake of your nymph, or the prisoner's conversation, you went there?</p>
               <p>Carnes. It was to lie with the several young women that were there, that made me go three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose expence was you entertain'd there?</p>
               <p>Carnes. The first time it was at my own expence; the second and third times, it was at part my own, and part some of the female sex, that were there; and after that by his expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never run on tick there?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any letter of recommendation to Purcel?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, none at all; I had no writing, but the woman had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been conversant with her before you set out?</p>
               <p>Carnes. Yes, sir, I had 5 or 6 times before; but I was as free with other women at his house, as with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is she now?</p>
               <p>Carnes. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever your own regimentals again?</p>
               <p>Carnes. Yes, sir, the serjeant of the company that I belong to, went to the prisoner's house, and brought this coat I have on; he had my ammunition waistcoat there, out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a wife?</p>
               <p>Carnes. Yes, sir, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you pawn your hat?</p>
               <p>Carnes. No, sir, I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife pawn it?</p>
               <p>Carnes. That wife was one of the prisoner's own producing; I deliver'd it into the prisoner's hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170028"/>Q. What did you do with your arms and accoutrements ?</p>
               <p>Carnes. I left them in my quarters; the prisoner said, suppose you should meet any soldiers on the road, you had better cut your hair off. He also desired me to bring my firelock, arms, and accoutrements to him, and he knew a safe way to send them over; said I, that is death without mercy, I'll never dispose of his Majesty's arms; he called me fool, saying, he knew which way to convey them safe over, and that he had conveyed pieces of the Tower arms over before then.</p>

               <p>Templestone. He went away for some time. We began to enquire after him; we had intelligence by some people who had seen him at the prisoner's house; I went there and took two or three more people with me, and enquired if he knew

I would have sent them to the people they belong to had I known where to send; so he went and brought me Carnes's coat and waistcoat, the hat he denies. Carnes said he left the hat there, and I believe I have an evidence here that knows it was left there; the prisoner said Carnes lodged some nights in his house, and told me he was gone out a hay-making with a woman.</p>

            . On last Saturday morning, coming along Radcliff Highway, I saw the prisoner and another person walking together; the other person had a bag on his shoulder; by the appearance of them I imagined the goods were stolen, and so followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this?</p>
               <p>Harris. It was betwixt eight and nine o'clock; I observed them to carry this bag into the house of one Macdaniel, a chandler's shop in Rag-fair; they came out again together in about two minutes time; I passed by the door about ten yards to see the event, and there made a stand; I saw them both go into a publick house over the way; I went up to Mr. Macdaniel and said, I hope you are not concerned in the merchant's goods, pray who are the two persons which brought these goods into your house? said he, I know one of them very well; then he called out Dodd, (the prisoner at the bar) who came out; Mr. Macdaniel crossed the way to him and said, pray what goods have you brought into my house, you are the person that brought them in, for I know nothing of the other man; then I took hold on the prisoner and said, I have watched you some time giving him a detail of the matter; said he, I know nothing of this thing; then he wanted me to go to another publick house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170029"/>Q. What house did he come out of?</p>
               <p>Harris. He came out of the Gun and Hollybush, and wanted to go into the Coach and Horses in the Tower liberty; said I, I insist upon keeping you here till I can send for a proper officer; but before one came, there came a neighbour, and he and Macdaniel did engage to keep him whilst I looked for the goods; I went, and in the back part of the house I found these goods. (They were produced in court according to the indictment.) It is the same bag they were carried in, that I am certain of. After the prisoner was taken in charge I had him before alderman Bethel, there he acknowledged he was the person that was intrusted to sell the goods, and that he had them that morning at a publick house at Rotherhith, I think the sign of the George.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard since whose goods they are?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I have not; I advertised them, but have not had any intelligence of an owner?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When he took me he asked me what business I had with them goods; I said they were honestly come by; said he, I'll know that; he brought me and left me in the Compter, and went to alderman Bethel, and had a commitment made ready to send me to goal immediately; said I to alderman Bethel, these goods were sold to me, I agreed with Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Wright, I am to give them so much for them; I asked them if they were honestly come by; they said they were, and that no hurt should come to me; they have attended every day this week, and are now hard by; they told me if I would send any body for them when there was occasion, they would come and give their evidence here in court.</p>

               <p>Evans. No, sir, she lived with me as a servant, her maiden name was Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you yourself declared that that woman was your wife, and you received her as such in company, and it has so passed?</p>
               <p>Evans. I cannot say I have to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, or have you not?</p>
               <p>Evans. I don't know that I have; she has said often I was her husband.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known her?</p>
               <p>Evans. I have known her these five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know her to live in the house of Mr. May?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you prefer a bill for a misdemeanour at Westminster against Mr. Kelso, only for receiving those goods as knowing them to be stolen?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes, sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that bill?</p>
               <p>Evans. It was thrown out; but I have found the right of it out since that.</p>

               <p>Ferguson. I remember in the year 39 I stopped the prisoner at the bar and one Foster at the Hen and Chickens door in the Minories, they had got about 60 pounds of tobacco; we took them to the watchhouse; the prisoner said he was a sailor and would give us two or three hands of tobacco; I told him my constable was a very good gentleman, and he must go and speak to him; the constable put the prisoner out of the door and two or three of us to take care of him; then Foster wanted to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170026"/> make himself an evidence, and said they had taken the tobacco out of a hogshead at Summer's-Key; they were both tried here for that fact in the year 39; I don't know the day of the month, nor the month neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what time of the year it was?</p>
