I did not miss any thing - I pursued him, and followed him about twenty yards, and never lost sight of him; when I came up to him he threw the basket at me, and said"take it." He was secured before I lost sight of him. The check was in the basket-it was taken from the window, and must have been taken by a person within the shop. I did not see him take it.</p>

On the 13th of May, about three o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner, with a bundle, near the Platform, at Rotherhithe - I asked him where he was going to take it; he said they were clothes that he was going to take to a woman whose husband worked in the Docks. I asked him where he brought them from, he said from his lodgings at Deptford, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210006"/>that he had been stopped before, and when the watchman had examined his bundle he let him go. I searched him, and found the articles stated in the indictment - He had two shawls concealed under his shirt. The ship laid in Middlesex.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of May I met the prosecutor in Aldersgate-street. From the description he gave of the woman, I went in pursuit of the prisoner, knowing her before. I took him to Golden-lane - She was standing at the corner of George-yard, talking to two other women. We passed her about two yards-the prosecutor turned round, and immediately pointed her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210008"/>out, saying, she was the woman who had robbed him. I said nothing to him, on purpose that he should identify her himself. I secured her, and asked her if she knew him-she said she never saw him before. I asked her if she should know him if he was dressed in his uniform - She said she never saw him before. I found 3s. on her. The man who lived with her has absconded. The prosecutor described her as short, plain, having only one eye, red hair, and being very hoarse. He was quite sober. There was a gas-light opposite the door.</p>

            . I am the porter. On Thursday morning, the 10th of April, I was sent to sweep out the counting-house - I found the door unlocked, and the desks wide open. I immediately locked the door, and took the keys down to Beetham, who went back and found it as he has described-the lock had been picked.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEETHAM. I double-locked the counting-house door at ten o'clock at night; I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>WALTER STONE. I am an officer. On the 10th of April I was on duty in Tower-street. The prisoner, in company with two other men, passed me about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning. I followed them into Fenchurch-street; the prisoner crossed over to Biliter-lane-the other two went to the right. I went up to the prisoner, and asked him what he had got; he said it was a pretty thing to ask him. I told him he must satisfy me before he went further. He said, if I stopped him it would be the worse for me. I told him he must satisfy me. I secured him, and took him back to Tower-street. He had a handkerchief in his hand, and a cash-box; a quantity of stamps, 4s. 11d. in copper, and 19s. 6d. in silver. I found seventeen skeleton keys in his pocket, a dark lanthorn, and two candles. He had a custom-house freeman's ticket in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

I looked very hard at him, and felt my pocket and walked on. When I had got some distance, I looked back, and saw him about twenty yards off. I walked on about thirty yards, and thought no more of him. I put my hand to my pocket, and found my handkerchief gone. I looked round but could not see him - I ran back, and overtook him at Puddle-dock; he was then going the reverse way - I stopped him, and asked him why he took my handkerchief - He denied it. I found it inside his coat, under his arm - He said he picked it up. It was a dirty day, but the handkerchief was quite clean.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live in Church-lane, Mile-end, New-town. I was at the White Hart at four o'clock in the afternoon; the landlord introduced me to the prisoner - the prisoner shewed me two colts - He asked me 9l. for the best - I did not think it worth that money; I bought the other of him for 3l. 2s. 6d. He said they belonged to his brother, who was in distress for rent. I asked him where they came from - He said he brought them from Cambridge, and if he could not sell them, they must go to Smithfield market. I asked him several questions - He did not seem to know any person at Cambridge. I told him to meet me at the Cherry Tree, and I would have an officer there, and if he did not come by them honestly, he had better not meet me. He came - I had an officer there, and he secured him. Yarrow came in about an hour after and claimed them. He still said they were his brother's. When he was being locked up, he said he lived at Aldgate - I found he did not live there.

               <p>Cross-examined. After he was taken, he said he was employed by a man to sell them, and if he could not, he was to meet him at Shoreditch about nine o'clock - I did not take him there. He said, a strange man overtook him, and asked him to sell them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody. The mares were delivered to me. He said they were given to him to take on the road by a man, and that he was to go on till the man overtook him. He said nothing about selling them.</p>

I was going to the Ship public-house, to see the landlady there - I was not in liquor; I went strait from home-it is about three miles from my house. I left home at seven o'clock, and met my brother at the Blue Lasts, and stopped an hour with him; we had only a pint of porter; when I left him, I went to the Ship, in Bacon-street. Before I got in, I was stopped by four or five men - I did not know them before. They hustled round me, and one of them drew my watch out of my pocket; I have never seen it since. I caught hold of the seal-the chain was broken in two, and they made off with the watch; the prisoner was one of them - I saw him again that evening. I had 18s. taken out of my breeches pocket at the same time, viz. two 3s. and eight 1s. 6d. pieces. The prisoner was the man that took my money - He was taken into custody at the time.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. It was not very light. I stopped at the public-house about an hour, or an hour and a half, with my brother. I stopped in the street about an hour with him before we went in. I am certain that I drank no more than a pint of porter. I went to the Ship, to see the landlady-there were a great many people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210011"/>there at the same time. When the men came up to me, they asked me to fight, and bustled me. I called out, and they made a noise to drown my voice. The prisoner was taken immediately after. I had changed a 1l. note at the public-house, and gave my brother 1s. 6d. The prisoner had his arms round me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CANEW. I live with a cow-keeper, and have lived in my place eight months. I was standing at my master's door, which is opposite the Ship; I saw a skirmish, went over, and saw the prisoner's arms round Warne's body-his arms were under his. I caught hold of him. I saw his hand near Warne's pocket - I will not say it was in it. I dragged him across the road into the public-house - He did not go willingly - He was searched. I did not hear Warne say how much he had lost before he was searched. He said he was robbed of his watch and money before the prisoner was searched. I do not remember his saying what was the amount of the money. - He said, the prisoner took his silver out of his breeches-pocket, but he did not know who took the watch. Turner searched him, and found two 3s. pieces and eight 1s. 6d. pieces on him. When the prisoner was charged with the robbery, he said we might search him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the money taken from the prisoner, he had only one penny about him beside-the prosecutor said he had lost his watch and silver; I did not hear him say any thing more. I have had no conversation with Warne about it - He has said nothing to me about a reward.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am an officer of Worship-street. On Friday, the 16th of May, I was passing the end of Bacon-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! I went to the Ship public-house, and found the prisoner in the custody of the last witness; I asked the prosecutor what he had lost, he said he had lost his watch and chain; after that I asked him if he had lost any thing else - He said he had lost his silver out of his pocket. Before I searched the prisoner, I asked him what money it was; he said, two 3s. and eight 1s. 6d. pieces. I searched the prisoner, and found two 3s. and eight 1s. 6d. pieces, in his breeches pocket, and one penny in his waistcoat pocket - I found no more silver on him. I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This was in the presence of Canew; he heard what he said, but may not recollect it - He was close to me; the prisoner was willing to be searched.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Mansfield-street. On Friday, the 16th of May, the prisoner came to me in the evening, about half-past six o'clock, and asked if he could sup and dine with me the next day, - being our Sabbath; I told him he could; he asked what he should give, I told him 2s.; he gave me a 1l. note, I gave him eight 1s. 6d. and two 3s. pieces in change, being 18s. I have known him from from his infancy, and never knew any thing dishonest of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you a relation of his - A. No; I heard of his being taken up on Saturday morning, between nine and ten o'clock; he supped with me on the Friday night at a little after seven o'clock, and stopped till near nine; I live about a mile from Bacon-street. My family supped with me-none of them went out with the prisoner; he lodged at my house, and slept there on Thursday night for the first time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER re-examined. Before I searched him I did not ask him what money he had about him-when I found it he did not say where he got it, there were five or six people in the room at the time. I am certain that Warne said what the money consisted of before I searched the prisoner. The prisoner said nothing about Fernando, nor did he say he had changed a 1l. note that night.</p>
               <p>JACOB FERNANDO re-examined. I had given change to several people in the early part of the day, but I do not recollect what I gave them; I had got rid of all my small silver, and had nothing but 1s. 6d. and 3s. pieces left.</p>
               <p>TURNER. Warne said there were several of them - He could not say who took the watch; I have got the seal and key. He said the prisoner was the man who took his money before I searched him.</p>

I took her back. I had not seen any little boy with her-there was no person with her.</p>

               <p>JOHN MANNING. I live in Hatton-court, Saffron-hill, and was a watchman. On the 13th of February, a man charged another with taking his seals - I found them in the kennel; the man did not appear, and the prisoner was discharged-the magistrate told me to keep them. I kept the ring in my pocket-the prisoner slept in the same bed with me, and several others slept in the same room; in the morning when I got up, I found the prisoner was gone out, and the ring and seal gone also; some days after, from what I had heard, I opened the prisoner's box, and found the duplicate of them - I went to Mr. Hill's and found the seal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I am not a watchman now; I was discharged because I could not produce this ring and seal. I lost the seal, I never pledged it - I pledged the ring. I found the duplicate in the prisoner's box.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Collins. On the 30th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise, and ran down stairs - A mob came round; as I was going to my back room I saw the prisoner taking my husband's watch-no other person came into the house. I called out stop thief, he ran out, and I followed him round Charles-square - He was stopped before he got out of my sight; I did not see him throw it down - He had not got it when he was stopped. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CHAPMAN. I heard the alarm and ran after the man; the prisoner was stopped in the square - He had no hat on; I picked a hat up, when a man sprung out from behind a tree, and asked me what I had picked up; I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said he would not run the risk of getting himself into trouble, and ran off. The prisoner said he had lost a hat. I picked the watch up.</p>

On the evening of the 7th of May, I had been to Cow-cross for Mr. Wright, with some medicine, as his boy was not at home. I was returning home through Moorfields. About a quarter after ten o'clock, as I was going by Old Bedlam, I heard some person following me. I turned round, and found it was the prisoner. He followed me about thirty yards.

It was a little while before I could speak. I then told him I had no money. He then said, "d-n you, where is your watch?" and stroked me down to feel for it. I had no watch about me. He felt in my coat pocket, and took my handkerchief out.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How did he do it - A. He let go my collar, and felt me down with that hand, and he held the knife in my face. I had a parcel in my pocket, and he took the handkerchief out of my pocket. While his eye was off me, I caught hold of the wrist of that hand which held the knife - I got hold of his collar with the other hand, and called out "watch!" loudly; it was a great while before the watchman came-when he got near us, the prisoner also called "watch!" twice-the watchman was an old man. I delivered him to his care, but still held him myself till another came up. I gave him in charge, and he made a charge against me; we took him to the watch-house, and there gave him in charge. I saw him searched-my handkerchief was not found on him, but the knife was found tucked down in his apron. In searching him, we found the flap of his breeches was open-upon that he charged me with indecency - He had not made any such charge before. On my oath I had not done any such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have been eight or nine years in London. I came from Otley, in Yorkshire; I am independent. I was a merchant at New York, and came from there thirteen years ago. I have lived in and about London eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210015"/>Q. How many prisons in London have you been in?</p>
               <p>Q. How many years is it since you were in the King's Bench - A. Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you in the Fleet - A. Never. The prisoner was quite a stranger to me. He had a dark apron on-it was a butcher's knife. I never asked the watchmen to go back and look for the handkerchief - I told them I had lost it, and that the prisoner had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, before he got to the watch-house, that you had lost your handkerchief - A. Yes, I did, and described it to be yellow. The place where I was robbed is about a quarter of a mile from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you say one single word about the knife to the watchman till you got to the watchhouse - A. Yes, I told the first watchman he had a knife, that he held it up to me, and robbed me of my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about a knife either before or in the watch-house, till one was found on the prisoner - A. I mean to swear I did tell the watchman as I was going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner called out "watch," and charged you with indecency upon his person, before you called out "watch" - A. It is not true. He did not call"watch" until we got to the watch-house. He had a butcher's jacket on. I know nothing about a reward.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did the prisoner first call out"watch" - A. As the watchman was coming up. I had called a dozen times before he called out once. He wanted to run away. We dragged one another full twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any pocket-book - A. No. I had a few shillings in my waistcoat pocket - He did not search that; he only put his hand into my coat pocket. I never found my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>CHARLES TURNER. I am a watchman. On the night of the 7th of May, about a quarter before eleven, I heard the cry of "watch." I suppose I heard it ten times before I could get up; it was called by two different voices-one called after the other. I came up to the prosecutor and prisoner, in Long-alley; they had hold of each other; the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, he did not say what for - He did not say what he had done - I took him to the watch-house directly; as they were going there nothing passed, not a word, either by the prosecutor or the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor, as he was going to the watchhouse, tell you that the prisoner had robbed him, and had a knife in his hand - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. My Lord, after this, I certainly cannot proceed any further in this prosecution.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the child after it had been found in the privy-it was in a very putrid state. I conceived it to be about a seven months' child. I cannot say whether it was or was not born alive-its nails were not perfect-that might be the case if it was born alive.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210017"/>Cross-examined by MR.PLATT. It is not common for seven months' children to be born dead-it would not have been in so putrid a state in that short time if it had been born alive.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOX. I am a nightman. On the 17th of April, I was employed to empty the privy, and found a child there, wrapped up in a petticoat, and had a piece of worsted about its neck-there was nothing particular in the manner in which it was wrapped up.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN HUMPHRIES. I live in New-street, Mile End. The prisoner, Thompson, lodged with me: she took the room, in my house, with her husband, and lodged with me about a month. On the 14th of April, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I went out, and returned about nine o'clock for something that I had forgot. Thompson let me in - She appeared in a flurry - I asked if she was ill-she said she was not; but the woman who had slept with her the evening before, had been taken ill. I told her she had better send her home, as she was not my lodger-she said she was in the yard - I went there, and saw her standing by the water butt-it was the prisoner, Cornwall, with a pot in her hand - She seemed as if she was in great pain - I told her she was in labour, but she said, that she was not. I told her to go to her own home, as she did not lodge in my house - I asked Thompson if the woman was not in labour - She said there was not any thing at all that ailed her, only that she had caught a cold, and had been poorly in the night, which occasioned her to be in that state. Cornwall said she was going, and desired me not to talk harshly to her - She went away, and I saw no more of her - I followed Thompson up into her room-from what I saw there, I told her, that the woman had been in labour, when she replied, that it was not so - I went out, and came home about half-past five o'clock - I then went to the privy, and found it nearly full - I saw something had been thrown down, and told my husband of it - He went out, and found nothing there but some horse-hair - We went in search of Thompson, and found her in George-yard, Whitechapel - I asked her what was become of the young woman who was ill in the morning; she replied, that she had gone into the workhouse - I asked whether she was not in labour, and she replied, that the doctor was of opinion, that it was no such thing-my husband asked her who had thrown the horse-hair down the privy, and she replied, that it was herself - He said he hoped there was nothing else there-she left our house the next day - I saw the prisoners at the workhouse on the Friday morning-Cornwall was in bed-she called me to the bed-side, and told me, that the child was not alive when she threw it there-that was all I heard, there being so much noise. I said,"Sally, was the child alive?" and she answered me, No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. If she had been ill in the night, I must have heard it.</p>

On the 5th of April, I was sent for, and saw the prisoner in the kitchen - I asked what was the matter with her-she sat for some moments before she gave me an answer, and then gave me a key, telling me to open her box, and I should find a child - I did so, and found it was there-it had nothing over it.</p>

As I receive my money in the day, I put it into a cash-box, which, at night, I keep up stairs under my bed - I take an account of what I receive at nigh (reads)."On the 28th of March, I had 8l. 7s. in silver, 1l. 8s. in copper, and thirty 1l. bank notes." On the 29th of March I had occasion to pay 7l. - I brought my cash-box down about half-past ten o'clock in the morning - I took out 6l. or 7l., but did not count it then. About twelve o'clock, a person called for some money - I opened the box, counted the money, and found I was 8l. deficient, 6l. in notes, and the rest in silver. I accused my shopman of it, and discharged him - I did not suspect the prisoner - I had marked my notes before I put them into the box - I believe I marked them all - I marked those which were stolen. In consequence of something that took place on the 12th of May, I went to Mr. Scovell's, to whom, I understood, a payment had been made, and received five 1l. notes of him (I produce them). They have my mark on them,"28th of March, 1817", in my hand-writing, which enables me to say they are part of the notes I put into my box on the 28th. I got an officer, and told the prisoner I wished to go into her bed-room-she went up - I told her I wanted to search her box-she unlocked it, and I told the officer to search it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and her about the robbery - A. Yes - I asked her how she came by the five 1l. notes she had lent my wife that afternoon; she said they were her own. I told her not to tell me a falsehood, for they were the notes for which I discharged the shopman - She paused a moment, denied it at first, but afterwards acknowledged they were the notes, saying, she had found them on the stairs at the time we went to search the young man's box-it was above six weeks before that that I searched his box-the officer then asked her why she did not give them to her master then, as she knew they were his property - She made no reply. I asked her if she had any more property about her, and she told me no, not a farthing-the officer then said we will search her person. She turned her pocket out - We found a purse, containing twenty shillings in silver - I called my wife up to search her person - She found nothing on her-my wife said she had seen her on Saturday with a handful of notes; she replied, that she had received a pension; I did not know she had any pension to receive. The officer said he would search the bed; she replied, "keep the five 1l. notes, and let me go." The bed was searched, and an apron of the prisoner's was found, made into a bag; it contained a paper bag, which had fourteen 1l., and two 2l. bank notes; 15l. 12s. in three shilling tokens, 2l. in half crowns, 2l. 12s. in one shilling and sixpenny tokens, 2l. 9s. in shillings, and four sixpences; she had not received a farthing in wages from me while she was in the house. During the time she lived with me, she cut her finger, and went to the doctor with it; she returned, crying; her mistress asked her what was the matter; she said the doctor had charged 3d. for her finger, and she had not got a farthing to pay him for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I made out the account that very day. I keep a young man and a boy. I never kept two servants(looks at the note). This is Tabernacle, 28-3, on one of them, which means, I took it of Tabernacle, on the 28th of March; I did not tell her she had better confess. I had turned away the shopman and warehouseman. The warehouseman had not been in the house on the 28th.</p>

               <p>HANNAH CLARKE. I am the wife of William Clarke. Sadler called on me on the 12th of May for some money. I had not got any money to pay him; the prisoner offered to lend some to me; she gave me five 1l. notes; I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210019"/>him the same notes. Before I paid them to him, I observed my husband's hand-writing on them. I saw the notes that came back from Scovell's: they were the very same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not ask her to lend me the notes; she offered them to me.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL NATHAN. I am a headborough. On the 12th of May, the prosecutor fetched me to his house, I went, and searched the bed in which the prisoner slept, and found under the head, close to the sacking, a bag, containing the money of which the prosecutor has spoken. As I was taking her to the watch-house (I neither threaten

             the prisoner, nor held out to her any promise) I asked her if there was any other person implicated in the business? she said, No - She said she knew she must suffer.</p>
               <p>JOHN SERGEANT. I was shopman to the prosecutor, and dismissed his service. I never had the five 1l. notes which have been produced to-day. I did not leave any notes on the stairs in my master's house.</p>

I had them all in my possession on the 28th of March-there are two dated the 28th of March; the others are marked, but not dated. I am sure the two are part of the 8l. that were taken out of my box on that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The dates denote that they were in my possession on the 28th of March. I did not pay any money away after I took them. I did not receive them until four o'clock in the afternoon. I received them from Tabernacle, who pays me after he leaves the India House. I did not pay any money away after that or give change. I might have changed a 1l. note in silver.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q.When you get up, do you put the same clothes on - A. I do; but sometimes leave the key of my box behind me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On the morning of the 29th, when you missed your notes, did you discover that you had lost any of those you took from Tabernacle - A. I particularly remembered I had lost five 1l. notes which I had taken of him; only two which have been produced to-day have his name on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Among those you found in the bed were there any of his - A.(looking at them). These two were with his name on them, but only one with the date. I receive money from him every month - I must have received them of him at the same time, although it is not dated, because I do not keep my money so long. There is another of Tabernacle's dated the 28th. I leave my room at six o'clock in the morning, leaving my wife in bed.</p>
               <p>HANNAH CLARKE. I get up about eight o'clock. I cannot remember what time I left the room. I do not remember returning to my room after I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My room-door is not locked; I have lodgers in the house. I have seen the prisoner wear the apron out of which the bag is made; I knew it by the pattern. There is no female in the house but myself.</p>

I staid there about half an hour. The moment I came out I was collared and pulled down upon my face; they rifled my pockets, and tried to get my watch, and broke the chain.

I caught Fowler and Moses with their knees upon him, and their hands in his pockets. Fowler cried out, "hit the b-g-r," and struck me and cut my lips open. I will positively swear they are the men - I have seen them before. I saw them again the next day, and went down to Clarke. I went the next night with the officer, saw them there again, and took them all.</p>

I have heard Gardiner talk about a 40l. reward before they were taken; I told him of it. He asked me if I knew any of them, I said I did; he said, if they were cast I should have 40l.; he said it depended upon their being cast.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CAREY. I am a weaver, and live in Holywell-street, Shoreditch. I was at the Ship; I saw Clarke come out - He was pulled down.

I could have taken him, but there was a gang round. In about an hour, Dalton came with Duncomb, and we took Fowler. Duncomb went round, and picked out all the others, singly, and charged two others with another robbery. Carey swore to him for another robbery, and took him for this. I stood inside the door.</p>

On the 8th of May, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop - I came into the shop myself at half-past five o'clock and saw her and Maddy serving her-there were no other persons in the shop - I was looking at my books. I looked at her again, and saw something bulky under her arm, which made me suspect her. I went up to her, and saw the corner of the print from under her shawl, which was very large. I took hold of it, and asked her how she came to have it there - She laughed in my face, and said I must have put it there - I told her that was impossible, it could not have got there accidentally. I took it from under her arm; it had my mark on it, and is worth about 20s. cost-price. I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I do not think she was sober; she smelt of liquor. I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MADDY. I am shopman to Messrs. James. The prisoner came into the shop between five and six o'clock, and asked for some gingham which another wo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210021"/>man had been looking at in the morning. She asked the price of the print when she first came in-the same print was afterwards taken from under her shawl-when I told her the price she said it was too high for her. I shewed her several ginghams, and cut her off one yard, at 1s. 6d. per yard; she was paying for it when Mr. James came up, and pulled the print from under her arm; it was the same that she had asked the price of. I pulled down several ginghams to shew her, and left them on the counter. I did not see her take the print. I turned my back to her to take the things down; she could not have got it by accident. If Mr. James had not stopped her, I should not have known that she had got-it there were nineteen yards, it is worth 20s. I asked her 3s. per yard for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was no other person in the shop. The boy was in the shop when she first came in, but he went out, and I saw the print on the counter after that. She was twenty minutes in the shop.</p>

               <p>MR. JOHN EARL. I am a barge-owner, and live at Kingston. In March last, I sent a barge to London, laden with four hundred quarters of malt and one hundred sacks of flour. Horne, Horrod, and Hubbard, had the care of the barge-it was to go to Hawkes's wharf, Whitefriars, for Messrs. Reid and Co. Hawkes's wharf is between Blackfriars Bridge and the Temple. She left Kingston on Tuesday, the 11th of March, about half past eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>JAMES HORNE. I was captain of the barge. We left Kingston, about a quarter before twelve o'clock; Horrod and Hubbard were on board with me. We arrived at <placeName id="t18170521-65-crimeloc326">Hawkes's wharf</placeName>

We made the barge fast at half-past seven o'clock - I and Horrod went on shore for refreshment, leaving Hubbard in the barge, and returned about half-past eight. About a quarter before twelve, I heard some person step on the fore-sheets - I looked out, and called out "Shinah!" meaning Hubbard-no person answered; I thought it was Hubbard. I walked round the bulk to see that all was right, and missed nothing. I heard some person or persons talking at a distance, they were strange voices. The barge being aground I thought no person could rob it, and I returned to the cabin, thinking all safe. About a quarter before one o'clock, Hubbard returned; he had been ashore for refreshment - He said the barge had been robbed. I walked round the bulk, and missed four sacks of malt, each containing two bushels - We returned to the cabin, and missed no more; I then looked out several times, and saw the police-boats stop several other boats, but did not suspect them. As soon as it was day-light we missed four more sacks, making eight in all. I went to the Police-office; the sacks were marked"John Earl," in full length.</p>
               <p>JOHN HORROD. I was fellow-servant with the last witness, and came away with the barge. We arrived in town all safe, at Hawkes's wharf - We did not stop at all on the river. Between twelve and one o'clock I walked over the bulk, and missed four sacks, and in the morning we missed four more, making eight in all. The sacks were marked"John Earl."</p>

               <p>JOSEPH FARRANT. I am a corn-chandler, and live in James-street, Covent-garden. On the 13th of March last, a man, named Hawkins, came to me about ten o'clock in the morning, and produced a sample of malt - I agreed to buy it of him at 56s.; the price of malt of that quality would be 86s. at that time - I had given 96s. the previous week, which was the fair market price for that kind of malt; it was to be delivered to me on Friday morning, at seven o'clock (the next day). I did not know the man before, I gave information at Bow-street. On Friday morning, about half past six o'clock, Hawkins and another man brought the malt, in a cart, to my door; there were eight sacks-Adkins was in attendance. The malt was shot out of their sacks into mine. Adkins took the two men into custody and the sacks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I never saw either of the prisoners-Hawkins was tried here. Three of the sacks had the name of Bowell, of Camberwell. on them.</p>
               <p>HARRY ADKINS. I am an officer of Bow-street. Hawkins was tried here last Session. On Friday morning, the 14th of March, I went by appointment to Mr. Farrant's, and saw the cart come up to his house.

            . I know Hawkins. In the month of March last I got a horse and cart for him, from my house in Portpool-lane; he joined me, and got into the cart; we drove to Westminster Bridge - He directed me to drive there. When we got there he alighted, and went and spoke to a man, it was the prisoner, Thomas, he was in waiting. I did not hear what passed between them. The prisoner, Thomas, told me to bring the cart down after him. He took me down on the beach by the water-side; it was rather dark-this was a little distance from the bridge, on the Surry side of the water, and the further side of the bridge from the city. When I got to the water's-edge, the two prisoners were in the barge. Thomas told me to back the cart to the barge; I did so, and they both helped to unload it - They lifted the sacks out of the barge into my cart; this was the first time I saw them - I am sure they are the two men - They put eight sacks into the cart, and told me to drive away; I had left Hawkins at the foot of the bridge. I drove off the same way that I came,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210022"/>and found Hawkins at the foot of the bridge where I had left him; he joined me, and we drove over the bridge to Mr. Farrant's. I unloaded the same malt that I had got from the prisoners at the water-side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know Hawkins's wife by sight - I have not talked to her about giving evidence here. It was about six o'clock in the morning when we got to Westminster Bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they not tell you, that if you would swear to these two men, it would be better for her husband - A. No, nothing like it. It was light enough to see the countenance of a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said it was so dark you could not see the man when he came up to you - A. No; I said, if I saw him I thought I should know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, the last time, that you had not seen him so that you could know him again - A. I cannot swear that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have sworn to the man at the time he came up to Hawkins - A. I cannot swear to the man that came up to Hawkins, but I can swear to the man who gave me the malt - They were in the barge and I was in the cart.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you put your cart as close to the edge of the barge as you could - A. Yes; they lifted them up and I took them in.</p>
               <p>HARRY ADKINS. I apprehended the prisoner, Thomas, at his house at Lambeth; he is a fisherman-it was after Hawkins had been tried. I asked him if he knew Hawkins? he hesitated sometime, and said he did know a man of that name. I found Piper at his own house; he is also a fisherman. He said he did know Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw their nets in their houses, and they said the fish-trade was very bad.</p>
               <p>MARGARET HAWKINS. My husband was tried here last Sessions, for stealing the malt. I know the two prisoners. I went to Thomas soon after my husband was sent to Newgate on this charge; I believe it was the day after - I knew nothing of him before - I did not find him then. I went a fortnight afterwards (which was before my husband was tried). I found him at home. I said,"my husband is in trouble concerning this malt that he had of you, and I hope you will help me;" he said I should not want while he had any thing-this was all that passed then. Thomas's wife, and the prisoner, Piper, came down to my house in Portpool-lane after this - I did not know Piper before-this was a day or two after I had been to Thomas's. I told Thomas where I lived. The morning that my husband was taken to Bow-street, Piper came and asked where Hawkins was. I said, "I believe you know, for I think you to be one of the party" - He went away. That was all that passed. I went to Bow-street, but did not see either of the prisoners there. One evening, before my husband was tried, I went to Thomas's house, to see if he would give me any money. I found him at home. I was talking about my husband's trouble, and asked him to assist me with a little money. I do not know that I told him what I wanted it for; he said he had not got any at that time - He said nothing else. I did not tell him of the robbery, or who was concerned in it, at either of these conversations. The morning after my husband was tried, I went to Thomas's house again and saw him, Piper came in while I was there. They told me that they had heard my husband's trial the night before, and said they had promised my husband 2l. 2s. towards a counsellor. They said they had not got 2l. 2s. then, but each of them gave me 10s. to help pay for the counsellor. My mother had assisted me, and this was to help to pay her. Nothing more passed. I went to Thomas's house again the week before last, to see if he could assist me a little more, as they promised they would. I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not seen Thomas with my husband - I had not seen either of the prisoners at our house-it was a fortnight after my husband was taken that I first saw Thomas, and told him I believed him to be one of the party. Thomas said I should not want. Mr. Ulmer was my husband's attorney; I mentioned it to him and was fetched before the magistrate by the officer. I never had any hope of getting my husband off. Ulmer did not tell me what to say; nor do I remember Mr. Harmer checking him and the justice turning him out; he went to the office with me, but did not tell me what to say.</p>
               <p>MR. EARL re-examined. The value of the malt was 88s. per quarter, in all 16l. or 17l. I compared a sample of the malt with that brought to Farrant's, they exactly agreed-there were three different kinds among it-and it was dried of a particular colour for Reid and Co. I have no doubt but that they are the same. I compared it with the bulk from which it had been taken.</p>
               <p>SILVESTER DRAKE. In March last I was working at the Waterloo Bridge, and found four sacks just below the barges, between them and Blackfriars Bridge-it was the 15th of March, they had "John Earl," marked on them; they appeared to have been sometime in the water, and to have had corn in them.</p>
               <p>HORROD re-examined. The barge was robbed on Tuesday, the 11th of March, between twelve and one o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>MR. EARL. I missed eight sacks, with my name on them. I saw those which Drake produced, they are part of the sacks which the malt was put into.</p>
               <p>THOMAS'S Defence. I never saw the woman or the man before. The officer asked me if I knew Hawkins, I said I did; he said it would be better for me if I did not. I walked all the way without being hand-cuffed, and might have made my escape if I had been guilty.</p>
               <p>PIPER'S Defence. I never saw either the woman or the man before.</p>

The next morning, I went to the Bench and, found he had not been there; I then went to Mr. Oxenham's, and he had not been there. On the Monday following I received a letter which I believe to be the prisoner's handwriting - I have seen him write several times; it stated that he had made off with the property, and wished to resign himself up to justice; and that he would be opposite St. Giles's church between seven and nine o'clock in the evening, to surrender himself. I went there and took him into custody; he said he was willing to resign himself, and went with me alone; he said he had pledged some of the property, and sold the rest. He was porter at an auction room.</p>

            . This is the hatchet. I will swear that I had it in my hand; I knew nothing of him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I only saw it that afternoon-it was Sunday - I took it off the tap-room table, and particularly observed the marks on it - I can swear to it-there is a notch cut at the end, and it is split in the middle of the handle - He had been at my house ever since two o'clock; he had as much as would do him good. I only know that it was in his possession. Schneider lives about a mile and a quarter from me.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS DAWKINS. I am a horse-patrol belonging to Bow-street Office. In consequence of the report of the house being broken open, I and Propstring examined the premises. The bill was found among the property; I fitted it to the marks on Reasby's house; the marks exactly fitted. The bar had been attempted, but not opened; I tried the marks there; they corresponded. The shutters had been forced open. I tried the bill, and fitted it to those marks; it appeared that they went out at the door, and entered at the window, by breaking a pane of glass, after forcing the shutters.</p>
               <p>REASRY re-examined. There was a little liquor gone; the casks were broken in the road near the place where I found the other things. There were two casks taken from my premises; it was a gallon cask of rum, and a two gallon cask, with some brandy in it; they were stone casks, marked Nos. 1 and 2; I found part of one of them near the place.</p>

             re-examined. I had known the prisoner a great many years. He lived about a mile from Reasby. When I first saw him, he was close to where I smelt the liquor, between that place and Reasby's. I took no notice of it to him; it was just getting day-light when I saw him, and was about three o'clock. I thought he came over where I was because I should not take any notice of it; there was somebody with him under the pailings. I thought he wished to see who I was, but did not wish me to see him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. At this time I was going towards Reasby's; I had passed the place where I smelt the liquor before I saw the prisoner; he was also going towards Reasby's: they followed us after we got by. I do not know whether there was one or two more with him. I did not see them so as to know who they were. I did not see any thing about the prisoner; the other two men were pretty near to Schneider's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did the smell appear to come from - A. Near the gate leading to Schneider's. After I got by, they followed me about one hundred yards, and then turned back; they followed us as far as the road that leads to Reasby's; when they got as far as there, we saw no more of them.</p>

            . I know no more than Dawkins has told. I took the prisoner into custody on the 26th. I could not find him before. I began to look for him on the 23d.</p>
               <p>JOHN REASBY. The watch was worth 3l. I would give 3l. for such a one; the other things are of little value; the liquor was worth ten or twelve shillings. The window was safe when I went to bed.</p>

            . I was passing along the corner of Samuel-street, and observed four men; they appeared to be connected together and talking. I was gone about ten minutes. When I returned, I heard a man had been robbed. The prisoner was in custody; I knew him again. I am quite sure he was one of the four men that I saw standing at the corner; he had a blue coat and white apron on.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL DOBSON. I am headborough of the parish. I took the prisoner into custody. I did not hear Higley say he could not swear to the man. I never gave the boy(Franks), any directions to swear to the prisoner. I asked him if he was sure the prisoner was the man. I never said I would say, that the prosecutor said he could not swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Dobson said the man said he could not swear to me. When I was examined, the prosecutor said, if his watch was made good to him, he would not prosecute me. My brother gave him a watch, and he promised me not to appear against me; the watch was deposited in Bradstone's hands.</p>
               <p>HIGLEY re-examined. I said if he was innocent, I should not wish to hurt him, before he was taken. I said if he would produce my watch, I would not go against him. I never received a watch not to prosecute him; the prisoner offered to give me one or make any recompence I thought proper. I refused it-no watch was given to me. I heard nothing of it.</p>
               <p>DOBSON re-examined. When he was going to the watchhouse, he said he would give the prosecutor a watch, or make him any amends for the watch. I know nothing of a watch being deposited.</p>

I have had frequently occasion to go into the country, and used to leave some sheets of paper with him, bearing our signature, for him to send letters in cases of emergency(looks at the check). This is on Snow and Co.; they are our bankers. The prisoner had no authority to draw on our bankers on any occasion; the signature is in my hand-writing; the body of the check is the prisoner's - I never gave him authority to draw this check. I never but once drew a check on plain paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have, on some occasions, left a printed check signed, to be filled up. I always draw my checks on printed papers. I got the check from Messrs. Snow and Co.</p>
               <p>Edward Wilson was then called to prove the payment of the check, and not appearing, the Jury found the prisoner.</p>

            </rs>, his property.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLEMAN. On the 20th of April, after dinner, I went to Blackwall, and got intoxicated. The prisoners were drinking in a house at Stepney, and joined me. I waited there about an hour, and came away after ten o'clock. I gave the prisoners my property to take care of; they were going to see me home. I did not give them the money, but gave them the other things.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you see the prisoners last - A.Not since their second examination. I did not tell the magistrate, that I gave them the property. The officers told me that I must come forward. I am a letter-carrier in the Post-Office. I signed my examination before the magistrate, but did not read it first.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On the 20th of April, I was out with Partridge. I saw the prisoners in Stepneyfields, at eight o'clock, and at ten o'clock, we saw them standing at the door of the George, at Cock-hill, with the prosecutor; there was another man with them; the prosecutor was in liquor - They went up Schoolhouse-lane with him, and felt him about; he said he wanted to go to the Borough; they were taking him the wrong way; they hustled him about in the lane, and threw him down; a man came by, and disturbed them - They returned again with him near the back of the Bristol Arms, threw him down there, and brought him into Glasshouse-fields. I was just by them - He asked them if they wanted to rob him. I run into the Bristol Arms, and called Barber to my assistance - I sent him round by the glass-house. I sprung down to them, and saw Manning rifle his pockets. I seized him. Spelman ran away. Manning said he had not robbed him, and had got nothing belonging to him. I found the articles stated in the indictment on him. Coleman had a mark on his head, and his hand was cut; he was very much in liquor - He claimed the things, and charged them with robbing him; the next morning I took Spelman - He said he had nothing to do with it. The morning after Manning told the Magistrate, that Coleman gave them the things - He did not say so before.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLEMAN. My hands were not cut. I had not got a blemish about me.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>GEORGE PARTRIDGE. I am an officer, and was with Brown. I saw the prisoners, at ten o'clock at night, with Coleman. I followed Brown, but lost him. I saw Coleman at the Bristol Arms; one of his knuckles bled, and I saw something under his eye. I was with Brown when he took Spelman; he at first denied being there, and afterwards said, that he had nothing to do with the robbery, but was there.</p>

               <p>JEREMIAH BARBER. Brown fetched me out of the Bristol Arms. I went round into the fields. Brown called out, that he had got one; he had Manning (Coleman laid on the ground quite motionless); I saw him searched, and the articles found on him. When Manning came into the house, he said, that Coleman gave them to him-this was in Brown's presence - He must have heard it. One of Coleman's hands bled, and his face likewise.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I did not hear Manning say they were given to him till he was before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>SPELMAN'S Defence. I lost Manning and the prosecutor, and went home.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH BARBER. When I went out, I only saw one man-if there had been another man, he might have got away before I saw him.</p>

I had a pint of beer, and stopped there about three quarters of an hour. I was not in company with any body. I observed two or three young men and women there. I had a shawl on; when I went out, two young men, who stood at the door, followed me down <placeName id="t18170521-75-crimeloc376">Field-lane</placeName>

I said I was going home; they stopped me three or four doors down, and one of them put their hands round my neck. I said what do you want of me. The prisoner took my shawl off - He had hold of me, but he is not the one that had hold of my neck; the other man pressed my throat - They both ran towards the White Lion again - I said they had taken my shawl. A man said, "never mind, I will find him for you." I described them to the waiter, and went home. The next morning I returned to inquire for them, and went to Barnett, and described them to him. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man. He was taken up the next day. I have seen my shawl in the possession of Barnett.</p>
               <p>ANN GAVERNOR. I was at the White Lion public-house, and saw Reece there, and some men at the same time-the room was almost full of people-Mrs. Reece was by herself; I was not there ten minutes, but saw her go out, and two or three men followed her; I noticed them before they went out-the prisoner is one of them - He left the house after Mrs. Reece; I met him again in Holborn, about a quarter of an hour after-there were two or three of them - I went to the coffee-shop with them - They treated me; the prisoner gave the man of the house the shawl, and said, "take this: we want coffee for it for four of us." He left it there. I am sure he is the man that gave the shawl. I know that Mrs. Reece had the shawl on when she went out; this was the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear, that I left it, or did you do it yourself - A. He left it himself. I knew him before by frequently seeing him. I heard of the robbery, and told Barnett.</p>
               <p>HYAM BARNETT. I am an officer, and have got the shawl. I obtained it from the coffee-shop, in Field-lane, the day after the robbery; the man could not tell his name. The Magistrate said I could not apprehend him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNLEY. I am a constable, and got information of the robbery. The next day (after the robbery), I was walking down Field-lane, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw two girls fighting. The prisoner was there; and, within hearing, one of them said, "you shan't have the shawl." I took both the prisoner and the girls into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came out, Gavernor came out with me. I picked the shawl off the ground; the woman was not within 20 yards of it at the time. I gave it to Gavernor, we then went to the coffee-shop, and she pledged the shawl for the coffee.</p>

The prisoner's companion opened the door, and went in; the children were in the shop. The door was latched at that time; he came out, and the prisoner went in; the prisoner then came out, and his companion went in again, and he followed him, and brought the articles out. The prisoner unlatched the door three times, and the other twice. I am sure they unlatched it each time. The last time the prisoner went in, he brought the parcel out under his arm. I run over, and gave the alarm. Mr. Temple was not there. I ran after the prisoner, and took him, with the property in his possession; he was never out of my sight.</p>

I had locked it up myself the night before, about a quarter before two o'clock, when I went to bed, and took the key up with me - I was the last person that was up. I found the tobacco-drawer on the floor, and about three-quarters of a pound of tobacco gone, which was nearly all that was in it. I missed a clock, worth 4l., and twelve two-penny loaves; about one pound of cheese, and some cakes; I also missed about half a gallon of bitters, worth 10s. 6d. out of the cellar, a gallon of gin, two gallons of anniseed cordial, worth 1l. and eleven bottles of cyder, worth 9s. I have seen some of the cakes since in the possession of Bly - I saw them the same day. The tap-room door, which leads into the wash-house, had a hole cut in it, and the bolt pushed back-the wash-house shutter was broken down; the hole appears to be cut with a chissel. I found the cellar door had been entered, and a small axe, which I left laying in the wash-house, was found in the tap-room. I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a millwright; I lodge with Mrs. Timson. I got up about half-past five o'clock in the morning-when I came down, I found the street door fast but the bar-door was open, and the tobacco-drawer on the floor; I gave the alarm, and went down to Westminster to stop the things, if they should be pledged. As I was returning, I met Westcoat. We went to a boat which was about a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Timson's house-it was about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon; it laid on the beach, the tide was making up to it; the two prisoners were there, and abused Westcoat very much. We both went to the boat, but found nothing in it - We afterwards went and searched it with Bly and Gillmore. We saw the prisoners in the act of pushing that same boat off. I went with them to it, and found the cakes in the boat, with some bread and butter; the prisoners were taken, and the officer took a screw-driver from House; I saw him find it on him - I afterwards tried it to the hole that was cut in the door, the marks corresponded in size, and in my judgment, the hole was cut with it. When they were taken House threw his hat off, and I saw a great deal of tobacco fall out of it-there might not be quite half a pound of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CASTLES. I am a brewer's-servant. On the 6th of May I was going to work; it was light - I had to pass Timson's house in my way. Before I got there, between her house and the water-side, I met three men going as from Mrs. Timson's. When they saw me they stopped, and leaned over the garden pailings. After I had passed them about fifteen yards, they all started off as hard as they could run-the two prisoners are two of them. I knew them very well before that-it was about eighty yards from Mrs. Timson's - They ran towards the wharf; the other man who was with them, had a large bundle under his arm, tied up in an apron, it might have been bottles-his name is Wright. I went further towards Timson's house, and within about twenty yards in the same foot-path that they came along, I saw something spilt for some distance; I also saw the neck of a bottle.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I had a warrant against the two prisoners and a man of the name of Wright, whom I cannot find. I went to the boat about a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the two prisoners just by the boat; the tide was just coming up to it. I secured the prisoners, and as we were going close to the passage of a public-house, the prisoner, House, knocked his hat off himself-in the crown of his hat I found some tobacco covered with a piece of paper to keep it from his head. I found a screw-driver in his jacket pocket. I then searched the boat, and found some cakes and some bread, butter, and cheese. We compared the screw-driver with the marks of the hole in the door - They exactly fitted. There are no marks on the door but what fit the chissel. There are some marks under the hinge which also exactly fit, as if they had attempted to wrench the door off.</p>

               <p>MRS. TIMSON. I will swear to the cakes, they are my own making - I have two which were left in the house exactly like them-the bread and cheese I believe to be part of the same that I lost; the tobacco seems like the same sort that I sell. Some of them had got in at the cellar-window, which had a great many cobwebs in it.</p>

The articles stated in the indictment were taken from the room on the first-floor, out of the closet, which was not locked - I had seen them safe an hour before. I was in the kitchen, which is two stories under the first-floor, and heard some glass break, and ran up stairs. I heard the silver fall on the floor, and a cry of Stop thief! and found the prisoner in my daughter's custody - I had not been in the room for an hour before; the street-door is open all day - I do not know whether the room-door was closed, or not. We have no lodgers; my husband is a merchant. I stopped the prisoner myself - He turned round and asked me what was the matter, and said he had got none of my property; he fell down on his knees, and wanted me to let him go.</p>
               <p>CAROLINE MOSS. I am the daughter of the last witness. I was in the two-pair-of-stairs room; I heard the glass break. I had been in the room a very short time before-the door was open. I came down stairs, and saw the prisoner coming out of the dining-room - He was quite a stranger to me. He said "how do you do?" and went down stairs; I followed him down to let him out, thinking it was some person come to my father. I did not suspect him. As he was going down I saw a spoon sticking out at his collar, which made me suspect him. I called out Stop thief! and pursued him, still calling out; he got out of the door - I only lost sight of him for a moment; I am quite sure he is the man whom I saw coming out of the room; he had two keys about him when he was stopped. My mother came; he was searched - I saw the articles stated in the indictment fall from him as he ran out; he let them fall on the mat-they were buttoned up in his coat. I am quite certain he is the man - He opened his coat, and they fell from him.</p>

               <p>BARTHOLOMEW WOOD. I am a beadle. I took the prisoner; he said he took the half-crown of a Jew. I searched him and found he had no more, and let him go, and told him to send the Jew to me, and I would return the half-crown.</p>
               <p>HOWELL GODDARD. I am a beadle. I was passing by Cooper's, and saw Wood let the prisoner go. I watched him round several streets into Tenter-street. He looked round to see if he was watched, and there joined a Jew; they talked together for three or four minutes - I lost sight of them for a short time; I then saw him again and followed him into Mr. Perkins's shop - He came out in a few minutes - I went in, and from what I heard there, I went after him, and told him he had passed a bad half-crown, and brought him back to the shop. I searched him, and found two good shillings and one sixpence on him, and a watch. I asked him where he got the bad half-crown from? he said he had it of a person for whom he took the watch out of pledge. I asked him where he lived? - he said he did not know, and what his name was, he could not tell. I told him it was the second time he had tried to pass bad money, and asked him where he got the one he passed in Beech-street; he said of a Jew. Perkins's man gave me the half-crown. As we were going to the Counter, he said he received it from a boy in Wentworth-street; I produce it.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOODBURN. I am shopman to Mr. Perkins. On the 6th of May the prisoner came to our shop to redeem a watch; he gave me 15s. 6d. in silver, including the half-crown which I gave to Goddard. I am sure I gave him the same, as I had no other in the till.</p>

On the 11th of April my shop-man delivered me a note (purporting to be an order from Mr. F. James, of Chesunt, who had formerly lived in Newgate-street, and had been a customer of mine), requesting me to send goods to the value of 7l. 4s. 8d. to him; I saw the prisoner about two hours after - I had then sent the goods to Mr. Treacher's in Paternoster-row, as the note directed, and they had been returned. The prisoner said he was surprised the goods had not been sent to Mr. Treacher's for Mr. James. I told him Mr. Treacher did not know Mr. James, and therefore they were returned. I told him I would not send them unless I had satifactory references that Mr. James sent the note. He mentioned several houses, and among others Messrs. Howell and Caesar, whom I knew. I told him to call at two o'clock, and if I found all was right he should have them; he said he would call before two, as he was going down by the coach, and could take them himself, as they would be too late for the carrier. He called about two o'clock, I went to inquire, and gave him the goods; I should not have let him had them if Messrs. Howell and Caesar had not thought it was a proper note from Mr. James. He represented himself as having them for Mr. James, and I thought it was Mr. James's hand-writing. On the 30th of April I saw him again, and had him apprehended. He said he had pledged the goods and sold the duplicate.</p>

I live in the lower part of the house, the rest of it is let out in different tenements; the owner does not live in it-there are five different families living in the house, besides mine. On the 22d of May, when I went to bed, I left every thing locked up safe; I got up at eight o'clock next morning, found my windows broken, and the articles stated in the indictment taken out-my wife and two of my children were in the house at the time, and some of the lodgers. I went round to the shops and gave information. I lost thirty-eight screen sticks.</p>

            . My mother lives at No. 2, Drury-court. I was going on an errand at seven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner, and another man, the prisoner put his hand in the glass and took the sticks - He put them under his coat, came out of the passage, and went away with them. I knocked at Mr. Goodey's back-parlour door, but no person answered; I then saw him cross over the road, go up Craven-place, come back, and stand at the corner of Craven-buildings. I am sure the prisoner is the man that I saw take them - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FIELDER. I am a gold-beater, and live in Greek-street, Soho. On Friday last, the 23d of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor gave me information that he had lost the articles stated in the indictment, and requested me to stop them if they were offered for sale. About eleven o'clock the prisoner called with some of them - He said he had those and a number more; wishing to get the whole in my possession, I told him if he brought all that he had I would buy them. In about half an hour he returned with the rest of them. I then told him I understood they were stolen, and should detain him; he appeared very willing to stop. I sent for the prosecutor. The constable came and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LONGLEY. I was sent for and took the prisoner into custody; he said he found them in St. James's Park. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out about half-past six o'clock, and found them tied up in a bundle in one of the seats in St. James's Park. I told Fielder how many there were. I stopped willingly till the prosecutor came.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I was opposite the public-house, and saw Hudd there. As he was going into the house, the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and drew his watch out. I saw him give it to one of his companions. I went for an officer - I did not cry out Stop thief! nor lay hold of him. On the 2d. of May I saw him again; I did not then take him. I told Thompson of it - He did not take him. The next day he was there again, and Dalton took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I only took the prisoner on this charge - I pointed seven others out on another charge. I did not say I would not appear against him for a 1l. note. His father got me intoxicated, and asked me to sign my name to a 1l. note. I took Fenton up for receiving the watch - He was acquitted.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, at the Ship, in Bacon-street - He surrendered quietly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I took seven up in all, by Carey and Duncomb's orders. Two were discharged, and five acquitted here the other day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Carey swore that another man took the watch.</p>
               <p>CAREY re-examined. I have charged the prisoner with two robberies-the other was for robbing Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>ELIZA SWAIN. I keep the sign of the Box-tree, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch. The witness, Carey, was at my house last Friday night-the prisoner's father was there. Carey was sober (looks at a 1l. note) - He gave me this note, and said "keep this; and when Fowler's son comes out of prison you are to give it to me." He put his name on it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. I was employed at the Ship, public-house, to let the people in and out. Carey applied to me on the Friday night; he did not come to me on the Thursday - I was not there. He said, there was a gentleman had been robbed of his watch, and shewed the prisoner to me. I said I should know him. The next night he was taken. I did not think it proper to take him, as Carey could not tell me who the man was that had been robbed. <rs id="t18170521-110-verdict557" type="verdictDescription">

He left the fiddle, and Brickman brought the bow. I asked Dalton how he got it; he said Brickman sold it to him-and Brickman said he bought it in America, and sold it to Dalton.</p>

            . I am a watchman. A little before two o'clock in the morning of the 25th of March, I saw Hawkins, and two others with him, pass my box in Rosemary-lane - They were all intoxicated. My box is about twenty minutes' walk from the Commercial-road - They were going towards the city. The two prisoners were standing at the corner, just by my box - I am sure they are the men; I knew Pearson before; he had been over to me between twelve and one o'clock, and asked me to call his boy at half-past three o'clock. He went over to the corner, where he stood before-Ball was talking to him there. Soon after Ball came, and lit his pipe at my box. When the prosecutor and his two friends came by, they asked me the road to the London Docks-all of them were very drunk. I directed them, and they turned towards the Docks and went on. When they had got a few yards from me, Hawkins fell down, and the prisoners left the corner as if to assist him. Hearing a noise, I got out of my box, and saw both of them with the three gentlemen; I got up to them. Ball was stooping to help Hawkins up; I stooped to help him myself; and as I lifted him up, I saw Ball with his hand in his waistcoat pocket. He then put his hand down to his breeches-pocket - I saw him pull his watch out - I saw the seals and ribbon hanging in his hand. Hawkins was leaning on my arm. Pear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210035"/>son was behind Ball-whether Ball gave him the watch, or not, I cannot say. I immediately seized Ball by the breast, and said, "You have robbed the man of his watch and all that he had!" He made a bounce, and got from me. I ran after him with the cry of Stop thief! He ran down Cartwright-street, and turned into a passage which had no thoroughfare; he got out, but I secured him before he got out of my sight; nothing was found on him. I am sure I saw him pull the watch out. I secured Pearson between two and three o'clock that morning at his house. He denied the charge. Ball got away from me, and on the 12th of May I saw him at Lambeth-street Office, and am sure he is the man. I took Pearson to the watchhouse; the gentlemen were not able to give charge of him, and he was discharged by the keeper - He was afterwards apprehended.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FARRELL. I am a watchman. I was in Cartwright-street and heard the alarm between two and three o'clock. I ran up, and found Ball in George's custody - He was taken to the watch-house, and escaped from me. We took Pearson at his house, and the watch-house-keeper let him go. I am positive he is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Ball on another charge.</p>
               <p>BALL'S Defence. I have witnesses to prove I was at home that night.</p>
               <p>PEARSON'S Defence. I stood off the pavement-Ball was with me, and did not go near him. George pointed Ball out to Farrell at the second hearing, saying, "Mind that is Ball."</p>
               <p>THOMAS GEORGE. I did not point out either of them to Farrell.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FARRELL. He did not point out either of them to me.</p>
               <p>SUSAN JOSEPH. I live with Mrs. Francis, at Butcher-row, East Smithfield. Ball lodged in the same house. On the 24th of March, he came home between nine and ten o'clock, quite intoxicated; he sat down a little while in Mrs. Francis's shop, and afterwards said he wanted to go to bed. Mrs. Francis asked me to light him up stairs, which I did - He went to bed-this was a little before ten o'clock-the house was open till about twelve o'clock that night. Mrs. Francis has several lodgers sometimes. The street door was shut. She stays up till twelve or one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time was the house shut up that night - A. It had struck twelve o'clock-it is generally shut at that time; the outer door of the house was open till twelve o'clock-it was shut at eight o'clock, and the shop shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it shut when the prisoner came in - A. It was shut from the time that the prisoner went to bed till twelve o'clock. I was sitting in the kitchen with Mrs. Francis.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come home the next night - A. I do not know. On the Monday night (the 24th), he said, he had some business at his sister's, and told us he was to go again on the 27th - He shewed me a printed paper, as also Mrs. Francis, that she might see he had to go to his sister, at Islington, on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to shew it to you when he was tipsy - A. He pulled it out of his pocket, and said, he had a paper, and was to go, on the 27th, at eleven o'clock in the morning. On the Monday morning, he went out at nine o'clock, and said he was going to his sister on business.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear that it was of consequence to know that he was at home on the 24th of March - A. He sent for me about a week ago - I was not intimate with him; I saw him in Newgate - He asked me when he went to his sister, and came home tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you then to know the day of the mouth - A. I have heard the people say the robbery was done that night - I heard so two days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. If you only heard it two days ago, how can you say, that when he sent for you a week ago, that you knew the 24th of March was material - A. Only because the paper said the 27th of March, which was Thursday, and I knew it was Monday that he came home tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that was Monday, the 24th of March, you cannot say - A. Yes, I am sure of it; I kept it in my memory - He told me that it was Monday he came home tipsy - I told Mrs. Francis, that it was Monday, the 24th of March, and asked her if she did not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was he not taken up for stealing geese - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any geese found in your room - A. He asked me to let him leave them there - I washed for him.</p>
               <p>SARAH FRANCIS. I live in Butcher-row. Mrs. Joseph is married-her husband is abroad - She does not take in washing, but washed for Ball. I let him in. On Monday, the 24th of March, about twenty minutes before ten o'clock-Mrs. Joseph was below at the time - He was then tipsy, and asked to go to bed - I asked Mrs. Joseph to light him up; he stood talking while she lighted the candle, and went up directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had been, or on what business - A. No; I never heard him say any thing about his sister's business. I saw no paper - I am sure I never saw either printed or plain paper. Nothing was said about the 27th of March, nor did Joseph say any thing to me about the 27th of March. He was taken out of my house about troubling himself with a woman, and was afterwards taken about something in a back yard which joins our yard. I never heard what it was. I have seen him once, in Newgate, about a week ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you it was material to recollect the 24th of March - A. Nobody; I do not know that he was charged with doing any thing on that day.</p>

He laid hold of my right shoulder, shook me, and said, "shew your property!" I cried out, and the watchmen came to my assistance. When they came, he said he would not let me go-the watchmen got me from him. I went a step from him, turned round, and saw a penknife open in his hand-the point stuck out. I was very much frightened, and told them of it. The prisoner did not ask for any money; he only said, "shew your property." I did not see the knife till I got from him - He laid hold of me as if he was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you think that I meant to rob you, or that I took you for another woman - A. I thought he was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PEARSON. I am a watchman. I was about four or five yards from them in Russell-street - I was at the corner of the street, and heard a woman scream. I turned round, and saw the prisoner holding her with his left hand, and a knife in his right - He held it up, and I seized it as he was putting it down on her. I said "let her go;" he said he would not, for he would stick it into her. I held him fast by the right wrist, when Clarke got the woman from him; he then turned round, and said "I will serve you the same." I sent Clarke with the woman, as she seemed frightened, and took the prisoner to the watchhouse, he still having the knife in his hand. As we went along, I told him he was a bad fellow for attempting to do such a thing; he said," I have been out all night, on purpose to stick it into somebody, and will now stick it into you," and made a stab at me. I seized him by the wrist, and told him I would knock his brains out, if he did not deliver the knife - He said," take it, then," and gave it to me; I carried him to the watch-house - He was quite sober. As we were going along he said," now you will take notice that I am perfectly sober."</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When you first heard the cry he could see you - A. He could. He said he was sorry he had not done it, as it would bring something out. We asked him what he meant - He said he would explain that here.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take the knife out of his hand - A. I was afraid to lay hold of the blade. I did not like to open his hand.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CLARKE. I am a watchman. On the 8th of May I was coming up Brydge's-street, and saw the prisoner take hold of the woman; she screamed out - I asked him what he was going to do with her. Pearson came up, and caught hold of his right arm, and I let loose his other arm from her throat. I saw the knife in his hand with the blade out - I did not see it till after the watchman caught hold of his arm; I was about five yards from them - I saw him all the while. Before the woman came he stood opposite to Russell-street, for some minutes; when she came by, he turned round all of a sudden - He was not looking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210037"/>the way that she was coming; it was all done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When the other man laid hold of me, did you see me with the knife, stabbing it at her - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>JOHN SWAIN. I am the constable of the night. On the 8th of May, about half-past four o'clock, Pearson brought the prisoner into the watch-house, charging him with attempting to stab a woman, himself, and the other watchman, with an open knife, at the corner of Russell-street. I asked the prisoner what he had to say? he said it was perfectly right. I asked him if the woman had been in company with him, or if he knew her? he said, No. I asked him what could induce him, with an open knife, to attempt to stab people? he said it would lead to a farther discovery, which he would explain before the magistrate. I thought he must be deranged. He said he had been walking about two or three hours, and intended it. He spoke broken English, and behaved very civil - He could not write his name, but gave me a letter which was directed to him from the War-office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had supped with some friends, and not being well, my liquor had effect upon me. When I got home, I had some words with my landlady; I went out again, and a woman laid hold of me, wanting me to go with her - I gave her a 3s. piece, and she ran away. I followed her, but lost her, and took this woman for her. I took hold of her, saying, "shew me my property." I put the knife into my pocket, and afterwards gave it to them. I have been eleven years in his Majesty's service with respectability.</p>
               <p>PEARSON. He never had the knife out of his hand.</p>
               <p>CLARKE. His right hand hung down all the while, by his side.</p>
               <p>JOHN DANIEL. I had supped with the prisoner that night, and left him between twelve and one o'clock - He was very much intoxicated. I went home with him - He had some words with his landlady, and went out again.</p>

               <p>THOMAS METCALF, ESQ. I live in Queen-street, Bloomsbury; the prisoner was my <rs id="t18170521-119-deflabel602" type="occupation">servant</rs>

On the 16th of May, the prisoner had my plate in his custody, which was of considerable value. I went out, and returned home between eight and nine o'clock, and found he was not at home - He was the only man I had left at home in the care of the plate; he came home a little before ten o'clock - I had returned home quite unexpectedly. I told him the impropriety of his being out. About eleven o'clock, as I was getting into bed, Jane Atkinson came to my door. In consequence of what she said, I got up and went to the prisoner's bed-room, which was in the lower part of the house - I found his door locked, and told him to open it; he answered, that he was getting into bed. I was kept at the door sometime, and insisted on his opening it, which he did. He had his coat off, and the rest of his things loose. I told him I understood there was somebody in the house; he said," how could you suspect any such thing?" I said I would satisfy myself. I searched his room. I made him follow me, and looked round the rooms, and was going up stairs quite satisfied. I met my wife and Atkinson on the stairs, and told them to go to bed. My wife was not satisfied, and made some observations. The prisoner said," do you possibly suspect me of intending to rob you?" - She said" I do not know that I suspect you, but am sure, from what Atkinson says, that there is some person concealed in the house." I said I would make another search to satisfy her. The first place I went to was a closet in the prisoner's room, which was close by the door-way, and which I had omitted to search before. I opened the door, and there found a black negro. I retreated back a few paces - He came forward, and I presented my pistol to him. He said," for God's sake, sir, do not fire." The prisoner also put his hand up, and said"pray do not fire!" and I think he said he could explain it. The black man then made for the door; I got entangled between the prisoner and the bed, and he escaped. The prisoner then said, he hoped I would he merciful to him, and nothing of the kind should happen again. I called the watch, and gave him in charge. I desired the constable to ask him for the key of his box - He gave it to me; we opened his boxes, and found the articles stated in the indictment, and some bottles of wine, with the seals cut off the top; he had a key of my celler - I suspect the wine to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I never gave him the waistcoat to get mended-it was quite new.</p>
               <p>JANE ATKINSON. I am servant to Mr. Metcalf. On the 16th of May, about ten o'clock at night, the bell rang - I went to the door, and a black man asked for the prisoner; I told him he was with my master, but I would let him know when he returned. I shut the door, and he waited outside. When the prisoner came into the kitchen, I told him a black man wished to see him, and that if he must see him, he had better speak to him through the area-gate, as I thought my master would not like to hear any person going about the house at that improper time of night. He said it was very late, and returned to the drawing-room to my master. When he came down again, I asked him if the black man was gone, and what he wanted? he said, he was gone, and that he only wanted a direction that he had for him. I stopped in the kitchen a little while, and went up stairs to go to bed. I went into the drawing-room, to see if the fire was safe, and as I came out, I heard a gentle ring at the street - door. Expecting the prisoner to come up to answer the street - door, I leaned over the banisters till he came. He did not come up stairs, but I heard him open the kitchen door, which leads into the front area (it was barred before). I heard him unbar it, and shut it immediately. I was convinced that he had not time to speak to any person if they had wanted any thing. I felt curious to know what it could be, suspecting something, I took my light up stairs and left it there, and returned down stairs in the dark. I went to the top of the kitchen stairs and listened, and was quite certain that I heard another voice talking, as well as the prisoner's, in his room. I went up to my master, and told him what I had observed. He went down without me, and I heard my master tell the prisoner of the ring at the bell. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210038"/>prisoner said it was Edward (a man who had been employed there) gone out. I then called out that it was not so, and he did not contradict me - I knew Edward had been gone sometime before. The second time that my master went down I went with him, and saw the negro; I opened the street-door and let him out, fearing that my master would shoot him.</p>
               <p>JAMES DUNHAM. I am a constable. On the 16th of May, the prisoner was given into my charge - He gave me the key of his box. I opened it, with Mr. Metcalf, and found the articles stated in the indictment in his boxes - I borke one box open. I searched him - He gave me a bottle label out of his pocket, and said he had taken it to be mended.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The black man called upon me for some money that I owed him; while I was talking to him, I heard some person coming down stairs, which alarmed me, and I, imprudently, instead of explaining it, denied that he was there. I placed the property where it was found for safety. <rs id="t18170521-119-verdict603" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>EDWARD LOWE. On the 13th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner passed my door with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210040"/>a sack on his back, with somthing in it, which I took to be bread, I was going to stop him, when a Jew came up, and said he saw him fill the sack with loaves, from a barrow in Howland-mews. I followed him, and stopped him in Foley-street, and insisted on his taking the sack back to where he got it from; when he got to the place a great mob assembled, and endeavoured to rescue him. I detained him, and kept him there for sometime, thinking the man would come back, and then took him to the watchhouse, with great difficulty.

About six o'clock the next morning I found it plundered of the articles stated in the indictment, which were all safe the night before; I observed the foot marks of two different persons, one of them had nails in the sole of the foot. I was present when the prisoner's shoe was fitted to the marks-it tallied.</p>
               <p>JAMES FARE. I am servant to Mr. Druce, and attended the rabbits. On the 2d of May, I missed twenty-one, and saw them again the same evening - They were a particular breed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's house, in Fulham-fields, about half a mile from Mr. Druce's, and found the prisoner in the garden hocing-the moment he saw Welch, who was with me, he threw his hoe down, and ran off towards the back of the house. I secured him, and asked him why he ran away? he said he was going to the fair; we searched the house, and found eleven rabbits-there were more, but we could not catch them; we found the seeds in the house. When Welch was taking them down, the prisoner said," there is nothing there belonging to you." We found about 400 cauliflower-plants concealed under some rubbish in the garden, and some flowers; the rest of the things were concealed about the garden. The next day we went to Mr. Druce's to look at the foot-marks, and the print of nails in the sole of the shoe. I took the prisoner's shoe and compared it, it exactly fitted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner's father, who lived in the house, has absconded. I did not count thenails in the shoe.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with the last witness, on the 2d of May, at the prisoner's father's house, and saw the prisoner hoeing, he ran off - We secured him; he said he was going to the fair. Brookgreen fair was held at that time. We found the things as Westcoat as described. The next morning I compared the prisoner's shoe with the foot-marks where the cauliflowers had been taken from, it exactly corresponded with one set; there were some nails in the marks, and the nails in the shoe fitted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not count the nails.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELCH. I am a gardener. I went with the officers. The prisoner's father rents the house and land. The moment the prisoner saw me he ran off. I saw the things found as described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His father lives in the house - I did not know that the prisoner lived there.</p>
               <p>EDMUND PAVNTER. I am a gardener, and live at Fulham. I knew the prisoner lived with his father. I have been in his garden - He has no means of raising young potatoes at this early season.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I see the ground every day; the potatoes could not be raised in natural ground.</p>

On the 1st of May, I was looking over the hedge, and saw the prisoner digging a hole, when he had finished he got into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210041"/>into the hole, lifted a deal box out, and a canvas cloth, he then filled the hole up, took the box and the cloth, and walked past his father, who was at work in the grounds, and carried them to the pig-sty, he then moved two sliding boards and put the box into the sty; his younger brother, who is about twelve years of age, was with him. His father could see him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WELCH. I am gardener to Mr. Brown, who lives about half a mile from the prisoner's house. On the 29th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, when I came I found the gate broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone; on the 2d of May, I went with the officer, and saw the prisoner in the garden, as I stated before, and found part of the property concealed under the floor in the house, and the rest of the things in different parts-the seeds hung against the wall, and had my hand-writing on the papers. The prisoner said there was nothing there belonging to me, and that he had had the seeds more than three months. I found the mats in an empty well, and am quite sure they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>LEWIS LEWIS. I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the 4th of May, I was in Crown-street, - the prisoner, Edwards, keeps an old iron shop there; I saw the prisoners, Hooper and Edwards, with a piece of floor-cloth; having been in that trade myself I noticed it, and by the mark on it, I knew it to be Messrs. Harvey and Knight's manufacture. I followed them about five minutes, they went to Abrahams's house, the door was immediately shut, and I went away to Mr. Harvey's; the next day I got a search-warrant, went to Abrahams's, and found the same floor-cloth by his bedside, in a sack; he came home in about an hour, and Limbrick asked him how he came by it? he said he did not know how it came there. It had no sack on it when I saw the prisoners, Hooper and Edwards, with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. His bedroom is on the same floor as the shop. I saw his cart in St. Giles's between one and two o'clock, on the Sunday. Edwards carried the floor-cloth, and Hooper was with him. I am sure they are the two men. Abrahams was not in the cart when I saw it. There are only two rooms in Abrahams's house.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LIMBRICK. I was with Lewis, and found the cloth by the bedside.</p>
               <p>JASPER KNIGHT. I am a floor-cloth manufacturer, in partnership with John Harvey. Lewis came to me, and I missed the cloth. Edwards had been in my service.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HOOPER'S Defence. I found it in Britannia-row - A man told me I could sell in Crown-street. I took it there, and sold it. A woman came to the door, and said the man was not at home, but that I might leave it till he came; the next day I went there, and she said her husband was taken up for it. I told her I would go to the office and say I had found it. I went, and as I was coming back I was also taken.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM'S Defence. I was in Whitechapel that morning. My wife said nothing to me about it.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 9th of May, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw a person knocking at a door in Phillip-street - he seemed very much agitated, and repeated his knocks and called out. Before I got up to him, he had got in; he had a bundle with him. I suspected all was not right. I listened, and heard a man and a woman talking. I stopped for a few minutes, and heard the street-door open and shut, and looked round and saw a man come from the door, and go towards Thomas-street. He met another man - They both returned talking together. When they came within about twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210043"/>yards of me, I went up to them, and asked them what they had got? Hoffman was one of them and Gibbon, the other, had a bundle under his arm. He said he was going on board a ship, and that he had loaves. I seized him and said, "they are loaves of sugar." I secured him, and Gibbon got away. I do not know who the man was that went into the house.</p>

               <p>ANN GULLEN. My husband is a cooper. On the 28th of January, two men brought a cask to our house to sell - I told them I would not buy it; they then asked to leave it there for a few minutes. I believe they both asked me to let them leave it.</p>

               <p>JOHN SMALLMAN. On the 28th of January, I saw the prisoner with the firkin on his shoulder, in White's-row, Spitalfields; he took it into Gullen's shop. I went in with him, and afterwards told the drayman.</p>

On the 30th of April, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I discovered that the lead had been taken from the roof of the scullery, with the water-pipe and bason - I had seen them safe two or three days before. I found it at Mr. Vidler's, and on comparing it with the place it exactly fitted.</p>
               <p>JOHN DRAKE. I am servant to Mr. Vidler, who is a coach-smith. On the 30th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in a field behind Mr. Hodges's house, with three or four pieces of leaden pipe in his hand - He appeared to be coming from the back of the premises. I stopped him, and told him he was going the way to the gallows - He made me no answer - I knew him before. I let him go about his business. I found about thirty pounds of lead concealed under some timber in the field - He came from that way. I afterwards saw it fitted to the building-it exactly corresponded.</p>
