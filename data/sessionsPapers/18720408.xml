               <p>thence took about two yards of blue cloth—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the goods—I said "Good God, Alfred, did you forfeit character and Situation for a trifle like that? how long has this been going on?"—he replied "Only two or three weeks"—I asked what he had done with the things that he had taken—he said he had sold them—I asked who to—he said to a Mr. Fel<lb/>lowes—I asked the residence of this Mr. Fellowes, which he told me—he was then given into custody—he began to cry and begged forgiveness, not for himself, but for his wife and family—up to that time I was not aware that he was married—I afterwards went with the officers Green and Row<lb/>botham to Fellowes house—he keeps a little tailor's shop in Golden Lane, St. Luke's (he has also another shop at Notting Hill, which I was not then aware of), when we entered the shop Fellowes was there; there being two or three persons there, Green told him that he wanted to speak to him privately, upon which he asked us into the back-yard; Green then told him what he was and the nature of our business—he stood still for some time without answering—at last Green told him that he had Claridge in custody for stealing a lot of cloth from his employers, and he had every reason to believe from what Claridge had stated, that he had purchased them of him—he then said "Well, I suppose it is no use"—he then took us back into the shop and said "What do you want?"—Green said he wanted some blue cloth, or any other things that he had purchased of Claridge, upon which he com<lb/>menced routing about some pieces on a board, and produced a remnant of black cotton velvet, which I swore to the best of my belief was the pro<lb/>perty of my employers—Green said "Now then, we want some blue cloth which you purchased of Claridge "—upon that he took Green upstairs into the second floor, leaving me and the other officer in the shop—after some few minutes I was called up by Green, who showed me four lengths of blue cloth, which Fellowes acknowledged that he had purchased of Claridge, and asked me if I could recognise them—I immediately swore on examining them, to the best of my belief they were also the property of my employer—Green then told me to look about the room and see if I could see any<lb/>thing else that I could recognise—I searched about the room, there were lots of pieces of stuff strewed about in nooks and corners; it was more like a lumber room, and I picked out several pieces of black cloth, and black doe and other things, which I also swore to the best of my belief was the property of my employer, and which Fellowes said he had purchased of Claridge; I picked out and took away twenty-seven pieces of cloth, twelve pieces of velvet, four pieces of Alpaca, one piece of Russell cord, and a quantity of lining, which are now produced—they are in lengths that will cut garments—the value of them is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards went to the other shop in James Street, Pottery Lane, Notting Hill, and there found property which I identified, and which the officers brought away—there were about fourteen or fifteen pieces of cloth and tweed, no velvet there.</p>

I am a mechanical engineer of 90, Cannon Street—Mr. Aaron Andrews is a traveller for the firm, the sale of blocks would come entirely under his control—we also carry on business in the North—my first knowledge of the prisoner was through Mr. Andrews—it was in reference to a block that had been obtained from our firm—I think I had an interview with him on the 14th February—we discussed the question as to whether we could prosecute this man May, and he said if we did not prosecute, Riley who had the block would give it us back again for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer N</hi>). On the morning of 6th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I received information, and went to the church—I found the safe broken open, the lock broken off—there were marks on it showing that it had been prized up by this nail—Mr. Parry gave me this piece of rag, that might be used to put round the head of the nail to ease the mallet, so as to make no noise—the safe was an old one—in consequence of information, I went and watched the prisoner—I followed him all day long from one public-house to another—I found him first in the Carved Red Lion, at the corner of St. Peter Street, Essex Road, about 11 o'clock in the morning, and I followed him, till 10 o'clock at night, into nearly a dozen public-houses—he paid for nineteen pots of malt liquor—he did not drink it all himself—he had some companions with him—he paid for them—he did not change any gold—he paid generally in silver—the last house he was in was the Blue-coat Boy, in company with five other men—I went in there and told him I should charge him with breaking open an iron safe in St. John's Church, Duncan Terrace, and stealing there from 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, some foreign coins, a gold ring, and a purse—he said "I have got none of the sovereigns. If I am going to be locked up for this, I was there, but you must get the other two with me "—I went and searched a room where he lives in Parsley Court, and there found this piece of old quilt, which corresponds with the piece found in the safe—before the Magistrate the prisoner said "I hope you will settle it here. I plead guilty."—But Mr. Partridge said it was not a case for him to settle; it must go before a Jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I deny it. The Magistrate cautioned me that anything I said would be taken down. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was before that he said it—the Magis<lb/>trate cautioned him, and then he reserved his defence—I found no marks of violence on the church doors—I did not tell the prisoner there were two other men, and ask him who they were—he was dumb when I took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have been in search of two other men, one named Michael Kilrose, better known as <hi rend="italic">King Dick</hi>—I have not been able to find them—when anything like this is done, they go tramping—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the prisoner.</p>

I went to the church that night thinking there was service. As I was looking at the notice board outside, a man came up to me and said "Is Mr. Parry in the church?" I said "I don't know; I will go and ask for you." I went in and saw the old gentleman who minds the church and asked him, and he said Mr. Parry was not expected that night. I went out and told the man, and went to the corner of Duncan Street with him. I bid him good night, and went straight home, and at 11 o'clock I was in bed. My sister can prove it, and so can Mrs. Randall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw through a window, but I ran into the street after them—I am certain Price is the boy—I saw his face in the shop—ten minutes afterwards I saw him passing the shop in custody, and pointed him out to my master.</p>

When I went to bed an organ was playing outside, which was the reason I opened the window, and in opening it the string of the blind broke. She said "My husband has lost his watch." There was a tremendous row, and she ran up again and said that she was certain I was the man who stole the watch. I said "I have never been out of my room, and you are welcome to search it." The man is 81 years old, and she had to shove him up stairs. After I had been there some time, she came up and said that she could let my room for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a lady and gentleman if I would go. I refused, and then she came and said I had got the watch. The police concluded that I had thrown the watch out of my window because the window was up. The woman cannot swear that this is part of her husband's watch. She said that it was done in the dark, and there were other lodgers besides me.

On 30th October, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was driving a two-horse dray, with two wheels, over London Bridge, coming from the Borough—I was going about two miles an hour—I was sitting on the front plank of the dray, near the kerb—when I passed the crown of the bridge, looking towards King William Street, I saw a man and woman—I do not recognise the man—they were coming from the City towards me—I saw the man make a rush behind the woman with his arm up, likewise he gave her a shove that caused her to fall to the ground, and she came under<lb/>neath the dray—he shoved her by the back of the neck; as she dropped her head I saw his hand on the back of her neck, one hand—I pulled my horses up and eased the dray, for the people to take her out—I backed my horses as quick as possible—when she fell she was out of my sight, I could not see where she was—it was gas-light, but it was dark—I was on the western part of the bridge, and they were coming on the same side—the dray did not pass over her, or any part of her, if it had it would have cut her in halves—the dray and the load I had got weighed about two tons—I heard her scream once; that was as they were taking her from the wheel, just as I pulled up—I did not see what became of her afterwards—a police<lb/>man came up and took my name and address, but I did not know what he said to me or what I said to him—this is the first time I have been examined.</p>

Hoare &amp; Co.—on Monday night, 30th October, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was on the dray with Webber—I was sitting with my knees to the side, looking towards the City—I saw a woman and man coming along by the head of the first horse—I heard something, but what it was I could not hear, but when they came to the shaft I heard her call him a good-for-nothing blackguard, or a good-for-nothing vagabond—he put up his fist and said, "Go on with you," and he shoved her down—she went down the near side of the wheel, and he went down the off side—she fell between the kerb and the wheel, into the road, in front of the wheel, he fell on the pavement, not in the roadway—Webber pulled up at once, as fast as he could—I did not get off the dray—I could not get down either side—persons came up to assist, and I saw the woman taken into a recess of the bridge, I could not say who by—a police<lb/>man came up and told my mate to stop—I recognise the prisoner as the man who was with the woman.</p>

On Monday night, 30th October, I was on duty on the Southwark side of London Bridge—I was fetched across towards the London side, and found a woman in a recess and the prisoner standing in front—as soon as I got up I heard the prisoner ask if he should take her to the hospital, and I put the same question—she said "No, let me be taken home, but I can't walk"—the prisoner asked me to get the name and address of the drayman—I was in uniform—I turned to do so, and Mr. Crouch said "There is no fault attached to the drayman, policeman"—I took the name and address of the drayman, and he was allowed to go shortly after—the dray was then stopping in front of the recess, and Webber was sitting on the side—I asked the prisoner if he saw anything of it, he said yes, he was walking alongside—I told him I should require his name and address, and he gave it me as Walter Pettingell, 10, Manor Road, Bermondsey—I also took Crouch's name and address—by this time a cab had driven up to the side and the woman had been placed in it—the prisoner asked me if I had got the particulars—I said "Yes, are you going with her"—he said "Yes, it is my wife"—he got into the cab, and she was then driven to the hospital.</p>

I live at 60, Church Street, Great Grimsby, and am a journeyman tailor—I first saw the prisoner in May, 1871, at my house, he came with my aunt Mrs. Garnett, who introduced him as her husband—they were living at Cleathorpes, about two miles from Grimsby, as man and wife, in the name of Pettingell—on Sunday night 29th October, Mrs. Garnett came to my house and made a statement to me, and on Sunday evening I went over to Cleathorpes and found the house all locked up; I was not able to get in—the prisoner was there—I returned to Grimsby, and the following evening between 7 and 8 o'clock I went to the house again, and found my wife and Mrs. Garnett there—they had gone over in the morning—I believe the prisoner did nothing while he was living with Mrs. Garnett, she had a private income at that time I believe—on the Tuesday evening from 9 o'clock to 9.30 the prisoner came there—my wife and Mrs. Garnett were there; he said he had come from London—I noticed that his moustache and whiskers were shaved off—Mrs. Garnett asked him what he had done with her, meaning his wife—he said he had left her in London at Guy's Hospital; she would not trouble him for two or three months—(<hi rend="italic">The witness detailed in substance the evidence given by his wife</hi>)—The prisoner also said in the course of the conversation that he took good care she should never come back again—next day I asked him if he had done this for the purpose—at first he said "No," afterwards he said "Yes"—he left Clea<lb/>thorpes on Wednesday evening, and came over to my house at Grimsby—he remained there till Monday, in the name of James Smith—he then went to Manchester—he said he would write—on 1st December, I received this letter from him enclosing this card:—"Mr. Griffin, at Mr. Braggs, Sum<lb/>merfield Cottage, Cheetwood Strangeways, Manchester"—I wrote to him at that address, and afterwards received this letter of 13th December—the envelope has been destroyed—it is in the prisoner's writing—we did not give any information to the police until we heard of the inquest, that was on the 12th, and on the 13th my wife communicated with the police—I was too ill to do so.</p>

I am station-master at the New Holland Station, on the Manchester and Lincolnshire Railway—on Saturday, 28th October, I saw the prisoner there on the platform—the 4.15 train was detained two or three minutes while he was searching the station, and he then went in the train just as it was moving away—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I received a telegram from the next station, and soon after I saw the prisoner back again at my station with a woman—I told him he had, by jumping out of a train in motion, rendered himself liable to punish<lb/>ment, and asked him for his ticket—he said he had not got one—I said</p>

               <p>that was a second offence, and I told him that, from information given to me, he would be in worse trouble through representing himself as a detective officer—after some time he gave me his name and address, but from his manner in giving it I said I did not believe him—I wrote it down—it was "George Pettington; 174, Albion Street, Grimsby"—after some time he gave me his address as "4, Albion Cottages, Cleathorpes," but still as George Pettington—he remained at the station till half-past seven, or nearly eight o'clock, walking about with the same woman—I spoke to him frequently, and about half-past seven I said to him, "This is the last train to Grimsby or Cleathorpes; if you are going home it is your last chance to-night"—he replied that they were not going to Grimsby or Cleathorpes that night—he repeatedly begged me not to take proceedings against him—a few days after I received this letter from him.

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at the Whitechapel Work-house—on the evening of the 6th January a child was brought in—it is marked in the workhouse books as at 7 o'clock—it was between 7 and 8 o'clock—it was very cold, as if it had been exposed to the weather, and was suffering from the effects of exposure—its hands and feet were cold, and it seemed exhausted—its pulse was feeble—it lived thirteen days, and died on the 19th—during the whole of that time it got gradually weaker—there was an inquest and a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the cause of death was exposure—from the time the child came into the workhouse it never recovered from the effects of what I call exposure; it wasted—it took the breast for two days, and then it was too weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had a wet nurse for it as soon as it came—its clothes getting wet and its being carried through the cold wind did not do it any good—it died from wasting very rapidly—two months is a critical age—I think it was exposed a sufficient time to have great effect on its vital powers—waiting would be accelerated by exposure.</p>

I said "I must stop this," and I wrote—I don't recollect any cor<lb/>respondence from the prisoner—if we did receive a letter from him, we produce it—letters are opened before I arrive at the office in the morning—as far as I know, that is the only letter that I saw of the prisoner's—he never called after I wrote to him on the 24th—I wish he had.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">A letter, not dated, from the prisoner to Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went over the books with the prisoner, about a week or so after Snell's death—he said he had paid money to Snell, which Snell had not entered—he told me Snell would look over his list when he came back, and would tell him that he must not pay that sum in because there was a mistake in it, and that he would make it right—the day before the prisoner left he told me Mr. Wilson had called him into the counting-house and told him the charges, and had given him till the next morning to meet them—he said "If you were in my position would you go or stop?"—I said "Go"—he could give no explanation why he had not entered the sums in his own book.</p>

Rathbone &amp; Co., corn merchants—there is no internal communication between the two premises—the corn ware-house overhangs the street, so that you can let down corn from the ware-house into a cart underneath—about 6 o'clock on the evening of the 26th my attention was called to a horse and cart which was being driven by</p>

Rathbone's employ, and Aslin was delivery foreman there—on 26th February I arrived at the wharf at 6.30—the usual time for beginning work is 7 o'clock at both wharves, the corn wharf and the iron wharf—I saw Barker standing in Messrs. Golds' cart, under the loop-hole of Rathbone's, stowing corn away in the cart in sacks—I saw Aslin lower the sacks down from the second floor of Rathbone's granary—Aslin was by himself—I stood there about ten or twelve minutes—I was about seven feet from the wheel of the cart—I then went into a public-house called the Barley Mow, and had a cup of coffee—when I came out the cart was still there—I saw my foreman, Dyer, and called his attention to the cart—the prisoners were loading the cart at that time—Barker covered the load over with a sheet about ten minutes to 7 o'clock—he then turned the horses' head towards Blackfriars Bridge, and backed the cart against the stable gates, they burst open and the cart went in—the door was shut, and I did not see any more—I went to work—the coach-house is just inside the gates—I have known Barker for about eighteen years, and Aslin about three—I am quite sure they are the two men—I have always been on friendly terms with them—</p>

Gold and Messrs. Rathbone trade between one another sometimes—I have seen a cart of Messrs. Gold's at Messrs. Rathbone's with a load of dung to go to the country—I was not surprised to see the cart there so early—I have often seen the cart load there—I did not know there was anything wrong—I thought they were going to the governor's house.</p>

Rathbone's warehouse in Upper Thames Street—there might have been eight or ten sacks in the cart at the time I passed by—the sacks were coming from the loop-hole of Messrs. Rathbone's granary—I did not see who was lowering them—I did not look up—Riley called my attention to the cart, and I saw Barker in it, and the corn coming down, but I did not look up to see who it was at the loop-hole—I knew Aslin very little—he was almost a stranger to me—I knew him very well by sight, and I knew he was foreman at Messrs.

Rathbone then—Barker had no business with the cart on the evening of the 26th at all—the horse should have been in the stable, having done its day's work—I have seen the corn in Messrs. Rathbone's sacks—it had nothing to do with our firm—I knew nothing of the sacks being lowered from the loop-hole into Barker's cart—Hyams kept the key of the coach-house, but it was supposed to be empty—I did not know of any corn being there—Hyams absconded, and the coach-house was forced open, as he had the key.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They have been as often open as not when I came in the morning—I had to light the fires in the office, and I went up to the first floor to get the firewood—my ordinary work was to light the fires and sweep out the counting-house—that would take me an hour—I had to do all that before I went up in the granary—I can't tell whether Aslin was in the granary at all at that time—I can't say whether he or I came first that morning.</p>

I live at 30, George Street—I am a wood carver, in the employment of Mr. Broadwood—the prisoner was an apprentice—on 26th March I was in Mr. Broad wood's shop in Castle Street, it is on the second floor—it was about 8.5 or 8.10—there was a candle at one end of the shop—Mr. Antill was in the shop—the prisoner came in after him, and shortly afterwards I heard a noise as of someone falling over something at the further end of the shop—I then heard Mr. Antill cry for help, and a struggle—Mr. Broadwood went up first—there was only one light, and I wanted to get another—I then ran up—I saw the prisoner with his back against the wall, and Mr. Antill was holding him by the throat and by his right hand—this mallet was in the prisoner's hand—I took it from him—Mr. Broadwood had also got hold of the prisoner, he had run before me and I could not get close to him—both Mr. Antill and Mr. Broadwood had him—we got him out from between the panels—I saw a cut on Mr. Antill's head, and the blood was trickling down.</p>

               <p>21st February, I was employed by Mr. Meyers, of Houndsditch, to take a case to the Willow Walk Station, Long Lane, Barbican—he told me that Harper and Bacon were there with me to help me to get in on the truck—they afterwards went away, in Bishopsgate Street—I took the case to Long Lane, Barbican—I asked about the Brighton and South Coast Railway, and they told me to take it to the Railway Station, in Falcon Street—I did not know where I was—I met a man I knew by sight, and he told me to sell it—he said "I would net be bothered with them"—I then met a strange man, and he said he would buy them—we opened the case and showed him some of the things—he put some in a bag and said he would give me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I sold him part of the things for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then he fetched another man out of White cross Street, and he bought the remainder and the case for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he took the Case and all away—that was the last I saw of it—I only knew the men by sight—I don't know Turner—I did not know him till he was charged at Guildhall with us—I drank part of a bottle of champagne which was in the case, and the man that was with me had part.</p>

About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning, 24th February, I went with Wright to a lodging-house, in Turvill Street, Bethnal Green, and took Harper and Williams to the station—we passed Lockhardt; as we went out of the house he went in—Harper said that they had divided the money between them, and Bacon received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it—about 2.30 the same morning Lockhardt came to the station and said he wished to give himself up for being concerned with the other three prisoners—I asked him what three, and he said "Williams, Harper, and Bacon, for the robbery of Mr. Meyers' plate"—he was charged and detained—about 9 o'clock on Monday morning I went to Turner's house, which is about ten minutes' walk from where we took Williams and Harper—I went to the back of the house, and Wright and the other officers went up to Turner's room—I went down three steps and up a flight of stairs and I opened the door of a room and went in—I found all the goods with the exception of the wrappers—Wright afterwards asked him how he came in possession of them—he said he bought them of a man, he did not know who the man was, and when he was asked what he gave for them he made no reply—these wrappers were found in a cupboard in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 78, Kingsland Road—on Saturday night, 2nd March, about 10 o'clock, I was coming along Kings<lb/>land Road, and turned into a urinal—I turned out of it towards the rail<lb/>way arch, and the prisoner Marvin said to me "George, would you oblige me</p>

               <p>with a match?"—I said "I have not the pleasure of knowing you, but I will give you a match"—when I had done so he said "You will know me better now," and caught me by the throat and arm, and tried to throw me down—he whistled, and four men came up—Haynes and Homerton are two of them—they caught me by the legs and lifted me up—I thought they were going to throw me over the wall by the side of the canal—they kicked me and fumbled me all over, and tore my coat all to pieces—I turned over and said "I shall know every one of you "—they took my silver watch and two half-crowns and fourpence—my watch was fastened round my neck, and through a button-hole into my waistcoat pocket—they broke off a piece of the chain, and left the rest hanging round my neck, which was cut by the chain—I said "I shall know you again," and they turned me over, and all five kicked me in the ribs and between my legs, so that I was obliged to go to a doctor—they ran away towards the railway arch—I lay there, and the parties who passed did not assist me—ultimately a gentleman assisted me to get up, and I sat on the bridge till I got a little better, and another gen<lb/>tleman assisted me to the station-house, where I gave a description of the parties—Marvin then had a black moustache—I had seen Homerton before—I have no doubt that these are three of the men who robbed and assaulted me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Overman &amp; Sohon, merchants—I had not known the prisoner until I saw him in London, but I had dealt with the firm of Heymann &amp; Co. of Zurich, for eighteen months—during the last four months of last year, I had supplied them goods on credit to the amount of from 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have never been paid for—the exact amount the prisoner's firm was indebted to us at the time of the bankruptcy, was 1657<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received this letter from Heymann &amp; Co., dated the 16th November; it is in German; I will translate it: "In respectfully replying to your favour of the 13th instant, we think we ought to make an observation to you, that the information respecting us, which you had the kindness to give to Messrs. Stewart &amp; Macdonald, is rather insufficient, and therefore we are not astonished that the firm has hesitated to execute our order. Our working capital is beyond the sum of 150,000 francs, our own money, which Messrs. Delias &amp; Co., to whom our position is pretty well known, might confirm. Mr. Thomas Delias has only recently called upon us, and these gentlemen must also state to you the fact that in Switzerland one must give six, nine, and twelve months' credit, so as to be able to compete with other houses"—that letter is in the same writing as nearly all the letters we received from Heymann &amp; Co. (<hi rend="italic">The letter referred to was also read.</hi>) There was a remittance for 231<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods supplied before the four months, and is not to be deducted off my account—I believed that statement that he had a working capital of 150,000 francs—on the 30th November we supplied him with goods to the amount of 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and on the 29th December, 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the last invoice we stopped the goods in <hi rend="italic">transitu</hi>, and he is not accountable for them—I was in the chair at the meeting of creditors, and I eventually concurred in the prosecution of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 26, Chicksand Street, Brick Lane—on the night of 25th March, about 11.15, I was proceeding home with my daughter and son-in-law, and as I was coming along Colum<lb/>bia Place I saw the two prisoners Standing in the middle, about six or eight yards off—Ditton came up to within about two yards of me, and said "Go<lb/>vernor, do you know such a street?"—I said I did not, and as I took a second step to go home I was caught by the neck, and received a violent blow in the mouth from Joyce—as soon as I was on the ground the two fell on the top of me, and wanted to rob me—I halloaed out for assistance, which brought two persons up, and a woman called out "Oh, there is Mr. Krekel on the ground"—I held my watch, and they could not get that, but they got the ring off it, and when they saw the neighbours open their doors and windows they walked away—the blood fell down from my head, and since then I have been fit to do nothing—I have been very nervous all over—I lost so much blood.</p>

I am the wife of George Hill, of 10, Lumley Place—on Sunday night, 25th March, I was at my street door, listening to the clock striking eleven—I saw four or five rather rough-looking men come by my door, and I saw Mr. Krekel talking to a neighbour—I had just got inside my door when I heard him say "Good night"—I looked out of the door, and saw the two prisoners in front of him—I saw Joyce take him by the throat, and Ditton <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at his watch—I screamed "Murder! police!" and they ran up the court—my husband ran out, and asked what was the matter—I said "Look at Krekel"—he was lying in the gutter—I knew him—I was once a lodger of his—my husband went to lay hold of Ditton—he made use of bad language, and offered to hit my husband—Joyce turned round, and said "It is all right, governor"—my husband said "I don't think it is all right; I think it is all wrong."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th May to Lyson, Mead Vale, Reigate, enclosing an invoice for the two cloths and asking for a cheque for the amount, or a London reference, signed "Bedgington.</hi>") The prisoner called after that letter was written, and I then asked him what his name really was—I had the Directory before me, and we had found Mr. George Tyser, a gentleman living at Reigate, in the Directory—I said if so we should not trouble him for a reference, as we knew him to be a respectable man—he said "Yes, I have had dealings with you before"—I think the address of Mr. Tyser was Parkside, Reigate—I said that I knew Mr. Tyser as a customer—he said "Oh, I have had goods of you before; it is quite right" I found that Mead Vale was a district, and so I did not think there was anything wrong with the address—believing that he was Mr. Tyser, of Parkside, Reigate, I sent off the things—they were sent down to Reigate, addressed to Mr. Tyser, by the South Eastern Railway—I gave instructions that the name in the order-book should be altered from Tyssen to Tyser, and it was altered—I have not seen anything of the cloths since nor of the money—I sent my collector down to Reigate, but he is not in London at present—I was afterwards sent for by Mr. Williams, and I saw the prisoner in a cab at London Bridge—that was the 22nd January—I had not seen or heard of him between May and January—I gave him into custody—the constable refused to detain him, because it was only a mis<lb/>demeanour—he was not detained; but he promised to surrender at the Police Court the next morning—I went there, but he did not make his appearance—I got a warrant, and he was afterwards taken into custody.</p>

               <p>my partner—I did not address the letter which was written myself—it was copied from the memorandum which the prisoner had written—it appeared to be Tyser or Lysen—it did not look like Tyser—on the last occasion I said that Mr. Tyser was a respectable man, and he did say "I have had things from you before," but he also said that he was Mr. Tyser—he said "I am the same man, and have I had things before"—Mr. Tyler's name was not in our books—it appears that he had been into our place, making inquiries about goods, and I was under the impression that his name was in the books, but on subsequent inquiry, I found I was wrong—I found Mr. Tyser's name in the Directory, and I had my hand on it at the time I spoke to the prisoner—I did not take his address down then, it had been given previously as "Mead Vale, Reigate"—Mr. Tyser's address was Parkside——the prisoner did not mention Parkside—that is the name of Mr. Tyser's house as it appears in the Directory.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I don't think the prisoner could see the address in the Directory from where he stood—I had it before me, and I asked him if he was Mr. George Tyser—I don't know that I mentioned the address—Mead Vale is a district, and Parkside is in that district.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman at Reigate Town station—on 26th May three packages of rick-cloths came to the station from the London Receiving House, addressed to Tysen, or Tyson—I have copied it in my book as Tysor—the address was Reigate—they remained at the station till 10th June—I know the prisoner by the name of Tyson—he came to the station two or three days after the goods had been lying there—he tore the old labels off; and re-labelled them "To Dorking station, till called for," in the name of Tyson—they were sent to Dorking station on 10th June, with other packages—when he came he walked up to the goods and said "These are my goods here," and he compared the labels with some writing he took from his pocket—he then said he wanted them all sent to Dorking—he paid the carriage that was due from London to Reigate, and I forwarded the charges on them to Dorking—my book shows from what station I received them, but not from whom—I did not get the labels, the prisoner took charge of them—I don't know where they came from, but I know that they were rick-cloths.</p>

It matters not to the policeman whether persons are convicted, so long as he gets them convicted. I should have escaped when I had the opportunity if I had been guilty. Colonel Henderson has the police to back him, and supplies them with funds to commit perjury. A man cannot come here and get justice. It is only proved that there was one piece, and that I did not utter with a guilty knowledge; and I have never been convicted of tender<lb/>ing counterfeit coin.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The witness being deaf and dumb, her evidence was interpreted.</hi>) I am the wife of Benjamin Freeman, of Fulham; he is an engraver—on the morning of the 12th February I went out about 12 o'clock—I returned at 8 o'clock, when I went to bed, about 11 o'clock, I missed several things, amongst others a dress—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I was married on 30th October, 1869—this is my wedding dress—it was made by my sister—she cut it out and I helped to make it—I am quite certain this is the dress—I know it by the trimming—it is in the same state now as it was when I lost it—there have been no alterations made in it that I can see—the boddice is different, and it is very dirty now, and this watch-pocket has been placed since—the lining under the arm is different—when I went up to bed I found the room untidy.</p>

On the night of 31st January this year, about 9.30 or 9.45, I was sent for by the Fire Brigade to a small fish shop kept by James Lawrence at 133, Larkhall Lane, Clapham—I went into the front room, first floor, with Mr. Dangerfield, of the Volun<lb/>teer Fire Brigade, which is close to the house—I found a bedstead with the tick, apparently without sheets or blankets, and very much burnt—I did not discover the remains of any sheets or blankets—there was a wash<lb/>hand stand, very much burnt, close to the bedstead—the room measured about 8 feet by 7—the floor was strewn with paper of a description similar to these advertising placards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a great deal of which was very much burnt—I marked this one at the time in the presence of the Fire Brigade—the paper smelt as if paraffin, or some oily substance, had been on it—it has that smell even now—there was a japan wood chest of drawers on the right going into the room, some of which were open, on the top of which I noticed the remains of what appeared to be a paraffin lamp, broken—I discovered the receptacle for the fluid of that lamp—there was a large heap of paper by the drawers, which was not burnt at the bottom, and I think it had caught fire from the top—the door of a cup<lb/>board was very much burnt; and in the left-hand corner of the room, at the other side of the fireplace, was a table under which were the re<lb/>mains of similar paper, all burnt—there were marks of fire all over the place—there was a quantity of paper on the landing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of it—it is burnt—I think the door was open, but it had been opened by the firemen—there was no track of paper or of burning from</p>

               <p>and am superintendent of the same brigade—on 31st January, about 9.50, I went to the fish-shop—I got there before the secretary—I discovered the fire, and immediately got a hand pump—the shop was entirely open—there is no sash; it is an open front—there were a few fish there—I went half<lb/>way up stairs, but could not get further, as the paper was in full blaze—I extinguished it, and went to the front room, and then to the back room—the bed, bedding, and palliasse were well alight—the palliasse was stuffed with straw and shavings—the bedstead was against the wall, and I had to pull it away to get the fire out—there was paper on the bed—the room door was closed when I went in—the bedstead was behind the door; you could only open the door at an angle of 45 degrees, because it came against the bedstead; it partially blocked the door—the paint on the outside of the door, on the landing, was a little blistered by the heat inside—the doors were about an inch and a half thick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman at 8, Borough Market—on Thurs<lb/>day, the 27th February, the female prisoner came to me and asked if I wanted to buy an umbrella—I said I did not—she then asked if I had anything that wanted mending—I said I had, and I fetched my umbrella—she said she would do it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it would only take two or three minutes to mend—when I turned my head she was gone—there was nothing said about her taking it away to do—I gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the umbrella—after she was remanded the male prisoner came and asked if I got the umbrella back, whether that would settle the case—I said "I will see about it," and I communicated with the police—he came again with it, and I told the beadle to take him to Stone's End station.</p>
