                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Stagg and Mantle, linen-drapers, in Leicester-square. The prisoner was in their employment—in consequence of something I had perceived, on 22nd Dec. I made a com<lb/>munication to Smith, another shopman, and on 24th, I and Arnold, and Jefferies, watched the conduct of the prisoner—it was the Monday before Christmas-day—we had a customer named Madame Routens—a little boy and girl used to come for things for her—they both came on the 24th, the girl came I think about two o'clock—I then made a communication to Jefferies—while the girl was waiting I saw the prisoner cut off three yards of velvet and put it under the counter, between some boxes—I saw him serve the little girl with a few trifling things—Mr. Mantle was in the shop at the time—after the little girl was gone I and Jefferies went to the place where I had seen him put the velvet, and found it there—that was not the usual and ordinary place to put goods—there was also a silk dress in the same place—Madame Routens' little boy came that day—I cannot say how long after the little girl had left, but I think about an hour—I saw the prisoner serve the boy with two pairs of gloves and a piece of lining—these are them(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when goods are sold to a customer on credit, it is the practice for the shopman to take the goods to the desk and get them entered separately by the entering clerk, and <hi rend="italic">called back</hi> by the shop-walker, or one of the shopmen, to see if the goods correspond with the entry—Mr. Smith was walking the shop at that time, Jefferies was there also—I saw the prisoner go to the entering clerk with the gloves and muslin—that was all he had—he then returned to the counter where the boy was standing, that is close by where I had seen the silk and</p>

                  </hi>. From a communication I had from my brother shopman, I watched the prisoner on 24th Dec—I did not see the velvet cut—from what Jefferies told me I went behind the counter and found the velvet and silk dress, they were not lying in a usual place for articles about to be sold—I saw Madame Routens' little girl come in; she was served by the prisoner with some wires and nets, such as we usually sell her—they are articles of very small value—after she had been served she left the shop—about an hour after that the boy came in—I continued to watch—at the time the boy came in Mr. Stagg was in the shop—I saw the boy served with some gloves and lining, articles of small value—I saw them entered—I was the shop-walker—after the goods had been entered the prisoner had another young man to call them back—I then returned to the place where the silk and velvet was—Mr. Stagg was then walking about the shop—the prisoner then put the lining and gloves, the velvet and silk, in paper, and gave it to the boy immediately—the velvet and silk remained under the counter, where the prisoner had placed them, until I saw them delivered to the boy—I saw the boy leave the shop, I sent Arnold to stop him—I was present when he was stopped on the pavement, and took him back into the shop with Arnold—I found the velvet and other articles with the boy; he was taken to the counting-house, the prisoner was sent for, he came, and Arnold asked him what the silk and velvet was—he said they were for Madame Routens—Arnold asked him if they were entered—he said they were—Arnold asked him who saw them backed—he said, "Jefferies;" Jefferies, who was present at the time, said, "No," he had only seen the lining and the gloves—the prisoner then said that the silk and velvet were going out on approbation—Arnold said they were entered after the boy had left the shop—I am not aware what the prisoner said to that—he said they had been ordered on the Sunday—Mr. Stagg sent for a constable, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>there, or Mr. Mantle—when the charge was made against the prisoner it was stated, in his hearing, that he had said the goods were ordered for Madame Routens on approbation—on that Madame Routens was sent for, and was examined on the part of the prosecution, and after being examined, the Magistrate dismissed the case—I am not aware when this indictment was preferred; I think last Session—I did not go before the Grand Jury, nor did Mr. Challis or Mr. Mantle; Mr. Stagg did—I have been nine years in the service—I was not aware when Madame Routens first became a customer—I do not know whether it was before the prisoner came; I do not think it was—she has been a customer from three to four years—I was not present at any time when she was introduced to the prisoner by Mr. Mantle as the person who was to supply her with goods—it was the duty of the prisoner, and one or two others in the house who spoke French, to supply the foreign customers—since the prisoner left we have been advertising for a young man who could speak French—I have not referred to the books to see whether Madame Routens was a customer before the prisoner came there—I dare say the books would show—we have fines in our shop—I do not remember the prisoner having been fined a shilling about a fortnight before this transaction—he has been fined a great many times—I do not remember his giving notice to Mr. Mantle of his intention to leave—I never heard of it—I did not know that he was in treaty for a shop near ours, after the Magistrate dismissed the charge—I have not heard of such a thing—I have never been to Madame Routens—I should say there are about forty young men in our shop—Madame Routens has been a good customer—I am not able to state whether it has been as much as 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it has been nothing very extensive—she bought her millinery—she is a milliner—I do not know whether she is in a large way of business.</p>

                  </hi>. In Dec. last I was an assistant to Messrs. Stagg and Mantle. In consequence of a communication I had, I watched the prisoner—I did not see Madame Routens' little girl come into the shop—I saw her in the shop, and saw the prisoner attending to her—I did not see him do anything with any velvet, I was informed by Challis—I afterwards saw the boy come—he sold the boy some gloves and muslin—he then went to the entering-clerk, came back, and put the velvet and silk with the muslin—I watched the boy out, and saw him brought back in custody—he was taken into the counting-house, and the prisoner was sent for—I did not see the prisoner do anything, or go anywhere, when the boy was brought back in custody, I followed him up to the counting-house, and did not see the prisoner till he came into the counting-house—I had called back the muslin</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040008"/>
               <p>and gloves for him—nothing else was called back at that time—when the prisoner was asked in the counting-house for whom the muslin and gloves were, he said they were for Madame Routens; that they were entered, and that I had cried them back—I immediately replied, "No, Bradley, I did not, I only heard the muslin and the gloves"—my attention was particularly called to see what he really did have entered—the entry-clerk called back from the book what he had entered, and I saw that there was nothing but the gloves and muslin on the counter at the same time—I listen to what is called out, and then I see that the articles produced correspond with what is called out—what was called out was merely the gloves and lining, and there was nothing else there, and nothing else was produced—the entering-desk is about from twelve to fifteen yards from where the prisoner put the velvet with the muslin.</p>

I was in the shop on 24th Dec.—I saw the girl in the shop—I afterwards saw the boy come in—I saw the prisoner cut the muslin off, and take it and the gloves to the desk—I did not see him cut the velvet; the silk was a dress length—I did not hear what the prisoner said to Salmon, the entering-clerk, he came back with the gloves and the muslin—he went behind the counter afterwards, and I saw him deliver a parcel—I then went and stopped the boy in the street, and brought him back—when the boy was brought back, the prisoner immediately left the counter, and went to the entering-desk—I did not hear what he did there—I went into the counting-house—I called the prisoner out of the entering-desk and told him I wanted to speak to him, and asked him to go up stairs into the counting-house with me—he did so—I then asked him who those goods were for that were lying open on the desk in the counting-house, pointing to the silk and velvet—he said they were for Madame Routens—I said, "Are they entered, Bradley?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who called them back?"—he said, "Jefferies"—Jefferies said, "No, Bradley, I beg your pardon, I did not"—up to this time he had not said anything about the goods being sent out on approbation—I asked when he had seen Madame Routens—he said the day previous—I said, "That was Sunday"—he said, "Yes"—I believe I said it was a curious day for doing business—he then said he had previously cut patterns off, and then afterwards he said they were entered on approbation to Madame Routens—I should say three yards of velvet would not be cut off to be sent out on approbation—this is the velvet and dress(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of the dress is 57<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the velvet 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—a length of velvet varies from fifty to sixty yards—a policeman was sent for, and the prisoner given into custody—I went to make inquiry of Madame Routens—</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The letter produced to Mr. Stagg was from Mr. Humphreys, the prison<lb/>er's attorney, and was as follows</hi>:—"Giltspur Chambers, 10th Feb., 1850. Gentlemen, we are instructed by Mr. William Bradley, your late shopman, to apply to you, in consequence of your having apprehended him upon an unfounded charge of stealing your property, and also of your having de<lb/>clined to pay him his wages due for the time during which he was in your service. You must be aware that his character has sustained, and must sustain considerable injury by your act; and trusting that a respectable house like yours will have no objection to replace him in as respectable a position as he was before your charge was made against him, we propose that you do, in writing, acknowledge that the charge made was so made from misappre<lb/>hension and misconception, and that you are satisfied, as the Magistrate was, that it was unfounded, and that you regret it ever was made; and fur<lb/>ther, that you do pay to him the wages due, being, as we are informed, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. If you comply with this suggestion, we shall recommend Mr. Bradley to be satisfied, and not to seek compensation for the injury he has sustained; if not, he has no alternative but to submit the whole matter for the consideration of a Jury."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Routens, and am a milliner and dress-maker, at Charles-street, Soho-square. I have lived there four years, and nearly two years in Lower John-street—I have dealt with Stagg and Mantle five years—I know the prisoner as a shopman there—during the last year I was a credit customer there—prior to that I was a ready-money customer—I became acquainted with the prisoner through Mr. Mantle—he told me, because I could not speak very good English, he would give me a young man to speak French to serve me—I found that the prisoner spoke French very well—at that time I could not speak English so well as I do now—during</p>

               <p>the whole of last year I had an account with Stagg and Mantle—I paid the bill in Dec.—I do not remember exactly the day—I have the receipts—I have known the prisoner ever since he has been there; not before—sometimes he has called on me of an evening to know if I had any orders, and sometimes he has called as a friend—he sometimes called on a Sunday—if we had a party, he was invited—I heard of this the same evening that he was taken up—I had given him an order on the Friday morning before Christmas-day to send me three yards of silk velvet, and also a half-mourning dress for a choice—if the dress suited me I was to keep it, and if it did not I was to send it back—he called in that evening to know if I wanted anything—on the Sunday following he called in the afternoon—I reproached him because he did not send me the goods—Sophia Martelli was present, and a Mrs. Rich; they are in my employment—on the Monday I sent to Stagg and Mantle's twice or three times—I sometimes send five or six times in the day—it depends on what things I want—if a customer came for anything which she wanted immediately I should send there for it if I had not got it—they knew this, and asked me several times if Mr. Bradley served me properly—they were well aware that I was in the habit of sending several times a day—I paid ready money before the account was opened—I should think my dealing with them has been between 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I remember on the Monday evening the prisoner was taken, a gentleman from Stagg and Mantle's and a policeman coming together to me—the policeman asked me if I had sent for any goods—I had not ordered the dress or velvet on the Monday or Friday—I meant to pay for the velvet, and that it should be entered at Stagg and Mantle's—if I had approved of the dress and kept it I should have paid Mr. Mantle for it—I never paid anybody but him in the shop—I was at Stagg and Mantle's myself once or twice a week—I have waited several times, when Bradley was serving other customers, that he might serve me—I never applied to any one else to serve me after Mr. Mantle introduced him to me—sometimes one of the partners served me if he was engaged—they well knew that the prisoner was appointed to serve me.</p>

Stagg and Mantle's young men were there—the prisoner called sometimes in the evening, but very seldom—Stagg and Mantle knew that he came to get orders, because I had asked Mr. Mantle how it was he never called on me, and he said, "I will call in some day"—he never did come; he looked outside the window, but never came in—I had an order to make bonnets of the velvet—I did not tell the prisoner that I had the order, I told him I wanted the velvet—he perfectly understood it was to be sent to me as a matter of sale—on the Monday I sent my little girl for some goods, and something of a small amount—I did not send her for the dress and velvet—I did not expect her to bring them back—she came back before the boy was sent—I think the boy was sent about seven in the evening—I do not remember that he was there at three—I do not know how he came to go at three, perhaps some of the young ladies sent him; they did so sometimes—I did not know that the boy was stopped till between ten and eleven at night—I sent him for one or two pair of gloves, for a lady who was waiting at the time in the shop to go to a concert—I did not send him, or anybody, that day for velvet or silk—I did not send for any muslin or any lining—when the policeman came, he asked me if I had sent for any goods—he did not say any date—I think the words he used were,</p>

On Monday, 28th Jan., I left that shop about three or four minutes before eleven in the evening—the guns and other things were then safe—I left my servant, Charlotte Rhodes, in charge of the shop—the door was shut when I went out, and I heard it bolted and locked, and I tried it after<lb/>wards—next morning, in consequence of information, I went there again a little after seven—I missed some guns and pistols from the shop-window—I have since seen them at the Featherstone-street station—their value was about 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found the prisoner in custody there—some of the guns and pistols have my name on them, as the maker—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is one of my make—there is no name on this pistol, but it is one I made—I have the fellow one at home—I have looked over all these, and am able to identify them all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The evidence of the policeman is very different to what it was at the police-court; it appears to me to be impossible for the property to have been obtained by violence, and therefore they must have been assisted in obtaining it by the parties in possession; the policeman's evidence is, that the premises were safe at quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, an hour when we may presume servants are on the alert; the sound of footsteps would be heard, and it is certainly monstrous to suppose that such a daring act could have been committed; the breaking of the shutter and large window would inevitably have alarmed the house, and this being done in the extraordinary short space of time, very forcibly shows to me that assistance must have been given by one or two of the inmates; the policeman who is not here passed the premises from half-past six to half-past seven, and the premises were perfectly safe; Curzon at first said he called at my house at half-past seven, and found the property. Now to account for the property in my lower room: I let my room to two young men, about twenty years of age on this morning, one a carpenter, and the other a cooper; I had seen them before in the neighbourhood, but did not know them. The court in which I lived was principally occupied by persons making use of one room as a work<lb/>shop. The two parties I let my room to I presume must have been in this affair, and by whom I have been made a dupe; whether they took my room with a guilty knowledge of this robbery being about to be committed, and with the intention of removing the property to their room, I cannot say; but about half an hour before the policeman came, I heard the door below opened and shut quickly, consequently I now conclude that the two parties had the property, and being hotly pursued by the police, to save themselves, rushed</p>

               <p>in, left the property, and immediately decamped; I was in bed when the policeman called.</p>

I went to bed soon after twelve o'clock—I went over the whole of the house—I was the last person up—on the landing on the first flight of stairs there is a door, and a window shuts down on it—it was safe, secured hy a bar and a lock—I am not quite sure whether the window-bolts were fastened, but the window was so stiff we could hardly move it, it had not been opened for a long time—the door opens on the leads which cover my back parlour, it abuts on some sheds and yards which lead into Seabrook's mews—a person could get to the window and door by coming over the buildings—the house communicates with a public-house yard—about half-past three I was awoke by the springing of a rattle—I got up, thinking there was a fire, but seeing nothing went to bed again—as the clock struck four I was aroused by the police, found the window open, and the bar removed—I let the police in—my secretary and book-case were broken open—a drawer had been turned over in the shop—a glass case, which had contained silver pencil-cases and gold pens, was emptied—I missed silver-mounted pen-holders and other things, value 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—to the best of my belief, this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—it laid on the dresser the night before.</p>

He had made no complaint to me of being ill the evening before—I lifted up my desk, and the key of the cup<lb/>board appeared to be in the situation I had left it on the Monday evening not at all disturbed—I took it, went in Mr. Cox's room to the closet, and was about to introduce the key into the lock, and found the door was broken open, and stood rather ajar, and the money I had deposited there was gone—Mr. Cox had not arrived—it was between five and ten minutes after ten—I went after the prisoner, and overtook him near the Elephant and Castle—he lives within five minutes walk of the Elephant and Castle—I think it was about a quarter before eleven o'clock when I came up to him—he was walk<lb/>ing very leisurely—I said, "This is a most unfortunate job, the cupboard is broken open, and the money is gone, come back to the office"—he made answer, "I can't help it, I am very unwell, I must go home"—I turned to him, and said, "What am I to do?"—he said, "Go to Mr. Cox's house"—with that I left him, and hastened back to the office—when I arrived, Mr. Cox was there—I saw in Mr. Cox's room the ironwork of a chisel or screw-driver lying on a chair, within two feet of the cupboard—I believe this is the instrument, but I made no mark on it—I did not touch it; I let it remain there.</p>

               <p>her what she was doing—she said, "I am thinning this gruel for Merritt to drink, he is so very thirsty"—the gruel was made of oatmeal, one of my little boys fetched it from the corn-chandler's, at her request, between ten and eleven in the morning, shortly after Merritt came home ill—I saw no more of either of them till ten minutes past nine at night when Mrs. Merritt came for me, I was in bed—I got up and dressed myself—I went with my husband and the prisoner into the deceased's bed-room, and found him in bed retching vio<lb/>lently—he complained of a burning pain in his chest, and a violent pain in his stomach—I gave him water half a dozen times or more—he asked my hus<lb/>band to fetch Mr. Toulmin—he left for that purpose, and shortly afterwards Mr. Frederick and Mr. Francis Toulmin came—the prisoner had come to me window at five, and said she was going to ask Mr. Toulmin to send Merritt something for the bile, but Merritt did not wish to see him—she went away, and shortly after returned, and said Mr. Toulmin was not at home, he had gone to dine at the Manor-house—she then went into her house—she came twice to me in the evening; the first time was between six and seven—I asked her how Merritt was—she said he was very bad—I said, "Have you not had any one to him?"—she said, "No, I will wait a little longer, as Merritt does not wish to have a medical man"—one of the children came to say that the father was sick, and wished to get out of bed, and she left—at half-past eight she came again—I was not in bed then—she said, "If I should want you during the night, Mrs. Gillett, will you come to me?"—I said, "Is Merritt so bad, and have you not had any medical gentleman to him?"—she said, "I have sent for Mr. Brooks, and he is out; I sent for Mr. Welch, and he refused to come, but sent two pills, which I gave to Merritt"—she said "I sent <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> (meaning her little boy) to Mr. Toulmin, and they wanted to send the child with a note to the Manor-house, but the child said he did not know where it was, and came back again"—I went to bed, and she went home, and at half-past nine she came and called me up, and I went and remained at the house till half-past twelve, when he died—I and the prisoner were present when he died, no one else—she remained there about half-an-hour after he died—she said, "How true Mr. Toulmin's words are! they always come to pass; because he always told me, if anything came to pass, he would go off like the snuff of a candle"—she went to the down<lb/>stairs front-room—there is no bed there—she sat up the whole of the night—there was a fire in that room all night—I sat up there too—about eight in the morning Mr. Urrey was sent for—I do not know who sent for him; a person said it was me; I was ill that morning; I do not recollect doing it—two women, named Geary and Patten, were with the prisoner besides me—Mr. Urrey soon came—there was a conversation between him and the prisoner—I do not know what passed—they were in the front room—Mr. Toulmin was present—nothing was said about the Society that I heard—he had a conversation with the prisoner and left—I remember a few days before, being at Mrs. Merritt's, it was on the 22nd; a person named Bartholomew had died on the 20th, and I said what a pity it was that Mrs. Bartholomew was left with such a family, and so near her confinement, and only to receive 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner said, "If anything should happen to Merritt, I shall be en<lb/>titled to the full benefit"—I was at the prisoner's house the day the surgeons opened the body—Mr. Toulmin was there—after it was opened, the prisoner asked me if I had asked Mr. Toulmin the cause of death—I said, "From what has passed between Mr. Hacon and Mr. Toulmin, there is not the least doubt that he has been poisoned"—she clasped her hands together, and said, "Do you think I am guilty, Mrs. Gillett?"—I said, "I don't doubt you"—the walked about the room in a very agitated manner, and seemed to be</p>

               <p>suffering a great deal in her mind—on the morning of the 28th, before the lnquest sat the first time, I went in to Mrs. Merritt's, and she said, "You know, Mrs. Gillett, that Annie and me (meaning her little girl) ate the remains of the gruel"—I said, "Don't say so, Mrs. Merritt, for I never saw any of you eat it"—she then said, "If you did not, Ashby did, and he can clear me; and Ashby ought to be the first witness before the Jury"—she said Ashby and Andrews (the summoning-officer) had mixed it up between them, and that Ashby was not wanted; that he ought to have been the first witness—that conversation took place on different occasions—what she said about Ashby being the first witness, was before the Inquest; it was between eleven and twelve, and the Inquest sat at 12—on the 31st, after the Inquest was adjourned, she came to my house, and asked me if I had heard that poison was found in Merritt's stomach—I said I had—she said, "I am innocent; he was a dear, good husband, and it was not likely I should do such a thing"—she then said, "Dear creature! if that is the case, he has done it by his own hand"—I said it was not very likely, as he had purchased a new pair of boots the night previous to his death—during the conversation Andrews came, and Mrs. Merritt said, "Mr. Andrews, Mrs. Gillett knows I ate the remains of the gruel"—I said, "I saw none of you eat it"—that was all that passed—I was there on Wednesday evening, 30th Jan., when she said, "Do you think, if I had any hand in his death, I should not have let him live until after the day when I should have received the full benefit?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bachelor of medicine and professor of chemistry, at the London Hospital. On 29th Jan. I received from Mr. Long a glass bottle and earthen jar—I entered on an analysis of their contents</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040065"/>
               <p>—I experimented on the contents of the bottle first, and detected eight grains and a half of white arsenic—by one course of experiments I reproduced the arsenic in a metallic form—it is in this tube (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the earthen jar contained part of a human stomach—I noticed a peculiar appearance in it, which I have noticed in cases of poisoning by arsenic—there was a very small portion of a whitish powder adhering to the inner lining of the stomach, too small a quantity to ascertain what it consisted of—I then examined the intestines that were in the jar—I subjected them to a chemical analysis—the result was the detection of a very small quantity of arsenic—there was also in the jar part of a human liver—I subjected about a quarter of a pound of it to experiment—(I say that, that you may form a judgment of the quantity in the entire liver,) and obtained a quantity of metallic arsenic (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was too minute a quantity to weigh—that in the stomach was the only quantity I weighed—that would be quite sufficient to produce death—I had an oppor<lb/>tunity of witnessing a case where two grains and a half killed—the general quantity would be eight grains—I look upon that as an average dose—it would generally be fatal—vomiting is almost invariably the consequence of arsenic introduced into the stomach—a person attacked in that way would be likely to throw up a portion of the arsenic—looking at the quantity I found, and the parts I found it in, in my judgment, the arsenic I found had been taken not more than two or three hours before death, but that is a mat<lb/>ter of opinion; a dose might have been given before—it would depend on many circumstances how soon it would find its way to the liver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About five grains of arsenic you say would cause death; do you mean taken together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or less; 2 1/2 grains have done so—I know nothing of this transaction, but from the examination—I found a very small portion in the liver; perhaps about 1—10th of a grain in a quarter of a pound of liver—a liver weighs about 5lbs. on an average—supposing it was equally diffused, there would be twenty times that quantity; that would be two grains—my observation in reference to the time it had been taken, has reference both to the stomach and liver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the data at all safe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I will tell yon why; I found in the sto<lb/>mach 8 1/2; grains of arsenic, and there was not much in the intestines; I con<lb/>clude, therefore, that there had not been time for it to have been passed into the intestines which would have been the case if it had been taken a long time before death; but there was only a trace in the intestines, so I conclude it was a very short time before death—that furnishes a data to me to form a judgment on the subject of hours—food remains in the stomach five hours before it passes into the intestines—I am able to say, that the contents of the stomach pass into the intestines within four, eight, or ten hours—from experiments which have been performed on living subjects, I have not the least doubt—I saw the intestines; they were in the jar; they did not appear to be influenced by arsenic; they were slightly red, and there were traces of arsenic; I have reduced something that was in the intestines into a metallic state—I experimented upon it, and found it was arsenic—it was destroyed in the experiment—I was obliged to submit it to experiment to prove it was arsenic—it is not likely I should find arsenic in the liver, without some being m the intestines—the time would not depend on the constitution of the person—digestion depends on the constitution, but I am speaking of the average—digestion is more or less rapid, according to the constitution of the person who has received the subject matter—I have heard of cases in which matters which would not digest have remained three or four days, but those were solid matters—I think liquids pass into the stomach under all circumstances within five hours, as they are imbibed—there is a valve, which prevents solid</p>

               <p>matters from passing into the stomach till they are digested—the arsenic was in a liquid state; all except a little white powder on the side of the stomach—I am obliged to have recourse to an average to form an opinion as to how long it would take—we have no means of dealing with an independent case, but by the average.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is a chemist and druggist, in Church-street, Hackney, about half a mile from where the deceased lived—I assist him in his business in the shop—I have known the prisoner from her having frequented the shop—on Saturday afternoon, 19th Jan., she entered the shop, and asked me at first for two pennyworth of arsenic, which I refused to let her have—nobody but me was in the shop when she came—she said, "Oh, your father knows me very well, he has often let me have it," and gave me her name—I did not remember it; but having heard her name since, I recollect that Merritt was the name she mentioned—I did not know her by name at the shop, only by sight—I did not take her name down, as I knew her well—I was about to serve her with two pennyworth of arsenic in one packet, when she said, "I want it in two separate pennyworths, one for myself, and one for my sister, who lives at a distance, and cannot procure it"—I asked her what she wanted it for—she said, "To poison some mice or rats"—I then put her up two separate pennyworths, about half-an-ounce in each packet—I did not weigh it—I labelled each packet "Poison," a printed label with large letters, and on the reverse side I wrote "Poison" twice, in case of accident; the packets were fastened with string—when she desired me to divide it, I was about reaching the bottle from the shelf, I do not think I had it down, I am quite sure a quantity of arsenic was not poured out—I put it in white papers, about this size (<hi rend="italic">folding a piece of paper to the size of an ordinary powder</hi>)—it was whiter paper than this—the half-ounce would pretty nearly fill the paper; it weighs very heavy—I cautioned her as to the use of it, saying she was not to put it on bread and butter, as children were apt to take it up—she said, "No, I cut a herring in two, and put it in the middle"</p>

               <p>we sell effervescing powders; they are the same colour as arsenic—white arsenic, divided into these portions, and folded in this way, would resemble effervescing powders externally—effervescing powders consist of two packets, one in blue paper, and the other in white, and one much larger than the other; the smaller is the white—she paid me, and left the shop—she had some pills at the same time—I observed nothing unusual in her manner—she was about the same as usual—she was not excited—she mentioned the death of her children, two I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the N division of police. On Satur<lb/>day, 2nd Feb., in consequence of instructions, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I went to the prisoner's house, in company with young Mr. Ground—when I got there, I said, "Mrs. Merritt, I have come here to ask you a few questions, which you can answer or not, as you think proper; but if you do answer them, I must make use of them elsewhere, for or against you"—I first told her I should like to have some other females present to to hear what I said—two other females came, besides one who was in the room with the prisoner; they were persons living in the neighbourhood—I am not aware of their names—when they came, I asked her whether she knew of any arsenic having been in her house lately—she said, "No"—I asked her whether her husband used any arsenic in his business, or for any other purpose—she said, "No"—I asked her whether she had purchased any arsenic lately—she said, "No, certainly not"—I then called young Mr. Ground in—she saw him, and became very pale, and exceedingly agitated—I said, "This young gentleman states that you purchased two pennyworth of arsenic of him about a fortnight since"—she said, "Well, I did, and I will tell you for what purpose"—she did not go on, for Mr. Ground left the house, and I went away directly, leaving her in the custody of a constable named Clark—when I returned, I took her to the station—on the way I asked her whether she had a sister living in the neighbourhood—she said, "No, I have a sister living at Brixton, named Carr; her husband is a twopenny postman"—I asked her whether she had purchased either of the packets of poison for her sister—she said, "No, I bought it for myself, and intended to take it, but thought better of it afterwards"—I asked if she had not taken it, what had become of it—she said, "I emptied one of the packets of powder into the other, and placed it in the cupboard, and burnt the paper containing the first packet"—she then added, "My husband was very fond of soda and acid powders, and used often to take them, which Mr. Coleman knows"—she remarked, "Shall I tell you what a woman said my husband said to her a short time ago?"—I said she had better reserve what she had to say before the Magistrate—she said a woman living down the Lea Bridge-road, who her husband owed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to, told her that her husband said he was often so troubled in his mind, that he had a good mind to throw himself into Clapton pond, or into the canal—I found a copy of the Rules of the Benefit Society in a drawer of a table at the prisoner's house, with Merritt's name on the title page—it was in consequence of what the pri<lb/>soner said that I looked for it.</p>

               <p>been to purchase arsenic a fortnight previously—on the morning of 2nd Feb., I desired be would go with me—I saw his father, and he told me his son had served the female; I had seen him the evening previous—the first time I went to Mr. Ground's house was the evening previous to my taking the pri<lb/>soner; that was all the conversation I bad with the elder Mr. Ground—I told young Mr. Ground that it was my wish that previous to his entering the prisoner's house there should berother females present, that he might be able to identify her if he could do so—I told him on his entering the room, if he did identify her he was to lift his hat and bend his bead towards her, as I wished to observe the expression of her countenance when she saw him—he said a female resembling the prisoner had purchased some arsenic a fortnight before; that was why I took him with me—I gave him an opportunity of seeing whether he could identify her or not, before questioning her.</p>

We worked together, and made three dozen cases; he told me to procure more money, and I went to some acquaintances of mine on the Wednesday evening, and borrowed more money, with which I bought paper, and bread, and other things that were wanted at home; I had been out alone on Monday and Tuesday, to sell them in New-street, Gravel-lane, and Hounds-ditch. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I lent the prisoner two shillings, and that he paid me again—that was all the money that passed between us—it is not true that I persuaded him to leave his former employ, to go about with me selling these things—I was working at Witz's, and he sold his business to me, and the prisoner came to me as an apprentice—he had not possession of the cases on two former days—I never intrusted my property to him alone—the cases which were done up and finished, I did not keep in the house, for fear they might be taken—I took them to my former employer, Mr. Witz; and there I always went with the prisoner when we went out to sell them; there we got them, and when we came back I left them there again—they did not belong to him, they were my sole property—when I established my own business, a relation of mine, and other acquaintances, lent me some money—I was not a servant to my former master, I had begun business on my own account—I paid my former master for the part he did to these three dozen cases, by making some other cases for him, and the difference he paid me in money.</p>

We had still to finish three dozen for our former master. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, they were left unfinished—I left my master on Saturday, when he had one dozen money-purses to finish—he was in want of silk—I offered to finish that one dozen for him, which I did not mind doing—my master it not here; he was at Worship-street, where he witnessed to my statement—he was sworn there—his name is Isaac Witz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When we were in Oxford-street he told me that times were very bad, and we would separate, and he intended to go abroad; I said, "How about my 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" and he said, "There are the two dozen cases. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not tell him that—he did not say to me, "How about the 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—I did not authorize him to dispose of these to make good any sum of money that he claimed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cattle-gate, Enfield. On 22nd Feb., I had three ducks and a drake in a shed near my house—the next morning two ducks were gone; these are them, I know them by the ring on their necks, and a little bit of white on their wings—I traced the footsteps of two men.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 113). On the morning of 23rd Feb. I heard of these ducks being missed, I went to where they had been kept, and traced the footsteps of two men upwards of two miles across the fields—they led me to the house of the prisoner's mother at Hadley—I knew the prisoners, and I had seen them round that neighbourhood before—I found two ducks in a room, and in the next room I found the prisoners and a third man, who I believe was their brother—I took the prisoners to the station—I took off their boots, and compared them with the footmarks—Isaac's boots had two rows of nails, and Joseph's had the nails half-worn off—I measured the lengths of the footsteps with a stick, and they corresponded exactly—I had seen the prisoners near the prosecutor's house on the 22nd, about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Rowlandson, of 83, Whitechapel-road. On 19th Feb.

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at 30, King-street, Drury-lane; in the same house with the prisoner and the de<lb/>ceased, Mary Ann M'Donald. On Monday, 4th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my room, which is only separated from the prisoner's by a thin wooden partition, I heard a wrangling between him and the deceased—they had been in and out all day, drinking and quarrelling, in consequence of the deceased having absented herself from her home—they returned about seven; and from the noise they made stumbling up the stairs, I presumed them to have been intoxicated, and I gave them a light, to enable them to unfasten their door—I heard them in conversation after they went in, but not apparently in anger—I did not pay much attention until I heard the deceased exclaim, "Now <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, it is my turn"—that was about ten minutes after they had been in their apartment—there was then a struggle, but no talking, then a momentary silence; and then I heard the deceased say, "I think, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, you have done enough; I bleed very much; give me my shawl, and let me go to the hospital"—I then heard footsteps leaving the room—I did not see the deceased again until the Friday following, the 8th; she was then very ill in bed—the prisoner was present—he appeared kind and atten<lb/>tive to her, and her manner was quite composed—she made no complaint whatever—she said very little—she was too ill to speak—she had been to the hospital and returned—I advised the prisoner to have medical aid at once; he had no means of getting it himself, but as soon as he could get medical aid from the parish he did, which was the following morning, and she was promptly attended to by Mr. Bennett, at the parish infirmary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College Hospital, in Por<lb/>tugal-street. I remember the deceased coming there—she gave her name as Mary Ann M'Donald—she had a wound over the left temple, from which she was bleeding very freely, and had lost a quantity of blood—it was about three-quarters of an inch long, and to the bone—it was a few inches above the left ear—it might have been inflicted by such an instrument as this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should say it was not such a wound as would be made by a fall against a chair—if she had the poker in her hand, and fell upon it, she might possibly have given it herself—she fainted once or, twice while I was dressing the wound—she was very anxious to go home that night, but she remained in the hospital till the next day—I considered she was not in a fit state to go home—I should say she was sober when she came to the hospital—she had been bleeding considerably—the whole of her things were saturated with blood—I did not see anything of the prisoner at the hospital—the deceased was brought there by two lads, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and her sister-in-law came for her next day—the wound was not in itself dangerous unless erysipelas supervened—erysipelas generally follows from scalp wounds—it depends very much on the state of the body and the extent of the wound, but all wounds on the head have a tendency to produce erysipelas—I did not see anything of her after she left the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of the parish of St. Giles. On Saturday, 9th Feb., I saw the deceased in the Infirmary of the workhouse, where she was removed after having been visited by the assistant-surgeon, who found her labouring under erysipelas of the head, and without any means of being properly attended to—I found her suffering from erysipelas of the head and face—on removing some plaister, which covered a spot about three inches above the left temple, I found an irregular-shaped wound, about three inches in circumference—the wound had sloughed, and the character of it had no doubt very much altered since its infliction—I should not think that at first it was a wound of any importance in itself, but erysipelas so frequently super<lb/>venes from injuries of that description that medical men attach more importance to scalp wounds than any other class of wounds, and an importance quite disproportionate to the extent of the wound at first—she remained in the Infirmary until 22nd Feb., when she died—the proximate cause of death was erysipelas, producing congestion of the brain, and effusion on the brain of about four ounces of serous fluid—that would be induced by some previous injury—the wound on the head was very likely to produce erysi<lb/>pelas, but I cannot distinctly state that it did produce it—I believe erysipelas occurs from atmospheric causes, and that it will not follow from any wound unless those atmospheric causes are prevailing, and the constitution of the patient is in a condition to absorb that poison, whatever it may be—in my experience I never found one solitary case of erysipelas; whenever it does occur it occurs in several cases, and I believe atmospheric causes influence it—the state of the blood and the body cause it, undoubtedly—a patient in a bad state of blood would be more disposed to absorb the poison—I believe that erysipelas is consequent upon atmospheric causes—I do not know what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040090"/>
               <p>those causes are—I do not mean exposure to the atmosphere, but the pecu<lb/>liar state of the atmosphere—it has been recently very prevalent in nearly all our hospitals, independent of external injury—I do not think it altogether depends on the state of the blood—a wound on the head, more than any other, would predispose a person to erysipelas.</p>

I recollect the deceased, Mary Ann M'Donald, being in the Infirmary of the workhouse—she died on Friday, 22nd Feb.—in con<lb/>sequence of her death I made inquiry at her late residence, on the Saturday afternoon—I saw Mrs. Dounes, and was asking her a few questions, when the prisoner and a woman came into Dounes' room—his room was locked—I asked the woman if she knew how it happened, and the prisoner made answer, and said, "It was done by the poker"—he then went into his own room; I followed him—he took this poker out of the fire-place, and held it up to show me the way in which the woman held it in her hand, saving that he was going to take it from her, and in doing so, he accidentally hit her on the head—I took possession of the poker, and have produced it to-day—an Inquest was held on the body—the prisoner expressed a wish to know when the Inquest was, that he might attend it—he was taken into custody that same evening, so that he could not attend.</p>

Look here, my head bleeds!" she then said, "Where is my shawl? Let me go somewhere and get it dressed; I gave her her shawl, and she went down-stairs; I laid down on the bed and went to sleep, not thinking she was hurt; I awoke about three o'clock, and not finding her in bed, I got up and struck a light; I saw some drops of blood about; I went down-stairs about seven o'clock, and then heard she was at the hospital, and that she was to be removed from the hospital, as it was full; she was brought home, and remained till the Saturday, when she was taken to the workhouse, where she remained till she died.</p>

William Sanderson, the rector of the place where the prisoner had lived for some years, were called for the defence—on the cross-examination of Mr. Sanderson, Mr. Bovill, who was for the plaintiff, surrendered his brief, aban<lb/>doned his case, and would not proceed with it any longer—Sir William Erle immediately directed the tipstaff to take the prisoner into custody, and ordered him to be taken to the Queen's Bench Prison for a week; and, addressing the Counsel for the defendant, said that he did so to afford the oppor<lb/>tunity of ulterior proceedings against him—I think those were the words he used—he was then taken, and he threw himself upon his knees, and said something which I was not near enough to hear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at New Timber, in Sussex. In 1847, and for some years before, I occupied a farm called Homestead Farm, in the parish of Cuckfield—I then had a slight knowledge of the prisoner—in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Scott, of Clerkenwell—he is infirm, and not able to attend to business—the prisoner had been in my service nearly four years—on 24th Jan., my attention was called to a ring by a lad named Popkins, who is in my service—I confined myself at home that day, watching the boy, fearing he had misinformed me—in the evening, after the prisoner and the other men had left, the boy remained, and I went in the shop, and found the ring where the boy had told me, hanging by the side of a bench, in a secret place, where it had no right to be—the prisoner worked in that shop, and could work at both the benches—I took the ring out, marked it with a file, and replaced it where it was—this is it—it is my husband's—I never gave the prisoner permission to take it off the premises—it was the prisoner's duty to pack clock cases, and to carry them out—on the 24th I directed him to take some, with two spring dial cases to Mr. Schwabe's in the London-road—they were in the shop from which he would have to take them—I went in before he began packing, to look at the goods—when he had got them packed, I went into the shop as he was tying the basket down, and I ordered him to take out two frames, which were to go to another customer—I said, "They are not to go till to-morrow, when I have more goods to send"—he took them out—I did not count the goods in the basket—this is one of the nine inch frames—I have marked it since—it has been given me by the policeman since—I know it to be my husband's—it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the ring about 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner had no right to have more than one dozen frames.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Scott. I went to Mr. Heitzman on 24th and got this frame from him—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—that was the price that he alleged he had given for it—it is my husband's—I made this mark "H" on it—I have had it in my custody since I had it from Mr. Heitzman—it is what is called a nine-inch frame—it is not finished—it is not in a state in which it would be ordinarily sold—it wants a piece of brass here, which we call a catch—here are three marks round this frame made by a chisel by the man who made the frame—if any other man made it, it would be marked by another chisel—this was made by the prisoner's father—I would not swear that I saw him make these marks on this, but I have seen him make marks on others—our men who make frames put particular marks on them—this is such a mark as the prisoner's father was in the habit of putting on the frames he made—the mark is three lines or rings, and this tool (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is a tool the prisoner used, to cut out these small pieces—I did not authorize the prisoner, on 22nd Jan., to sell this and another frame to Mr. Heitzman—he had no authority to take it to Mr. Heitzman either as a commission-agent, or in any other way—the prisoner was paid for piece-work, so much a dozen, and he had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for taking out and delivering goods—when he took goods he was to bring the basket back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mr. Heitzman is a customer of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner has brought me orders from him—I sent him to get orders, but he had no orders to take goods from my premises without my permission—he has taken goods from me to Mr. Heitzman frequently—Mr. Scott is in a state of imbecility—he goes and orders things in for me that he is capable of doing—he does a little writing in the books, but not at all times—if goods are sold to Mr. Heitzman, they are put in books first as sold, and afterwards as money received—my husband makes entries in the books when I wish him to do it—we have a book in which entry would be made of two frames sold to Mr. Heitzman, what we call the day-book—it is not kept in the work-shop,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040099"/>
               <p>but in the office—if the prisoner takes an order from Mr. Heitzman, he is to bring me word what he wants—if he brought word to my husband, he would tell me of it—there was no one to whom he could bring word but me and my husband—I never go out till evening—I have never brought this chisel for<lb/>ward before to-day—I knew of this frame when the prisoner was before the Magistrate—the Magistrate examined this case, and dismissed it—the pri<lb/>soner's father was examined, and denied turning that frame—Brazier was asked a question, and this frame was put into his hand, and into the prisoner's father's hand—the prisoner's father turned these frames for me—I do not know that he now turns them for himself—the father and son were taken into custody—Popkins was taken away from me; I do not know for what pur<lb/>pose—I had no wish for him to go—I had an inclination for the boy, and proposed to his parents to have him—they told me I should have him, but they took him away—I have not asked the boy about this frame, only what he told me—he was the first person who told me about it—he told me pre<lb/>vious to his telling about the ring—I threatened him about the whip if he did not tell the truth—I had nothing in my hand—it is a whip which I believe is called a <hi rend="italic">cat-o'-nine-tails</hi>—I have flogged him with it by permission of his parents—I did not threaten to flog him again when he told me about this ring and the frames, unless he told me the truth—I guarded him against telling me an untruth—I said I would punish him if he told me an untruth, and the Magistrate would likewise—I did not at the same time tell him I would give him a suit of clothes if he told the truth—I did not promise him anything of the kind—I did say I would not swear to this frame at the police-court, but having compared this tool to it, I will swear to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARNOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it on the Thursday you said you would chastise him if he did not tell you the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and on the following Satur<lb/>day I told him about the clothes—I sent him to Mr. Heitzman to know if he wanted any frames, and it was in consequence of the message that he brought that I went to Mr. Heitzman—till then I had no knowledge whatever that these frames had been sold to Mr. Heitzman—I went to Mr. Heitzman on the Thursday, and found the frame there—the prisoner went sometimes and got orders, and it was his duty to bring word to me what my customers wanted—he had no right to take goods out of my shop without my permission—he had not my permission to take these two cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I live at 48, St. John-square; I am a brass turner. Some time ago I worked in the service of Mr. Scott—the prisoner's father worked there also—the men who turn the frames, make marks on them—they used a chisel for that purpose—I should say when I worked there, the pri<lb/>soner's father made this frame—this is the mark he used to mark them with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that others might not make these marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should say that any tool run round here would make these marks—some mark inside, and some mark outside—the prisoner's father always made them in the middle, as this is—other shops have them made, but they have their private marks to them—some make no marks—it is nearly two years since I worked there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Garden-row, Knightsbridge. On the evening of 4th March, a little after twelve o'clock at night, I was in Sloane-street, going home—I was quite drunk—I was knocked down in Sloane-street, and a man put his hand in my pocket—I am sure there was a man there, he came close in front of me; it was the prisoner—I had my senses sufficiently about me to mind the man so as to know him again—he got his hand in my pocket—I seized his hand; he got it away, struck me on the face, and knocked me down—what he took out I don't know—when I left home, about eight in the morning, I had two crowns, two half-crowns, and three shillings—I drank some spirits in the forepart of the day—I drank very little afterwards but beer—after I had been knocked down, the policeman came, and I told him that a man in livery had knocked me down—I know that I had changed one crown-piece—I cannot swear what was the last time I had my money—I left the Clock House about five—I think I then went to Pimlico—I think I must have been in some public-houses after that, before I was in Sloane-street—I was quite drunk, but my senses had not left me—I do not believe I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

"he said, "It is all right"—I said, "I don't know that, stop!"—he said, "I have got the carriage to get ready; good-night"—I knew him to be a private in the Grenadier Guards, and servant to Captain West—he went on, and I went back to the prosecutor, who was endeavouring to rise—I knew he did not fall down himself, I saw the arm go out when he fell—his nose was bleeding very much—he was drunk, but still appeared sensible in what he had got to say—he told me what occurred, and 1 went to the stable where the prisoner was—I knocked, the prisoner came—he said he should not open the door unless I told him what for—I said, the man he had knocked down in Sloane-street accused him of robbing him of five shillings—he said, "It is only one"—putting his arm out, and giving me a shilling, he said, "Take it, and make it all right, as you know me"—I got my foot in at the door, and dragged him out with some difficulty—he persuaded me to let him go—I said, it was what I could not do—I took him to the prosecutor, and he said, "That is the man that robbed me, and knocked me down"—the prisoner said, "That is the fruit of getting into such company; I have been drinking with him at the Prince of Wales"—the prosecutor said he had the crown-piece, that he did not remember to have changed, and some other money—I searched the pri<lb/>soner at the station, and found two half-crowns and one penny-piece on him.</p>

On 20th Feb., I was by the George, and saw the prisoners with a wagon and three horses—one of them took a quantity of corn in a sack from the wagon and handed it to the other, who put it on the shaft, and then took it into the stable of the George, and handed it to the assistant to the horse-keeper, William Pledger—I went in and asked the man for the sack, and got it—the corn had been shot into the bin—it was taken out and put into the sack again—I took a handful of corn out of the nose-bag, and it exactly corresponded with that in the sack.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, of High-street, Deptford. On 23rd Feb., about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked my apprentice to show her some satin ribbon—the box was put before her to select the colour and width—she purchased one yard, at three farthings a yard—the apprentice cut the ribbon, and was in the act of putting the box back, when the prisoner said, "Stay a minute, my little dear; I will take one more yard," and while he was reaching for the yard-stick I saw her take one piece of ribbon out—she laid it on the counter for five minutes, covered with her hand, till she got an opportunity of putting it under her cuff—I saw her draw the cuff down, and take it up—I told her to step to the other end of the shop—I said I was very sorry, but I saw her take and conceal a piece of ribbon—she said I was a good-for-nothing fellow to accuse a lady—I told her to draw off her right-hand cuff, and the ribbon dropped out.</p>

                  </hi>. I perform the duty of a landing-waster at the Custom House, and live at Pitt's-place, Old Kent-road. I became acquainted with the prisoner in consequence of her coming to me and making inquiries about her husband, who she represented to have died during her absence from this country—she stated that he had been an interpreter at the Custom House, and was well known by those who were in the habit of frequenting there—she stated that the person with whom her husband resided refused to give up his effects, and she wished to know what means would he proper to use to recover possession of them—I gave her my address, having referred her to the Consul, telling her that I knew the secretary of the French Beneficent So<lb/>ciety, and that I would endeavour to obtain the restitution of her goods in the event of her not obtaining them through the medium of the Consul—I re<lb/>lieved her from time to time with money and food, and eventually, from an accident which she alleged to have received while carrying a message from my residence, which enabled her to obtain employment in needlework from a Quaker in London-wall, who gives it to distressed persons from motives of charity; I became security for the return of those goods, and she was unable to present herself, on account of this accident, and I therefore took her into into my service until the injury she had received should he cured, and during that period she committed this robbery—altogether she was in the house ten or twelve days—on the last day, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the morning, she appeared to wish to get rid of me; exhibited a great deal of impatience for me to leave, and told me it was late; when I got outside, I found that I was not so late, but I had come out without my watch, and I went back to get it, and had then time to go leisurely to my duty—on my return home at half-past four, I found a hot joint prepared ready for dinner, but the prisoner was gone—I noticed a bit of wood chipped off the lock of one of my drawers, and I immediately found that a purse which it then contained had been emptied of its contents; a gold watch and other articles were also missing—26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In gold, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In silver—the owner of the house, Miss Dummer, and her sisters, reside in the house, myself, and another gentleman and lady—from something I ascertained from Miss Dum<lb/>mer, I went immediately, having first informed the police; to the Electric Telegraph Office, and gave a description of her, and she was stopped at Folkestone—while I was wasting at the office, I received a paper, telling me that she was arrested, on the train, which was then on its way, arriving at Folkestone—they sent me word, within a quarter of an hour from my arrival at the office, that she was in custody—I then went to Folkestone, and iden<lb/>tified her—about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found on her, and a quantity of dresses, hosiery, and other goods, the produce of part of the money which she had expended, a gold watch, and the top of a smelling-bottle—I subsequently found other things—it appears that she had taken too much to drink, and she lost one parcel of goods on the road, which, by the diligence of the officer, I have succeeded in obtaining—when I charged her with stealing the money and watch, she at first said nothing—she afterwards said, "You gave them to me, to set me up in my own country"—I said, "This is base ingratitude on your part"—she said, "It is God's truth"—I spoke to her in French, and she replied in French—I asked her what had become of the remainder of the property—she said she only had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I had given her that amount with the watch—she said she was going to Dover—at that time she was very</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased John Boyle, and reside at 30, Francis-street, Westminster-road. On Sunday night, 24th Feb., my husband left home, between six and seven o'clock, with Morris Ryan, to go to a meeting at Vauxhall—about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve my sister-in-law called me out of bed—I went out of the house, and saw my husband, the prisoner Morris Ryan, Mrs. Quinlan, his daughter, and Mrs. Flood, at Riley's door, which is about forty yards, as near as I can say, from our house—Riley and my husband were having some words—I tapped Riley on the back, and said, "Patrick Riley, what is the matter with you and my husband, two men working together?"—with that I fetched my husband over, and said, "John, what is the matter?"—he said, "Nothing,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040117"/>
               <p>my dear"—he opened his hands, and said, "Patrick Riley, what do you want of me?"—with that Riley stripped off his jacket, and my husband said to Ryan, "Take my cout and hat"—they each took off their coats, and my husband struck Riley twice with his fist—Riley <hi rend="italic">wheeled</hi> out into the middle of the street before his own door, lifted up his right hand, sprang on his left foot and hit my husband, whose back was turned to him—whether it was on the head or shoulder, I do not know—he then went in doors—the policeman came up, and the words were over—my husband went up to the lamp, and walked a little way, and said to Ryan, "Where is my coat and hat?"—Ryan said, "It is all right, my daughter has got it"—he came down to the lamp, looked up, and was going to fall back, but the policeman, Mrs. Flood, and Ryan caught him—they hallooed out for water—I went in and fetched it, and the policeman put it up to his mouth, and he did not drink it, so I ran for the clergy, and rang the bell—I could get no answer, and when I came back my husband was dead—that was not more than five minutes after the blow—I saw no other blows than I have stated—I saw all that took place—the prisoner and my husband had worked together for nine or ten months, and were always good friends, as far as I understand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Mount-street, West<lb/>minster-road. I was called to see the deceased on the 25th Feb., and on the 27th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was a very slight mark on the left side of the neck, and a slight mark just above the left temple—I attri<lb/>buted those marks to violence—a fall or blow might have produced them; or catching the man by the collar, and shoving him, might do it, by forcing the hand against the neck—in consequence of seeing the mark over the left temple, I made a deeper dissection there, and found more evident marks of violence under the temporal muscle of that side, but still not sufficient to account for death—pursuing the examination I discovered that the man had disease of the heart—enlargement of the heart, with a dilatation of the ventri<lb/>cles; the other appearances were healthy—the immediate cause of death was disease of the heart—a person with that disease would be likely to have death accelerated, or caused suddenly, by anything acting on the nerves; fear, alarm, excitement, or a blow—it was a very considerable disease—he might not, without some such cause, have died immediately, but he ultimately would have died from that disease—I think it is more than probable that he might not have died then, if pursuing his ordinary quiet avocations; but I cannot state that positively—I could not trace any personal violence as having caused his death.—(<hi rend="italic">At the suggestion of the</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at Wandsworth, and had charge of a farm for Mr. Beaumont. I occupied and slept in the farm-house alone—on Tuesday, 12th Feb., between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I went out to work leaving the house securely fastened—I returned at a quarter past twelve, and on opening the front-door, I noticed a key lying in the passage—it was the key of the kitchen-door, which I had left in it—the kitchen-door was closed to, but the lock had been forced back—I noticed a square of glass in the window broken, opposite the fastening, so as to enable a person to remove the fastening, and by that means the window might he opened to admit a person; there were marks on the kitchen-door—I found a knife and fork of mine bent, as if they had been used for some purpose—I missed a black and a red silk handkerchief from my bed-room, a German-silver spoon, and a chimney ornament—there were footmarks on the ground outside the kitchen window—I afterwards saw the police-sergeant compare the marks with the marks made by a pair of boots, and the boots appeared capable of making such marks as those I had observed.</p>

I went to Dunneford Farm, and found two footmarks outside the kitchen window, and another impression about a dozen paces off—I covered them over, to preserve them from the wet—the house is about fifty yards from the high-road, and enclosed by a fence—I assisted in apprehending the prisoners—I took Thomas Hill at his father's house—he said, if I wasted till he came out of the house, he would tell me all about it—I brought him out, and cautioned him, that what he did say I should have to use either for or against him—he said he would tell the truth, that he had been to Salter's, the match manufacturers; from thence he went to the farm-house, where Walter got a piece of wood, broke a square of glass, and Walter Hill and Cooley got inside, while he remained outside; on coming out, Cooley gave him a black handkerchief, which was in his possession when they were stopped in the park; and on Cooley returning, after being stopped by the policeman, he had made him give him the handkerchief back, and told him he would be d—d if he should have any part of it—Walter Hill and Cooley denied having gone nearer the farm than Castle's house—there is a person named Castle lives down the lane—I took possession of their boots, and made a comparison in the prosecutor's and Hodder's presence—I made fresh indentations with the boots close to the marks in the ground, and they appeared to me to make marks precisely the same as the others—I have the boots, they are very remarkable—Walter Hill's and Cooley's boots fitted the marks close under the window, and Thomas Hill's fitted the marks about eleven or twelve paces from the house—I have not the least doubt that the marks were made by the prisoners' boots—Walter goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tig</hi> Hill—that was what Thomas called him—when they were in the cell, I heard Cooley say he supposed they should get off with twelve months at Brixton;</p>

death—it was such an injury as would he caused by a blow, or the falling of a heavy weight on that part—in other respects, he appeared to be perfectly healthy—I found no other bruises or anything to account for death—the rupture of the bladder</p>
