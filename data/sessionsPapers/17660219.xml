            . I keep a public house in Grafton-street. Betwixt 9 and 10 at night, on the 24th of last month, I heard there were three or four men in the street, and it was imagined they were upon no good design. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's shop door; he stooped down almost upon his knees, and then ran into the shop; after he was in, the person along with him walked by the door, to see, as I suspected, how he came on. I went up to the door, the prisoner came out with the ham in his hand, I laid hold of him, and called to Mr. Sumerville, and said he was robbed: he came out, the prisoner dropped the ham; we took him to the Round-house, and the next morning before Justice Welch, where he owned he took it.</p>

I am a waterman, I work from Chertsey and the west country, to Queenhithe; my servant received the box mentioned, and I delivered it to Mrs. Watkins at Laleham, that is near Stanes; this was in December, before Christmas; it was locked and tied round with a cord: after that Mrs. Watkins delivered it again to my man, and he brought it safe, locked and corded, to my boat at Chertsey. I received it on board, it was very heavy; I brought it down to London, to Scotland-yard: we had many brooms on board; we laid them out upon a lighter, at Mr. Wood's wharf, to get some things out; then we put the box down into a hole, and laid the brooms upon it, being tired and hungry; as we could not get our boat off, the tide having in part left her, we went to an alehouse, and had some bread and cheese and beer, and were gone about three quarters of an hour: when we returned to the boat, we saw the brooms thrown about; we looked and missed the box: this was betwixt 11 and 12 at night.</p>

When I heard the two boys were taken, I went to the Gate-house to see them. Lambeth came up to me, and told me of several things that he had taken out of my boat, besides the box which I had not then missed, and he owned that he had taken the box of linen, and that they tried to break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Walker in the hearing of this?</p>
               <p>West. He was, he stood by me at the time; Lambeth said they stole a boat and rowed up the river, and heard a gentleman call for oars; they took him in, and carried him to Whitehall; then they went on board a west-country barge, but got nothing, then they came to my vessel, which he called a broom-boat, and got into her stern, and tried at the cabbin, but that was locked; then he looked under the cloth, and saw a chest, and with a great oath said, here is a good prize: then they said let's heave it out, we will sell the things, and sit ourselves out for sea; they got it out of the hole and cut the rope, but could not then break it open upon the bulk; then they put a rope through the iron handles, and in lowering it down into their boat it fell, and hurt one of them very much; then they went away with it, and flung the rest of the things which they had taken over-board, near Scotland-yard; they rowed down to the Old Swan, and there broke it open, and carried the things off, but did not tell me where; they were both close together at the time Lambeth told me this.</p>

When I asked Welch about the other things, she cried and said, go to my house; take this key, (and gave me one) and open a trunk, there you will find some sheets.

Said I, what sort of things have you got? They said they had sold for 14 shillings and a pot of hot what was worth 4 or 5 guineas, to two women, names Welch and Foy; at the Blue Boar, and the next day they said they would come to me; then they went about their business.

               <p>I had been to sea in an east country ship. I went to see a relation in Lambeth parish. We drank till it was pretty late, then we agreed to come to Westminster bridge, and take a boat, and come to the Old Swan: there came a man with a boat; he said, he would not carry us under six-pence. When we came into the boat, he had these things in a white napkin; he asked us if we would buy a shirt or two; we bought each of us one; then he said we should not have them without we bought the whole lump, so we bought the whole tote. The next morning we saw these marks upon them: we never went to do them out, but went to sell them. We sold some to these women. The next day that man stopped us, and while we were in prison the ship sailed. She lay at Rotherhithe, and belongs to Gottenburg.</p>

When he was gone, on the first of January in the morning, I missed a sheet. I saw no more of him till the 31st of January. My baker being constable, I went there; he said he had taken a man for stealing a Cheshire cheese out of a cart, and that he was a baker. I knowing the man that had robbed me was a baker, I went to see him before the Justice, and found him to be the same. I charged him with taking my sheet: he confessed it, and said he had pawned it to a woman, name Young, near Shoreditch church. I went there; she said, if she had it she had sold it, so I could not get it again.</p>

            . I keep the public house where this happened. On the 28th of December I heard Benson cry, he was robbed. I went to him, and saw him and the prisoner had hold on each other. I saw the prisoner searched in the watch-house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190006"/> that was about an hour and three quarters after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was upon my duty upon Whitehall guard. I received my pay that morning. I went to refresh myself at a public house in Westminster. Mr. Benson came in a little in liquor: he forced himself into my company, and said he had been a soldier; he was going away and said, if I would go with him, he would treat me with a pint or a pot. We went to another house, there we had a pot of twopenny; then he took me to another house in Covent-garden; after that he took me to Mr. Gibson's house, and called for a pot of beer, there he asked to go to the necessary house; a boy lighted him down; he staid there some time. I wanted to go, the boy lighted me down. He went away with the candle. The prosecutor had not found the necessary house: he insisted upon going to it before me: we struggled for it: he had bought some eggs as he came; we broke them. When he found they were broke, he said, I had robbed him of his money.</p>

            . On the 21st of December, betwixt 8 and 9 at night, I, and the prisoner, and another not taken, went out, having no money, in order to get some. We saw this glass was cracked; we pushed it in, and Abrahams took a piece of handkerchiefs out; we took and sold it the same night to a Jew that he knew; he used to buy things of us. There were twelve of them in one piece.</p>

I ran out, up Fish-street Hill, when I came to Cannon-street, I saw two persons running from the opposite side of the way, the prisoner was one of them, who I immediately laid hold of; I said I had a suspicion of his robbing me: he said he lived with Mr. Roberts in Lombard-street. I went with him into Lombard-street, he went past it; then he said he lived with Roberts a barber, at the bottom of the street; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190009"/> went on and enquired, but found no such person. When I came to the Post-Office, I thought I heard something drop, I looked about and found nothing; then I imagined it was something in his pocket hit against a post: I felt on the outside, and found something like buckles, I put my hand in, and pulled out a plain silver buckle. I was afraid he might drop more of them, I called to Mr. Kippin to take hold of his other arm; we took him to the Compter, and in the presence of the constable and another young man, we took out of the same pocket another, which I believe was the fellow to it, and in his breeches we found 2 pair and 3 odd ones; we searched farther and found the long new scarlet cloaks, in his coat pocket: he said he found the cloaks and buckles in Gracechurch-street, and before my Lord Mayor he said he found them in a passage on Fish street hill. I have since had two buckles brought me that were found in the street. ( The buckles produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

I took it to the sign of the Ship, facing the India-house, from whence the prisoner and I went to the India-house, to receive the money, on the account of his not having paid my master: I delivered it to him there, the money due was 50 l. he received a 30 and 20 l. Bank note of Mr. Burgess the pay-master, this was in less than a week after he came to our house; then we went together to the Bank, to change the notes, I was paid 1 l. 10 s. for the probate, and I think he made me a present of half a crown for my trouble.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Pay-office, and have been almost 33 years. I can't say I know the prisoner. It is always my business to witness receipts: here is my name to this as a witness: it is always my business to ask executors or administrators where they live, in case any future demand should be made for wages. The person that was executor to this, gave me this direction, that he lived at the Feathers, on Portsmouth common.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burgess. If money should be paid by you to a false person, who does the loss fall upon?</p>
               <p>Burgess. I never did pay any money upon a false demand yet, but this, as I know of. The company issue the money, and the owners of ships deliver that money to me; so that if I was to commit an error, the company are responsible to the owners of the ships, and I am accountable to the owner for the money I receive of them; but the company, I apprehend, would indemnify me, had I paid the money under a legal authority, (that is, a probate from Doctor's Commons.) I account with the ships husbands, and look upon myself the officer of the company.</p>

            . I live at the corner of Hatton-garden, Holborn. I keep a silversmith's shop, and sell pistols. On the 22d of January, the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy a pair of pistols, and shewed me a pair: he asked me 30 shillings for them; they were unfinished; I bid him 15; he agreed to take that (produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor). I paid him for them. Said he, I have some other things of value and consequence to sell. After he was gone, I suspected him, and was determined to stop him when he came again. On the 23d he brought me another pair, silver mounted, (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor). He asked six guineas for these. I was behind the counter, and kept talking to him in order to keep him till somebody came by to assist me. He suspected I was going to apprehend him; he catched that I had out of my hand, and ran away. I called, stop thief, and pursued: he threw the pistols out of his hand in a handkerchief into the high way. A gentleman here took them up. I took him, with assistance, opposite the bishop of Ely's gate, in Holborn.</p>

            . On the 23d of January, I heard Mr. Rock cry, stop thief. The prisoner ran by me with a handkerchief in his hand, which he threw into the high way, and in running about 12 yards farther, we secured him: the pistols were taken up, which he threw away in the handkerchief. He said, they were his own property.</p>
               <p>Lambeth Case. I was going up Holborn the 23d of January, between 8 and 9 o'clock. I was on one side the way, and the prisoner on the other; running, he threw the handkerchief and pistols away so artfully, that I did not see the pistols till the handkerchief was taken up. I took them up. The prisoner demanded them as his property. He was taken before Justice Girdler, and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been in the city: coming home there were people fighting, and a mob, near St. Clement's church-yard. I felt something with my foot, a person near me stumbled over it; he turned back, and I picked it up. There were two pair of pistols. He claimed a right to them. I said, do they belong to you? I did not show him them. This was between 6 and 7 in the evening. I went on about my business. I said, he should drink if he pleased. We went to a public house, and had a pot of beer; after that I had another pint; he wanted half what I had found, but I would not give him any thing. I went home, and after that I went to sell them to that gentleman. I carried a pair first that were unfinished; a workman told me they were worth 4 guineas, but it would cost 2 or 3 more to finish them. I sold them for 15 s. and bought two silver tea spoons. I said, I had another pair at home of consequence. Said he, if you'll bring them, I'll buy them. I brought them about 9 o'clock. We did not agree. When I was got about 2 or 3 yards from the door, he called, stop thief. I stumbled, and they sell out of my hand. The gentleman came and said I was a thief. I said, they were my pistols and handkerchief. They took me before the Justice.</p>

            . I am a night-man. I never knew the prisoner till I met him in the Strand about a month or five weeks ago. About 6 or 7 in the evening I had my rod in my hand, by St. Clement's church-yard. I saw a mob of people. I got up near the houses: there I felt something.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190012"/> The prisoner stooped and picked it up. I said, friend, what have you got there? He said, what is that to you; he still kept going on towards Catherine-street. I was going to Hanover-street, Long acre. I saw him look several times at it, but he did not open it. He asked me if I had lost any thing, I said, no. I asked him two or three times what he had got there. I saw it was something tied in a handkerchief. We stopped at the White Bear, at the corner of Hanover street; there he would treat me with a pot of beer; then he opened the handkerchief, and shewed me four pistols, then he called for another pint, and threw down six-pence, and ran away, and I never saw him since, only once in Newgate; he sent me a letter to come to him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you lived?</p>
               <p>Elmore. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to know how to direct to you?</p>
               <p>Elmore. I can't tell that, and this day a woman brought me a subpoena. I went to a lawyer in Clifford's-inn to know whether I must come here, and he told me I must. I received two letters from him, one from New Prison, that I have lost, the other from Newgate (producing it.) I went to him accordingly. I did not go to New Prison, the letter being signed David Miller, and I did not know any person of that name.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your letters directed to?</p>
               <p>Elmore. To the White Bear. I use that house, and always leave my rod there. I received the letters there, directed to Mr. James, night-man, at the White Bear, Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to know your business?</p>
               <p>Elmore. I can't tell that.</p>

We found some of the silk, part in a band box, and part in a drawer: it had been cut, and some run into two petticoats (some silk produced in court.)

            . I am an officer. On the Saturday before the 8th of February, I was going to the barber's. A man that had been robbed had got hold of the evidence: he delivered him to me. He would not confess any thing at first, but after that he did, and said, he had been guilty of several robberies. This was before the Justice. I went with him to the houses he directed me to: the people all said they had lost the things he mentioned. He gave an account of this silk. We went to the prosecutor; he said, he had lost such. The boy said, it was sold to the woman at the bar. The Justice ordered us to go and fetch her, which we did. We found her in bed at 12 at noon; we went and found this silk in her apartment. The boy said, she bought it of him and the prisoner for 6 s. and he had 3 s. of the money. Burnham was taken five or six days after: he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190013"/> not own to any thing at all, we took Fox the evidence and two boys in bed with three girls, like piggs in a barn; some little time before this, the boys promised to go all to sea, upon which they were discharged, and in about a week after he was taken again.</p>

            . I had drank rather too hard, with two gentlemen waiting for the stage-coach going out; then I took coach to go to the Talbot-inn in the Strand, in order to lie there, and go out in the morning with the stage coach, this was on Thursday the 6th instant. The jolting of the coach, and the liquor together, took my senses away. I know I lay in a room by myself, I missing my watch in the morning after, did not go in the coach, but staid to inquire after it. It was the very day I had received it of the watchmaker that had cleaned it. I applied to the beadle of Goldsmiths Hall, and delivered out hand-bills, and in consequence of that I found it, (produced and deposed to) it is an horizontal watch; I gave 15 guineas for the movement finished up: the gold cases were my own before, the maker's name is Berridge; the chain was stopt by Mr. Smith in Holborn, where I saw it, (produced and deposed to.)</p>

I said I should see if it was advertised, and ordered him to call again on the Thursday: after he was gone I recollected I had a warning from Goldsmiths Hall. I looked at it, and found it was about a gold watch and chain lost. I sent to the hall for information, they let me know they thought it to be the prosecutor's property; he was sent for, and said it was his. I desired him not to advertise it, fearing the man that brought it would not come again. On the Thursday he came again; then I stopt him, and carried him to Guildhall: he desired to go in at the Castle, to speak to some of his friends, and then he would confess the whole; then he said he had the chain of Tricket, the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>That woman and I drank punch with the gentleman at the Talbot inn, pretty merrily together, she was in liquor; I found the watch on the floor, I told her of it, she said it would buy each of us a gown.</p>
               <p>Tricket's defence.</p>
               <p>On that night I went to bed about nine, the two girls came into the room, said Taylor we have got a watch, we found it at the Talbot inn in the Strand; she was very drunk and fell about. I read the Advertiser to see if it was advertised. I had no money to get it advertised, and it was useless to me to keep it. I did not know it was gold, I waited five days, and then went and pawned it.</p>

On the 6th of this instant, I missed a sack of oats of four bushels out of my barge at Twickenham, and about 10 or 11 o'clock Mr. Freeman came, and told me he had them in his house; I went to his house with him, he shewed me them, they were in a tub: he said the two prisoners brought them to him, between 10 and 11 the night before. I took up the prisoners, they both owned they took them from the barge; that one lifted them on the other's shoulders, and they carried them to Mr. Freeman's house.</p>

I have heard he dealt in horses: he always had a fancy for horses. He used to buy horses in Smithfield, and sell and chop them. His stables were in Hockley in the Hole. I have been at them.</p>

I ran after and stopped him. I took him to a house in Seething-lane, and delivered him into the hands of Mr. Goodson, one of the ward constables. He refused being searched, till the constable shewed his authority: then he said, he would take the sugar out of his pocket himself. Upon which he did, out of a large pair of trowsers; there was 25 pounds of it, I saw it weighed.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods are there in the warehouses where he came down from?</p>
               <p>Beldon. There are sugars. The next day he owned before the Alderman he took it out of a hogshead of sugar, and I observed a hogshead had the head beat in. The sugar was the property of his Majesty. There are no other goods there but what belong to him.</p>

            . I am a gangs man at Gally kay . I live in Barking-alley. I was standing at my door. The prisoner came up the alley with his pockets loaded. When he saw me he turned back, and went into Seething-lane. I followed him; he dodged me into a little alley. I went and laid hold of him. I charged him with having sugars about him: he said he had not. I knocked at a partner's door for assistance; by that he was got as far as Mark-lane. I went and got hold of him, and called a coachman to my assistance. I took him back to Seething-lane, and got a constable to search his pockets. I cut the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190018"/> bottoms of his pockets out, and the sugar came out into a handkerchief: there were 27 pounds of it. He said, one Ashworth gave it him on board a ship. Whose sugar it is, I cannot tell: we have had our warehouses broke open several times.</p>

            's, named Dyke, told me the cochineal was brought to his house by Egar and Ash, and told me the waterman was named Beck, that brought it on shore. I went and brought Beck before the Justice, and he declared the same, and swore against all the prisoners at the bar; I got a search-warrant, and searched Smith's house, this was I believe the 12th of January, but I found nothing. I have not seen my cochineal since.</p>

               <p>Collins. It was seen every day by my mate and my men. It was marked upon the barrel J. R. I must be answerable for it to the owner.</p>

               <p>Q. How many gallons, suppose the barrel was liquid measure, would it hold?</p>
               <p>Collins. It held upwards of forty gallons, it was larger than a cask of wine; it was worth about 14 s. and 6 d. a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it last?</p>
               <p>Collins. I saw it about a week before it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners did not confess any thing, did they?</p>
               <p>Collins. They did, Dun, Egar, and Ash, confest it before the Justice, that they stole it, and that they were set on by bad people.</p>
               <p>Q. What were their words as near as you can recollect?</p>
               <p>Collins. They declared they brought it on shore, and sold it to Hodson, and he paid them 21 l. 5 s. for it. Egar said he carried it, Dun declared at the same time, he had not got all his dividend of Hodson yet.</p>

            . I am turned of 14 years of age. I lived with Mr. Smith, the prisoner; he keeps a public house, I drawed beer: Dun, Ash, and Egar, brought a cask of cochineal to our house.</p>

               <p>Q. to Collins. Was it in a bag in the barrel?</p>
               <p>Collins. It was in one bag.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dyke. What colour was it?</p>
               <p>Dyke. It was like powder almost, it was blackish.</p>
               <p>Collins. It is of a dark brown.</p>
               <p>Dyke. They turned up the cask and shook the bag out, and I never saw it afterwards; I do not know what was done with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was this in?</p>
               <p>Dyke. This was in the entry by the parlour.</p>

            . I am a waterman, and ply at Wapping New stairs. About a month and a half ago, I don't know the particular night,) I was employed by Ash, Dun, and Egar, to go on board the ship belonging to Captain Collins, lying at West lane, by Rotherhithe. I have since known her to be the Friendship; I stood in my boat, and they hunted a vessel out of that ship into my boat. I rowed on shore at Mr. Smith's back door, and there landed it, and carried it into his house: then the stuff was taken out of the vessel, and conveyed away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it out?</p>
               <p>Beck. We did among us.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Smith?</p>
               <p>Beck. He keeps a public house, his back door comes to the shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Smith at the time?</p>
               <p>Beck. I did, he did not meddle with any thing; he was sitting by his fire in the kitchen, the vessel was rolled in just by the kitchen door; the back door was left open.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the cask?</p>
               <p>Beck. They said it was cochineal.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said so?</p>
               <p>Beck. They all said so, one among another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any money talked of?</p>
               <p>Beck. They were to have 85 l. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Beck. I was concerned in it, we were to have it among us; Hodson was to pay it, he was there, and it was conveyed out of the house by him: he went out of the house while I was sitting in the kitchen. We had a guinea each of us that night, Hodson paid it us.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the sign Smith keeps?</p>
               <p>Beck. It is the King's Arms. Some time after that, we four, Dun, Egar, Ash, and I, had 10 guineas each paid us by Hodson.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Hodson?</p>
               <p>Beck. I don't know, he uses that house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you conveyed the vessel there was it that you each received the 10 guineas?</p>
               <p>Beck. I believe it was about three weeks after, I received mine in the same house, at the King's Arms; Egar received his 10 guineas at the same time, then he married my sister: the other two were then on board a ship, but I heard them say they received theirs also; and last Saturday night I received 8 guineas more of Hodson, that was the last dividend.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collins. When were the prisoners taken up?</p>
               <p>Collins. They were taken up last Sunday morning. Beck, Dun, and Egar, received their eight guineas each; but Ash has not received his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Smith act any part in it?</p>
               <p>Beck. He brought us liquor, and was about in the house; I don't know that he had any concern in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dyke. Did you see Hodson in the house that night.</p>
               <p>Dyke. Hodson was there; he went home with the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. to Beck. What was done with the vessel?</p>
               <p>Beck. That was burnt in the parlour fire, because it should not be found out.</p>
               <p>Dun's Defence.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning I went to look for work on board this ship; the mate employ'd Ash and me, and worked sometimes half a day, and we were taken up on the Monday morning following, we were examined and cleared; I know no more of the thing than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Egar's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about it; I should not know the ship was I to see her.</p>
               <p>Ash's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Hodson's defence.</p>
               <p>I can't help it if they have a mind to swear against an innocent man; I know nothing of it: I did keep a coal-shed, and used to deal in stockings.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the story that has been told; if such a thing came in, it was without my knowledge; it is a common landing place; there are a great many vessels come broken from on board, and lying about the yard; we sometimes throw them into the fire, many things are brought on shore to my house.</p>

             on the 21st of November last (producing it.) I knew, upon seeing it, it had been paid many years ago: the proper date was scratched out with a knife: it was originally dated in 1754, but now it is the 4th of May 1765. It was canceled by making a cross upon it. We never file them, but settle our accounts once a month. Mr. Honeywood died in the year 1763, and this was drawn upon Honey-wood and Fuller. The house has since been altered to Fuller and Cope. We secured Parkinton, then we traced out Simonds: it appeared Parkinton was innocent, and he was discharged, and the prisoner Dixon was apprehended by Simonds that night: he did not deny it, but said he had it of Lesley.</p>

He told me he received this of one Sylvester, a marine officer, his brother-in-law, and desired me to get him change for it; he said it certainly was good. I carried it to Mr. Simonds's, and bargained for a suit of cloaths, and said, if he could not change that banker's draft, I could not deal with him. We bargained. I gave it him, and desired he would give me change for it. He said, go into a public house, and get a pint of beer, and you shall have your money in half an hour.

I went out and found my back window broke open, which we left key'd with an iron key in the inside: then I went and found my chamber door open; the lock was broke, and my chest of drawers broke open. I missed 30 l. in money.

I lost a pair of silver shoe buckles, a table spoon, and four tea spoons. The spoons and buckles were found buried in a common field about two shots length from the prisoner's house, but a little way in the ground. I lost a steel pencil case, which I had cleaned a little before with brick dust and leather, which was found in the prisoner's drawers with brick dust in it (produced in court).

I took the piece up when he was gone, and found it to be a 3 l. 12 s. I had other customers to serve. When I had done with them I went to look for the prisoner, but he was gone. I informed Mr. Drinkwater of it: he bid me let him know when the person came again. The prisoner came the Thursday following for a quarter of a pound of tea for a man in the neighbourhood. Saying I knew what tea that man always had, I weighed a quarter of a pound: the prisoner threw down half a crown, the price of it: he took the tea, and went out of the shop; then I went and told Mr. Drinkwater, and he had him called back. What questions he asked him, he will tell the court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Drinkwater. When the prisoner came the second time, I had him called back, and asked him whether he had not been at my shop before; he said he could not tell whether he was or not. I said there was a parcel left at my house, and I thought it was his; then he said he was at my house, and had two pounds of sugar, and change for a 36 s. piece: I told him that was a bad 36 s. piece; he appeared a good deal confused, and said, the next time he came he would change it. I asked him where he took it, he told me he knew very well, but I could not get out of him the person's name: after that he told me he went to a linen draper's shop in London to buy his wife a gown, and a man came in and asked the gentleman of the shop to change a 36 s. piece: the gentleman said he could not, and that he said he had so much money in his pocket, and he gave him a guinea, and the rest in silver, and took the piece. When he had taken it, he went out; I sent after him to let him know I would shew him the very piece: he sent word he would return immediately; he turned round. Seeing the boy watching him, he turned back and went to Mr. Cook's. In the afternoon, about 4 or 5, he came to my house; this, I believe, was on the 10th of January, he had then changed his dress: I then shewed him the 3 l. 12 s. and said, I should not deliver it to him till my apprentice was there, to assure me as well as my man, that he was the very person that brought it. Upon this he said, he was very much obliged to me, and went about his business: he came again, then my boy was in the shop; he assured me he was the person, then I delivered it to him, and he gave me 36 s. then I told him my reason for asking him these questions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190023"/> was to be sure that he was the right person that brought it.</p>

            . The prisoner employed me to sell an hundred pounds of 3 per cent. annuities on the 8th of November 1765. This was in the gateway in the Bank of England. I was talking to a gentlewoman. The prisoner asked me what the price of stocks was. I asked him what stocks; he said, consolidated 3 per cent. I told him the price was 91 5/8 a 2 3/4 per cent. he told he wanted to sell one hundred pounds. I was going to take that gentlewoman's direction that I was to sell for her, and if he would go along with me I would take his directions that he proposed to sell. We went all three together into the 3 per cent. reduce room. As soon as I had taken the gentlewoman's, I took his for an hundred pounds: the use of taking the direction is, to explain the stock, the name they have, the trade, and the place of abode, and the sum they intend to sell out. When that is done, it is delivered into the ticket books and alphabetical books.</p>

            , that I saw the prisoner sign. There was no transfer made, because it did not answer to the name in the books. After I had seen the prisoner sign it, I went away, and when I came up again, I found an obstacle arose between the prisoner and the clerk, I think it was Mr. Edwards. I asked the reason why the transfer would not pass. I was told there was no such account, or to that purpose. I went away again, and when I returned the prisoner was gone. The difficulty arose in spelling the name, and Gent. instead of brandy merchant.</p>

            , and found there was such a person near the Cheshire Cheese. This was the Monday after the 8th of November. After I had talked with him, and described the prisoner, I went to the Bank, and told the gentlemen what I had discovered. Mr. Melling told me who he thought it must be. Then Mr. Helstone, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Plumpton, Mr. Edwards, and I, there were six of us in all, went to see for the prisoner, and met with him at the Blind Beggar, on Bethnal-green. I think this was on the 13th of November: he was coming out of the back part of the house with a pipe in his mouth. I asked him how he could use us so ungenteel: he said; in what. I said, in withdrawing yourself, and not paying me my commission. His answer was, there was nothing done. I said, that was his fault and not ours. Then he asked me what the difference was. I said, almost every body knew my commission was half a crown, and as to Mr. Plumpton, he had sold out stock to pay me, (Mr. Plumpton had informed me he had sold outan hundred pounds stock to pay me) and the market went against him. I told the prisoner we could not settle it till we went to the Bank, and we would settle it by that day's market price. He agreed so to do, and came along with us. When we came to the Bank, Mr. Edwards charged an officer at the Bank with him.</p>

This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sign it?</p>
               <p>Plumpton. No, I did not. There was no transfer made. The prisoner and I went in order to make it, and the Bank clerk said there was no such account.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that?</p>
               <p>Plumpton. He said there was stock there, or he knew there was stock there, or words to that effect. Mr. Edwards said, he must be wrong, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190027"/> was no such description. The prisoner repeatedly said, he was not mistaken, he was sure there was stock there, and Mr. Edwards was mistaken. Upon its not being found, Mr. Trobridge had the receipt, but Mr. Edwards gave me the receipt that I had wrote my name on. I said to the prisoner, it was very strange he should come there to sell stock, and not know how to find it. He said, he knew there was stock there, but he wanted the ticket again. He said, give me the ticket again, and I'll call upon you. I said, I will give you no ticket; I have to do with your broker. Then he said, well then, I'll go with you to the broker. I prepared to go down with him, and in turning round to speak to somebody or other, the prisoner dropped me, and I could see no more of him. I concluded he was gone to the reduce. I went and called for the name Malling. I found the broker, but he was gone.</p>

               <p>Plumpton. I have. On the Tuesday following I went with others to Bethnal green. We did not meet with the prisoner. We went six of us the next morning to his lodgings, and found he was just gone out. We were directed to the Blind Beggar. Mr. Trobridge and I went there, and found him coming from the back part of the house. Mr. Trobridge told him it was very unhandsome of him to go away, after he had employed him to sell an hundred pound stock, and said, if every body was to serve him so he should starve. I said, with respect to myself, I sold out stock, and it is a loss to me, which I cannot at present ascertain, therefore I am come to know if you are willing to pay me the difference. He said there was nothing done, and asked what was the difference; he said he was not against paying that: he offered to pay Mr. Trobridge half a crown. We proposed to have it settled at the Bank, which he agreed to; then we adjourned to the Bank clerks, and came all together to the Bank; he said nothing at all tending to shew he was not the man.</p>

               <p>Melling. I do not know. His father was a tenant of mine at Islington: he has been to sea: his father died, and left him 600 l. in the Reduced. He was with me once when a broker bought me 400 l. in the Consols, that is 5 years ago. The broker spent the evening with me. I was possessed of 500 l. on the 8th of last November in the Consols, of 3 per cent. I never knew before but that he was a very honest man.</p>

I drawed it in a silver pint mug, as all our pots were out: the other woman delivered the mug to the prisoner; I heard her say, I'll take care of it: she bid the other woman go out, and while my back was turned, I missed the mug and prisoner. I went and asked my young mistress in the bar, if she had received the silver mug, she said, no. I opened the door, and there was the prisoner standing over the way. I asked her for the mug; she slapped my face. I laid hold of her; the mug was under her apron. I ran back and called some people that were in the house: she went one way and we another; then I went in about my business, and they went after her.</p>

            . I live in Radcliff highway. On the 22d of January I was invited to an entertainment in Holborn. I got a little merry. When I came beyond the ruins at the fire in Cornhill, there a woman met me, and said, Sir, it is a very cold night, extend your charity, and give me a pennyworth of purl; I said, I would if any house was open. When we came to the Cape Coast Castle, facing Billiter-lane, Leadenhall-street, I called for a pint of purl: while it was heating, she said, pray be kind enough to have a pennyworth of gin put into it. I ordered it. She went out and came in in about a minute. I drank to her: she took a hearty draught; I said, drink it up, I'll have no more. I had my change out of my six-pence: she said, will not you give me the change. We walked together as far as Cree-church, then I said, you are only spending your time in vain, I shall be no farther concerned with you: she asked me to go into some private place with her; I would not. Then she said, you are no man: she clapped her hand to my breeches, and took my watch out, and gave it to the prisoner, who stood close by me, whom I had never seen before. This was done in the twinkling of an eye. I said to the woman, d - n you, you b - h, where is my watch: said she, I know nothing of it, and fell down before me on purpose. I fell over her, and was all over dirt and mire. The prisoner ran. I got up and saw a watchman; I said, he has got my watch. The watchman pursued. My hat and wig fell off, and my stick fell out of my hand. A gentleman coming by, hearing me call, stop thief, followed the prisoner, and took him. He was searched in the watch-house, but nothing found upon him. The gentleman said, the prisoner fell down by Aldgate pump. The constable sent two watchmen, who came back with the watch, and said they found it on the very spt (produced and deposed to).</p>

I went into the room, and there found 14 pictures, which just before were hanging up in their places in the room, lying on the table, packed up ready to be taken away. The prisoner said two boys put him into the room, that they would have beat him, and he got in to screen himself: after that he said his hat was thrown in, and he got in for it. The room had been washed, and the sash was put a little way up, so that he could get his hands under it, and sling it up: it was quite up when I went to see what was missing in the room.</p>

I went to the window, and saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards in the room: he came up to the window to me and said, what do you please to have sir. I went about four yards farther to call my fellow apprentice. The prisoner jumped out at the window, and ran up the lane. I pursued and took him about 20 yards from the place: he told the prosecutor some boys were going to lick him, so he got in there.</p>

I went up stairs with her: she shut the outward door; it has a spring lock, and I saw the key hanging on the inside the door. I found the bed was made, and a blind hanging before the window: she said, now if I would go to bed for an hour, she would go to bed with me. I said, could not: she said, I had better pull off my cloaths. I said, I had not time, and could not stay to do that; then she consented to lie down, which she did, and pulled up her cloaths. I was going to - The door opened directly, there I saw the man at the bar: he pretended to be her husband: he locked the door, and directly seized me by the throat. I said, dear Sir, I have not done any thing. He said, I'll make you quiet enough, and took a penknife out, and said, You villain, if you offer to move, I'll rip you up, and kick your guts into the street, unless you will give me a bond of 200 l. I said, I had no such money. Said he, You villain, you blasted rogue, how came you here. I said, that woman enticed me here: she said, O my dear, I'll do so no more. O, you thief, said he, I'll do for you: strip off your cloaths, strip, strip. I begged for mercy, and hoped he would forgive me, and what I had in the world I would give him. Then he said, give me a bond of 100 l. that I said I could not do, and begged on my knees for mercy, and said I would give him all I had in the world, and begged he would abate his passion; then he made an attempt to loose his garter, and threatened to tie me. He took me by the collar, and threw me on the bed. His foot touched the leg of the bed; he tumbled; I got up from under him, and ran to the other side of the room, and begged and said, I would do any thing in the world, if he would let me go: then he said, You villain, you blasted dog, give me a bond for 50 l. I said I could not do that, but I would give him a note for 20 l. He said, 20 l. you blasted rogue, give me your cloaths: then he made an attempt to go to the door, he had the knife in his hand all the time. I begged he would let me have my liberty: he said, You villain, what have you in your pocket. I said, I have got some gold, and some silver, and halfpence, and my watch. Said he, let me see, you thief, you tell me a lye. I said, I have three half guineas in gold, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190030"/> it out; then he said, D - n you, you villain, give it me. I gave it him and some shillings. I asked him if he would have my watch: he said, he would not, but I should give him a note for 20 guineas: he locked the door and went down stairs, and fetched some paper up. The woman at the bar sat on the bed all the time. He came up again, and said, now write me a note. I said, I am in such a trembling, it is impossible for me to write it; if you'll write, I'll sign it. He wrote the body of the note, payable to himself or order. I begged he would not pay the note away, and I would get him the money as soon as I could. He said, You villain, you shall give it me to-morrow: he said, you shall swear before you go out. He gave me a book, and said, you must swear never to come here again: said I, that I shall do. The woman bid me kiss the book; I asked for what, he said never to have dealings here again; after that I was permitted to go down stairs. When I was at the fore door, I perceived the key hanging where I had seen it before. He opened the door, and let me out, and I went home. On the Saturday morning he came into my shop as soon as I took the shutters down; he delivered this letter into my hand: the purport of it is,</p>

Upon sending my daughter up stairs, she came down and said, she thought the prisoner had found somebody in bed with his wife. I went up stairs, and heard a voice crying bitterly for mercy, and that the prisoner would asswage his passion. I heard the prisoner say, you blasted rogue, I'll punish you another way, I heard the other say, he would satisfy him even to all he had in the world. I heard the prisoner say, how came you there: the other said, his supposed wife had decoyed him there. The partition is very slight between us, and we can hear all that passes, if they speak any thing loud.</p>

             at Portsmouth August the 2d was twelve months, and I dined with them that day: here is a certificate of their marriage; I examined it with the church book, it is word for word right (producing it.) I saw that Webber last Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>The mother and daughter said they heard and saw the two prisoners go out in about half an hour after the prosecutor, as loving as ever they saw them in their lives.</p>
               <p>Redmond's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work that morning, I had no notion of any such thing; I always labour hard for my bread, I came back and catched that man in bed with my wife, in a manner I shall not express now. I stepped back, and threatened him to be sure, but I was first going to tie them together, to turn them out of the door, he catched hold of the door as I was going out, and fell down on his knees, and begged for God's sake not to expose him, and he would give me all he had; he begged for God's sake for me to take the money out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Webber's defence.</p>
               <p>I was married to Mr. Webber at Portsmouth; after that he brought me to London, then I heard he had another wife; I found her out and told her; she said she was very sorry for it; I quitted him, thinking I should be counted an adulteress. Soon after that he came after me, and insisted upon my living with him; we came to an agreement, and he drawed up a writing never to come after me. I used Mr. Carr's shop ever since Michaelmas last; every time I went there he was enticing me. and made very great offers, and said, if ever I wanted money he would assist me. I told him I wanted no other man. He would pull out handfuls of money to induce me to lie with him. When I met him in the street, he would be making me proposals, at last I did agree that he might call; my husband being out at business, I said, I would grant him the favour, when an opportunity served. He came to the house three times before that. I went to his shop that morning for two ounces of sugar; he asked me if my husband was at work? I said he was gone to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190031"/> Blackwall. Said he, may I call, there shall be no money wanting: he came. My husband had taken the key of the door to let himself in: he came in order to lie down to get some rest against he went to work. He was in a great passion with me, and struck me down to the ground, and asked the other what business he had there with his wife, and said he would take the law of him. Mr. Carr desired he would not, for that would expose him and hurt him in his business, and offered him a note of twenty guineas, and three half guineas he had in his pocket, and delivered the money voluntarily, and offered his watch, but my husband refused it.</p>

             gave the same evidence as on the other trials, with this addition; That many pieces of scaffolding-boards were found in Archer's house, some of which were the prosecutor's property; that Archer keeps a chandler's-shop, and sells coals and wood, but that Archer himself is a coachman, and the business is carried on by his wife in the shop. No evidence was given that he bought or received any.</p>

He that was behind me got upon the shafts of the waggon, and demanded the passengers money. I went back again to the town I came from, that is Stanes, and told one of the serjeants how I had been served; he asked what sort of a person it was that robbed me; I described him as having a large rough voice, a middle sized man; he said he could not pitch upon any body but the prisoner. His outward cloaths were not buttoned, I could see he had red cloaths underneath, made me mistrust he was a soldier, the prisoner denied the fact before Justice Fielding, and I cannot swear to him.</p>

He immediately ran away, I pursued him, and took him by the collar; when he was got about five yards from the place, I charged him with taking my watch; he denied it, but there was no watch to be found, he must have got it off to some of his companions. There were people that stood by the side of me said, they saw something throwed. I am certain it was the prisoner that I felt twitch at my watch; there was no mob where I stood at that time; if there had been a mob, I could not have pursued as I did. The watch was advertised, and Sir

            . I live in East Smithfield.

I met Chappel two days after, and asked her if she was not one of the girls that wiped the blood off my face. She said she was; I took her to the watch-house, there she acknowledged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190034"/> where the coat and waistcoat were sold in Rosemary-lane. She said Rose Foy sold the rest, but she could not tell where. The other two prisoners were taken up the same night. The person that bought the coat and waistcoat owned he had bought them, and had sold them to a person in Yorkshire, and has sent for them up.</p>

Byrne denied it at first, but afterwards he acknowledged, that he, in company with M'Caves and Conyers, were the three persons that took the portmanteau from behind the chaise, near St. James's. The carriage came over Westminster-bridge, and along Albemarle-street to Grosvenor-square. He said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190035"/> they took them to M'Caves's, and divided them into three lots. This was on the 27th of January.</p>

I got over Smallberry-green turnpike about 11 at night: there came two men to me, and turned me round. I said, gentlemen, I hope you will not molest me on the highway, I hope you'll let me pass: I went on. When I came to the Rose and Crown, I crossed the way, being in fear; one of them crossed over to me, and knocked me down, I cannot tell with what; it was not his fist, because it hit so hard. I got up as quick as I could, they knocked me down again. I got up a second time, then they knocked me down again, and I could not then get up. One of them got his hand in my mouth; I strove to bite his finger to mark him, but I could not; then I cried, murder. I had 5 s. in one pocket, and a few halfpence in another: they took 20 or 22 d. I do not know which.</p>

I could not distinguish which; I cannot sware to them, but they knew me: one of them said, I'll be d - d if it is not All Hot (a name given me by crying my pies), they seemed to be sorry, and said, he knows us. I was a long time before I got out of the ditch: there came a lad that had been robbed; he said, halloo; I said, halloo, who are you. I have been robbed said he. I said, so have I: he said, he had been robbed of all he had: I said, then I'll go along with you to Brentford, because I had some left, and give you part of a pot. We went there, but nobody was up. The two prisoners were taken up before I came back, on another affair. I called at the turnpike. Mr. Smith that keeps it, said, All Hot, you may go on very safe, for the men are taken, I saw the corporal, and said, I had been robbed by two of his light-horse-men: he bid me go home to bed, so I did.</p>

            , Esq; I was in a post chaise with four horses. There was Mr. Marsden and Adams with me. On the 31st of January we were stopped about a quarter before 12 at night, <placeName id="t17660219-53-crimeloc309">about 40 yards on this side Lord Northumberland's , beyond Brentford</placeName>

The post-boy said, some gentlemen will not let us go on: we let down the fore glass. I heard a voice say, d - n you, go to the door, and demand the money. Upon which I saw Evans come with a pistol in his hand close up to the sash, on the left hand. I was in the center: he talked about money, when close to the window, d - n you, your money, I'll blow your brains out, or something of that kind. I saw by the presenting his pistol, if there had been a ball, it must go through the roof of the chaise, he elevated the point pretty high. I bid Adams let the glass down, the moment that was down, I cried, fire away: upon which Evans fired, I could see his face extremely plain by the slash of the pan. We fired two pistols immediately upon him from the chaise; I thought it would have knocked his head off, as the pistols were not three feet from his head: there was another man: they went away towards London. I bid the boy drive on as fast as possible to the first house. When we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190036"/> came to Smallberry-green, I asked the turnpike man to lend me a lanthorn: he did, with a bit of candle in it. I asked the post-boy if his heart lay right; he answered, it does lay very right. I thought we had killed the person, and I was determined not to let him lay in the road, but to carry him to Brentford. We went to the place, and hunted about with the lanthorn, and could see no man nor blood; I thought then these fellows could not have got far. In a little time up came Evans to me; this was just as you turn down to the Lord of Northumberland's house. I laid hold of him, and Marsden seized Swift: we tied Evans's hands behind him; then I went to assist Marsden, and found Swift had got a pistol in the lining of his regimentals: we took it out; it was a horse pistol. He wanted to get away; they can jump like greyhounds: we tied Swift's hands behind him also, and Marsden and Adams took them to the turnpike. When we got there, I held a candle to the face of Evans, and all about his eye were the appearance of gunpowder, and there was the least touch in the world of the graze of a ball on his nose. Swift desired to have his pistol. I said, you shall never have it no more: his pistol was laid on the table, and by the smell of it, I am sure it had not been fired off 10 minutes. Evans was dressed in his watering jacket and cap, and Swift in his regimentals. I did not see Swift at the time we fired: Mr. Marsden will account for him. When his wife came to him, he said, don't make yourself uneasy, I bless God there was no ball in my barrel.</p>

            . On Friday the 31st of January, after we had been examining the men on a slight suspicion at the barracks, at Kensington, five were committed to goal. We discovered about fourteen: one was upon centry, he flung down his piece, and ran away: we thought proper to give notice to the different officers where the men were quartered; we ordered a post chaise with four horses. Mr. Spinnage offered to go, and I offered my service to go with him. Adams went with us. We were unprepared for any journey: the major at the barracks offered us pistols: we had two brace given us loaded for our guard: first of all they brought us four pistols, with but one lock to them all. Going along, when we got to this place, about 40 yards on this side the lane that turns down to Isleworth, the first I observed was the chaise stopped. I called out, what is the matter: the boy, I think, said, two gentlemen stopped him; I guessed what it was. Swift, whom I have known for years, stood directly opposite the window. I sat on the farther side, and he on the near side very forward, so that I had a full view of him: he was in his full regimentals, cap, and every thing. I then had no doubt but that we were stopped: I had my pistol ready, intending if he had offered any pistol, to have shot him; it was so ready, I knew I could be before hand with him. In the mean time, I heard him say something to the other man, I observed nothing more than the word chaise. The other came up, and said something of money; he came on the same side, but the instant he spoke, off went the pistol; I fired instantly, we could but just see which pistol went off first: he came in a direction from the horses to the chaise, I saw but little more of him than his head and his hand. Mr. Spinnage fired, and so did Adams, at the other, then they ran away, and we went on; he that fired into the chaise, was in a woollen cap and white jacket. We went on to the turnpike, and got a lanthorn; I took one of the pistols that I found loaded, and went on. I saw Swift, and laid hold of him, and knew him directly; he was servant to a lady that used to visit Sir

            : we took them to the turnpike-house, and went to see how many pistols we had; we got him to a house at Hounslow, and got a constable. Evans ran away for that night, and was not taken till the Sunday after. I saw his face when we brought him to the light, all the left part of his cheek and his eyelid was all plain powder to be seen in it. When they were examined last Monday se'nnight, Swift began mentioning the stopping the chaise, and Evans acknowledged the same, but that it was with intention to ride, not to take any thing.</p>
               <p>- Adams. I was likewise in the chaise; we were stopped a little beyond Brentford. I saw a man in regimentals standing in the foot-path a little way from the chaise. I kept my eye upon him. I did not see the other man till he came to the window; there was something said, like d - n you, your money. Major

             said, let down the window; we let down the side glass, and Mr. Marsden said, keep off: the major said, fire, and I directly fired at the man that stood by the chaise; he was dressed in white, with his watering cap on, I did not distinguish his face: then we went on to the turnpike at Smallberry-green; we got out of the chaise, and came down and met with the two prisoners in the road, and secured them. We searched them; there was a pistol found on Swift. When we came to Hounslow, on the left side of Evans's face, the blood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190037"/> had a little started; it looked a little freshish. The pistol that was taken from Swift, had been fired off; the pan was quite wet. Mr. Marsden held it up and said, is this your pistol? Swift said it was: there was only two pistols fired in the chaise, I fired one, and I believe Mr. Marsden the other.</p>
               <p>- Brooks. I was the foremost post-boy: going along, we perceived two men; as we came near them, they parted, one went upon the causeway, and the other in the middle of the road; one in white, with his watering cap on, the other in his red regimentals: he in his watering dress came and held a pistol to me; there were some words passed between them. Then I heard Evans demand the money at the chaise door; the glass was down, and, to the best of my knowledge, there were three pistols fired: after that Evans came towards my horses: they called out of the chaise to go on, and we galloped all the way to Smallberry-green turnpike, after that they went back and brought the two prisoners to the turnpike.</p>

            . We were going along just on. the other side Brentford, by the lane that goes up to Sion-house: all on a sudden we stopped. I asked the boy what was the matter; he said, Harry, here is a man has hold of my horses, and will not let me go. They let down the glass of the chaise, and asked what was the matter. I said, here is a man stops us: the man in regimentals stood on the bank side. He said, You scoundrel, why don't you go and demand their money: he let go the horses heads, and ran by me, and said, your money, gentlemen. Who fired the pistols, I cannot say, but I could hear the report of two; they were so close, I could hardly distinguish them: after that there was another pistol discharged, which was, I believe, to the man on the bank; then they ordered us to go along as hard as we could to the turnpike.</p>
               <p>The prisoners in their defence denied the fact, and said they had been out, and staid till locked out of their quarters: that they imagined the chaise to be a return post chaise, and they went up to it in order to get a ride.</p>

By his information I found Riviere lived in Church-lane. I and my Lord's porter went to the house; he was not there. The boy told us there was a cook lived in Hog-lane, perhaps he may be there, so we went there with the boy, and left the porter in Church-lane; the boy shewed me the door in a cellar: I peeped through the key-hole, and saw a man: I knocked at the door; they did not come to open it. I knocked again, and said I had a commission from my Lord Baltimore to come and search. I found Riviere upon the stairs; I asked him if he had any plate of my Lord's, for I had information that he was the man that took it. He said, he did not know, but he would see. I secured him, and drove him before me, and found some of the plate among some saw dust, and some behind the barrels.

             was with me to fetch in pots and draw beer. On the 9th of this month, I went to the fire side to give change to a person, and did not take the key out of my drawer, but turned it; I had left a quarter guinea on the table, she took it up and gave it me, and I put it and a guinea into the drawer, when I turned the key just before. I missed her in about a quarter of an hour after.</p>

            . That is in the bar, I saw her in the bar when I was giving change. I felt in my pocket apron, and found my key was gone; I went to the till and opened it, and my bag was gone, eight guineas, four half guineas, nine quarter guineas, a 36 s. piece, and a silver twopence, three half crowns, and other silver. I went to the watch-house with a gentleman that was in my house, but heard nothing of her; at break of day we had intelligence her father lodg'd in Golden-lane, behind the Black Raven; we went there about half an hour after six; we called, the mother came to the window, I went into the room, she had her under petticoat on, there was a great fire; I said, Nanny, where is my money? Said she, what is the matter? where is Sall? I said, you know; my money is gone. She began to cry, and said she knew nothing of it; we took her till such time we found the two prisoners. She equivocated a great deal, and said she knew nothing of it; at last she said, they were at the foot of the bridge; in going, they met them both together accidentally by Cripplegate church; I was not there. They went in at the Ship-ale-house, in Whitecross-street, and I and the constable were sent for. The father used me there in a very abrupt manner; he pushed me down flat on my face, and threw beer over me and another. I called for a coach, and foolishly ventured my life with him; when we came to Wood-street Compter, he said, that was the place he wanted to go to. He smashed the glasses all to pieces, which I had to pay for, and behaved in a very bad manner. I carried them before the Lord Mayor, and my Lord committed him to Newgate, and the girl to the Poultry Compter. There was 12 l. and upwards found upon the man, there was a 36 s. piece, three half crowns, a silver two-pence, two half guineas, 8 guineas and some trifle of silver.</p>

            . I was at Mrs. Cole's house on that Sunday evening about a quarter after 9, I had a pint of beer; I said to the girl, put a bit of toast in it, which she did, and turned herself round and went into the bar. Mrs. Cole went into the bar about twenty minutes after, and said, I am ruined, I am robbed of all I got; it is not mine, it is the brewer's money. The maid said, madam, do you know where Sally is gone? The mistress said, no, I do not; she said, it gives me reason to think she had got it, saying, the father came to the house the day before, and demanded money of the girl. They were told the father lived in Beech-lane; I went to enquire, and found he was moved to Golden-lane, by the Black Raven; the next morning Mrs. Cole and I went there; the man at the Black Raven called Mrs. Stanley. She opened the window, then we went up; Mrs. Cole desired me to run for an officer, I went and got one, and we took her to Mrs. Cole's house; there we asked her several questions. She had five or six shillings and six-pence in her pocket. About eleven o'clock we went to go before my Lord Mayor with her, coming to the steps of the Mansion-house, she said, If Mrs. Cole would go home, and leave it to me, she would tell where they were. Mrs. Cole consented to it; then she said her husband and daughter were over the bridge at a public house, and she would speak to him to let us have the money back. Coming by Cripplegate, the father and daughter were coming from towards London-wall; the wife said to him, so John; then I took hold of him, and said, you are all three prisoners. The man said, he knew nothing of the matter. The girl said, father, we are found out, give Mr. Bull the money, you know it is my mistress's. People coming about us, I said, we will go into Mr. Durant's till Mrs. Cole comes. No, said the father, I'll go into the Ship-ale-house; I sent for an officer, and called for a tankard of beer; he threw it over me, and was striving to get out at the door; I laid him on the ground, and kept him there. When Mrs. Cole came in, the girl directly said, father, give my mistress the money; you persuaded me to do it, and you have got it between your shirt and your breeches. He said, I know not what money you mean. She said, you know you have it; for when I was at home in the afternoon to clean myself, you desired me to take my mistress's bag that the gold and silver was in, and you would wait in Jewin-street till I did it; and I took it and brought it to you, and you took and turned the money out into a paper, and put the key belonging to my mistress's till into the bag, and threw the bag away, and now you know that you have it, and here is six-pence that my father gave me out of the bag, and gave it into my hand. When we came before my Lord Mayor, he ordered him to be searched; we took him into a room, and I searched him; he put his hand into his pocket and took out three half crowns, and some silver, and put it into my hand; my Lord desired he should be searched closely; he pulled off his breeches; I took hold of them, and clapped my hand on the fob, and said here is something hard; Mr. Brown took out a parcel tied with a piece of pockthread: before we opened it Mr. Brown said, there is one particular guinea there, it is very smooth on one side, and the impression on the other very plain; we opened them, and it was the first guinea we saw; there were eight guineas, two half guineas, one 36 s. piece, one quarter of a guinea, and a silver two-pence (produced in court. The particular one inspected by the Court and Jury.) The money was sealed up in my Lord's presence. When we were bringing the father to Newgate, he desired me to get them to make it up as she had got the money, and hoped she would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Maynard Brown. This guinea (taking the remarkable one in his hand) I borrowed of Mrs. Cole. I was at her house on Sunday in the afternoon drinking a pint of beer; some gentlemen there asked me to take a walk, when I came to feel in my pocket I had no money; I said to Mrs. Cole, lend me a few shillings. She fetched me this guinea: when we came to the Blue Last at Islington, they would not change it; I turned it over and over, and said, this is a comical sort of a guinea, plain on one side, and smooth on the other. When I came back again, I returned it to Mrs. Cole, and in the morning I heard she had been robbed. When I heard the prisoners were taken, I went to them to the Ship-ale-house; I asked the girl how she could be so cruel as to rob her poor mistress; she burst out crying very vehemently indeed, and said, Sir, when I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190041"/> home to clean myself in the afternoon, my father said to me, Sall, you must take the bag where your mistress's money is, out of the till, and bring it to me. She said, I cannot do such a thing: said he, I insist upon your doing it, and if you don't, I'll beat you. She said, she took an opportunity in the evening, when her mistress was gone out of the bar, and took the bag, with her mistress's gold and silver in it, and her father was then waiting for her in Jewin-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all this in his hearing?</p>
               <p>Brown. It was, and he made no reply to it: she said he took it from her, and they went and walked about the other end of the town all night, and he took the money out of the bag, a nd put the key in the bag, and threw it away in some lane, I think about Drury-lane. After that, he made reply and said, none of your mistress's money, you never gave me none. Said she, don't say so father, you know the money is my mistress's money, you have the silver in your pocket, and the gold is concealed in a paper somewhere about your shirt, or in your breeches. He made no more reply, but was very audacious: we took coach, and went before my Lord-Mayor at the Mansion-house; the girl made the same confession there, as near as can be spoke. My Lord ordered him to be searched in another room; there were three half crowns, and a silver 2 d. and other silver taken out of his pocket: he was very loth to pull off his breeches; we insisted upon having them quite off. I felt a knob in his fob, and took it out and delivered it to the officer. I said, before you open this paper, there is a very remarkable guinea, if it is not gone, and described it: they untied the packthread, and opened the paper, and the first guinea was that.</p>
               <p>Daughter's defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw nothing about it. There was another maid in the house as well as I. I was frighted, and did not know what to say. I went from my mistress, because we had words.</p>
               <p>Father's defence.</p>
               <p>I was in bed at the time, and knew no more of it than your Lordship does. I went out in the morning about my business, about 6 o'clock. I am a buckle maker. Coming home about half an hour after 1 o'clock, they stopped me in the street, and charged me with having this woman's money. I said, I had none, I never was near her house. They took me before my Lord-Mayor, and took 8 guineas, 2 half guineas, a 36 s. piece, 3 half crowns, and other silver out of my pocket, money of my own. I got it by my own hand labour. I sell buckles to the Jews.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He came out of Newgate but the other day. He had no money of his own. I was a good friend to him. I can swear to that silver 2 d. very safely, it is my child's.</p>

On the 28th of January, I went to receive some money at a public house, and after that to another, and called for a pint of beer. The woman at the bar sat on one side the fire, and I on the other: she asked me whether I would give her a pint; we had a full pot, after that another pint. I bought two black puddings of a man that came in: then we went to the Ship, in Monmouth-street, together, and drank. I never saw her before. I got very fuddled. I said I lived in Whitechapel; she went along with me to another public house, but I cannot tell where that was: she came to see me home; this was about 12 at night. When we got just by Prescot-street, I fell down, and was terribly wet. I believe I might be there some time. When I got up, I clapped my hand to my fob, and missed my watch. I said to her, you have my watch: she said, she had not. I took hold of her, and shoved her through Rosemary-branch-alley, and called the watch, and gave him charge of her; she was searched in the watch-house, and the watch found under her arm.</p>

            , went out one night together a thieving, a fortnight ago last Wednesday: we went into Little Russel-court. I saw the door of the prosecutor's shop open. Wedle went in and fetched the shew-glass out, and blowed out the candle upon the counter; then Bouden and he ran along Vinegar-yard with it, I followed them between two coaches and into Catherine-street, then into Southampton-street; there Wedle gave the shew-glass to me. I carried it to the ruins of St. Giles's, there we opened it. Wedle took the things out, and put them in a handkerchief, then we threw the shew-glass into a sawpit. We carried the things to where I lodge; we all three lay together, and put them under the head of the bed. The next morning we went to see for a Jew, that Wedle called Nickadowser: we bargained with him for near one hundred seals for 4 s. Then we sold him a large silver medal, and he made us give him another medal into the bargain. We sold him an instrument case, with scissars and things in it, all for 29 s. Then he said he had no more money, but he would go and get some, and buy the rest of the things: he went and came back, and gave us 24 s. for three pair of paste buckles, two pair of oval ones, and a pair of true-lovers knot buckles. After that he gave us 1 l. 14 s. for eight gold rings, with stones in them, and some watch chains, necklaces, and ear-rings, with stones. On the Sunday morning following we were going to Holborn, and met him again. I gave him a little hat buckle that I had. We went in at the Py'd Bull, by Bloomsbury-square; he bargained with us for three watches under a gateway, in Ormond-street, for three guineas; after that we shewed him a pair of silver buckles like a true-lover's knot: he insisted upon our giving him them; we would not; then he allowed us 3 s. for them, but gave us but two. Then we went to the Rummer, in Oxford-market, and from thence set out for Hounslow, and staid there till the Wednesday, and came home in the evening, and on the Monday following Wright came and took me; after that he went and took Bouden. On the Tuesday we were carried before Sir

He and the prosecutor went out to whisper together, and between the prosecutor, who is a Jew, and one Lyon, they let him go. They talked in their own language together.</p>

Bouden and Quin said if we would not, we should have none of the things; then Bouden opened the door, he, I, and Quin went in, and Berryman stood at the door to see who came: we went up stairs, and brought down the several things mentioned in the indictment (naming them.) Berryman went and pawned a shirt for 4 s. after that a waistcoat for 6 s. 9 d. at Mr. Styles's. Quin sold two boys shirts in King-street, Seven Dials, for a shilling. There were two frocks, one of them I have on now.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Between twelve and one o'clock that night, I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's house, and bring out a candle and light it by another watchman's candle; when I came round again, I saw a light in Mr. Jennings's shop, I looked thro' a place in the window, I saw him untie a hamper of fowls, and take the fowls out, and put them into his pocket; then he went to a slitch of bacon, and cut a slice; after that he came towards the fore-door, and took off a Salmon-kitt, and from underneath took a bunch of greens, and a cole-wort; then he went into the cellar, I looked through a large grate and saw him take some large apples out of a place; after he had stuffed out his pockets, he went up stairs; I knocked at the door as loud as I could; Mr. Jennings looked out; I said, I want to speak with you, there is something amiss; before Mr. Jennings came down, the prisoner came and opened the door; he said have you no light? I said no, Sir, be so good as to stop until Mr. Jennings comes down; when Mr. Jennings was got about half way, the prisoner wanted to get up by him. I said to Mr. Jennings, do you allow any body to ransack your shop in the night time? he said, no; but I have lost things many a time. I said, this man has got something of yours now, in his pocket; I insisted upon his coming down; he would not: I took him by the arm, and pulled him down on his breech, and got him into the parlour. We turned his outward coat on one side, and the heads of the fowls hung out of his pocket: there were the things mentioned in the indictment found in his pockets. I told Mr. Jennings where he took the bunch of greens, and savoy from, and the bacon; he went up and brought down the slice of bacon, greens, and savoy.</p>

               <p>That evening I went home very much in liquor, as to the fowls I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godfrey. Was he intoxicated with liquor?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. He was not; he might have been drinking. I suspected him many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What way of life is the prisoner in?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe is a shoemaker, or cutter-out of shoes. His wife is a very industrious woman; she maintains him, I believe; he has not earned six-pence this year and a half. He was often out on nights till three, four, or five in the morning.</p>
