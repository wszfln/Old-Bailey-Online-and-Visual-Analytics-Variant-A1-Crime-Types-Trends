I interrogated the man where he lived; he told me in the Haymarket; he said, he was a servant there, but would not give me his master's name; I told him then, that he could not prove the things were the boy's; I then sent for a constable; he desired me to take the boy to Mr. Coward's, in St. Martin's-court; I took him there, and Mrs. Coward knew the boy very well; I inquired his character; she hesitated a little, and then her husband came in; I told him what I was come about, and shewed him the things; he said, he did not know whether they were his own clothes or not, but his mother was extremely fond of him, and they might be his own; he said, he was a wild boy; I then let the boy go, and I saw nothing of him for near a month afterwards.

             sworn. - I am porter at the Berwick wharf in the employ of Mr. Laurie; I employed the prisoners on the 8th of May, about one o'clock, to move leather from one lost to the other; in one of the losts there was a cask of boots, which had been landed from the vessel; I told out the boots the night before, and there were a dozen and four pair; we found two pair in Griffiths's jacket-pocket; his jacket was lying upon a case as if he was about his work; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; when I discovered the boots in his jacket, I went down stairs, and informed Mr. Laurie; he told me to fetch the jacket, which I did, and shewed them to Mr. Laurie; there were two pair of boots, and a spoon; I took it back again, and Griffiths put on the jacket, and came down stairs; he desired me, for God's sake, to take the boots out of his pocket, and let them go; I said, I could not do it, for my master knew they were there as well as myself; then he went up stairs for his hat; my master desired me to go and see where he was gone to, and, when I went up, I saw him jumping out of the loop-hole into the street; I called out stop thief, and he was stopped; I brought him back to my master on the wharf, and an officer was sent for to take him up.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you searched the pocket of the other man, Piper? - A. After Griffiths had got out into the street; I went into the warehouse, and took up the jacket; I asked Piper if it was his; he said, yes, and asked how it came there; he said, he had left it upon the case; I went down into the accompting-house with him, and put his jacket on the stool in the accompting-house; I looked, and found two pair of boots, one pair in each pocket, of the same sort of boots; I cannot swear to them; they were delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Piper.) 
               <persName id="t18020602-2-person67">Q. </persName>
            Griffiths took to his heels, and ran away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Piper submitted to be searched very readily? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS sworn. - I belong to the Police-office, Lambeth street: On the 8th of May, I was sent for to Mr. Laurie's there was a soldier's jacket on the stool in the accompting-house; I took it up, and asked Piper if that was not his jacket; he said, it was; I then took a pair of boots out of each side of his jacket in the lining; the lining was tore; the other two pair were delivered to me by Mr. Laurie. (Produces them.)</p>

            He had no hesitation in telling you that was his waistcoat? - A. No.</p>

            (To Jones.) Were there any other soldiers employed? - A. Yes, there was one other soldier, and another man, that always worked there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Laurie. This is the boot that had the rent in it; the others are the same kind of boots; I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. All the boots were consigned from Scotland in a cask? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-2-person70">Q. </persName>

               <persName id="t18020602-2-person71">A. </persName>
            No; Piper certainly did not shew the least symptom of criminality or fear, so much so, that I wished the Justice not to commit him; I dare say he was five minutes in the warehouse after it was discovered.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Piper, left his defence to his Counsel, and called his serjeant, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Griffiths, put in a written defence, stating that he was innocent of the crime.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you understand by that? - A. Being taxed with stealing the cloth, he then said, he had taken a piece of Irish cloth from the lower warehouse, we were then in the upper warehouse; he said the mark was D. Y. and that he had carried it to his brother's, he said, that was all he had taken; we then sent for a constable, and I went to his brother's house, there I found a piece of nankeen, a remnant of white calico, and a calico wrapper; I knew them to be our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you had a very excellent character with the prisoner? - A. I never had a better character with any servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you been supping that night? - A. At the Queen's-head, Tower-street; Mr. Dawson, another officer, and myself had drank a pot of beer a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing for supper? - A. We had a morsel of bread and cheese for dinner and supper; we cannot afford suppers.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Dawson here? - A. No, he is upon duty; I did not ask him to come here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite clear you were sober that night? - A. Perfectly sober; I told the watchman to take charge of him, for he had knocked me down and was going to murder me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man fell down, and I came up to help him.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman in St. Catherine's parish, Tower-hill: On the 18th of April, after I had cried the hour of eleven o'clock, I heard a voice cry out murder, watch! murder, watch! I immediately went towards the place, again, and heard the same words repeated with a shrill voice; I went round the corner and caught the prisoner and this old gentleman down flat upon his back, across the kennel; when I saw that, I took hold of the prisoner's collar and hauled him away; as soon as the old gentleman found I had got hold of him, he said, watchman, I give you charge of that man, for he had knocked me down three times, and robbed me; the prisoner immediately said, watchman, he is my comrade; he is very drunk, and I want to get him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that in pretty good English? - A. Yes; then another watchman came up, and I desired him to list the old gentleman up, for he could not get up himself; we took them both to the watch-house, and delivered them up to the officer of the night, who searched the prisoner, and found upon him, in my presence, fourteen pence halfpenny; the officer of the night desired me to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020014"/>and see if I could find any thing near the spot; I went, and found two single halfpence, one lying in one place, and the other in another; I dare say it was half past eleven o'clock before I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you at all to be drunk? - A. He appeared to be very much frightened; but when we got him to the watch-house, he was very steady; indeed he did not appear to be at all in liquor.</p>
               <p>

            (To Wright.) The prisoner says you were his comrade; had you ever seen him before? - A. I declare to God I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Your duty is not on the river, is it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him on board of any ship in the river? -

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. All this man says is false; he was very sick, and vomited; he fell down, and I was helping him up when he desired the watchman to take me up. <rs id="t18020602-31-verdict175" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am shopman to Thomas Moore: On the 18th of May, about a quarter after eight, the prisoner came into the shop with a man, to buy a pair of shoes; William Rumbold, the apprentice, served her with the shoes, for which she was to give three shillings; the prisoner pretended she had lost one shilling; she left one shilling, and said she would come again for the shoes; she then produced sixpence more in halfpence, which I gave to the apprentice; while he was looking at it, she went out of the shop, and left the man in it; there were a great number of shoes near the door; and, in consequence of a fire in the neighbourhood, I ordered the lad to take the shoes in; I then observed the prisoner outside the shop, leaning upon the window; I desired the boy to keep an eye upon her; a neighbour then came into the shop, and said, Saunders, come here, and look at this woman's petticoats; upon which I looked at her, and observed a great coat, which I took from under her petticoats; she said it was none of our coat; she clapped her hand upon her knees, and said, I should not take it from her, for it was none of our coat; the man absconded; I sent for an officer, and delivered up the coat and the prisoner; the great coat had been hanging outside the door before the alarm of fire.(Thomas Hubbard, a headoorough, produced the great coat, which was identified by Saunders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked it up at some distance from this man's house; it was lying upon the ground. GUILTY, aged 38.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your business? - A. I am a cordwainer, and keep a chandler's shop: On the 2d of March, the prisoner came in for some bread; whilst I was getting it, my wife looked up, and said, William, look at that man's money; that is the man that gave us the bad shilling this day week; the prisoner heard her; the shilling then on the counter proved to be a bad one; and I told him, you villain, are you not ashamed to come a second time with bad money to my shop; he took the shilling and went out, swearing it was a good one; I followed him to a butter-shop, opposite Trueman's brewhouse, where he tendered the shilling, which was refused; I then followed him to a butcher's-shop, where he tendered the shilling for some steaks, and it was refused; I followed him to Church-street, Mile-end New Town, where he went in for a red-herring; there the shilling was refused; and he then went into Mrs. Arnott's shop for leg of beef; I saw him tender the shilling, and saw her give him the change; whilst he was eating the beef, I beckoned Mrs. Arnott out, to come to the door, and said, I doubt you have taken a bad shilling; she said, why do you think so; I said, I think he is one of the people they call smashers, a name they give the people that put bad money off; says I, take care of the shilling, and, as soon as he comes out, I will take him into custody; when he came out, I collared him, and said, you villain, give me what bad money you have about you; he said he had none; he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and gave me eight good shillings; I told him I did not want his good shillings, but his bad ones; he then put his hand into his jacket-pocket, and gave me eight bad ones; I said, you have more; says he, I have not; said I, come along with me, and I took him to the public-house and sent for an officer; on searching him we found one more, which I have, and it is marked separately from the first eight.</p>

            You are the brother of the prisoner? - A. Yes; he lives at North-End, near Fulham; he buys and sells horses: On Saturday, the 24th of April, about half-past five in the morning, as high as I can guess, I got up, and my brother came to the door, and told me he was bid money for a horse yesterday, but did not choose to take it; he had since thought he would take it, and was going to Smithfield to see if he could find the person; I went with him; and, at Stamford-bridge, very near Walham-Green, a man came out of a lane with a bag upon his back, and asked me if I would buy a coat and waistcoat; my brother said he wanted a waistcoat; and then the man pulled this waistcoat and these breeches out; my brother gave him eight shillings for them; I attended at the Magistrate's after my brother was taken up, but I was not asked any questions about it; I am sure these are the same things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. Where do you live? - A. I am a butcher, and live at Walhamgreen, about a mile from my mother's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the 24th of April? - A. Yes, I recollect it, because it was on a Saturday; and I was coming to Newport-market, upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020019"/>my business, and my brother was taken up the Sunday-week following.</p>

               <p>Q. You chose rather that your brother should be committed to Newgate for trial, than give yourself the trouble of telling your story? - A. I did not wish him to go to Newgate; I told Mr. Jepson I had seen him buy them, and he said I should speak, but my brother was then taken away.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday evening last, the 2d of this month, I received, from Messrs.

            , take twenty-eight pounds of sugar out of the cart, and go away with it; upon which I followed him, and took it from him; he made a stout resistance and then run off; I pursued him, crying stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - A. Yes; he was taken by a person that came up while he was struggling with me; I met them in Moor-street, Seven-dials, bringing him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man? - A. Yes; I saw his face; I know him by his face and his clothes likewise; I am sure he is the same man; he was not out of my sight two minutes.(Thomas Mallard, an officer, produced the sugar, which was identified by Archer.</p>

            Please to name your partners, and state the particulars of this robbery? - A. My partners are, Robert Wyatt, and Clement Wyatt: The prisoner was in our employ about thirteen or fourteen years; and, on the 10th of May, I cut out fourteen pair of calf-skin boot legs; when I returned from breakfast, I missed one of those pair. In consequence of information, when the prisoner went out to dinner I sent for him back, and desired him to walk into the accompting-house; a constable searched him, and this piece of calf-skin was concealed under his waistcoat, the value is five shillings, and I know it to be one of the pieces I cut out in the morning; he denied having any thing at first, but afterwards, he was asked for what purpose he had taken it, and he said, to cover a chairbottom; I gave no permission to him, or any of our servants, to take any leather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You would not have kept the prisoner thirteen or fourteen years unless you had a good opinion of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not add, that he meant to have brought it back, and applied to you to purchase it? - A. He did; and said, that he took it as being the cheapest leather, but it is the very dearest, he had no business in that part of the room where it was; there were other workmen in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAMPBELL sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Birkett and Co. I was desired by Mr. Birkett to watch, which I did, and on the 10th of May, between the hours of twelve and one, I saw the prisoner take this piece of leather from where it was concealed, and put it under his waistcoat, near the place where he was at work.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Gentlemen, I have worked with Messrs.

            : Last Saturday night was three weeks, between twelve and one in the morning, the prisoner followed me down Newgate-street, across the Old-Bailey, and down Fleet-lane; at the bottom of Fleet-lane he asked me to treat him; I said I had no objection; upon that I went in and asked for a glass of gin; the prisoner said he must have a glass of Holland's, which he had; then he followed me out again, and asked me if I would give him the price of a pot of beer; I told him I could not afford it; he followed me up Fleet-lane again, put his arm round my neck, and said, I could if I liked; I told him, no, I could not afford it; he then gave me a blow on my shoulder, and I was so frightened, that I sell down, and saw no more of the prisoner that I can remember.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not take any thing from you? - A. Yes, he took the bag of halfpence from me; there was five shillings and a penny in halfpence and penny-pieces; he saw me take some halfpence out of my bag in the wine-vaults.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the bag taken from you? - A. When he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in his hand? - A. Yes, he took it out of my left hand: I am generally paid in halfpence, and they were in a bag I made on purpose to bring them home in; I screamed out, and he was taken immediately; I saw the prisoner again on Monday, before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At No. 24, Seacoal-lane; the patrol came to me, and asked me to go and see if it was my bag and money; I saw the bag, which I made myself, but no money was in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was an aukward time of night for a woman to be out? - A. It was late, but it was past ten before I was paid, and I had to go to several places to get a few things; I stopped and supped in Whitecross-street, where I had a pint of beer, but no gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was quite a stranger, and you treated him with a glass of gin; did you tell your husband that? - A. No, my husband is out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cat's away the mice will play, I have heard; what made you treat him? - A. I had the halfpence, and I gave it him out of fear, because he kept following me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the person who keeps the wine-vaults, how much you were frightened at this naughty man? - 
               <persName id="t18020602-66-person518">A. </persName>
            No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or the watchman? - A. No, I had no apprehension; I did not think he was going to do me any harm; I gave it him out of fear and good nature.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he take the bag of halfpence? - A. In Fleet-lane, just beyond Hill's wine-vaults; he did not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the gin that made you fall, was it? - A. I don't think it could take any effect on me in so short a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel him take the halfpence from you? - A. Yes, I did, and held the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. No, I did not; he took it by main force.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that main force, fear, and fright,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020029"/>is necessary to constitute a highway robbery? - A. I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-66-person519">Q. </persName>
            Have not the officer told you, that fear and fright is necessary to make it a highway robbery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Have they told you of the reward of forty pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not any body told you of a reward of forty pounds if you convict? - A. I am told I am to tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there is forty pounds reward? - A. I don't understand the reward; no reward I want to have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been told so? - A. No, I have not asked about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you to be careful what you say? - A. What I have said I will say again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never heard from the officers, there was a reward of forty pounds? - A. They never said any thing to me about a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard any body say it? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never heard there was a reward; do you mean to swear that? - A. I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, do you mean to swear that when you came into Court, you did not know of a reward? - A. I know the consequence is this, it is a very critical point; what I have said is nothing but the truth; I have said the same as I said before; I cannot say any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never heard, before you came here, that there was a reward of forty pounds for a highway robbery? - A. No, I have not; I was told to speak the truth, and so I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Has any body told you there is a reward; say yes or no; you shall answer it? - A. I will answer it so far as this; they said there was a reward; I have told the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether any body told you there is a reward? - A. I want no reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been told there is a reward or not? - A. All I can say is, it is a highway robbery, and that I had a right to come to the laws of my country.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been told by any body, that there is a reward for convicting a man of a highway robbery? - A. They did say there was a reward certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You say the prisoner was a stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your husband come to town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know whether you live separate from your husband? - A. I live with an uncle and aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. And all you have is your own property? - A. Yes; I am a spangle-maker, and lay out what I earn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, before the Alderman, asking any body, whether or not the prisoner was she person who had robbed you, for that you did not know him? - A. I say nothing but the truth, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask somebody? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, which is the man that has robbed me? - A. There was no one asked me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bag, whatever it contained, was taken from you before you got the blow? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. It might fall from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were not frightened or alarmed? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear to the bag? - A. I have sworn to it, and must say the same again.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have sworn to that which is not true, you are not to swear to it again? - A. I have sworn to the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the bag? - A. I can; I made it out of a bit of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not give a penny for it? - A. It was worth something to me for the use I made of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to St. Sepulchre's: On the 9th of May, at one o'clock in the morning, being at the corner of Bear-alley, Fleet-market, I heard a rattle spring, and went to it; and the watchman told me a man had escaped, and described him to me; I went into the Old-Bailey, and, at the corner of Green-harbour-court, I saw the prisoner come out with a small bag in his left hand; I said to him, its a late hour, but in your dress I suppose you have been barbering; says he, no; he then endeavoured to secure the bag under his apron; I then said, my friend, who are you, out at this late hour; he said, I am a porter just by; I said, you answer the description of a man who has ill used a poor woman in Fleet-lane, and taken from her a bag full of penny-pieces; if you have such a thing in your hand, I am a patrol, and shall take you into custody on suspicion; I then took hold of him by the left arm, and he struck me as hard as he could between the neck and shoulder with his right, and run to Giltspur-street; I recovered myself and followed him; I never lost sight of him; in Cock-lane I heard a scuffle, and somebody call out here he is; when I came up, the person who had the prisoner was just rising, and the prisoner was just above him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020030"/>offering to strike him; I caught hold of him, and held him; when we had lodged him in the Compter, I went to No. 24 Seacoal-lane, and found Mrs. Hayward, who claimed the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The lady and the prisoner both lived in Seacoal-lane? - A. I don't know, they were both strangers to me; I did not know he lived there till this day; coming along she told me did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see that woman on Sunday last? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never see her from the time you apprehended the man? - A. I saw her when we came to find the bill, but never before or since.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-66-person521">Q. </persName>

            Never, or any other.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you call at her house for? - A. To know whether she would come forward to give evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you never desired her merely to tell the truth? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have had conversation with her; why did you admonish her to tell the truth; it implies a bad opinion of a person to say, take care and tell the truth? - A. There can be nothing more plain than to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was she in on the night of the robbery? - A. Just as she is now.</p>

            , and myself, are proprietors of the Hambro' wharf: The prisoner had been our porter about two months; upon the information given us, we examined the cask, and there was a deficiency, but I cannot speak to the exact quantity; we searched the prisoner's lodgings, and found 10lb. of sugar in a pan, and 14lb. of soap; I compared the sugar with that in the cask, and it corresponded exactly; and I found that half a cwt. of soap was missing; I compared the soap, and it corresponded with that in the warehouse; the prisoner said he bought them, but could not tell where.(The article produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Neither the sugar or soap you can swear to? - A. Not positively; but, to the best of my belief, it is mine.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer, and apprehended Hahnah Butler, who lives with the prisoner, at No. 30 or 31, Field-street, Pentonville, by virtue of a warrant from the Magistrate; when I went there, the prisoner was shaving himself; I asked for her; says she, my name is Bittler; he looked at the warrant, and read it to her, and told her she must go with me; he likewise said, he would go with her himself; we all went then to Mr. Fletchor's, his attorney, and finding there was no warrant against him, he wished to go; but, before that, he had acknowledged he gave her the fifty pound note at his house to get change for; I asked him where he got it; he said, you know how I got it, I got it on the drop, meaning dropping the ring, or the cross; when he wanted to go away, I detained him; his pocket-book was laying on the table, which I took up; says he, there is a good five-pound note, and some gamnoning notes.(Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I won the notes of the prosecutor fairly; he won a guinea of me first, which he kept; he said, he would see me again; and I said, if he would make the letter himself, I would see him for a hundred; he said, I have only ninety; I turned my back, and he took the chalk to make the letter; the other man said, make it plain; says he, I cannot, the table is greasy; then he made the letter O, and I guessed O, and won the money; then he went away with his friend to receive four hundred pounds, and what conversation passed between them I don't know; but, when they were gone, I went about my business.</p>

               <p>This was an indictment tried before Mr. Common Serjeant, in February Sessions last, stating, that at a Quarter Sessions holden for the Country of Surry, this prisoner had been, in due form of law, tried and convicted, by a Jury of the County, upon an indictment charging him with having uttered one piece of false and counterfeit money, made and counterfeited to the likeness of a good half-guinea, as and for a good and lawful piece of money, knowing, when he so uttered it, that it was false; and also with having another piece of false and counterfeit money in his custody and possession, and thereupon it was considered, and adjudged by the Court, that the said

             should be imprisoned in the common goal of the County for the space of one year, and untill he find sureties for his good behaviour for two years more, to commence from the expiration of the said first year. Then it goes on, and states that he afterwards, being a common utterer of false money, on the 14th of January, at the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate, did utter one piece of false and counterfeit money, made and counterfeited to the likeness of a good seven-shilling-piece, as and for a good seven-shilling-piece, he knowing, at the time, that that seven-shillingpiece was false and counterfeit, against the statute in such case made and provided.</p>
               <p>Upon this indictment being tried before Mr. Common Serjeant, it was objected by the Counsel for the prisoner, that, in stating the original record, and the judgement of the Court of Quarter Sessions, it is not stated that the Court did adjudge the defendant a common utterer, only, that they adjudged that he be imprisoned twelve months, and find sureties for his good behaviour.</p>
               <p>This indictment is founded upon the statute of the 15th of the late King, chap. 28, and the clause, upon which the indictment is founded, is this:"And be it hereby further enacted, that if any person whatsoever, shall, after the said 29th day of September, utter, or tender in payment, any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, to the same person or persons, and shall, either the same day, or within the space of ten days then next, utter, or tender in payment, any more, or other false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, to the same person or persons, or to any other person or persons, or shall, at the time of such uttering or tendering, have about him or her, in his or her custody, one or more piece or pieces of counterfeit money, besides what was so uttered or tendered, then such person so uttering or tendering the same, shall be deemed and taken to be a common utterer of false money, and being thereof convicted, shall suffer a year's imprisonment, and shall find sureties for his or her good behaviour for two years more, to be computed from the end of the said year; and if any person having been once so convicted as a common utterer of false money, shall afterwards again utter, or tender in payment, any false or counterfeit money, to any person or persons, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, then such person being thereof convicted, shall, for such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020036"/>second offence be, and is hereby adjudged to be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy."</p>
               <p>It appears then, upon the record, that the prisoner was convicted of uttering false money, having other false money in his possession, knowing that both were false and counterfeit, and for which offence he was adjudged to be imprisoned one year, and until he find sureties for two years more. - Now, this it is which the act requires; it specifies, it is true, that such offender shall be deemed, not that he shall be adjudged, but deemed and taken; this is the conclusion of law upon the offence and upon the conviction; therefore, such adjudication is not required, it would neither be of use to the prisoner, or the public, that it should be so. The Judges are therefore most clearly of opinion, that the adjudication, that the prisoner was a common utterer, is neither necessary by the statute, by the common law, or by practice, and that therefore there is no foundation whatever for the objection.</p>
