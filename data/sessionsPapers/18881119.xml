                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 37, Coleman Street. On 18th June the prisoner called on me with Mr. Toll, who told me, in his presence, that the prisoner had a reversionary interest under the will of Mrs. Henrietta Frances Salter; this copy of the will was produced. Mr. Toll said that the prisoner's mother had a life interest, that she had two children who were entitled in reversion, viz., the prisoner and his sister, Mrs. Julia Wallington, that a Mr. Coulson had lent him £50 on mortgage, and, except as to that £50, it was free from incumbrance. Mr. Toll also said that Mr. Coulson had received a letter from the trustee, the prisoner's aunt, stating that she had received no notice of any charge or incumbrance, that the prisoner wished me to pay off Mr. Coulson and lend him a further sum—I asked the prisoner if these representations were correct—he said they were—I referred to the pencil notes on the copy of the will, and told him I should require a declaration in support of his statement—he said he would make it. On 20th June he came again, and I paid him £3 on the faith of these representations, and on the 21st I paid him £2. On the 23rd he came again with Mr. Toll—I think the statutory declaration was then made—my clerk went out with him to the commissioner, Mr. Hodson, and he executed the declaration and also the mortgage—the mortgage recites that I had paid off Coulson.

               <p>on the London and South-Western Bank—in pursuance of the arrangement with the prisoner I paid Coulson £63 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the transfer of the mortgage was taken for it. On 26th June the prisoner and Toll came again to my office—he handed me the letter purporting to be written by the trustee, Mrs. Salter, to Coulson—<hi rend="italic">letter read,</hi> 25th May, 1888: "Sir,—At the request of my nephew, I beg to inform you that I have already answered similar applications to yours to a Mr. Brassfield, but up to the present time have not received notice of any charge—the investment is in the names of trustees in Midland stock." I then said I would make a further advance, and I paid him £5 in cash and £36 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by this cheque—that is endorsed by the prisoner, and was paid by my bankers, on the same day the prisoner signed this account, showing that I had advanced him £135—I parted with that money on the representations made that he was entitled to the reversionary interest, free from incumbrance, except the £50, which I paid off—subsequently I attempted to give notice of my charge to the trustee, Mrs. Salter—I received a reply from her—in consequence of that I made certain inquiries—the result was I took these proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first took criminal proceedings about 9th August—there were several hearings—Mr. Timbrell was not a witness; he was before the Grand Jury at my request—I know nothing of a Mr. Callisher—I do not know that Messrs. Green and Cheese were Mr. Callisher's solicitors—the transaction with Green and Cheese was, I believe, on 9th October, 1879—I believe the prisoner came of age in October—I suppose Mr. Toll is an intermediary who gets money lent on security—I do not give him a commission on introductions; I suppose he has to get it from the borrowers—Mr. Toll is in Court—I have never called him as a witness—I have never charged him with conspiring with Mr. Brabazon; it is a difficult matter to prove—he was a client of mine four years ago—he was not a stranger when he came to me—I have not on many occasions advanced money when there has been a chance of costs for the offer of a mortgage—the writing of this paper is all mine except the signature; that is rather shaky—the £25 was given to him personally—I took a transfer of the mortgage from Coulson—as far as I know the prisoner's mother is alive—Mr. Toll told me afterwards that there was a reversionary interest under the will of the prisoner's great uncle, Mr. Middleton—I have not had many conversations with Mr. Toll when the prisoner was not present, not during the period when I lent the money—I did not have a long interview with him before I parted with my money—I had one or two interviews with him alone—he told me that he was being sued by creditors, and that he wanted a little money—I did not learn that a suit was commenced in Chancery by the prisoner against the executors of Cheese and Green—the body of the statutory declaration is in my clerk's writing—I do not think I shall have a good civil claim for the money I have advanced—assuming the document is set aside as to Mr. Green, I shall not be entitled to a shilling, because there are others before me—I don't think it would be worth while to proceed; I should not care to take a judgment, I don't think it would be worth anything—I don't know that I might have liked the mother to pay the money—it might have been nicer in the first instance—if the proceedings had not been commenced I should not have objected to take the money; I must wait till that time comes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in practice at 123, Pall Mall. I attested the execution of this deed on 24th October, 1879—the prisoner is the man who executed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Green and Cheese were solicitors—Callisher was never their client—we never acted for them, we have against them—Engel was never our client—I don't think Callisher introduced the prisoner to us—the prisoner told me he had £400 from Callisher on the day the deed was signed—after these proceedings were commenced a writ to cancel this document was served on me—the prisoner did not call from time to time to ask when he was to have his £400, nor did I or my partner to my knowledge tell him that I had been unable to negotiate it, and that he must consider the matter at an end; it was going on for some time—I was examined at the Police-court, and signed the depositions, and the thing was over—I did not come back to be cross-examined—I was not wanted—a long time after that I went away for my holiday in the usual way—I was never asked to be cross-examined—I have this paper signed by the prisoner to show that he had money of Callisher—it was handed to me by Callisher, to hold between the parties—this was not sued on, Callisher was to take the money out of the proceeds—the date of the bill is 14th October, 1879; that was the first I heard of it—from the year 1879 I took no proceedings for the prisoner against Callisher; I took no proceedings myself against the prisoner or on behalf of Callisher, there was no reason for any; nor on behalf of Engel—I did not act for Engel—there was no power of attorney to sell the property for £400; it is an assignment to Green for certain purposes—this is the cheque for £25; it is dated 24th October, 1879; it has been through my bankers; there is a receipt for it on the deed, no other would be required—the cheque is in my writing—I handed it to him; he executed the deed in my presence—I think he signed the back of the cheque at the bank—he did not give it back to me—neither Callisher nor Engel had it—I should think he cashed it at the bank—I did not cash it—a further sum of £5 was advanced to the prisoner on 5th November, 1879 by this cheque—I have a receipt for that cheque, because there was no receipt for it on the deed—the £5 cheque and the receipt for it are in my late partner's handwriting—they were not given in my presence—only the £5 on 5th November, and the receipt for it, and the bill for £400 were given in my presence—the two £5 and the bill of exchange which Callisher brought us were all in 1879—the bill of exchange had to be put in our possession to show money was owing; it has never been discounted—there was no occasion to sue the prisoner—the reversion of the property was sold by Green; the deed shows it—we got this assignment of the power of sale from the prisoner—Engel was not our client, he was a solicitor represented by another firm—the reversion was not put up to auction—the prisoner knew the thing was sold—I don't know when the reversion was sold, but he must have been several times at the office—he was sure to have known that all matters had come to an end—there was nothing for him to do; it would not have been right to ask him to sign</p>

               <p>anything in order to perfect our title to Engel—the £400 was advanced by Callisher on statements made by the prisoner which turned out to be untrue—I was not present to see any money paid by Callisher—the prisoner was not my client—the reversion to £3000 on the death of a lady 56 years of age was worth more than that at the time on the prisoner's statements—it was not disposed of at the time without consultation—I sold it to Engel for £175—Engel must have paid the money—the balance was handed to Callisher; there is no. acknowledgement on the back by Callisher, we took the bill to dispose of—I cannot say now how much I gave Callisher, but it was the balance after deducting the £25—Callisher had £120, he lost £300—1 do not know that he did not lend his own money—I think there is only one Engel, he may have lent the money—I don't know if he lent it as a friend of Callisher—the whole thing was settled in 1880, when I settled with Callisher by giving him £125—the bill of exchange was handed to us—there was no necessity to write off that it was satisfied to the extent of £120—I did not act as solicitor for Callisher—I don't know if he introduced the young minor to me—I never acted for Engel, whether the money-lender or solicitor—we deducted our charges in the matter of Engel from the purchase money—we did not ask the prisoner to sign any deed confirming our sale to Engel, we could not do it, it would be absurd—the writ to set aside this deed was issued after the institution of the prosecution.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a carver and gilder of 30, St. James Market, Jermyn Street, and I keep a provision shop there—on September 19th about 12. 15 a. m. I was shutting up the shop and saw the prisoner come from St. James Market and go to a doorway 4 or 5 yards from my door and put something in a corner of a doorstep—he stood there 2 or 3 minutes, saw me and tied up his shoes—he had a pair of brown shoes on with pointed toes, and I noticed that he had long white shirt cuffs—he then went round the corner into Market Street, and I went to see what was there and found two packets of money—I opened one of them in my shop and found some bad florins, I did not count them, they had paper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188811190010"/>
               <p>between them—I had them in my hand just inside my door when the prisoner came back and went to the same doorway and then to the next, and looked and then went out of the Market—a policeman then came and the prisoner came back a third time and looked in all the doorways—I said "Have you lost anything?" he said, "Yes," and passed on looking in the doorways—he again left the-Market—the constable came and I showed him the two packets I had found, and described the man, and he afterwards brought the prisoner back in custody and said, "Is this the man?" I said yes—the prisoner said nothing—I handed the two packets to another constable, Jackson—there were three oil lamps in my shop window, my door was open and there were two street lamps, one at the end of the Market and the other 6 or 7 yards off—I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The two packets were separate—mine was the only shop open—the Whole thing took about ten minutes—I should be rather surprised to hear that he had boots on; they were brown yellow shoes—I think his cuffs were white with a light stripe—I told the constable that the prisoner had a white waistcoat on; I don't remember whether I said that he had striped cuffs or yellow shoes—I did not see anyone else about—when I said "Have you lost anything?" he answered me, and I saw his face, but he did not stop—he went up the Market placing his hands on his head—the constable and I were not together above two minutes—the constable said "Is this the man?" and I immediately said "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When he was taken I stayed in the shop; I had to finish shutting up—he looked at me while he was tying his bootlace.</p>

On 19th September, about 12. 15 a. m., I was on duty, and Mrs. Randell spoke to me—I went into her shop and she showed me two packets—I examined the open one—it contained ten bad florins—she described a man, and I went out and met the prisoner at the corner of Martin and Market Streets, about 20 yards from the shops—I said I should take him in custody for placing counterfeit coin under a doorstep—he made no reply, but struggled—I took him to Mrs. Randell's shop and said, "Is this the man?"—she said, "Yes"—I took him to the station, where Jackson handed me these coins—the prisoner had on a white waistcoat, brown boots, a brown coat, and a brown hard felt hat—I saw the second packet opened at the station; it contained six half-crowns, wrapped separately in paper, and each coin folded over—I found on him four florins, a shilling and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, all good—he was charged, and made no reply—he gave his address, 29, Osborne Street, but next morning at the Police-court he said 29, Oswin Street.</p>

's order is treated as one of £12 for 3 years, amounting in all to £36; his commission on that at 30 per cent, was £74<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was in his handwriting—some time afterwards I communicated with Hanson, Carter, and Co., and heard from them on the subject—the prisoner remained in our employment till some time in October, when in consequence of inquiries about this and other matters steps were taken against him.</p>

On the 21st he came again, and stated that he had another tenant, Mr. Fletcher, a shoemaker next door to Malony, who would pay me his quarter's rent if I would lend him £7 10 s.—I gave him this cheque for the amount, and he signed and gave me this receipt—soon after 25th March I saw Malony—I did not get the rent—I have not been paid a penny—I believe this letter is the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Green Gate, Bethnal Green. On 26th October, about 4.50 p. m., I served a woman with two of gin and bitters; she put a penny on the counter, a florin on that, and a halfpenny on that; she then picked up the florin, offered the 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and felt in the pocket of her apron, saying "I have got no more money, you must take</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188811190015"/>
               <p>it out of that," and put down the florin—I picked it up, bit it, found it was bad, threw it on the counter, and said, "Do you know this is a bad one?"—she picked it up, looked at it, put it down on the counter, and told me to make it three halfpennyworth of drink, which I did, and she left—I followed her, and saw her join Warren and Morris. (<hi rend="italic">See next case.</hi>) Edwards is the woman—they conversed together and walked together to Brick Lane—Warren and Edwards went into Mr. Rouse's, a linendraper's in Bethnal Green Road; they came out and joined Morris, who was standing at the corner of Gibraltar Walk, watching—I went into the shop and spoke to Davey, who showed me a bad florin—we both came out, and I put him behind Morris, while I followed Warren and Edwards down Brick Lane, where a constable took Warren—he struggled violently, and threw the constable on his back—Edwards and Morris went in different directions—on November 1st I picked out Edwards from a number of women, and on the Sunday following I picked out Morris from among a number of men—he at first caused me to be doubtful, as he drew himself up to such a height while he stood in the row, but when I saw him walk I identified him—he limped.</p>

                  </persName>. I am a tea merchant, of 41, Great Tower Street—in August I took the prisoner into my employ as traveller—on 25th August he said he had received orders from Mr. Nix and Mr. Smith, and gave me this paper in his writing, "Josiah Nix, 1/2 chest of tea at 2 s. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Mr. Smith, Olinda Road, 16 s. 6 d. Try and beat W. and D."—W. and D. are other tea merchants—I never give out tea without a written order—it was then and there entered in the order-book—this yellow paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the kind of paper I put my tea in—this came from my place, and this is my warehouse clerk's writing on it—the prisoner said that as Smith lived so near him he could deliver it by hand—it was handed to him, but I don't think he took it away with him—on the following Saturday I gave him his commission on it, 9 d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not take it away, and I ordered it to be sent to his house for delivery, as he lived so close and the address was indefinite, "Smith, a general shop, Olinda Road"—he requested me to send it to him—I did so, and wrote him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Requesting the prisoner to deliver the tea</hi>)—"Try and beat W. and D." means that if I beat them I should probably get orders from Smith—Mrs. Torring deals with me—this tea was not sent to him and sold to her for 9 s. after Smith refused it—I cannot tell what becomes of a parcel after it leaves my office—I know that 9 s. was collected from Mrs. Torring, but it was not paid to me—Mrs. Warland called on me two or three times early in October with a list which I had provided—she mentioned £4 odd, and asked if I would take it and put an end to the whole matter—I said "Decidedly not, you may leave it if you like, but I can make no conditions whatever"—I engaged Warland's stepdaughter on September 7th, as he asked me to do so—she came again to my warehouse on the 8th, but never came again, and on the Monday I sent a telegram asking why she had not come—the prisoner told me that she was ill—I do not know what made her ill—my telegram on the 10th was" Hetty not arrived"—I had returned home with her a part of the way when she came on the 7th; I had promised her father that I would do so—she was never in my private room—I took her out to lunch, and she told her father I treated her well—we went round by Bow—I had very good reasons for going that way—I did not go to Stamford Hill, I went to Hackney—it did not make three minutes' difference—we were in a first-class carriage—I think there were other people in the carriage, but not the whole way—she came the next day, Saturday—I did not give her a kiss—I acted in no way wrongfully to her—I live at Clapton, a long way from Stamford Hill—she met me on the Saturday morning at the station—I told her the train I was going by, and if she liked to go that way she could, if she was at all nervous—I took a first-class ticket for her; that was about twenty</p>

               <p>. minutes to 9 a. m.—that is my station, unless I go by omnibus—I did not at night accompany her in the train again—I never saw her after two o'clock on Saturday—in the morning going to the warehouse I was not alone with her again in the train—I did not take her on my knee and kiss her, and behave in a grossly indecent manner with her—there is not a word of truth in it, the carriage was full of people—a charge of indecent assault was not made against me before I made this charge against the prisoner, nor was a solicitor consulted as to prosecuting me criminally, I wish he had been—I invited the prosecution, but it never came—Mr. Sills came to my house—I gave him his quietus, and he never came near me again after what I told him—I told the girl by what train I should go to the warehouse—the prisoner said that she was very nervous, and did not know her way about the City; and I said that I would look after her; and I saw her well on her way home, and said, "If you are not able to find your way to the office, do you think you can on Saturday morning, here is sixpence to pay your train fare"—I told her the best way to go, and said, "If you think you will not be able to find your way, I invariably go to the office from Clapton Station; I shall be there at 8. 30," and she was there—I don't know her age—she looks about 15—I engaged her as a packer, only as a little assistance to her father—he brought her to the office on the Friday morning—on the Saturday after-noon, going home, I took a Hansom's cab for the prisoner, the stepdaughter, and myself—I did not travel alone in the cab with the girl, only for two minutes while her stepfather jumped out to go into a customer's shop—I do not know that this is the reason why the girl did not return to me after the 8th. I have only gathered it since as an excuse—I attribute that excuse to the prisoner; it was at his importunity that I employed her—I did not know why she kept away, and I was very anxious to find out, and I found it out three weeks afterwards—I have not had a little experience in charges of this sort—I was a member of the Salvation" <hi rend="italic">Army</hi> "eighteen months ago, but am not now—I was not turned out; I resigned honourably—a meeting was not held to consider my conduct towards females—Rose Anna Penny was a servant of mine, but no inquiry was made by the officers of the Salvation <hi rend="italic">"Army"</hi> into my conduct in reference to her, nor was I in consequence dismissed—I was not prohibited from appearing or speaking on the Salvation" <hi rend="italic">Army</hi> "platforms—I have reason to believe that Rose has had a child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the paper called the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Clipper</hi>—the prisoner was in my employment as general manager, and had been so eight years last March—I am usually absent from London on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—whether I was absent or present it was the prisoner's duty to open all letters and do the correspondence; he had the whole management of the paper—if a letter came enclosing money it was his duty to send a receipt and enter the name and address of the person on the counterfoil; then he would enter the name and address in the subscribers' book—all the money he received was to be placed in the safe, of which he had the key—he accounted to me for it usually at the end of the week, nearly every week, when I settled up with him—I reckoned up the money and compared it with the counterfoils, and if correct I signed the last receipt in the book—I had suspicion before October this year, because the receipts fell off so much, but I could not find it out—I told him to take four days' leave of absence, and while he was absent I received more than 200 complaints from subscribers—amongst them was one from Mr. Manner, of the Queen's Hotel, Manchester Road, Poplar—thereupon I searched the receipt book to see if I had any entry of his name—I could not find any—I could not find his name entered in the subscribers', book—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's writing—I find entered in it Mr. Manner's name—the endorsement to this cheque (H. Pearce) is in the prisoner's writing, and this bundle of envelopes is addressed in the prisoner's writing—I have recently examined the end of my receipt book, I find about 25 pages and about 100 receipts have been cut out with a</p>

               <p>penknife, counterfoils and all—there are four receipts on a page—subsequently to the prisoner's leaving I received this letter from him on Saturday, November 3—it is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This expressed regret for careless conduct, and a desire in any way to repair any havoc it had caused, and a hope that in view of his aged parents' condition he might be permitted to do his best to retrieve his position and still write for the paper.</hi>) I wrote in answer to the prisoner's father, because I wanted his book with the addresses; I did not write to the prisoner, I had no address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The publisher (Brooke) brings out the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Clipper</hi>—he has been publisher for eight years—Locke Narburgh is my son, he is about 20—he was 19 on 12th November—in 1883 he was about 13 or 14—he has been on the register of the paper for two or three years—I cannot say if he has been since 1883—I have been very ill, on my death-bed very nearly; it has affected my memory very much—I don't know that this boy of 14 was registered as publisher in 1883—he was registered as proprietor—I have been abroad for two or three months at a time—I don't know if he was put on the register as printer and publisher—the prisoner generally put the article together from my notes—I have written hundreds of articles for this paper—I have not done so within the last year; perhaps I wrote some last year—the prisoner had to pay the wages on every Friday—on a few occasions he got advertisements for the paper; it was not part of his business to do so; we do not press anyone to advertise—we do not want advertisements; as a rule, we had a good business without them—to my knowledge he did not pay money out of his pocket to agents and others to get advertisements—I never heard of his doing so—<hi rend="italic">Advertisement read:</hi>—"'Turf Investments. A Guide to Winning on the Turf,' by T. Narburgh, the result of 25 years practical experience in the ring. This system of backing horses, being entirely new and original, will be found the best guide to winning money on the turf ever published, being simple in action and certain in its results. Mr. Thomas Narburgh has been the most successful backer of horses in the kingdom under this system, having won a fortune, and what is more, retained it. Post free from the author, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. T. Narburgh, Elstree, Herts. I am the most successful backer of horses in the kingdom; I have won a lot of money, a fortune, and kept it—I am a member of the Victoria Club, not Tattersall's. I could be a member of that; I do not care about it." (<hi rend="italic">Another advertisement was read, announcing that T. Narburgh would attend Yarmouth and Kempton Park meetings, and adding,</hi> "Mr. Thomas Narburgh has determined to discontinue sending results of races, as these are for the most part required only for fraudulent purposes.")—We send results of races from the office—my business is quite distinct from the business in London—my son has advertised as Jack the Spaniard—I have not—he asked my permission to put the advertisement in—(<hi rend="italic">An Advertisement was read to the effect that Mr. Potter Brown would telegraph selections for Brighton and Lewes for £1 Address P. Brown, Emery's Temperance Hotel, Brighton</hi>). I decline to say if that was my advertisement—I was personally advertising from the Post Office, Brighton—I do not have two addresses in the same town at race meetings, one in the name of Narburgh, and one in another name—I never had letters sent to Ludgate Circus in any name—I decline to answer anything referring to Potter Brown—I describe myself as possessing this marvellous skill and certain system—I continue to offer</p>

               <p>my services to the public—I should be at Manchester now—I have advertised for 25 years in the name of Narburgh—I have not looked into the law on this question of advising people; that had nothing to do with my putting the boy forward as the proprietor of the paper—I was seriously ill at the time, on my death-bed it was thought, and I left the property in the will to him, and it was thought it had better be in his name—this was three or four years ago—this paper is printed on Friday night, and brought out on Saturday—the prisoner attended at the office entirely—my son was also there, and another clerk—the paper was not printed at the office, but the type is composed there—George Ascot Voysey is dead—I should be at the office on Monday, from 10 o'clock until about 3—I did not send the prisoner a telegram asking him to meet me after I had sent him away—I do not know it was the practice not to give a formal receipt for amounts under 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these are my initials; it is a receipt—when a receipt is missed another is taken from the end of the book—if the prisoner was not in the office during the week, the boy would see persons who called, or my son would sometimes—my son, the registered proprietor, would not have authority to do what he pleased; he was under the prisoner—the prisoner saw everyone who came, unless he was away, and then I don't know who would see them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had my son's name put on the register because I was ill—I cannot recollect when the registration took place; it was within the last few years—I left my son the paper in the will when I was ill, and in case I should die his mother said his name had better be put on the register to save bother—since then there has been no alteration in it; it has been in the hands of the publisher—besides money from subscriptions and advertisements, the prisoner received money from the wholesale newsagents on Friday, and out of "that money he made what payments he had to make—I have his last statement of the payments—I always kept him well supplied with money; he was never short—he had never paid money out of sums received for subscriptions or advertisements to my knowledge—it was his duty to cross the cheques with the name of my bankers, the Union Bank of London, Chancery Lane—it was his duty to put all money received from subscriptions and advertisements into the safe, and to pay it over to me when he accounted, not to spend it; he had plenty of money.</p>

I live at 30, Finch Street, Whitechapel—between half-past 11 and 12 on Bank Holiday night, 6th August, I was standing just inside the gate of my house, when my attention was attracted by two boys fighting almost opposite my gate in the street—I did not know them—I crossed the road, and said, "Leave off fighting"—the prisoner, who was in the mob and backing one of the boys up, struck me on the head with his two fists—I fell down; he jumped on my left leg—I became insensible, and found myself in the hospital—I knew the prisoner before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I live next door to the Hop Pole beer-house—the fight was closer to my gate than to the middle of the road—it had been going on five or ten minutes—there was a mob of people all standing round—I and the prisoner have been friends; he had no reason to bear me animosity, nor I him; we are neighbours—he jumped on me imme<lb/>diately</p>

               <p>after he knocked me down—I was lying on my side—the Hop Pole does not give a very bright light—I could see very well; my gas was alight, and shone under my gate—there were people between me and the gate—I did not see my wife come up—my wife and another man drew me out of the mob—she spoke to me as I was taken in at the gate—she went indoors when I went out of the gate, and when I hallo out, "My leg is broken," she came to me out of my house—I left the gate open when I came out; there is a wicket-gate, and then the parlour door to my house.</p>

On 9th November Mr. Brown called me to the two prisoners at 3, Hamsell Street—there was a horse and van there—he said, "There is something wrong here, I wish you to detain these two men; they are removing my goods without my giving them authority"—I asked the prisoners who had given them authority to remove the goods, and Been said, "A man with a full brown beard; he asked us, as we were standing by the Grapes, if we wanted to earn two bob'—I said, "Where is the man?"—Been looked round and said, "I cannot see him"—I asked him where the carman was—he said, "There is no carman"—I asked Mr. Brown if the room was locked—he went upstairs, I remaining below with the prisoners—Mr. Brown came down again and said, "The room is locked in the usual way"—he went to 30, Hamsell Street, and came back, bringing the key with him; we went upstairs, I taking the two prisoners—I saw the door of the third floor opened—I heard no question asked as to the door of the room being locked—I searched the prisoners at the station, and found on Been this key, which fitted the padlock.</p>

I did not hear Mr. Brown ask Been who unlocked the door—when I came up the prisoners were standing by the cart—I remained with them till they were taken into the room where the mantles were, and I did not hear Mr. Brown ask who unlocked the door, nor did I hear either prisoner say "the man that employed us unlocked it and locked it up again"—Been gave me a correct address—I have ascertained he is a fireman employed oh board a vessel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker at 164, Drury Lane—on 1st November, about half-past four in the afternoon, I was in the George Hotel in the Strand, nearly opposite the Central Hall of the Royal Courts of Justice—while I was in the front bar speaking to a juryman, who had been discharged from attendance, I turned my head, and noticed the prisoner looking over the stained-glass or embossed part of the window, looking in at me—he was standing in Devereux Court—the window faces Devereux Court—I walked out, and when he saw me he ran away—I stood outside the front door for about ten minutes to see where he had gone, and I then saw the prisoner emerge from a dark corner about twelve yards off, to the right of Devereux Court, near the Griffin—I beckoned him towards me, just to let him know that I had seen him—he came towards me—I said, "Come along, there's no use in hiding; I have seen you long before"—he laughed the matter off as a joke—he said, "It's all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188811190037"/>
               <p>right, let us come in and have a drink"—I said, "All right," and we both went into the George, and we were joined by two other parties—the prisoner paid for the drink this time—we had a separate drink, in separate vessels—what was called for, of course, we drank—one of the parties who joined us I had never seen before, whose name was the same as the prisoner's; he called him by the name—there was a pot of ale called for then—the other party I had seen on two or three occasions at the Law Courts, I did not know his name—I think he called for a pot of ale, and the prisoner called for a pot of ale—it was all drank amongst us—I think altogether it was two pots of ale and two half-pints of ale—the other Kavanagh said to the prisoner," You were receiving £6 a week from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Solicitors," or "the <hi rend="italic">Times"</hi> I am not sure which; "you must certainly be an informer," and he said he was quite ashamed of being of the same name—the prisoner said he was nothing at all of the sort, and that by and bye, when he would be in the witness-box, he would turn the tables on the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> he wanted to have as much money as he possibly could out of them—the prisoner then turned to me and said, "You called me a consummate scoundrel in the Freemasons' Arms; do you call it me again?" I said "Yes, and I shall always consider you such." He then made a blow at my head with his fist, which I avoided; it caught me in the shoulder, and I wont down with the force of the blow—I made an attempt to retaliate with my fist, and the friends that were present intervened and prevented me—I let the matter go over, I never retaliated—I remained there for a short time, until the young Kavanagh asked me if I knew of a place of convenience—I told him yes, and I took him across to the urinal that stands in the centre of the road facing the Law Courts—I left the prisoner and the other young man in the bar—when we returned to the George the prisoner accused me of vilifying his name and character to the other Kavanagh during our absence, which I denied—I had a glass of ale in my hand at the time, half-drunk, when he hit me at the side of the head with his fist, and I hit him with the glass; it was partly empty—the effect on him was very little, but the effect on the glass was that you could simply pick up the pieces—the glass hit him; but his head was out of the glass, his head looked like a paving-stone—the glass was shivered into <hi rend="italic">smithereens</hi>—the glass was rather thin—then we hit one another as best we could, with our fists, and he being a more powerful man than me, I got down again, and he kicked me four or five times while I was down—the other two that were in the bar with us, with the assistance of the manager and the barman, who jumped across the counter to my assistance, got me away from him and pinned him up in a corner of the bar—the manager asked me to withdraw outside until quietness and peace should be restored, until they could get the prisoner quiet—I went out—as I was going out at the door, the prisoner seeing me, tore himself away from the men that held him in the corner, and came to the door—he opened one side of the door with his left hand, and deliberately pulled his revolver from his trousers pocket and aimed at me—he took a deliberate aim at my head, and fired—I was scarcely further away from him than I am from his Lordship when he fired—I expect if I had not moved it would have hit my heart, but I ducked my head—I was not more than three yards away from him at the time—I was just in time to save myself—the very moment I stooped them</p>

               <p>Was the shot, and the flash in my very eyes, and the bullet whizzed by my ear—he then came out at the door—he held the revolver still in the same position—I expected he was about to fire a second time, and I dodged about behind a few parties that collected—I saw him held by a party, and I saw a policeman, and I stepped up at once and gave him into custody—I charged him with shooting at me—I did not hear what he said—he was taken to Bow Street station—I followed behind—I heard him charged there, and he said he had a perfect right to shoot me, and that Mr. Soames would back him up in it, and that Mr. Soames gave him the money, or a sovereign, for the revolver, and he bought it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had damaged it in some way after that, and got it repaired, which cost him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at a shop at the corner of Chancery Lane—at the station he said if he had shot me dead the devil a hair on his head would be touched for it—I had known him about five or six weeks—he had shown me the revolver in the Freemasons' Arms, and he told me who had given him the money for it—when it was repaired, I accidentally met him in Holborn, and I waited outside the door while he went in and got it repaired and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he showed me the card; it was Watson and something, at the corner of Chancery Lane—I have been a resident in this country 21 years—I have resided in Drury Lane seven months or so—during the five weeks I have known the prisoner I have been frequently in his company—we have been very comfortable at times, rather friendly—we have had a few altercations.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. We were not friendly down to the time of this occurrence—it was not my wish to cease to be friendly—it was about three weeks before that the altercation took place—one night he asked me to accompany him to Rodney Road, the address of William Maloney, and because I got the address he even assaulted me because I would not give him up the address—the altercation was simply because I had been prying into his business here as a witness for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—in the course of our conversation in a friendly way I wished to glean as much as I could from him as to what he had to say as an informer over here—I did not care so much for neglecting my business, as long as I was doing any good to my countrymen, if there was anything in it—he was doing about the same, trying to pry into my business—I was just as wide awake as he was—my business was not quite similar to his—I was not, on the part of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> receiving £6 or £7 a week—I have been summoned as a witness by Mr. Soames—I don't mean that Mr. Soames himself came and summoned me—their paid agent did, William Maloney—I have got my summons here (<hi rend="italic">producing</hi> it)—I had spoken to the prisoner about my evidence during these altercations—Maloney is their paid agent to go about and rake up all the evidence he possibly can—I got half a sovereign with my subpoena, and I got half a sovereign the first day Maloney took me into the office—it was to pay me for my day's labour in coming there—I have since had, I think, two more half-sovereigns from them—that was not from Maloney, but from Mr. Soames's clerk—Maloney was not the man that was paying the witnesses, he is something similar to a recruiting sergeant, to go about and rake up all the rubbish he can to give in to Mr. Soames; something similar to my own, similar to the statement ho got me to make—he told me I could make up a yarn outside—I said, "What, do you want me to go against my countrymen?"—I said I would not—I went into one of the offices, and Maloney went in to two of</p>

               <p>the clerks—that was at Mr. Soames's office, 58, Lincoln's Inn Fields—I saw two of the clerks there; one was Mr. Edmunds, I think, and the other Mr. Hall.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. I told the prisoner what I was going to do—I told him I had pitched them a yarn that would knock them sick; in fact, that would hang half the Irish members, if it was only true—I told him the course of action I would take if I was called into the witness-box—I told him I had manufactured a pill for Mr. Soames, and I would see that he swallowed it, and that I would leave it to Sir James Hannen and Sir Charles Russell to see whether he would digest it or not, or whether they could manufacture it or not—I told him that when I went into the witness-box, if ever I got there, I should turn the tables on him altogether in favour of my own countrymen.</p>

I did not go of my own accord—I was taken by their agent—he wanted to entrap me, and I thought I would entrap them—they did not take me there to make a yarn that would make them sick, but I gave it to them the more for that—I have not got a copy of the yarn—I could not even think of a second word of it this moment; it just came to me there and then—there was not a particle of truth in it; that is the truth for you now—it was a yarn just to suit their own palate; it was very nice—if it did not suit them it would not be any use at all—the pill was stiff enough—I made it just to suit their palate, that is it—I think that was right—I did not tell a deliberate lie—it was like this, I wish to show you my justification—it is nothing but trickery and falsehood that they are acting under at the present time themselves—I did tell a deliberate lie, and I consider I was justified in doing so, to fight them with their own weapons, because it is nothing but lies they are building on—I told the prisoner that as they were playing a little bit of trickery on their side, I did not see why T, as an Irisnman, should not do the same on our side, and meet them with their own weapons—I told him that a verbal statement I considered as nothing whatever; but sworn testimony I would adhere to in any place—I value my oath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know that Mr. Soames was solicitor to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> till I was taken there—I don't know how much money I have had from him, about four half-sovereigns—I don't think I have had five—he paid me half a sovereign for my loss of time the first time I was taken there by his paid emissary—the next time I received another half sovereign with my subpoena—after making my statement I was subpœnaed as a witness to attend to give evidence before the Commission—the statement I made was a verbal statement; there was no truth whatever in it—that is my answer; you don't want it straighter than that—I took their money as a witness; they were throwing it away like sawdust, and I did not see why I should not have some of it—there was no swindle in it.</p>

Lewis and Lewis, of Ely Place—I saw a clerk, I can't say his name, I told him as nearly as I could possibly think the statement I had made at Mr. Soames'—it was taken down by the said clerk—I did not tell him that I had told the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> solicitors a pack of lies—he asked me, was there any truth in the statement, and I said "No"—he did not ask me if I was called as a witness for the <hi rend="italic">Times;</hi> was I going to sell them?—I simply told him there was no truth in it—I did not tell him I was going into the witness-box, because I was not sure—I got nothing at all on that occasion—I did not get anything from Mr. Lewis at any time—I was not promised anything—I went there when I got my subpoena—I wanted to ask for some guidance in the matter; I mean that; I told him I had been to Mr. Soames's office and received a subpoena, and I asked him his opinion on the matter—I have not had any money from the other side—who do you mean by the other side?—I don't at all know who you mean by the other side—do you mean have I had half a sovereign from Mr. Lewis?—put it in a definite form and I will answer it—I had no money from Mr. Lewis—I had half a sovereign from Kavanagh; that was not in Mr. Lewis' office, it was out in the street—I don't know what it was for—Kavanagh was there at Mr. Lewis's office, and he took me there that day and gave me half a sovereign, but Mr. Lewis never gave me a half penny—whether he or any of his clerks gave it to Kavanagh is a thing I know nothing about—I don't know Mr. Griffiths, one of Mr. Lewis's clerks; I don't know any of their names—I know that the prisoner was subpœnaed as a witness for the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> so he told me; he told me he was going to give evidence—I had called him a consummate scoundrel, not because he was going to give evidence, but because he told me that he expected when the case would be over he would receive £1,000 or £2,000 to take him out of the country and get a Government situation—that gave me to understand what he was at once—it was not then that I called him a consummate scoundrel, but I held him in my opinion as such—I never called him an informer, as far as I remember; but if I did not call him one, I thought him one—to the best of my memory I did not call him one in the hearing of anybody—I really can't swear to that; I may have done—I did not do so at the Freemasons' Arms in the presence of a number of my countrymen—I did not call him a blasted informer; I can't remember anything of the kind; I hardly said a word to the man—he has called it to me, though, and tried to make my countrymen think I was such—I did not threaten him in Rodney Street—I had not a stick with me—this is one I have had to carry—this is the first day I have brought it with me, and that is because I was run over—I did not have it with me the day I went to the George—I had not brought this stick out this twelvemonth or two years—I never carry such, but I was run over accidentally last Monday by the wheel of a cab over my toe, and was compelled to bring it</p>

               <p>with me—I knew that the prisoner had a revolver, and that he carried it about with him—I don't know that he had been threatened—I had no animosity against him, only this, that I wished to glean anything I possibly could out of him, if there was the slightest chance—he did not tell me that he had bought the revolver in consequence of threats, and that he walked about in fear—nothing of the sort, nor if he fired it off in the street it would soon bring the police for protection—to fire it at my head is a new way to call attention—I was a member of the National League off and on for some few months—I have been attached to Irish Nationality for some years—I am not a member of the Fenian organisation—I was when it was in existence—since that has been put down by Mr. Parnell and his party I have joined the National League—I knew the Fenian was a rebel organisation, the League is a constitutional agitation, I believe; not so with the other—I carry a knife, as I used to; that is the biggest one I carry (<hi rend="italic">producing small one</hi>)—when the prisoner saw that I noticed him at the George he ran away—I did not know why, but I knew it was for some very queer purpose—he did not want me to see him, I daresay—what his motive was I can't say—I did not go out and beckon to him just then; I did after about ten minutes—I just simply drew the badger, when I saw him in the corner I thought I would walk him out, which I did—when we were together the dispute took place—I had not had very much drink that day—I think it might have been four or five half-pints of ale altogether; it might be a little more than that through the course of the day; it might amount to six half-pints—when he said to me, "You called me a consummate acoundrel in the Freemasons' Arms," he made an attempt with his fist at my head, which I avoided, and it caught my shoulder; it knocked me down—my striking him with the glass was about half an hour after the first assault—I think I had a perfect right to do so—I did not see any blood on his head—I was knocked down and ticked about five times, and a man came to my assistance—when I got outside I was standing just in front of the door; I had no time to go very far—he stood inside the door, and took deliberate aim at me, opening the door with his left hand; he was about three yards from me—he fired in my direction—he was standing just in front of me—I felt the bullet whiz—I don't know that I said that before the Magistrate, I may have forgotten to say so—I really don't remember what I did say before the Magistrate, but I know, on my solemn oath, that the bullet did whiz—I don't remember whether I did say so or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager at the George Hotel. On the afternoon of 1st November, about twenty-five minutes past five, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner in the bar—they were arguing in a loud tone, so I had to ask them to be quiet—the prisoner asked me if I would serve him with some more beer, which I refused—they still stopped in the bar for a short time—they were both perfectly sober, as far as I could judge; but I thought if they went out of the house, there would be an end of the row, or bother, or loud talking—a short time after, I turned my head and saw the prisoner strike at Lane—I heard them speaking to each other before that; I did not hear what was said—the blow did not seem to hurt Lane in any way that I could see—at the same time he struck at Lane, Lane had an ale glass in his hand, with which he hit the prisoner on the head, and it fell to the ground and smashed, and the prisoner fell to the ground—I don't think the glass smashed on his head; I think it fell on the ground—I heard it fall, and heard it smash—I could not see in the scuffle whether it smashed on the man's head or on the floor—, after that they seemed to close with each other, and in the struggle Lane was pushed on the floor—I saw the prisoner kick Lane three or four times—I jumped over the counter to separate them, caught hold of the prisoner, and held him up in a corner on the left of the bar—while I was holding him he said two or three times," Leave go; let me go"—I still held on to him, and a short time afterwards I noticed him put his hand into his left-hand side pocket and pull out a revolver—he got away from me, and went towards the door—I also went towards the door, and opened one of them, he opened the other; I thought he was going out, but instead of that he held up his arm, and fired at Lane, who was standing by the side of the kerb in the gutter—he pointed the revolver at his head—it was not discharged immediately he pointed; there was a</p>

               <p>short time, I should say about twenty seconds before he fired—Lane was standing there during that time, he seemed to move about—I did not see any persons in the street, I was standing close to him—after firing he turned round as if he would walk back into the bar, but afterwards walked out of the house—I afterwards saw him in the hands of the police.</p>

I don't know you; look here"—he turned the right side of his face towards me, and I saw that it was cut and looked very bad; it seemed to be lacerated—the blood was smothered on his face, the right side of his face seemed smothered with blood, just in front of the lower part of the ear—he whipped by me very quickly, and opened the left-hand door with his left hand—the manager, Mr. Minch, opened the right-hand door—I expected the prisoner was going out; but he stopped, planted himself firmly, and drew the revolver—I looked out in the direction he was pointing, and saw Lane in front, in the road, about four feet from the kerb—the footpath is about three yards wide—the prisoner took a very long aim at Lane—he was interrupted three times by persons passing across his sight—I was at his right-hand shoulder, close to him, just at the rear of him—Lane kept dodging, moving his body while the prisoner was taking aim, and as he was about to pull the trigger I knocked his arm up, just the front part of his elbow—his arm was nearly straight—I partly turned him round after he fired, and he partly turned himself—I said, "Give me that thing"—he said, "Who are you? I don't know you, you are not a policeman, I want a policeman"—I said, "Don't be a fool, man, give it to me"—as I was about to say I was a policeman some constables came up.</p>

Price," are in the defendant's writing; there is no substantial difference between them and the signature on the bill—I was sober, and I believe he was sober when he signed till—we had had a glass or two of whisky after dinner, and had been for the evening—if it had not been for the conjunction of his ordinary writing and my own writing on the bill, I should have been very 10th to believe it—on 28th September, 1886, I wrote to him saying, "I think you ought to have provided for my acceptance, and now you say nothing about it;" that was after the bill was dishonoured; I do not think I had any reply to that—I saw him one day at an hotel in Holborn, but that was when the substantial part of the business was concluded.</p>

I am Secretary of the Mutual Loan Association, Limited—I received this bill of exchange from Mr. Barlow—it was like a post-dated cheque—we charged him nothing for it—we presented it at maturity through our bankers, and it was returned endorsed, "Orders not to pay"—I communicated with Mr. Barlow, and in January we communicated with the defendant, and received this reply, dated 12th January, 1887, and signed," R. L. Price," the same as on the bill—in reply to that I wrote a letter on 13th January, of which this is a copy. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the bill had been held over at the drawer's request</hi>)—in answer to that I received this letter, dated January 15th, from the defendant, saying," My cousin, Mr. Ewens, will see you on Monday in reference to your two letters to me"—I think Mr. Ewens called, and I think I saw him—nothing came of it, and on February 21st I issued this writ.</p>

               <p>a letter of January 15th, 1887—it may have been a week after the letter—it did not exceed two or three weeks—I cannot say whether it was before the end of February—I think it was before I instructed my solicitor—the defendant would know that I had the bill because if they presented it at his bankers they would forward it to him—I had financial transactions with Mr. Barlow, and he was indebted to me—he was to have credit for the full amount—I charged him about 20 per cent, interest, not 45—I have a bill of sale on him—I handed Mr. Beard, my solicitor, the bill on some date subsequent to January, 1887—when I made my affidavit the bill was before me at Mr. Beard's office or before the Commissioner—I most likely read it over—paragraph I says "This action is brought to recover principal and interest on a bill of exchange drawn by the defendant, Walter A. Barbour"—that is not true—I admit that I have made a mistake if that is so—I have apparently deliberately sworn what is not correct—I made two affidavits—I made the second after the defendant's, and Mr. Barlow must have made his after the defendant's—when the defendant made his affidavit the only affidavit in existence was this of mine of March 24th—the true defendant was Barlow, and not Walter A. Barber—I am afraid that in my affidavit, which I filed after the defendant's affidavit, I still continued to adopt the suggestion that Walter A. Barber was the defendant—I have no entry of when we received this bill—we did not give him credit for it—we took it, and I should credit it when it was paid—we put it in a case to be presented when due, and although the title was passed to us we did not enter it—we received it about June, soon after it was made it was due in August—we made no communication to the defendant about it for nearly six months, but I wrote to Barlow at once—he asked us not to press; he owed us more money, and we were pressing him—if he had brought us money we should have taken it on the ordinary loan—we should have kept it till we had cleared him off our books—there are no shares in the market—Mr. Barlow did not arrange with us, only to look to him—he did not want us to press Price—we served notice of dishonour on Mr. Barlow next day, but we did not give the defendant notice of the dishonour by our Society.</p>

Bell, Brodrick, and Gray attended at my office and inspected the bill—that was two days before application was made before the Master—the Master gave leave to defend, and we then applied to a Judge, and produced Mr. Barlow's affidavit; and Mr. Justice Manisty gave us judgment—the defendant paid nothing under that judgment; and in June, 1887, we took proceedings against him for perjury—he appeared at the Mansion House on the first occasion, and the case was adjourned to July 13th, when he did not appear, and a warrant was issued.</p>

Barber—the Barber was wrong, but the signature might be taken for Barbour—I adopted the Barber on the writ—Barlow was not served with a copy of it to my knowledge, nor have we got judgment against him, because we were not instructed—I am not sure he was not served—these affidavits are not the only documents, there was a letter—I agree with you that under Order 14 the defendant answers the affidavit made against him—a defendant is bound in answering an affidavit to apply his mind to the cause of action; he ought to answer the affidavit—on this affidavit the name is first written Barber, then Barbour, and then Barlow—I had the bill to look at if I wished it—I was present when he came to see it; my managing clerk was there, but he was about other business.</p>

I am a stevedore of 162, Cable Street—on 15th November between 11 and 12, I was in the Golden Lion, when the prisoner and about ten other men were there—the prosecutor came in and was joking about; and he said "I am Jack the Ripper"—the prisoner looked at him and said, "That is the way to put himself away"—the prosecutor asked for a pennyworth of beer; he drank some of it and said, "I will show you whether I am Jack the Ripper"—he went behind the table and took out some documents and started writing—the prisoner went over to look, and the prosecutor seized them and put them in his pocket, so that the prisoner should not see them—I said to the prisoner," Let him alone; he says he will put himself away; we will all do with a reward"—I held the door open and stood at the door—the prosecutor went out, and the words "Jack the Ripper" gathered a great crowd; the prisoner stood in front of the door, about two yards from it; I kept him in my sight till I followed him back into the public-house—the prisoner did not assault or rob the prosecutor, because I forced him to come in; there is no mistake about that—we were all drinking together; he is innocent—they might as well have taken me, as the prisoner—I gave evidence at the Police-court.</p>

I lodge at 46, Chissendale Road, Old Ford, and am a traveller—the prisoner was landlord of the house—on 12th September I came home between eleven and twelve—I knocked at the door more than once—the prisoner opened it—I remarked that he might have let me in a little sooner—he said, "You b——r, you had b——y well be off to bed, or outside you go, or otherwise I will throw you out"—he let me in, and then he put me outside and pushed me down the three or four steps leading from the door to the street—I did not fall—he followed me up the street about fifteen yards—I could not get away from him; I tried to—I walked away from the house—he butted me with his head, and gave me a black eye, about fifteen yards from the house—I put up my hand to protect myself, and then he kicked me on the side of my leg between the ankle and knee, on the tibia—I heard it crack, and said, "You blackguard! you have broken my leg"—he gave me another kick, and broke the large bone of my leg in the front—I was then in the middle of the street; I hopped across to the other side and laid hold of the railings—a policeman came up and I told him where I lived—I was taken to the door—they asked the prisoner if I lived there, and took me inside and laid me in the. passage—the prisoner said to the constable something to the effect that there was nothing the matter with me, and that it was a pity it was not my b——y neck—the constable remained with me while two other constables fetched an ambulance and took me to the hospital, where I remained a little over ten weeks, I think.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know that he denied having broken my leg by a kick, and said I did it in a fall—I did not fall to the ground the whole time, I am certain; it would have been impossible for me to get up—I saw a doctor one and a half to two hours after my leg was broken; it was about one o'clock—my wife lives in this house—she was in bed there on that night, I believe—I had been eighteen months there, I think, regularly, except when I was away on business—this happened on Tuesday; I had last been to the house before that on Saturday—after I knocked at the door I got just inside the door—I had not got as far as my wife's room; I had no opportunity of going upstairs—he might have pushed me in the passage—he took me by the shoulders and pushed me down the steps; it was done momentarily—I did not strike him at all, either in the passage or outside; I only put my hand up to his face after he butted me and gave me a black eye and other contusions—as far as I know he had no cause to push me out of the house; I did not strike him—I am a peaceable man as far as I am aware—I don't know Mrs. Miller—I don't know who lives in the house; Mrs. Miller may live there—I was not drunk, I had had a glass or two of drink; I was not the worse for drink that I am aware of—I deny I was in a very drunken state—I did not come to the house before eleven o'clock—this was the first time I went in the house—I had been more than twenty miles travelling, I had been nearly down to Wood Green, and I was potter</p>

On this night I was in Chissendale Street, and I saw the prosecutor standing with his back against the railings on the same side of the way as his own house—he complained that his leg was broken—I took him indoors to No. 49—I saw the prisoner there—I told him the prosecutor said his leg was broken, and asked him how he accounted for it—he said, "I am very sorry it is not his b—y neck," and he said if he did not go up into his own rooms he would put him out into the street again—I took the prosecutor to the hospital, with assistance—he and the prisoner appeared sober to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon of the London Hospital, and attended the prosecutor there—I found the tibia and fibula of the right leg fractured; those are the large and small bones between the ankle and the knee—they were broken by one injury—I should be rather against the injury being caused by a kick—I do not say it could not have been, but I cannot think it was—it was one a. m. when I saw him—he had had something to drink; he was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This accident may have had something to do with sobering him—in my opinion it was far more likely that the accident was caused by a fall than a kick, because if a kick produced a fracture I should expect to find laceration of the tissue; there was none—both fractures were on the same level.</p>

               <p>done nothing to anger Hope; he was with me all day on the 23rd; Edwards was there a good bit of the day in the room; he was living with another girl below in the same lodging-house—I undid the parcel in the room when I was there by myself—I did not give Edwards any of the things—on 1st November I was at the Commercial Street Policestation; I saw Hope in custody—I said, "This is the man that brought the things to my house on the 23rd," and I told them what the things were, and they telegraphed it to West Ham—I said, alluding to Hope, "He has sent the police after us; he said he would put us away"—I said so because another girl and three chaps, two of whom are the prisoners, were taken to the station, one of the men was let off—I never saw Norman till he was brought into the station—on the night the things were brought in I can swear Edwards and the young girl he was living with were in bed at 11 o'clock, when Hope went out to get the things, because they went to bed as soon as I went upstairs; I heard them lock the door. <hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> What the witness says is perfectly true.</p>

Where have you been?"—he said, "Oh, out strolling," and upstairs he went—the same morning, about 10. 30 or 11, he came back to my room bringing a bundle—Edwards was there—he opened it in our presence—I saw this dolman, clock, boots, knife, and all these things—he told us he got them out hawking flowers—he had not before come back from hawking with property of this kind—he asked me to pawn this shawl—I tore off a piece of the table-cloth in which the things were wrapped, and wrapped the shawl in it, and pawned it—I brought back this pawn-ticket and put it in a vase in the room—I gave the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective L</hi>). On 27th October I went to 81, High Street, Woolwich, and arrested Young and Sawyer; they were in bed together—I told Sawyer I should arrest him for being concerned with Young in stealing some fowls and tools; that was another charge—in his jacket pocket I found this handkerchief, with the initials "H.M.H. 6" on it—I had that morning received from Mrs. Brewster a description of the property stolen—I then said they would both be charged with being concerned together in committing a burglary at Oak Villa, Plumstead, and stealing a clock, violin, and various articles, this handkerchief among them—Smith said, "I gave Young a penny for it last night"—on the way to the station Smith said, "It's no use telling you any lies about it, we did break into the house and steal the things; we sold them at the little shop opposite the Eagle, in Beresford Street"—he pointed the shop out, it was the one kept by Swinburne—he said he did not know Swinburne's name, but he pointed out the shop on the way to the station—he was charged at the station—he made no reply—I had been to Swinburne's the previous day, and said to him, "Have you bought any clothing from anyone?" mentioning an Astracan ulster, a jacket, a coat with Astracan cuffs and collar, and such clothes as were worn by the Arsenal boys; he said, No, he had not bought any, but he would keep a sharp look-out—about ten o'clock on the Saturday, in consequence of the robbery at Mr. Brewster's, I called on him again before arresting the prisoners—I then told him that another robbery had taken place, and that a number of coats worn by the Arsenal boys, greasy and dirty, had been stolen, and I described an old eight-day clock with the name of the maker on it in Gracechurch Street, a very old violin with one string broken, and I mentioned various other articles—I asked if he had bought them—he said, "No"—I told him that Sawyer and Young were suspected, and to refresh his memory who Young was, I told him he was a man whom he had once bought some shirts of—he said he had not seen him—I asked him if either of those two had been to his shop that morning and sold him any coats or any property—he said, "No"—I then arrested the other prisoners, and took them to the station, and then returned to Swinburne's shop—I told him I should have to take him into custody for feloniously receiving the goods I had asked him about, knowing them to have been stolen—he said he had not bought any—I then searched the back room of his shop with Police-constable Rutherford, and found the property there which has been identified by Mrs. Brewster—the greater part of Mrs. Hammond's property was also found there,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188811190076"/>
               <p>which was identified; also some property belonging to Mr. Arnold and Mrs. Jackson and another person who was too ill to attend at the Police-court—Swinburne kept denying it till just as we were going into the Police-court, when in consequence of Young saying that he had sold the goods that morning, he said, "Yes, I did buy them; I am sorry I denied it at first; when I first started business in this shop I tried to get an honest living, but I found I could not get a living that way, and I took anything that was offered me."</p>

I live at 60, Hornby Road—on the night of 15th October I was passing Mrs. Brett's house—her door was open, and I saw her standing in the kitchen and the prisoner standing in front of her—all of a sudden I saw the lamp knocked over and smashed—I could not see how it was done—the prisoner and Mrs. Brett were the only persons in the room—I spoke to some one who was passing by—shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner come out of the house—he said to me, "I don't want no row with them"—I said, "Why don't you go indoors and go to bed and take no notice of them—he said, "No, I am going on board my ship to sleep to-night"—I told him he was too drunk to walk up the ship's side—he was drunk—he began to unbutton his coat, and said, "Hold my coat, and if he hits her again I will knock his b——jaw in"—and with that he went in doors—and about five minutes after I saw Mrs. Brett's little boy, about seven—he came and halloaed through the keyhole of my door and called me—I came out and found Mrs. Brett lying in the gutter, bleeding from her neck—I assisted her, and then went home.</p>

                  </hi>. I go by the name of Charles Scott—I am under sentence of twelve months in Wandsworth Prison, for stealing watches from a shop—I know Laing and Ryan—we were in the habit of freqenting the King's Arms, Bath Street, kept by the prisoner Morecroft, and I have played with Morecroft in the bagatelle-room—I have heard Laing called "<hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Laing," and have heard him call Ryan "James"—we were all at the King's Arms on the night of February 9th, and about two a.m. we all went to Bermondsey and broke into Miss Barclay's house, and carried off a quantity of property; there were three or four pictures and two clocks, a blue velvet hand-bag, and a lady's purse—we left the things in a garden, and we all three then went to a coffee stall kept by Cooper, who spoke to us—we then took the things to Tooley Street, where we got a cab to Laing's house at Camberwell, but we could not get in, and we walked towards the railway and got a cab and went to Ryan's house, where we left the things, and next day we all went to Morecroft's—I saw Morecroft. that day, but only when I called for drink—two days after the burglary I took some things to Morecroft's; a woman carried a clock there between one and two o'clock, from Ryan's house, and two pictures, and a cloth was thrown over the pictures, which were done up in paper—I do not know her name—(<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Jennings was here brought into Court</hi>)—that is the woman—Laing went with me and her—we saw no one at Ryan's house before we left; it is 200 or 300 yards from there to the King's Arms—Morecroft was there, and the things were handed to him in the private bar, where there was no one else—he asked the price of them, Laing said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Morecroft took them into a back room, and came back and said he thought 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was sufficient, and Laing said to me, "Freddy, I think we had better take 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and have done with it" and Morecroft paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we had a drink, and I went away to dinner, leaving Laing there; and when I went back I found him there, and while we were both there Ryan came in, and we divided the money, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. apiece—the purse was first given to my wife, and Laing went across and brought it back, and handed it to Mrs. Morecroft as a valentine, it being a few days before Valentine's Day; Laing also handed her a blue plush bag between three and four the same afternoon as a present, and she accepted it—Morecroft was not there then—that is all the property that was taken to Morecroft's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After we left Ryan's we went immediately to the Corner Pin, but we waited five minutes while the things were done up—we got to Morecroft's about two o'clock, not between five and six—the blue plush bag was given in the afternoon, between three and four—the purse was given about dinner-time in Mrs. Morecroft's presence, and mine, and Laing's; that was about twenty minutes after the pictures, and Morecroft had left the bar—Mrs. Jennings was not there—the first thing Morecroft said was, "How much?"—he did not say that he did not want the pictures—he had not to be pressed three or four times before he would take them—something passed about the pictures and clock which I did not hear. I considered that an arrangement had been made before; any person looking round the partition could see what was going on—on March 13th I first communicated with the police, and I gave them more information on September 13th and 19th—I was convicted on the 2nd of this July—I wrote to the Treasury, and the police came</p>
