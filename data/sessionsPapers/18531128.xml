I work for Mr. Singer, of Watling-street, a shirt maker—the prisoner worked there, on the premises—there were four other women there besides myself—we do not take any work home—last Saturday fortnight, when I was leaving work, there were three other women there—there were two shirts lying on the table; the prisoner took them up, put them into a handkerchief, and left the room with them—they were shirts which she was making, and were unfinished—I supposed that she took them home to finish them—it was not allowed to take shirts out of the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You are a day worker, and I am a piece worker? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I work by the day, and have 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—the prisoner works at piece work; I do not know how she is paid—I do not know what orders she had with respect to shirts, I only know what orders I had myself—being a day worker, I had no right to take anything away—the other women all worked by the piece—I never saw them take away shirts to finish, but I have seen the prisoner do so two or three times—she did not come back to her work on the Monday—I have not seen her since—I have been in the habit of making shirts for five or six years—I have always been a piece worker—it is not an uncommon thing to take shirts home, and bring them back next morning; I used to do so—the prisoner overlooked the young women in the room where I worked, and she was under Mr. Kohen, the foreman—when the prisoner has brought shirts back of a Monday morning, they have sometimes been finished, and she would hand them to Mr. Kohen in the course of the morning—the shirts are left in the work room at night—I saw the shirts the prisoner was making; this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, the other is not—I know it by this peak to the wristband—I never made any like it—I had not done any work upon it myself, nor did I pay particular attention to it before she took it away—the wristband of this other shirt is different; it has a little narrow band—this third shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one she took home to put the wristbands and collar on—I know it because she had only got so much as this done of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I went with Mr. Kohen to the prisoner's house, No. 4, Windsor-street, Somers Town, on Monday, 14th Nov.—I told Mr. Kohen to ask for another party, merely to see if the prisoner was there—he asked at the door for Miss Roberts—the prisoner</p>

               <p>did not answer the door; but she came out to where we were standing after we had left the door a short time, and said to Mr. Kohen, I hope there is nothing wrong with respect to Miss Roberts?"—Kohen said, No, there is nothing wrong respecting her—the prisoner said, You know I brought three shirts away to finish on Saturday night, which I intended to bring back this morning, but I could not get them done"—this was at 11 o'clock at night—Mr. Kohen said he was not aware of it till he was informed of it, and that she had no right to do so—she said that it was usual with most shirt makers—I said I was an officer, and had come with respect to the shirts; that it would be my duty to take her into custody; and asked her if she could produce them; she said, Yes," she could—I went, indoors with her, into her husband's shop, and she was allowed to go into the back room for the purpose of producing them—in about a quarter of an hour she came back, and said she could not let us have them to night, for two of them were with a friends of hers, Miss Randall—the husband produced this shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from a drawer in the inner room, and said, This is the only one I can find in the drawer;" but the prisoner was not present then—I showed that shirt to the last witness, and she identified it at the Mansion-house—Mr. Kohen examined it at that time, and said he did not know that there was anything missing till he was told of it—the prisoner gave me Miss Randall's address, but I could not find her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Singer, a shirtmaker, of 61, Watling-street. The prisoner was employed there at piece work, at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a shirt, which is what I always pay; it is the best price paid in the city—she was the overlooker of the girls; they did the rougher part, and it was her business to finish it—the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not for finishing only; she engaged hands under her to work—she did not give security for work done on the premises, but if she takes work away she must—she got security signed, and took, work out about three months ago; but we did not like to give her any more out, because she did not bring home a shirt in time once when I wanted it; and I told her I would not give her any more at home, but that she might do them on the premises—that was about a fortnight before I missed the three shirts—I still have the security; I have not realised it—I am in the habit of cutting out the shirts—I know these shirts, the three are worth 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I signed, as well as you and your husband—I did not take the work in before the women left at night, if I had nobody could have taken it; but I went up stairs every night and looked for the work, except on Saturday, when I am busy, till half past 11 o'clock, and cannot do so; and I go on Monday mornings instead.</p>

I said I was an officer, and had come to take them both into custody—I said to the prisoner, I suppose you know what the charge is against you; it is for embezzling a sum of money which you have taken from Shoolbred's, the property of your master, Mr. Bates"—he made no answer; but the female said, Who, and what is Mr. Bates? I know nothing about it"—I said, From circumstances which have come to my knowledge, it is my duty to take you in custody also for receiving the same, knowing it to be stolen"—I asked them if they had any property—the prisoner said he had none; the female said the property she had belonged to her—the prisoner then said, Will you allow me to speak to her?"—I said, Certainly; you can speak to her in my presence"—I allowed them to speak privately, but I was in the same room—the female</p>

               <p>then took out a purse, gave me twelve sovereigns, and said that was all she had—I sent for a fly to go to the railway; as we were going to enter it, the prisoner was going to speak, and I said that anything he might say would be used in evidence against him—as we were coming up in a railway carriage, he said, "What is the extreme sentence they can give me by law for this offence?"—I said, "You may be transported; but you are not found guilty yet"—he said, "But I am guilty; I took the money, and I don't mean to deny it; the female prisoner does not know anything about it; she does not know how I got the money, or how I came by it."</p>

                  </hi>. I reside near Hollybush, at Chase-side, Enfield. I am a captain in the West Essex regiment of militia—I am in the habit of sending hay up to London—the prisoner was in my service twelve months ago, and I took him back about five or six weeks since; I keep two carters—I generally leave it to Monk to allow fodder for the horses; I have no settled rule as to the quantity—on 22nd Nov. I was called up about half past 3 o'clock, by sergeant Good all; I came down into the high road opposite my house, and found the prisoner there in a hay cart; there was a load of hay in it—there were two bundles of hay on the ground, and one of <hi rend="italic">rowan</hi>, or second crop of grass—there was also a nose bag.</p>

               <p>we have sent up three a week lately, since the hay harvest—I used to give out to the prisoner the food for his horse; I have been in the habit of doing that—I gave it him over night on 22nd Nov.—I cannot exactly say how much I gave him, we never weigh it—I gave him from twenty-five to thirty pounds, as near as I could tell; I tied it up in a little bit of a band; I gave him as much as I thought the horse would want, we never stint it—I never gave him orders not to take more than I gave out; I asked him if there was enough, and he said he thought there was—there was no other carter besides the prisoner—I drive up to London sometimes—on that morning only one cart was going to London—I gave him out a peck and a half of corn to bait his horse, and to take with him; I gave him that in the morning, he had only one horse—the thirty pounds of hay was to take with him for his horse.</p>

I was in a field belonging to Mr. Edinborough, adjoining his yard, about forty or fifty yards from it; it was rather a dark night; I heard a noise in the yard which drew my attention in the first place—I waited a short time and then saw the prisoner come down from the stable with a bundle of hay on his back—he placed it by the side of the cart, and immediately returned to the stable—in a short time he returned again with something bulky; I could not distinctly see what it was—I then saw him get a fork and endeavour to put it on the top of the load of hay—he did not succeed; he then placed it in an empty cart by the side of the loaded one—he also put up a sack containing what I afterwards found to be chaff and corn; he put that on the top of the tilt, on the top of the load of hay—he covered over the chaff and corn with the two bundles of hay—he then went away with his cart; he had got into the high road when I went up to him—I asked him if his master allowed him to take such a quantity of hay away as that—he said, I have got hay for two horses, the other horse is coming out directly"—I called Mr. Edinborough up, and showed him the hay; I found two bundles of hay on the tilt, and under that was the sack containing fourteen pounds of chaff and corn—I weighed the two bundles of hay; altogether they weighed sixty-eight pounds—Mr. Edinborough said it was decidedly wrong—he ordered the carter to drive the cart back into the yard, and gave the prisoner into custody; he said he had no right to take the hay, and he had repeatedly told him so.</p>

I put the half crown into the till; I am quite sure there was no other half crown there—I saw there was some sixpences and shillings there; not more than 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not turn them over, but I am sure there was no half crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister of the last witness; I sometimes assist at Mr. Wiggins's. I was there on 22nd Oct.—I remember seeing the prisoner come in—I served her—she gave me a shilling—I put it on a slate book in the till; that kept it apart from other shillings in the till—the slate book is about three quarters of an inch thick, and I put the shilling on that—just at that time my sister came down stairs; she said something to me about the woman—in consequence of what she said, I looked for the shilling; I found it on the slate book, just as I left it—I am sure that I took from the till the same shilling that I put there—I gave it to my sister; I saw her bite it—on 3rd Nov. I was attending in the bar—the prisoner came again, and asked for a glass of the best ale—she gave me a shilling in payment—I remembered her as the person who had been there before, and in conesquence of that I handed the shilling to Mr. Wiggins—he said, That will do"—I told him I did not like the sound of it—the prisoner heard that, and, she said, I can give you another, Miss, if you don't like that"—I gave her the change, and put the shilling on one side of the till—there were other shillings in the till, but I put that shilling separate from them, because I knew the prisoner was the woman that came before—I went and spoke to my sister—she came down, and just saw the prisoner going out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman copper plate printer. Some months ago I was employed in that trade, in the service of Mr. Tallis, of No. 100, St. John-street, Smith field—I was in his employment for some months—I left him on 10th Sept., on account of the slackness of work—on 13th Sept. I applied for employ to Mr. Jackson, of Angel-street, St. Martin le-Grand—he is a publisher—Mr. Jones is the manager of the copper plate department—I made an engagement with him for that week, and perhaps the next, but that week certain—generally speaking, the week terminates on the Saturday, but at Mr. Jackson's it terminates on the Friday—you write your bill up to Thursday night, and the week terminates on the Friday—I did the work I was employed upon, and on Friday, 16th, I was paid for my work; I had only been there three days then—the termination of the week was not specified to me when I was engaged; I understood it would be on Saturday—I did not expect the week to be seven following days—Mr. Jones paid me for what I had done—I asked him for more work—he declined to give me work—he did not pay me till after I had this conversation with him—before he paid me, I asked him why I was not to get any more work, and he referred me to Francis Friend; Francis Friend was the oldest workman on the establishment at that time—I saw him, in consequence of what Jones said—on the day before, the 15th, I had observed what is technically termed in the trade the calling of a <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi> by the men—that was before dinner; it was attended by the whole of the defendants, and one besides, but he has been excluded from the prosecution—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi>; I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you mean thatyouwere in the shop, but not at the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was excluded from the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi> is a congregation of the workmen altogether to discuss a certain subject—that was held in the same room where I was—I saw the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi> called; I could not hear what they said—I did not ask to be a party to it; they did not call me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were they conferring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be impossible to say how long, except by guess; it might be three, or four, or five, or six minutes; I could not say positively; it was a short time—they assembled at the opposite end of the shop to that at which I stood—after dinner I observed another assemblage of the men of the same kind the same persons attended it; I was at the same place as before, at the press—that was all that took place on the Thursday—before I applied to Jones on the Friday for more work, I saw Francis Friend, and said to him, "Mr. Friend, do you consider that the <hi rend="italic">chapels</hi> held yesterday had any reference to myself?"—he said that he certainly did; it was concerning my being at Tallis's—I then expostulated with him upon the injustice of such proceedings, and cited the case of one George Shaw, who had been discharged from Mr. Tallis's and had been taken into the employment of Mr. M'Queen, the copper plate printer, of Tottenham-court-road, and that the men had not refused to work with him there—I also referred him to the case of Pyall, who had been employed by Mr. Bacon, and the men were working with him—Pyall had been in Mr. Tallis's employment—I mentioned several other cases; to all of which he said that he knew nothing about it; he did not trouble himself with trade affairs, and he could say nothing to it—nothing further passed on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280036"/>
               <p>that occasion—it was after that that I applied to Jones for more work—he referred me to Friend, and I went to him—the whole of the defendants were in the room at the time—Brind was sufficiently near to hear what passed between us; he was not more than fifteen or eighteen inches distant; the others were at their respective presses, at their work; it would be a matter of uncertainty whether they heard what passed—I asked Friend the reason why the men would not work with me—he said he thought I had a job to go on with (not a job at another place, but another job for Mr. Jones), and he was not prepared with an answer then; he had forgotten the reason; and if I would come after dinner he would be prepared with an answer—I think this conversation took place about 25 minutes to 1 o'clock—I then left the shop, and returned about half past 2 o'clock—I found Friend and the other defendants there; they were all at work—I spoke to Francis Friend, and told him I had come for the reason why they declined to work with me—he said there were two reasons; the first was my having gone to work for Mr. Tallis, which was a house they disacknowledged; and the second was my belonging to a third society, which they also disacknowledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by a third society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two societies in the trade; one is enrolled, and one is not; and this is a third society—there are two societies that they do acknowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you then say anything to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I reasoned with him on the injustice of this proceeding towards myself, and repeated the arguments I had made use of respecting the men, and finally asked him Whether this persecution was to continue against me always, or whether because I had worked at Mr. Tallis's house, I was never to get into any respectable house again, and why I was selected as a victim—to the first question he replied, that he could not give me an answer; and respecting My being a victim, he said I was not selected as a victim, or the only one, but it extended to the whole of the men employed in Mr. Tallis's house—I do not recollect anything more that passed—I then left the employment—I was requested to call at 6 o'clock in the evening to receive my money, which I did—there had been a difference between the employer and the workmen at Mr. Tallis's house before I went there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am foreman and manager of the copperplate department, in the service of Mr. Peter Jackson—it is part of my duty to engage workmen in that department, and to discharge them—on 13th Sept. Spence applied for work at our house—I gave him work; the defendants were all working in the shop at that time—Spence worked there</p>

               <p>on the Wednesday and the Thursday—on Friday, 16th, he applied to me for more work—I declined to give it him—before he applied to me for more work, a communication was made to me by Harper and Robinson, I cannot say whether that was on the Thursday or Friday—Harper asked if I knew anything of the man Spence—I said, No; I do not"—he said he was a party that he should not like to work with—he mentioned about his working at Tallis's—that was all that Harper said.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did either of them say what they would do, or what they would not do, if Spence was allowed to continue to work there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing at all was said about that—Spence applied to me on the Friday after for more work—I did not employ him for two reasons; the first was that I knew that the party wanted him where he was going to; that was at Mr. Tomlinson's—I did not give him that as a reason—I said nothing to him) about it—when he came to me, he asked, was there any objection to him, for he had seen that the men had come in to me—he said that the men had been in to me, and did they say anything about him, or was there any objection to him? and I said I did not know—he said, Can I ask the men about it?"

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Harper and Robinson had not made that communication to you, should you have discharged him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I engaged him for a very short time—the three days that I engaged him for were completed when I discharged him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why did you not re-employ him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I knew if he left us, he could go to Mr. Tomlinson, where he had been employed for a long time; and he expressed a wish to me to employ him again; and if he called on the Monday, he would do so—I thought several times in the course of the morning whether I should discharge him or not; and as this communication had been made to me by the men, I thought he was a person perhaps that would not be comfortable while he stopped there, that he might be sent to Coventry by them; so I thought, taking all things into consideration, as there was a place for the man to go to, that I had better discharge him—I thought he would be more comfortable in a place where he had been working than with parties who would not consider him as an associate.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 18th Oct., I was at the Roebuck public house, which is about three quarters of a mile from Claremont-street, Edmonton—it was about 11 o'clock at night—I saw Pluck there—I had known him a little while—he had a bag with some money in it, but what there was I cannot say; it was a largeish bulk, and he had a handkerchief likewise—he pulled the bag out of his pocket; it was darkish, something like a sample bag—I think it was canvas, I could not say—it looked more like that—he had a handkerchief round his neck; he pulled it off and put it in his pocket—I should know the handkerchief again if I were to see it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—lie drew a watch from his waistcoat pocket, and he showed it to all that were in the room—he tried to open it, but could not for a little while, and he said he would throw it across the room—at last he opened it, and showed it to all round the room—when he first came in he saw me, and said, "Will you stand half a pint of beer?"—I said I had got no money, and after a little while he drew the bag from his pocket, and said, "Never mind, I have got plenty of money, let us have a pot"—this is the watch he had—I did not have it in my hand, but I looked at it the same as others—there was no key or guard to it—he said he had left the key and guard at home on the shelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He had a handkerchief round his neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this same handkerchief, that I can swear positively, without any doubt—I had not the curiosity to take it and examine it—I swear to it by the colours—I am not a particular good judge of colours—I took notice of it when he first came in—I had been in the beer shop about half an hour when he first came in—we had one pot of beer amongst four of us—I can positively swear to this handkerchief—I sat close to him—I saw him have it on his neck, and saw him take it off"—I did not describe it to any one before I saw it next—though I had not the watch in my hand, I can swear this is it—I sat close to him—he held it under the gas light for everybody to look at—I took such, a view of it that I can swear it is the same—I cannot tell how many were there—there were only four of our own party, one was Bail, one was Bass, one was Brown—Brown and Bass are at home at Tottenham—I do not know who served us at the public house, whether it was the landlord or the lady—the potboy always brings it in—the boy is not here, nor the landlord, nor the landlady—I think there were six or seven in the room when this watch was handed round—the bag was a dark canvas bag, I saw it had something in it: a large bulk—I cannot say whether it was leather, it was a dirty bag, like a sample bag, such as they carry samples of corn and seed in—it was something like this one—I did not look at the clock, when he came in—I know it was about 11 o'clock from the time we left our own place—we left just before them—Clark started first I know—Bail is here—he remained in the room with me till I left—we both went away at one time—we do not live one way—he and I were at work together that day—we work together now—we had only one pot of ale before Pluck came—I do not know how much more we had—we did not stop a great while—we had not above two pots between ourselves—Pluck called for one—somebody else came in with him—when I left, Pluck was gone—the party who came in with him left before him—it was two men who came in with him—I did not know either of them, they were strangers to me—I live at Tottenham; I work at the brewery which is near the Roebuck—one of the men who came in with Pluck had a smock frock on; I did not take much notice of the other—they did not remain long after they came in, perhaps a quarter of an hour—they did not sit down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at Tottenham. On 18th Oct. I was at the Roebuck when the last witness was there—I saw Pluck; I knew him previously by sight—I did not know his name—we were there just before 11 o'clock—I know the time by the time we left work—after we were there, Pluck came in the parlour where we sat—there were four persons in our company before he came—there were no strangers—Pluck first asked Bosher if he could stand half a pint of beer—lie said-no, he could not—Pluck then offered to toss for a pot, and after that he produced money in a bag, something similar to a sample bag—it was rather a dirtyish colour—I cannot say whether it was canvas or leather—it was not leather—I did not see him take any money out of it, but it appeared to have money in it—he took out a watch, and showed it round—it was in a silver case—I think this is the same watch—I did not have it in my hand—I was near to it—he handed it round in his hand—he showed a handkerchief—I believe this handkerchief before me to be the one—we did not stay long; we left Pluck there when we came away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you and Bosher and two others went in together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there can be no doubt about that—I am sure that I and Bosher did not go in alone—we four went in—I live close by where I work—there was Bosher, and me and another one next door, and another one—we were all in the lane together when we met, 200 or 300 yards from the Roebuck—we found no one in the Roebuck when we went in—there was nobody in the parlour but us four when Pluck came in—he came into the parlour alone the first time—he went out, and was a very short time gone, and another one came in with him into the parlour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure it was only one A. When we came out there were two others—another came in, and looked in at the door—he did not come into the parlour, that I noticed—I do not know that he came in and partook of any of the beer—Pluck did not treat us with a pot of porter; if he did it was more than I knew of—he might have treated some of the other company—he offered to toss for a pot of beer; whether he stood any I do not know—I do not know whether he tossed any one or not—I do not know whether the other man did that he brought in—I have seen that man on the road; I do not know his name—I have not seen him since to my knowledge—he did not remain long—I can speak positively to the handkerchief—I saw it at the Roebuck, and I saw it at the Angel, where the Magistrates sat—I cannot say how many days that was after I saw it at the Roebuck—I was fetched, but what day it was I do not know—I think it was about 28th Oct.—it was in Oct., I know—I do not remember the day—it might be a week after I was at the Roebuck—it was on a Thursday; I was at the Angel—it was the Thursday week after I was at the Roebuck—that was the first time I had seen the handkerchief, except at the Roebuck—I saw sufficient of it at the Roebuck; there was plenty of time to see it—when I saw it at the Angel, I knew it as soon as I looked at it—I did not take it in my hand and examine it—I felt it—it was by feeling I knew it—I felt it at the Roebuck—I knew it because I saw the mark on it—Pluck did not show me the mark, but it happened to be where I touched it—I saw the mark at the Roebuck—I believe it to be a mark—this is the mark, here are the letters "G. H."—I swear I saw "G. H." at the Roebuck—I did not point out the letter when I was at the Magistrate's; I was not asked—I did not hear all Mr. Hedge's examination; I was not there quite so soon—I was there when I identified the handkerchief—I was not there when he pointed out the marks—I told Mr. Hedge I saw the letters on the handkerchief—I told</p>

               <p>him so that afternoon, after we had been first to the hearing—I had mentioned it before I appeared before the Magistrate—I had mentioned it to those who spoke about it—I had mentioned it to Mr. Hedge and Mrs. Hedge—I cannot tell how many days that was before I went before the Magistrate—it was after I had the summons—I was not in the Roebuck above an hour—I walked to the Magistrate's with Bosher; we were both fetched together from our work—I heard of the robbery the following morning—some one came and told Bosher—I knew Hedge; he belonged to the same society that I did—I do not know whether Bosher knew Hedge—I heard of the robbery the next morning; some time before dinner—I saw Hedge three or four days before we went to the Angel—I did not go to Hedge's house after seeing "G. H." on the handkerchief—I do not know where he lives, to the present time—I know where the street is—I could find out the place of the robbery if I went to look; but I had plenty to do without going—I did not go to Mr. Hedge at all, I met him—I did not notice that any money was produced out of the sample bag in the Roebuck—he opened the bag, and nestled it up—I could see it was silver—by what I could see it looked very much like a sample bag—I do not say that I will swear to this watch without any doubt—I thought it was the same—it looks very much like it—I believe it to be the same; I had not it in my hand at all—when the money was shown in the room there were only us four and Pluck—there was one came in directly afterwards—the baker and Brown are at Tottenham.</p>

In consequence of information, I apprehended Pluck on the morning after the robbery, in the tap room of the Bell, at Edmonton, about a couple of hundred yards from Claremont-street. I took him to the station, and I then went to the house where he lodged, in Claremont-street—before I left him, I said I was going to search him, and he pulled out what property he had in his pocket, and said it was his own—he pulled out a knife, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of copper—I then went to his lodging, in Claremont-street—his mother and sister live there—it is his mother's house—I searched, and found a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece and a 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bit, I believe, or a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or something of that sort—the big piece has got a hole in it—I think it is a id piece; no, it is a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—in the bed room I found these two pieces of money and these ear drops, in a flower pot on the table—there was a flower pot there, and flowers, and dirt—they were deep in the dirt—these are the fear drops—I did not find anything else in that room—I found this watch and 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, buried in the lower part of the garden at the back of the house, five or six inches in the earth—the ground appeared as if recently disturbed—it was about ten yards from the house—this is the money (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—another officer, Maskall, was with me—I believe he scraped the dirt off, himself—this handkerchief was found in the garden—the money and the watch were in the handkerchief—I did not find anything else in the bed room when I found the silver pieces.</p>

On 18th Sept., between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in company with Hart and Bryan, in Holborn—we were talking, and the prisoner came up, and asked us if we were talking to him; we said not, and to mind his own business; and he went away—we then went into the coffee shop, and had some coffee—I saw the prisoner go up the street, but I did not see him go into the coffee shop—he was inside when we got there—I saw him leave before us—we went out when we had done our coffee—we did not remain long inside—when we came out, the prisoner was standing in the carriage way, and he came over to us, and asked us if we wanted to fight—we said we did not—he kept talking in some different language, but we did not understand what he said; and he gave me a kick on the foot as he was going away—T followed him, to ask why he did it—I was catching him by the collar of the coat, and he turned round, and stabbed me in the right side of the head—there was no fighting before he stabbed me—I was going to ask him why did he kick me in the foot, but I had not time, when he turned round, and stabbed me in the head—he was making a second attempt to stab me, and I put up my left hand, and he stabbed me in the arm, above the elbow—I caught him round the two arms, to hold his hands still, and with that he pulled himself back, and fell on the kerb stone, and I fell a top of him—I was holding his arms, and saving myself as well as I could, and he stabbed me in the body—I had three or four stabs in the body, but they never reached my skin—my clothes were all cut—I had two stabs on the shoulder—they did not reach the skin—only two stabs reached my skin; one in the side of the head, and another in the arm—my ear was cut right through—Hart then came up, and took the prisoner off me—I saw something in the prisoner's hand which appeared to me to be a knife—I did not see the handle of it, but I saw the blade—he had the handle in his hand—Hart gave the prisoner time to rise up; and as soon as he rose up, he ran at Hart, and stabbed him, and then ran away—I fell when Hart left me—I ran after the prisoner—I saw all the people running after him, and the police with them—I fell down before I ran—I did not run far—I did not go down Southampton-buildings; I did not turn out of Holborn—I was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the hospital by the policeman—I was not sober, and I was not drunk; I had taken a little beer early in the evening, but I was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a policeman at this time, <hi rend="italic">F</hi> 69; I am not now—on Sunday morning, 18th Sept., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was on duty in Holborn; my attention was called to two men, one of whom was the prisoner, and a woman, standing in High Holborn—during the time they were standing there, I saw three or four men come out of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> coffee house opposite—they all assembled together—I heard one man speak in Irish, and say to the person with the prisoner, "Why, you b——, you can't fight"—I then heard rather a loud reply in a foreign language; I could not understand what it was, it was uttered by the prisoner and his companions—as some little disturbance was likely to take place, I went up to them, and requested them to be quiet, and to go home to bed—they all walked away together up Holborn, towards Southampton-buildings—just at that time a man and woman asked me to direct them the way to the Bank; I did so, and then turned myself round again to go up Holborn, and saw some persons apparently fighting together, some distance up Holborn—that was about fifty yards from the coffee shop—I hastened to them, and on getting up to them, I saw the prisoner and another man get up off the ground—the prisoner then ran to another man who was standing a little way off) that was Hart—a fight took place between them, and Hart fell down—the prisoner then got up and ran away—just at that time some person hallooed out," Oh, he has stabbed the man!"—I went up to Hart, he was bleeding very much from the head—the prisoner was at that time forty or fifty yards further up Holborn, just against Southampton-buildings—I followed him—he turned down Southampton-buildings, in company with a woman—on getting near to the prisoner, he turned round and saw me and several other persons following him—some persons then hallooed out," Stop thief!" the prisoner then ran off with great speed—when he got to the turning in Southampton-buildings, he turned to the left, and ran to the gates leading into Staples Inn; they being shut he could not get through, but he turned to the area railings of No. 28, Southampton-buildings, and made an attempt to jump over—in doing that his trowsers caught on to the top of the railings, and he fell to the bottom and was secured—he likewise broke a window—there was a hole in the knee of his trowsers, and a stab upon his person just opposite it—I believe it was a stab from the appearance of it—I do not think the area railings would do it; I took him to King's College Hospital—about two hours afterwards I went to the house, No. 37, Southampton-buildings, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>) in the area, it opens with a spring; there is some blood upon it, and a few hairs—the spring keeps it from shutting, it was open when I found it—the prisoner passed by that area while I was following him—neither Buckley or Hart passed by there, at least not to my knowledge.</p>

On Sunday morning, 18th Sept., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was coming through Holborn from the City, on my way home, and my attention was attracted by Buckley, Hart, and the prisoner standing in the middle of the road, opposite Middle-row—I saw the prisoner and Buckley fall to the ground—Buckley came into the road, and I went towards him—I saw the blood running from his arm, and I said, "You are stabbed"—Hart and the prisoner then began quarrelling—I did not hear any words pass with either of them—they were in the act of hugging one another, fighting, and they both fell to the ground—I did not see the prisoner stab Hart, but I saw him with the knife in his hand after he had stabbed him, up above his head—the policeman then came up, and the prisoner ran away—I followed him down Southampton-buildings, and saw him taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at King's College Hospital when Buckley was brought there, on 18th Sept. I found that he had received a wound on the right side of the head, from near the outer angle <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the eye, running backward through the ear—there was very profuse bleeding from this wound—it was about three inches in length—I cannot say the depth; it was deeper in the middle than at either end—the ear was completely divided—he had a slight wound near the left elbow—such a knife as this would be likely to produce it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the General Post-office, and live at the Branch Post-office at the corner of King William-street and Lombard-street—that office is occupied during the daytime by the clerks, until about half past 7 o'clock in the evening—I sleep in the house, over the office—on the night of 2nd Nov. the clerks left about half 7 o'clock—I then took charge of the premises—I went to bed about 11 o'clock that evening—before doing so I examined the office, and found all secure—the breakfast things were laid in the office for the clerks next morning, according to the usual custom—I got up about a quarter to 7 o'clock in the morning and came down into the office—I missed two silver forks off the table, and a salt cellar; and on looking further round I saw that the window had been thrown open—I had noticed the forks there the night before; I put them on the table myself—I found a chair had been put on the stamping board, close under the window, and the window was open—it had been shut over night—I saw that one of the drawers had been forced open, and the money drawer had been tampered with, but not successfully—other drawers had been forced open—I gave information to the police—on the evening of 8th Nov. the clerks left, as usual, at half past 7 o'clock—I saw the premises quite safe that night when I retired to rest—I heard nothing particular in</p>

               <p>the night—when I came down in the morning I examined the window and saw that some person had been cutting away the putty—there had been an unsuccessful attempt—no one had got in that night—in consequence of this, an arrangement was made with Mead and Carroll, two constables, and after that night they remained on the premises, in the inner office—on 15th Nov. I retired to rest at the usual time—I let the constables in at 10 o'clock—I left the premises all safe—soon after 12 o'clock I heard a noise at the window, as if some person was cutting; and later, about half past 2 o'clock, one of the officers rang the bell from the office to my room—I ran down, and found the prisoner in custody—the office <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in the parish of St. Mary Woolnoth, and is the property of the Crown.</p>

In consequence of what was communicated to me, I and Carroll were placed in the post-office in Lombard-street, for the purpose of watching there at night—we were there on the night of 15th Nov.—we placed ourselves at the end of the office, behind a screen—about 12 o'clock at night I heard a noise at the window, as if some one was trying to cut the frame away—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a model</hi>) it was at this window, which looks into the office—the noise continued, with the exception of short intervals, and at half past 2 o'clock a square of glass was broken—none of the glass fell inside—the prisoner then came through the hole; the place was quite light from the lamps outside; he came through legs first—he dropped down on to the bench, and from there he got on to the floor—we waited till he came down to us, and then we seized him by the arms—he gave a scream, and said, I am Dutch—he had no coat or shoes on—he had a chisel in his hand, and a dirk in his waistcoat pocket—I found on him a purse, containing four sovereigns and a Swedish dollar—the window through which he came opens on to the roof of the vestry of St. Mary Woolnoth's Church—a person could get from there into King William-street very easily—I took the prisoner to the station, and he was examined at the Mansion-house the same day—I afterwards went to the house of Mary Galvin, of John's hill—she pointed out a room to me as the prisoner's; and this canvas bag was handed to me by a lodger, from a closet in that room; that bag contained another bag, marked, Lombard-street, Foreign, Paid; it is a Post-office bag—that contained a salt cellar, a spoon, two forks, and a ladle—I also found at the lodging some pieces of woollen cloth, which I produce, and a comb and a brush which I took from the mantel shelf—I went next day to the same lodging, and this clothes brush was handed to me—I also obtained this letter stamp and shaving brush—I have compared the pieces of cloth I found with a cape that has been produced to me, and it appears to have formed part of it.</p>

               <p>broken—the square by which the prisoner entered was knocked clean out, and the contents lying on the paper—I took possession of all the things I found there, and brought them into the office; I showed them all to the prisoner—the shoes he seemed to own, as he put them on, and also the coat; they fitted him; he has on the same coat now—Mrs. Smith identified the cape—I produce it, and all the other things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith and watchmaker, No. 62, Bishopsgate-street Without. On the morning of the 16th Nov., I was awoke by a noise between 2 and 3 o'clock, I got out of bed and saw two men on the roof of my parlour, which is under the first floor—it is a leaden flat—I opened the window, and sang out to them—they said, "Don't be alarmed, we are policemen"—I came down and found the window broken in the parlour, which looks into the yard—I found the window of the kitchen at the back of the parlour had been opened, and the bolt had been endeavoured to be put off the 'staple—there were appearances on my wall of a person getting over, and descending into my yard—I have no doubt that that was the road pursued by somebody—the glass was sound the night before, and the shutters all safe—it was in the yard of No. 81, where the man was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Customs, and inspector of the Thames police. On the morning of 19th Nov., between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was in the police galley with three constables, very near Mr. Cockerell's coal wharf—as we were rowing up I observed Geal and Warren on the deck of a sand barge, alongside of a loaded coal barge, and Bennett in the coal barge—I saw him stoop down once or twice—he had his back towards me—he stooped towards the coals, and lifted himself up towards the sand barge, and reached to the sand barge—the coal barge was down lower in the water—the sand barge was light—when I first saw this I was about three boats' length from them, going towards them—when we went towards them they all three began to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> the sand barge from the side of the coal barge, and after the sand barge got astern of the coal barge, Bennett jumped on board—they were then all three on board the sand barge—I turned my light on, and saw that coals had been taken out of the coal barge by no frost being on the places where the coals had been taken out—there was frost on the other parts, but where the coals had been taken it was black—I had my boat put alongside of the sand barge, and Geal went down in the cabin as fast as he could—I went after him, with a constable—the other two prisoners were on the deck—when I got down I asked Geal how many coals he had got on board the barge—he said, "None"—I said, "Are you sure of that?"—"I am positive of it," he said—I opened a locker, and found four very large pieces of coal with frost on them—I then asked Geal to move himself—he did not seem to like to move—I lifted his legs, and found a very large lump of coal, with the frost on it—I said to him, "I believe you have stolen these coals from Mr. Cockerell"—he made no answer—I then moved the steerage ladder, and found sixteen or eighteen large pieces of coal, in the space leading from the main hold into the cabin—I said, "I believe the whole of these coals have been stolen from Mr. Cockerell, by the frost being on them"—he made no answer—I went on deck, and found on the starboard side a large number of pieces of coal under some boards in the forecastle—by that time the other two prisoners were gone—they were just at the end of the wharf, going through the wharf—I and another officer followed them, and took them just on Blackfriars-bridge—I saw them stop, and look over the bridge—I took</p>

               <p>Bennett, the other constable took Warren back—I said, "I believe the whole of these coals were stolen from Mr. Cockerell's barge"—Bennett said he knew nothing about the coals—I went back to Mr. Cockerell's; I found three coal barges there—I found a great many marks in the <hi rend="italic">Clara</hi>, where a great many pieces had been taken away—the whole of the coals I found in the sand barge was 890 lbs.—the whole of them had frost on them—I took the prisoners to the station ship; I then went back for the coals, and took them—I took the prisoners to the Wapping station, and after they were charged, and were going to the cell, Bennett said, "Mr. Jones, I hope you will be as lenient as possible with us; we are not allowed coals in the barge"—Warren made the same observation, and Geal said the same—I went over the barge afterwards with Mr. George Jones.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weigher, in the service of Mr. George Joseph Cockerell. We had some barges of coals on the evening of 18th Nov.; three were loaded, and one partly loaded—I went over the barges that evening—there were several large lumps of coal lying on the top—on the morning of the 19th I examined the barges with James Jones; I missed several large lumps of coal—I have seen the coals found on board the sand barge—I have no hesitation in saying they were a part of Mr. Cockerell's coals—I have been in the business three years and three months—I know Geal by sight—the prisoners had no business with any of these coals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been three years in the coal trade; does that enable you to distinguish Mr. Cockerell's coals from all others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I missed coals that morning, and these coals were found with frost on them—I saw them in the galley soon after 5 o'clock, and the frost was still on them—there were other sand barges there, but no coal barges but Mr. Cockerell's—it is Mr. Cockerell's wharf—Mrs. Cockerell had three barges loaded, one half loaded, and two empty—there were no other coal barges nearer than Blackfriars-bridge, which is 100 yards off I dare say—there were no barges with small coals.</p>

On Sunday night, Nov. 13th, I went with Walters to No. 11, Monmouth-street, Dorset-place, St. Martin sin-the-fields, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—I was in plain clothes—I knocked at the prisoners' room door, and the prisoner Emma Irons let us in—I said we were police officers, and had come there to take her into custody, on a charge of robbery, and commenced to search the back parlour, which was the apartment they rented—the three prisoners were there, and a little boy, two or three years old—(the outer door of the house had been answered by another person, who let us in)—I saw Mrs. Irons go to a cupboard, and take out something rolled up in a piece of paper, and go towards the fireplace—I called out to Walters the officer," See what she has got in her hand"—he went to look—she <hi rend="italic">tustled</hi> with him, and struggled to wrench his hand away—he got the paper from her, and unrolled it—it contained four florins and two half crowns, counterfeit—Mrs. Irons said, in the other prisoners' presence, that she would account for how she got possession of it—I took the prisoners into custody—Mrs. Irons said at the station that she had brought the coins into the house without the knowledge of her husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. I was living last month as cook to Jabez Jackson, of No. 5, Compton-terrace, Islington—on Monday, 14th Nov., I was the last person up; I secured the kitchen window with an iron bar, and the window fastening—I slept at the top of the house, there were two stories between—about three o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by a noise; I laid awake, listened, and heard some one trying to get from the back kitchen (there is a door on the staircase, which was fastened over night)—I called my master, who threw the window up, and sprung a rattle—I looked out and saw three men running out of our house up the area steps into the back yard; it was then, I think, about a quarter to 4 o'clock—they got over the wall, went down two or three gardens, and I could see them running over the walls—my master came down with me directly, and we found the kitchen window forced open, the wood work cut away, and they had got the bar out, so that anybody could get in—I have lived there four years—the house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington.</p>

On the night between the 14th and 15th Nov., I was on duty in Compton-mews; and about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock, heard a noise in Mr. Jackson's garden, No. 5; I got over the wall, but did not see anybody—I heard somebody in the adjoining garden, rushing away from No. 5—I sprung my rattle, and went over the wall into the mews, and saw the prisoner Hawkins on the wall, three or four houses from Mr. Jackson's—he jumped over into the next garden; I followed him through several gardens, and he was taken by some one else—in the course of the pursuit I caught Foster in a garden behind the chapel, standing against the wall, about 130 yards from the premises—I took him into custody, and as I brought him away I saw Hawkins on the wall by my side, going back towards Mr. Jackson's—I took Foster into the mews,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280080"/>
               <p>and then found Hawkins in the custody of another constable—I went back to Mr. Jackson's house, and saw a file picked up in the garden, I saw it fitted to the timber work where it seemed to have been used, and it fitted very well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not you find Foster in an open place, attached to the chapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in an open place—there are no means of getting in without getting over a high wall—the door is kept locked and bolted—I got over several walls—the soil was not very soft, it is grass chiefly, and some gravel—there may be a few flower-beds—it was a light night—I heard a noise in the garden first, and immediately afterwards I heard a rattle spring—I was in the garden of No. 5 when I heard the rattle spring, and I saw nothing—I did not stop to look at Mr. Jackson springing his rattle—I got over from the mews into the gardens—the wall is about seven feet high—I did not get out into the mews again till I had caught Foster—the rattle continued sounding for some time—there were people looking out of their windows—the chapel is about twenty yards from the public way—I do not know that I ever saw Hawkins before.</p>

I was on duty—I heard a rattle spring when I was 700 or 800 yards from Compton-terrace—I came along from the New North-road, and saw Hawkins about fifty yards from Compton-terrace, running from Hyde's-place—I stopped him, he resisted, and I struck him with my truncheon, and secured him—he said, "I give myself up quietly, do not strike me again"—I took him to the back of the terrace, where he was identified—I examined Mr. Jackson's house—part of the woodwork of the kitchen window was cut away, the marks on which corresponded with this chisel and file—I found this candle in the back area, and this chisel in the back kitchen—I also found marks on the door leading from the kitchen to the staircase, as if it had been attempted to be forced—the back kitchen door and window were both open—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bar of the kitchen window—I found it on the kitchen floor, broken in two—it had been wrenched off.</p>

Madam, it may be some satisfaction to you to know that I have spent more than 100 times the sum I demand of you in your house, and I promise that it shall be faithfully repaid in three weeks from this time; but remember, madam, if I do not receive the money this morning, I promise you that you shall rue it before to-morrow's sun sets. You need not fear being again troubled by me, as I shall in a few months set sail to America. You must make a bundle of it, as though it was clothes; and if the bearer waits, give it to him: if it comes per post, direct it to Richard Jackson, Criterion coffee-house, Stone's-end, Borough, London. 'If you are so foolish as to try and brave me out, you will very soon see the effect of my tongue upon your business. Yours to command, if you choose, Jackson.") I never saw the prisoner, that I am aware of—there was nothing owing by me to him in any way—I do not know any person of the name of Jackson—upon receiving this letter, I communicated with the police—a bundle was made up, and sent to the Criterion coffee-house by a boy—I addressed it to" Geo.

               <p>him—I made some communication to the landlord—we got there with the parcel about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and waited until the prisoner came; that was about a quarter to 6 o'clock—he came in, went up to the landlord, and said, "I have called for the parcel that was left here in the name of Jackson"—the landlord handed the parcel to him, saying," You must speak to that gentleman before you go," pointing to me—the prisoner turned towards the door, as if he wished to make his escape—I said, "Are you the person that this parcel was sent here for?"—he said, "I am"—he went outside with the parcel; I allowed him to do so, to see if there was any one else there, and I found Simms standing outside—I said to the prisoner, "Is this young man your companion?"—he said, "He is"—I said, "How am I to know that the parcel is for you? perhaps you had better step inside, and write me out a receipt for it" he then wrote this receipt, "Received, of Mr. Bassett, a parcel left at the Criterion coffee-house; Robert William Smith, Nov. 16, 1853 George Banks."—that "George Banks" was put afterwards—after the prisoner had signed it, I said to Simms, "Perhaps you had better sign it also"—the prisoner whispered to Simms, "Sign George Banks"—I heard him say that, and he signed, "George Banks"—I took the letter from my pocket, and saw that the prisoner's writing to the receipt corresponded with it—I then said, "We are two police officers; and you are charged with sending this letter to Miss Weston, of Finch-lane, and endeavouring to extort 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from her"—the prisoner said, "This young man knows nothing at all about it"—after Simms heard me say we were police officers, he immediately said, "Stop! I have signed my wrong name; I will write my right one"—he then gave me his right name and address, which I found to be correct—in fact, I had a knowledge of the lad; I did not think he was guilty—the prisoner went on, and said, "He merely came, to see me; I asked him to take a walk with me"—he also said, "I wrote the letter; I wrote it at home; nobody was with me at the time; I sent it by a boy"—I said, "Where are you going to take the parcel to?—he hesitated a moment, and then said, "Over to Kennington"—I said, "You must go with us to the station house;" Edmunds, the other officer, took charge of the prisoner, and Simms walked with me—when we got to the station house, I searched the prisoner—I found on him three or four envelopes, one addressed to the housekeeper, at No. 14, Walbrook—that is the place where his mother is housekeeper—in consequence of a communication that Edmunds made to me, I took the prisoner in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> over to Kennington Church—it was about two or three minutes past 7 o'clock when we left the station; I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive as fast as he possibly could, as it was a case-of importance, and he did so—I do not know the time we got there—the station house was in Seething-lane—I should think it was not more than twenty minutes past 7 o'clock when we got over there—I left the prisoner and Edmunds in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I should say that the prisoner described a man to me, and I said, "You had better remain in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I will go and see if I can see the man, or a person answering the description; as, if he saw you, he would most likely make his escape"—I looked for him, and also made inquiries of the police, but could find no such person—I then said to the prisoner, "You had better take a walk round with me, and see if you can see him"—I took him round with me, and down all the by-streets round the church, and backwards and forwards in front of it—we waited there, I suppose, about half an hour, and could find nobody at all answering the description—in going back, I took the prisoner into the Criterion coffeehouse, and saw the landlady; she said, in the prisoner's presence, "I</p>

               <p>believe that is the young man that called here on Sunday afternoon, and said he had taken the liberty of having a parcel directed to that house in the name of Jackson, and would we be kind enough to take it in?"—the prisoner replied, "Yes; that is the lady that I saw."</p>

I went with Bassett to the Criterion coffee-house—I have heard his evidence; it is correct—I was with the prisoner when we went to the station, in Seething-lane—as we went along he told me that he was going to take the parcel to a tall man, about my height, in a blue coat, who was to be close to Kennington Church at a quarter past 7 o'clock—nothing further transpired, only he asked me my advice as to whether he had better give his right name and address, and all that sort of thing—I said, being a constable, I could not give him any advice, but I thought it would be more honest if he did—I afterwards went in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Kennington Church—I should say it was about 20 minutes past 7 o'clock when we arrived there—we told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive as hard as he could, and he did do so, and we tried every possible means to trace out the party—as we went along the prisoner said that he wrote the letter, he wrote it at home—I asked him what made him write it—he said the man that met him in the street—when he told me that he wrote the letter at home I said, "Then you must have a copy of it"—he said "No, the man dictated to me what to write"—he said the dictation was in the street—he said he had seen this man a good many times—I asked him if he could refer me to anybody who had ever seen him with the man—he said he could not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a merchant, at No. 14, Walbrook; the prisoner's mother is the housekeeper of the chambers there. On Monday evening, 14th Nov., I was leaving Walbrook with him, at a quarter past 5 o'clock—he said he was going as far as Newington-causeway to look at a pianoforte that he was going to buy—I went with him—when we had got a few steps past the Criterion coffee-house, he said, "Stop a minute, I am going in here to see if there is a parcel left for me"—I said, "You must make haste, because I am in a hurry"—he went in, and in about three minutes came out with this parcel—the officer came out with him—he asked him for a receipt, and said, "I suppose this is your friend"—I went in, and saw him sign a receipt—I was also asked to sign it—the prisoner said to me, "Sign George Banks; don't sign your own name"—I did sign "George Banks"—I asked him why I was to sign that, and he said, "Hush, hush"—I afterwards said it was not my right name, and gave my name and address—I was discharged when I got to the station.</p>

I have met this man several times, and he said he had lost hundreds in this house, and it had been the means of his ruin, and that if he could get a few pounds he could go over to America, and redeem his fortune, and begged of me to write it His excuse was that he had St. Vitus's dance in his hand, so that he could not for any length of time hold a pen. It was not only twice or thrice that he tempted me to do this, but he pleaded poverty, and dogged my footsteps wherever I went; and at last, without intending to gain one farthing by it, I consented to do it.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly of opinion that the objection could not be maintained; it would entirely defeat the object of the first clause of the Act of Parliament, if the word "menace" were to be construed as implying only some personal attack; threats might be made importing far more serious mischief, and more likely to result in obtaining the money demanded; but the use of the words, "without any reasonable or probable cause, cast back a reflective light upon the word" menace "and gave to it its full effect; those words showed that the thing was something which might be excused by there being a reasonable or probable cause for it; now if</hi>"<hi rend="italic">menace</hi>" <hi rend="italic">was construed to mean some specific act of personal violence or injury, it was difficult to see how there could be any reasonable or probable cause for any such thing; therefore if the Jury were of opinion that the prisoner sent the letter, and that the demand contained in it was without reasonable or probable cause, he was satisfied that it came within the statute.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John York, <hi rend="italic">of No.</hi> 1, Vine-court, Burn-street, Marylebone; I know the prisoners by sight. On 4th Oct. last I went into the King William the Fourth, in Salisbury-street, Lisson-grove, with another woman—some time after I had been there the prisoners came in; it appears that the woman who was with me went out and fetched them—I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money with me when I went into the house; it was in a handkerchief—I had 25<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether at first—I took the woman in to give her something to drink—I was not sober—the woman saw my money—I do not know that she knew the prisoners—I never saw them in her company—besides the 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I had placed 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the hands of the landlord of the public house; I do not know his name—I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it back, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was left—I asked him for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave it me—I put that in another handkerchief—one handkerchief was a blue one, with a white flower on it, and the other was blue, with a white diamond spot on it—the prisoners were not in the house when I got the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the landlord, they had not come in then—they saw it, because I took it out of the handkerchief and gave it to the potboy—they told me why could not I take care of it myself—they both said that, and I had it back from the potboy again—they saw that—I put it into the same handkerchief it was in before—I afterwards left the house—I went out before the prisoners—there was another in company with the prisoners, but I did not know him—the prisoners followed me out—Lamb asked me to "go somewhere else—I refused, and he then tried to get the handkerchiefs out of my hand—I fell down on I my knees; Lamb then took both the handkerchiefs out of my hand; he I twisted my hand round, and here is my gown to prove how I tried to struggle for them—the other prisoner took the handkerchiefs from Lamb, and they both ran away—I told them not to take my money, but they did, and ran away—I tried to follow them, but they escaped, and I did not see them any more till they were in custody—I was thrown down in the struggle by both of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lamb.</hi> I went into the public-house along with my father and mother, and three or four working men, to have something to drink; the prosecutrix and another woman were there; she was speechless drunk; when she went out, three or four men followed her; I followed her too, but not to rob her; one man snatched her handkerchiefs from her; she said, "Don't rob me of my money? he ran away; I ran after him, but could not overtake him, and when I came back she was in another public house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am not aware that Lamb's father and mother were in the public house; I did not see them—I know his father, I do not know his mother—I am quite sure that Lamb is one of the men that robbed me, because I caught hold of him, and he handed the handkerchiefs to the other man—I was not sober, but not so tipsy but what I knew them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live at No. 8, South-street Islington. I was in the William the Fourth on 4th Oct., from 11 o'clock till half past 3 o'clock—I saw the prosecutrix and heard her ask the landlord for some money, I saw him give her 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she wrapped it in the corner of a pocket handkerchief—I saw the prisoners in the house before that—there is a partition in the house—they were on one side of the partition before she received the money, and on the other side of it after she received it—at the time the landlord handed the prosecutrix the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I think only the taller prisoner (Lamb) was there, he no doubt observed the money passing—I noticed that he then went out for perhaps half a minute, and then I Hainsbury came in with him—they went to where the prosecutrix was, I saw her in conversation with Lamb—she afterwards went out, Lamb followed her and said something to Hainsbury, and at the same time made some sort of side motion which I interpreted to mean that he should pull the handkerchiefs away from her—he made a sort of snatch with his hand and looked at her, she was close to them and had the handkerchiefs in her hand under her shawl—after they had left the house I heard a noise, I went to the door and saw three men pushing the prosecutrix, the prisoners were two of them—I saw her knocked partially down, I think on one knee—while she was down I saw Lamb pull the handkerchiefs away from her, and directly afterwards I saw Hainsbury take the handkerchiefs from Lamb, put them in his trowsers pocket and run off—she ran after them—they both ran away—while Lamb was snatching the handkerchiefs from her, she was attempting to keep hold of them—I did not hear whether she said any thing or not at the time—I saw nothing more until an hour and a half afterwards, when I think I saw Lamb just put his head within the public house door and then immediately go out again, he did not stay there more than a few seconds—I think when the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was given to the prosecutrix, she might have had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hand—I saw silver and copper in her hand—I have no doubt whatever as to the prisoners being the persons.</p>

On 4th Oct., about 2 o'clock in the afternoon as I was passing the William the Fourth, I saw Mrs. York come out of the door—I saw two persons, Lamb I can swear to, but I cannot exactly swear to the other, with the handkerchief partly in their hand and partly in hers—they pulled her from the door and she went on the ground by the strength of the handkerchief, she laying hold of it—the handkerchief was taken from her, I could not say by whom, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. flew out of it—I heard her say, "Don't take my money"—that was after she was down on the ground—both the men then ran up Earl-street—the prosecutrix stood there and seized hold of a third person who came up, but I did not observe him being there, and I told her I did not think he knew anything about it—she afterwards let him go, and I do not know what then became of her—about an hour afterwards I saw Lamb at Cooper's beer shop in Bell-street Lisson-grove, where I happened to go in, I spoke to a policeman and had him apprehended—I am certain he is one of the men that took the handkerchief from Mrs. York.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 60, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. On 9th June I left my house about 11 o'clock in the morning, to go to Ascot races—I left my servant, Martha Farmer, in the house—my niece was at home, she is a little girl—she was gone to school—I left my pocket book in my drawer in my bedroom—I believe the drawer was locked—there was in my pocket book two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—there was in the same drawer seventy-five or seventy six sovereigns, a watch and chain, four bracelets, one of which was a diamond one, and two sets of earrings and brooches—I left some plate, but not in that drawer—it consisted of forks, and spoons, and knife rests—I returned about 11 o'clock at night, or a very little after—I left Windsor by the half past 9 o'clock train, and came away immediately—I do not think it was later than 11 o'clock—when I got home, I went in my bedroom—there was no appearance of a robbery, the drawers and everything were shut—the room was in better order that night than I have ever seen it—I went in the kitchen to have my dress unfastened by my servant, and she asked me if I</p>

               <p>had locked up my plate—in consequence of what she said, I looked, and missed the plate—I did not open the drawer immediately, because I had no suspicion, but in two or three hours afterwards: I then found that the jewellery, and the things in the drawer, had been taken—I took the key out of my dress pocket, and the drawer came open very easily—I believe it was open—there are no handles to the drawer; I pulled it with the key, and it opened very easily—I never saw either of the prisoners before they were in custody, to know them—I knew that Griffith used to come to see my servant—I had seen him at my door, but never spoke to him.</p>

I am the wife of William Pattison, of No. 28, Hoxton-square, Shoreditch On Wednesday, 23rd Nov., about half past 10 o'clock in the evening, I and my husband were sitting in the parlour, and I heard a scratching at the door, which I thought was the cat—I lit a chamber candle, put it on the end of the table just by the door, and opened the door to let in the cat—I saw the prisoner in the passage, rather behind the street door—I called out to my husband," Here is a man; "and said to the prisoner," What do you want?"—he instantly got round to the other side of the door, sprung down the stairs, and ran away—I went down the steps after him; I saw him turn the corner, and heard a cry of something—I cried," Stop thief! and he was brought back not more than five minutes afterwards—I recognized him instantly, only he had dropped his hat—I found a skeleton key left in the lock—the door had been fastened with a strong lock; I saw it safe half an-hour before—the prisoner had a hat on when I saw him in the passage; I had a light, and I was close enough to him to put my hand on his shoulder—I had time to observe his features, and I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

               <p>key out, and the light from the parlour door shone on him sideways—there was also a large candle burning on the table, and a strong fire—there was no lamp in the hall; they are very small passages in Hoxton-square; the front parlour opens near to the street door—the prisoner turned to the left from our house—there were no servants living in the house; but my daughter and grand-daughter were up stairs going to bed—I am confident they had not been to the door, because they must have passed the parlour door—the parlour door was not open.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 107). On 23rd Nov. I was on duty in Hoxton-square, and saw the door of No. 28 standing open about twelve inches; it was about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I heard Mrs. Pattison say, "Who is that at the door?" there was no reply—she again said, "Who is that?"—presently the prisoner darted from the door into the square; I am sure he is the man—he had his hat on, and ran in the direction of Old-street road—I ran after him, crying" Stop thief!"—he was six or not exceeding nine yards before me—he did not pass me—there was a dense fog at the time, but I could see him as distinctly as I can now at the distance he was from me—he was taken by another constable—I lost sight of him for about a second, not more, as he turned the corner—there was nobody between me and the person who apprehended him—I found this skeleton key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the lock.</p>

I and my family retired just after 11 o'clock—I believe I was the last person up—I saw to the fastenings of the front door, and I believe other members of the family had secured the rest—between 2 and 3 o'clock I was called up by a policeman, and found the front door wide open, and a quantity of cloth tied up in a bundle by the shop door; the back parlour window was right up, and a ladder reared against it—my place appeared to be ransacked; the things were removed from the shelves of the shop—there was about 270 yards of fine cloth, and 10 or 12 yards of silk removed, which were worth 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a silver watch was taken out of the stand in the back parlour, which I had seen on the Sunday evening, at 11 o'clock—two boxes were taken from the sideboard in the back parlour to another part of the room—these goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) all belong to me, and were safe on the night of the 16th—I found two chisels on the shop counter, which are not mine, nor were they there the night before—it was my ladder which was against the window—it was at the back part of the yard when I went to bed.</p>

On 17th Nov., a little after 2 o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Wenlock-street and Cropley-street—I had a view of Mr. Kenworthy's door from that point—I looked up and down the street, and saw the prisoner and another man emerge from the prosecutor's doorway—they stood apparently talking together for about half a minute, and I crossed over to them—there was not a soul else in the street, I had looked up and down before—seeing me they came towards me, and met me at the corner of Cavendish-street, which runs into Temple-street, between where I was standing and the prosecutor's shop—it was a beautiful moonlight night, one of the lightest nights I ever was out in—the prisoner was on the outside of the pavement, and as he passed by me I had a full view of his countenance, but the other I could not see so well, as he hung his head down—the prisoner wore a coat similar to what he has on now, and a plaid scarf, and a hat—I suspected that it was not all right, and found the door of the prosecutor's shop about a foot open—I then saw the prisoner and the other man running down Cavendish-street—I drew this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the streets, and know it to be correct—I ran to the corner of Cavendish-street and saw them running—I sprung my rattle, and called "Stop thief!" pursuing them across the New North-road to Minton-street, where I lost sight of them—I went back to the prosecutor's shop, and found three immense bundles of cloth tied up in the doorway, and the shop ransacked; the parlour window was open, and a ladder reared up against it—Mr. Kenworthy took a couple of chisels from the counter—I tried one of them to the marks in the window, and found that it fitted—the back parlour window had been forced—I found a box of matches there—I returned to the station and reported the robbery to the inspector, and on looking up I saw the prisoner, and said, "That is one of them that I chased"—he made no answer—the inspector went to the shop, brought the property down, and told the prisoner he would be charged with breaking into the tailor's shop—he said he could prove he was not there.</p>

On 17th Oct., about a quarter or ten minutes to 3 o'clock, I was on duty at Robert-street police station, and the prisoner was brought there by Alsworth on suspicion of entering the enclosed premises in the Wigmore-road, with intent to commit a felony—I asked him what his business was there; he said the fact was, he had been lodging at a house for a week, but had left there that morning, and the parties with whom he was lodging were to get him another lodging in the same road at the house of a person named Howard, or Coward, and he was looking for the house when he went into those places, he mentioned a number, but I forget it—as I thought there might be some truth in that statement, I directed a constable to go back and inquire whether he had really a lodging there or not—before the constable went, I said, How do you account for being out at this hour of the morning?—he said, I can explain that; I have been over in Long-acre to spend the evening with my brother, producing a card—I believe this to be the card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if it was his card; he said, No, it is the card of my brother—I sent a constable to the place where he said he had been lodging to ascertain the truth of his statement, and directed the prisoner to go and sit down—in a few minutes sergeant Busain entered, and said that there had been a burglary at a tailor's shop in Cropley-street—casting his eyes across the station to the prisoner, he said, That is one of them—I asked him for an explanation, because the prisoner had been brought from a distance—he explained the circumstances, and the prisoner made no reply whatever—I went down and examined the prosecutor's premises, and on my return the prisoner was sitting there still—I said, Well, sir, it is my duty to inform you that a much greater charge will be made against you; you will be charged with being concerned in this burglary—he merely said, I can prove I was not there—after the remand, I directed Alsworth to make inquiries at his brother's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a little cow keeper and market gardener; I live on the edge of Wanstead-flats, which is a part of Epping Forest In the month of Sept, I had a heifer; I turned it out on the flats—it was marked W. H. M. on each rump; I marked it myself—the letters were in a triangle, the M was at top, Won one side, and H on the other—I missed my heifer on Thursday, 13th Oct—I know that Sharpless had two heifers there—I had marked them on one single side—I marked my own on two sides—Sharpless's heifers were turned out on the forest, and he missed his the day that I missed mine—he and I walked miles looking for them—we went to Brentwood fair, and had them cried in the town; we did not find them—we went the same night to Mr. Saul, a butcher, and he gave us some information—we asked for heifers marked with my particular marks—on account of what he said, I went the next day with Sharpless and Benton to Messrs. Hepburn and Co., in Long-lane, Southwark—I saw there the hides of three heifers, which I had marked for myself and Sharpless; I also identified the hide of Mr. Glenny's heifer, and one of Joseph Hewes's with the Wanstead mark on it—I had not branded that, but I had seen it ever since it had been calved—I knew it as well as I knew my own.</p>

               <p>—he said he would send the heifers on the Wednesday following; that would be 12th Oct.—on Thursday, 13th Oct., I saw six heifers at Mr. Saul's, going to be slaughtered—the prisoner had before given me a description of the heifers—he said they were middling sort of goods—he did not describe the marks they had—when I saw the six heifers on the 13th, they answered the description the prisoner gave me, as far as my judgment went—one of them was a fold heifer—they were killed, and the hides went to Mr. Hepburn's, in Long-lane, Bermondsey—the prisoner did not give me any name—I had no name with the six heifers—they were slaughtered at Mr. Saul's—Mr. Hepburn has the sole consignment of Mr. Saul's hides to dress—after these six heifers had come in, the prisoner came to Mr. Saul's on the Monday, and asked me if the heifers were sold—my answer was, I believed they were; in fact I had purchased one of one of the boys—Mr. Saul was in the counting house, and I ushered the prisoner in—I then lighted the gas, and went to my business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">the younger.</hi> I carry on business, in partnership with my father and brother, as builders, in High-street, Wandsworth. In July and August last, we were engaged merecting some warehouses for the London and South Western Railway Company, at Nine Elms—the prisoner was in our service as foreman of the works; it was his duty to take on what men he wanted to carry out the works, and to discharge them when their services were not required—he engaged a good many men for us—he paid them their wages—it was his duty as foreman to make out what we call pay sheets—he fixed the amount of the wages the men were to receive—it is our custom to pay from Saturday morning till Friday evening—if a man was engaged on Monday, he would be paid from Monday to Friday; that would be five days in that week, and the next day, Saturday, would go into the following week—we pay on Saturday, but the pay sheets are made</p>

               <p>up to the Friday—I generally send' the money to the different jobs to pay the men with—the money for the workmen at Nine Elms was sent to the foreman of the job, the prisoner—these produced are the four pay sheets for 30th July, 6th, 13th, and 20th Aug.—in the first sheet there is the name of Webster put down for six days, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on the third sheet, that of 13th Aug., Webster is put down at seven days three hours, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on the 20th, six days nine and a half hours, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a back day—that means the last day of his services; he was to leave on the Saturday afternoon, 21st Aug.—we had only one person of the name of Webster in our service at that time—he has since been taken into our service; I think he returned some three or four weeks afterwards—he was not a perfect tradesman; I mean, not a first rate hand by any means—he is a carpenter—a first rate hand would be entitled to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day; I am now paying him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—if he had been a first rate workman, he would demand 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner's wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—these sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in these sheets are calculated at the rate of 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per day—if he had been a perfect workman, and entitled to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, these sums would be correct, if he had worked that time—if the prisoner had by mistake paid to any of the men more than he was entitled to pay them, and it was returned to him, it would be his duty to enter it on the pay sheets previous to returning them to our office on the Saturday afternoon, and to refund it with the pay sheets—it would be his duty, not merely to account for it, but actually to refund the cash—he did not, on 30th July, 13th Aug., or 20th Aug., return to me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any money overpaid to Webster; there is no mark or alteration in the pay sheets to show that he has corrected it—my attention 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. not called by the prisoner to those sums as having been returned—these pay sheets are not in the prisoner's handwriting—there is no person in particular appointed to bring the pay sheets to the office; it depends upon whoever is coming there, probably a labourer leaving the job would be told to leave it at the office as he passed by going borne—these pay sheets came into my hands the first thing on Saturday morning, at 6 o'clock; that is the course of business—60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was advanced on this first pay sheet—that was on 30th July; the 12. 10a. forms an item in that account—the men were paid at the place where they worked, at Nine Elms—my brother was present on that occasion—it is the course of business to have the pay sheet at the time the men are paid, and their names are called out from it; on the other occasions, a person named Watkinson was present—on 13th Aug., 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given; the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. forms part of that total—on 20th Aug., 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid out; the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is included in that in two items of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the money to Watkinson—I could not positively swear that I gave it into Watkinson's hand, for I am shut up in a private office the first thing in the morning—I have a clerk alone with me—I count out the money myself, and put it into bags myself, and give it to him to pass to the persons that take the money—at other times, I give instructions as to who shall take the money—I had not the slightest knowledge that Webster was engaged at a less sum than 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day; I did not know that he had only been five days engaged the first week, instead of six—the prisoner was not allowed to make any profit upon the employment of any of the men.</p>

The aggregate amount paid to workmen on 13th Aug., appears by this sheet (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to be 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid that to the prisoner in one sum; it was on a Saturday—I had the pay sheet with me, when I handed him over that sum—it was for him to pay the several men with it, which he did—this name of Webster appears here for him to be paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I saw the prisoner pay Webster that sum—I did not call over the names, the prisoner called in the men and paid them—on 20th Aug. I paid the men myself; the amount was 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Powell did not take part in it at that time, but he was present and the pay sheet lay on the desk by him—I think he called the names—I mentioned the sum to be paid—he was at my elbow—on the pay sheet of 20th Aug. here is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down to Webster's name, and an additional 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid to Webster—the prisoner has never returned me any money that I overpaid Webster.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Nicholson and Co., and worked in the same gang as Webster—I had been there six weeks at the time of this occurrence—the gang consisted of eight men, and the prisoner was foreman over it—I know that he was in the habit of supplying the men of the gang with money and beer when they needed it—I used to have some myself, and the other members of the gang at the same time—Webster had beer at the same time I had—we used all to have it at the same time, at 11 o'clock, or at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and in the evening sometimes, at 6 o'clock—it was supplied by Mr. Trimmings of the Three Goats' Head, in the Walworth-road, on the prisoner's recommendation, and we used to pay him at the end of the week on the settlement of our account, and he used to pay Trimmings—we used to pay Powell back, on the Saturday night or Monday morning—I have been present when Webster had beer, but I did not see that he paid at the time for it, nor did I pay for mine at the time—</p>

               <p>when Webster came to work there he had no tools of his own, and Mr. Powell supplied him with tools—I know that of my own knowledge, and that Webster had no tools of his own during the whole time he was employed.</p>

We have been married fifteen years—I have three children by him; the eldest is a daughter, named Eliza; she will be fifteen next Feb; and I have two younger children—on Monday, 24th Oct., we were living at No. 35, Little Park-street, Kennington-cross—I was living there with my husband—he is a wheelwright by trade—my brother, Peter Westbrook, had recently before this transaction lost his wife, and had since that come to live in an unoccupied room in our house—he came on the Wednesday as this happened on the Monday morning—it was a room on the ground floor—my brother had an acquaintance named Henry Lee—before this Monday my husband had threatened me—I went to bed on Sunday night about 10 o'clock, with my husband—my daughter Eliza slept in the same room—about three o'clock in the morning my brother came home—I was asleep at the time, but, my husband awoke me, and said, "Did you hear a knock at the door?"—I said, "No, I did not hear it; but if there is a knock, it is not for us, so you can let them knock"—I did not know that my brother was coming home that morning—my husband got up, and looked out of the window, and asked who was there; and Thomas (who is a young lad that my brother brought up) answered him—his name is Thomas Sears—my husband said, "Do you wish to come in?"—he replied," Yes"—my husband shut down the window, went down stairs, and let them in—I remained in bed—he asked them if they wanted to sleep there—he said, "Yes"—my husband came up stairs, and my daughter got out of her bed, and went into bed to her two little brothers, and my husband carried her bed down stairs into the room my brother occupied, for their accommodation for the night—Henry Lee was with Thomas, but not my brother—as soon as my husband had done the business, he desired me to cover them over with a pair of</p>

It is just 7, my dear, and came down stairs—I had been washing myself, and putting my hair to rights, and he came down and stood by my right side, apparently buttoning his right hand trowsers pocket—I was putting on my things to go out; I was going to my sister's, No. 24, James-street, Camberwell, and I was putting my black brooch in my dress—he said he should like to have my brother Peter to himself—I said, Well, you know, Philip, my brother Peter will not be with you by himself, as you have threatened both our lives.</p>

               <p>I got into the passage, and there he forced me backwards—at that time my daughter had come to my assistance, but she could not get the street door unbolted—when my husband forced me backwards, he drew a second knife from his right hand pocket, and commenced cutting me in the left side of my throat—he had hold of me by my hair—I struggled with him, and succeeded in getting up on my feet, and told my daughter to open the parlour shutters, and give an alarm—she was trying to get the door open, but could not—my husband was then cutting me in the left side of my throat, and I was struggling with him—I had hold of the blade of the knife with my right hand, and as my daughter passed through the parlour door, my husband made a terrible strike at heir in the back with the knife; had she not stumbled the knife would have passed through her between the shoulders—when she had got the shutters open, he said to her, You b, I will pay you for this—she got the shutters open, and screamed Murder! during this time I was struggling with my husband—I at last succeeded in wrenching the second knife from him, and as soon as I had done so, and threw it down, he tried to force his fingers through the left side of my throat, and tore the flesh towards the left ear—I was then on my feet in the passage he then dragged me by the hair into the back room, and got a third knife—where he got it from, whether he picked it up, or took it out of the table drawer, I cannot say, for I was almost exhausted—I was then on my knees and he commenced cutting my throat again with the third knife—he did not say anything during this time, till the last part of it—I struggled violently with him, and got into the parlour, where he endeavoured to get me down with my head against the cupboard door, and then he exclaimed, Now I have got you, you b, I will do for you—after he had used that expression, assistance came, but he had the knife, point downwards, trying to force it through the left side of my throat, but I clasped the blade so tight with my right hand, that he could not force it as he would have wished to have done; I fear I must have lost my life if assistance had not come—I do not know who it was that came; I was too far exhausted—I only recollect getting out of the house door into the gateway, and I recollect no more, till I found myself in the hospital the same morning—there were three knives used—I threw two away in the passage; he dragged me into the back room before he got the third knife—they were all three black handled table knives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 24, New-street, Park street, Kennington-cross. On Monday, 24th Oct., about half past 6 o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and when within about 100 yards of my house a person came running round the corner, saying, For God's sake, do come round to the front parlour; there is a man murdering his wife—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280127"/>
               <p>when I got to the prisoner's house I found the window thrown up—I looked in, and saw the prisoner at the far end of the parlour at the end of a bed, the wife underneath, and the prisoner cutting her throat—she was bleeding—at the instant I was looking through the window, one or two persons rushed in at the door, seized the prisoner by the back, and brought him out—immediately after, the woman was either led out or walked out to the door, and leaned her back to the fence—I saw the wounds in her throat—I pulled out my handkerchief, and wrapped it round the cuts; the daughter, or another person, brought out something better, and wrapped round my handkerchief—I then led her round to the side of the road, assisted in placing her on a barrow that was passing, and she was carried off to the hospital.</p>

About half past 6 o'clock in the morning of 24th Oct. heard cries proceeding from the window of No. 35, Park-street, right opposite where I live—I saw Eliza Grinney looking, out of their window—ran across, went into the house, and took hold of the prisoner—I took a knife out of his hand, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it over the bed—after bringing the prisoner out of the front parlour, I went in again to assist the woman to get up—she met me at the door, and fell back against the railings—I afterwards went in and picked up two knives, one where I had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it, and the other at the foot of the bed; the bed was on the floor—I delivered those knives to the policeman, Masser—I did not see a third knife—those that I picked up were all covered with blood—they were black handled table knives.</p>

I went down for a jug of water, and saw the prisoner and her husband down at the foot of the stairs—Mr. Avery was down, and Mrs. Avery was rather on the top, because there was a step—I went and got the water, and went up stairs, and left them in the kitchen—I did not interfere—I saw nothing further till I heard Mr. Avery call Murder! and saw him half in and half out of the door, with his head and face cut—when they were on the ground, Mrs. Avery said that Mr. Avery had got her hand in his month, biting it—I was not near enough to see whether that was correct—I cannot say whether she had hold of his hair or not.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house, and saw him lying part in and part out of the doorway, with his head towards the passage—the prisoner was standing in the passage—I asked her if this was her husband; she said, What has that to do with you?—I said, It will have to do with you also, and with that I picked him up—he appeared perfectly senseless; I thought he was dead—I got assistance, and we took him to Mr. Ayres, the surgeon's—a policeman came, and the prisoner was taken into custody I went to the house with the policeman, and found this axe leaning against the end of the house in the garden, near the back kitchen—there was blood on it, and there were marks of blood haying been wiped up where it happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Beecham, and live at No. 16, China-walk, Lambeth—the house is let out in tenements; the prisoners lived in the garret—they had four children—when he took the room he said he had but two—the baby was a year and ten months old, one boy about ten years old, a girl fourteen, and another boy about six—they lived there five weeks—on 28th Oct., about 2 o'clock, I was at home taking my dinner—I heard a rumbling noise, and just after I heard the baby cry—the rumbling noise came from the attic to the second floor door; I occupied the first floor—the house is only three storeys high—the ground floor has nothing to do with it; it is only a shop separated off—on hearing the noise I instantly went up stairs, and there I saw the baby lying against the second floor door—it had rolled from the attic—I screamed moat dreadfully, and brought the assistance of my sister—the baby was taken up, and brought into my room—it was in a most dirty, filthy, and neglected state; it had but one little flannel round it, and that was as dirty as the gown on your back—it was very dirty—it had nothing on but the piece of flannel; it was naked, except that—its body was in a most miserable state, in a starving state—I gave it some bread and butter, with some sugar to it—it made two mouths at it, and then dropped it—it took it ravenously—it could not partake of it, the food was too heavy—it was a female child—it could not stand by itself—as soon as it took the bread and butter, it ran through it—I had never seen the child before; I did not know there was such a child in the house—I knew the parents by seeing them—some one sent for the landlady and the police—I wrapped the child up in a handkerchief, put it in my ironing blanket, and put it in a warm shawl I had got, and took it with the policeman to the station—it had no warmth in it; it was as</p>

                  </hi>. I am relieving officer of Lambeth parish. I know the prisoners; they were in the habit of having occasional relief from the parish—the last relief they had was on 6th April, 1852; they have had none since—they have had a medical order; on 20th Aug. I gave an order for medicine for this very child—from that time there has been no application to me for assistance, for either father, or mother, or children—I gave the medical order to the mother—I asked what the child was suffering from; and the answer, as near as I could make out, was diarrhœa—I have not visited them at their place since they have been in China-walk; I have at their former residences—I do not know sufficient of them to state what their habits were.</p>

               <p>medical officer of the parish of Lambeth. On 28th Oct. I was called to see this child—it had then been washed and dressed, but I found it emaciated to the very last degree—I had it put into a ward, and it was properly clothed and fed, and had medicine—I saw it partake of its food—it took it very ravenously, as if it had been insufficiently supplied with food—I continued to attend to it up to the day before its death, 7th Not.—it rallied for about three days after its admission to the house—at the time I first saw it I believed it to be suffering from mesenteric disease—it would be rash to form any opinion of the source from whence that disease had sprung—it is a disease common among children; it is similar to consumption—after its death I made an examination of the body—I believe that it died from, that disease—I do not know what produced that cause—if a child was left insufficiently provided with food or clothing, that would be the most certain means of producing that complaint—I found that the lungs were affected; there were tubercles in them—that was evidence of a growing disease for some time past.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, if the child, in the state in which you saw it after its death, had been properly cared for, would there have been any reasonable probability of arresting its death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The disease had made too great progress when I saw it—if it had been attacked with that disease constitutionally, the neglect to supply it with sufficient food would decidedly aggravate that disease, and expedite its death—I have been in Court during the examination of the witnesses—I believe from what I have heard stated, that the neglect to provide properly for the child hastened its death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at Rother hithe. On Wednesday night, 26th Oct., about a quarter or twenty minutes after 8 o'clock, I was bringing two barges into the Commercial Dock, a ballast lighter was coming in before me—the dock gateman was assisting in hauling it in, and the people belonging to the lighter as well—when a barge is coming behind one that is being hauled out, it is usual for the gateman to give a rope, or for the barges astern to lay hold of the head most barge with their boat hooks to be towed out along with them—the barge I was in was, I should say, about twelve feet from the ballast lighter—that would enable me to lay hold with a boat hook—I did so—the prisoner was on board the ballast lighter—the captain of the lighter told me to let go—I told him my holding on made no difference to him as the gateman was pulling the lighter into the dock—the prisoner then called out, "Let go there will you?"—I made him no answer, but still kept hold—he then walked aft from the forward part of the lighter, and told me to let go—I unhooked my boat hook and laid it on the lighter, and I said to him, "It makes no difference to you about my holding on; the gateman is hauling you in the dock, ain't he?"—he replied, "Never mind, let go?—I was standing in the barge's head sheets—while this was taking place the lighter was going ahead—the prisoner took a short staff that he had in his hand, and knocked the hook of my boat hook over board, I was holding the other end in my hand—while I was talking to the prisoner, the lighter was going out of my reach—I immediately jumped up to the barge's head to lay hold of the lighter again, and the prisoner took up the hook and said, "I will knock your by eye out"—I turned myself round in the barge's sheets when the <hi rend="italic">hitcher</hi> struck me in the right ear—the handle of it was about eight feet long—I was about fourteen feet off at the time I was struck—it must have been thrown at me, it could not have reached me without—I had on this southwester at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and here is the hole right through—it went right through that into my neck—I bled a great deal, and I told the prisoner he had cut my head open—he said, That is the way to settle you"—my barge was brought to, and I was taken out and taken home—I was under medical treatment for a month—I had done nothing more to the prisoner than I have stated, hooking on to his lighter to pull my barge in—that would not have delayed his progress in the least, it is the usual custom in the docks.</p>

               <p>my hand—when the lighter was going out of my reach I jumped up on the barge's head sheets, and took up the pole in my hand to hook on to the lighter again—I hooked on to the lighter again, I could not see very well as it was very dark—I will undertake to say that I did not hit the prisoner with it; if I had hit anything with the staff I should have felt it—I hooked it gently—I was in a little bit of a hurry in doing it, because the lighter was going away from me; but we can tell within a few inches where the staff will lay hold, when we have it in our hand—I am satisfied that I did not touch the prisoner with it—I could not see his boat hook come at me, because when I saw him take it up I turned my back to it, so that my back might receive the blow—I did not see him throw it—at the time I was struck I had let go—I am sure that the prisoner's lighter was being assisted out of the dock, the people belonging to the dock were doing it; William Sells was one—it is a mystery where the hook is with which the injury was done, I should say it was about eight feet long; I saw it as he held it up in his hand—he stood rather higher than me, a trifle higher, about eighteen inches I should think—the lighter was close to the quay, the gateman had hold of it.</p>

On 26th Oct., about 8 o'clock in the evening, I was standing close to the ballast lighter—the prisoner was on board the lighter—the prosecutor was in the barge—I was assisting in hauling the lighter into the dock—the prisoner is not the captain of the lighter, he is a working man—I did not see the injury inflicted—my attention was first called by hearing the prosecutor groaning—I asked him what was the matter—the prisoner was on board the lighter; he might not have heard me—the prosecutor made a complaint to me—I saw a wound on his neck, under his right ear—it was such a wound as a boat hook would make—it went through his southwester—in consequence of information I received, I went on board the lighter, where the prisoner was, and took him into custody—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—he made no complaint to me of having been struck by the prosecutor.</p>

On Saturday night, 8th Oct., about half past 10 or a quarter to 11 o'clock, I was walking along Oakley-street—I turned into Kynaston-street for a necessary purpose, and while there the prisoner came behind me, put his hand over my mouth and his arms round my neck, and squeezed my neck so tight that I could not speak; I could only make a sort of gurgling noise—he had a companion that came in front of me, and snatched my chain away from my watch, endeavouring to get my watch at the same time, but the swivel gave way, and broke the chain from it—I happened to have an old satin waistcoat on; the pocket had been mended more in one part than another, and the watch had got tight down in the corner, and that saved it—I made an effort to release myself by endeavouring to throw up my legs and fall to the ground; by that the prisoner lost his purchase, and I got my voice so as to sing out, "Murder! Thieves!"—at the same time, I had the presence of mind to catch hold of the prisoner's coat tail—I held him by it till he struck me in the mouth and loosed himself from me, and walked away—I was on my legs in an instant; my hat was off but I never stopped for that—I followed the prisoner, and never lost sight of him—before he had got much more than fifteen yards I caught hold of him—just before I caught hold of him, his companion ran to the left into the Westminster road, and the prisoner was just about starting when I caught hold of his coat—they had both walked together straight out of the street—there was no thoroughfare in the street I was attacked in, and there was no one in the street but myself, the prisoner, and his companion—it was about the middle of Oakley-street where I caught hold of him—there were no persons passing, right or left—there were three or four persons on the pavement opposite, but he had never reached them; in fact, I never lost sight of him—just as I had got hold of him the policeman came up, and I immediately</p>

Murder!—I made my way towards him, and, as I started, I saw three men come out of Kynaston-street—it was dark down where the noise was—I could not see them when I first heard the noise; they came out of Kynaston-street into Oakley-street—one of those three men was the prosecutor—I hastened down as fast as I could into the street that I saw them come into, and when I got there, the prosecutor had got the prisoner by the flap of his coat, I went up and took him into custody—the prosecutor charged him with assaulting him, and robbing him of a gold curb chain—the prisoner said he did not know anything about it; he did not know what he was talking about; he was merely walking along the street.</p>

I did not see either of the persons who robbed me before I was seized—the first thing that happened to me was the putting the hand over my mouth—that was done by the prisoner from behind; he then put his aim round my neck—he was still behind me; up to that time I had not seen him—I then made a struggle, and fell, and caught hold of the tail of his coat—he then turned and struck me in the mouth, and then I saw him—he got away from me, but was never at any time further from me than I am from his Lordship—it happened close by the gas light—I am rare I saw his features while I had hold of the tail of his coat—I fancy the reason they did not run was because I made such a terrible noise, crying "Murder!" and "Thieves!"—it was the other man who was in front of me; I only caught sight of the prisoner as I fell—I knew nothing at all of him before—I have since heard that his father has been a respectable brewer at Stourbridge.</p>

On 26th Aug. twenty six packages arrived there from Dorchester, from Wimberley the carrier; they were to be delivered to Thomas Skinner, of the New Inn, Old Bailey—I have the bill of parcels; the packages were put on the platform at the end of the stage near the window, just by the basket, I have every reason to believe—I saw them last on the Saturday afternoon, and I missed them on the Monday morning—Skinner made application for four baskets, but one was missing, and three only were delivered to him—from information I received on the Monday, I went to a field near the goods station, to some premises belonging to Mr. Godstone, and in a hedge there by the side of the rail, I found this hamper, it had the paper boxes in it, and they were wet; the gloves had been taken out of them—the prisoner was a porter in the Company's service, and was employed specially on the platform—he would know the glove hampers because we have them up daily, sometimes twenty, and sometimes thirty, and particularly by their being directed to Skinner, of the Old Bailey—on Sunday night, 30th Aug., the prisoner applied to me for leave of absence on Tuesday morning, and I gave him leave for from 10 minutes past 9 o'clock in the morning till 6 in the evening, and he was absent the entire time—he would leave on the Saturday, when the work</p>

I live at No. 14, Mill-street, South Lambeth About March last I used to work as a carrier, which took me to the South Western Railway—I have not been in regular employment—I know James Wade, who has been convicted at the Surrey Sessions—I had not given information against him—I had known him for some years—soon after Christmas last the prisoner came to lodge with me, and he remained till some time in Aug.—I had not myself any knowledge of the premises of the South Western Railway, or of the goods there; but one Sunday morning in Aug. I was down in the kitchen, and the prisoner told me to come out in the garden to him; and he said there was a good thing which we might do in the evening—I asked him what it was—he told me it was a parcel which he had got <hi rend="italic">all to rights</hi>, on the Company's premises, and might easily be got out at night—I would not go with him, and in the afternoon he came down again about 2 or 3 o'clock, and asked me if I had made up my mind whether I would go—I hesitated about it for some time, not knowing what to do, and at last I arranged that I would go—he remained at the top part of the house, and about 7 o'clock in the evening he came down, and asked about how it should be got, and I inquired if there was a policeman there; he said there was not—I had a carpet bag, and he said that would be the best thing we could take, and we arranged to take it—we left the house at a little after 8 o'clock; we went up the Wandsworth-road, into a field over at the back of Mr. Godstone's house, and crossed the line to the warehouse—(I am married; I saw my wife not a minute before I left home, and she knew we were going out together but I do not know whether she saw us leave the door exactly)—we got to the premises about 20 minutes before 9 o'clock, and the prisoner got under the warehouse door, leading out of the Wandsworth-road—there was just room for him to get under—he then opened the door, and gave me this basket to take away—I have no doubt that this is it—I took it a little distance, and he stopped and fastened up the place, and came away to me—we unpacked the basket in a field very near Mr. Godstone's house about 200 yards from the warehouse; it contained fifty-three dozen pairs of gloves—we put them into this carpet bag; put the boxes back into the hamper, and the prisoner took it away some distance—he was four or five minutes gone, and said he had thrown it in a pond or a ditch, and that it was in the water—I did not see where he threw it—we went down the Wandsworth-road, as far as the Goats public house—Wade had not appeared in the matter at all—I then went away to Mile-street with the bag, and the prisoner went into the public house—I put the bag into a place like a little dust hole at our front door, and then went back to the public house, and found the prisoner and three or four other people in the parlour; there were one or two of the company's servants there, and several men—Header was there—we remained till nearly 11 o'clock, I and then went home, went indoors, and then out into the garden—I fetched the bag, and took it indoors, so that his wife and my wife knew nothing of it—I locked it up in the front room for the night, and in the morning, at half past 5 o'clock, the prisoner came down—I got up—we opened the bag, and counted fifty-three dozen pairs of gloves—we packed them up into the bag, and put them od one side—I arranged with the</p>
