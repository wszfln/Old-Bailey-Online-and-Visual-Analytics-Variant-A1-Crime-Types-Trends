I am a gardener, living at 5, Albert-road, Old Ford, Stratford-le-bow—my house is at the back of the defendant's butt, about forty yards from it—the butt is in a sort of garden or enclosed ground—there are three highways close to it, the Victoria-park-road, the Victoria-road, and the Albert-road—the Victoria-park-road runs right across the back the butt—the Victoria-road is about from thirty to forty yards from the butt, and the Victoria-park-road about the same distance again—the Albert-road runs immediately at the back of the butt—the nearest road from the butt is from twenty to twenty-five yards; I cannot say exactly—if a person at the butt, and the bullet passed to the right of the butt, it would most likely go into one of the houses, or into the Albert-road—there are ten houses there—immediately at the back of the butt the ground is open as far as the Park-road, and there is a footpath leading to the Victoria-road and the Victoria-park—it is not the defendant's ground between the butt and the Victoria-park-road; it is a piece of ground belonging to some other man, I believe—there is a kitchen garden at the back, belonging to Mr. Brown, of Marquis of Cornwallis public-house, then comes the Albert-road and the houses in the Albert-road—there are no gardens at the back of the Albert-road—the Victoria-road is a main thoroughfare into Victoria-park by Victoria-park-road—there is regular street in the Victoria-park; the houses stand at the back of the Albert-road—on the evening of 3d December I had just left my own house, and was passing No. 8, three doors off, when a rifle bullet whistled over my head, and entered Mr. Bartholomew's bedroom window at No.—that is the third house to the right of the butt, No. 10 being at the corner of the Albert-road—I have been in the army nine years—I know the whistle of a rifle bullet well—the sound of it rather astonished me for the moment—I was on my way to Victoria-park station—I hesitated for a moment whether to go on, when two more came over immediately, and fell into a small heap of gravel and knocked the stones about my feet—I then turned back immediately, and went over to Bow station instead of Victoria<lb/>park station—I should think this was about a quarter-past 8 o'clock—the firing was usually carried on from half-past 9 to 10—I only heard it one day afterwards—I never took much notice of the firing previous to 3d December—I knew the ground—there was firing going on, rifle shooting—persons were assembled there—the butt was there previous to 3d December—I have seen it—in my opinion it is not broad enough or high enough—at the top of the sand-bags, which are placed before the butt, there are some wooden faggots, placed, long ways towards the shot—a pound of candles would have about the same effect in stopping a rifle ball as that—if you walk at the back of them you can see through them—a cat could run between them in many places—I cannot give you the size of the butt at all, I daresay it can be given; but I should think from the top of the target to the top of the sand-bags which would be at all effective in stopping a rifle ball, it would be seven feet, as far as my judgment goes.</p>

               <p>where it entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The report came from towards the end of Mr. Beasley's ground, which I should think would be about 150 yards—it might be a little over, 170—the other two bullets that were fired that night, and came near me, came from Mr. Beasley's ground, I can be on my oath—there is a great danger, in addition to the person not hitting the butt, of the ball hitting the ground before hitting the butt—you can then hardly tell where the shot will fly; it is just as likely to fly into the street, or go back again—in a properly constructed butt an allowance is made for a shot striking the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you speak from your own experience as a rifle shooter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can shoot a rifle as well as a great many—I have been engaged in practising rifle shooting—I have been an instructor in rifle shooting, and also in the artillery—I have just looked at the butt to tell the size of it—it does not want much looking at it to give an opinion upon it—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is something like the rifle ground—the butt is situated at the end of a cutting, which is represented by that model—there is an archway at the commencement of the cutting, but I cannot say whether the riflemen always fire through it or not—I believe that is a correct rep<lb/>resentation of the construction of the cutting, 'the butt, and the arch through which they fire—I can't say whether there is a gradual descent from the grounds of the garden down to the place where they stand to fire through the archway—I have not seen that part of the ground—the 3d of December is the only occasion of which I personally complain—some rifle balls, pro<lb/>pelled from a rifle, will be carried 1,000 yards, some 1,200, some 800—the rifles which are ordinarily made use of by the rifle corps of London will carry a ball from 800 to 1,000 yards, a fair charge being in the rifle—that would be the regulation charge—that would be about half a mile—my house is about forty yards from the butt—it was not into my house the ball went; it was No. 8, three doors from me; my house is No. 5—there are sand-bags seven feet from the top of the target—I should think the target is about four feet high; I cannot say exactly—I saw the bullet afterwards that the policeman picked up—that bullet presented the appearance of having been recently discharged from a rifle—I can hardly tell you how soon I saw it—it might have been a fortnight; but you can tell for a twelvemonth, whether it has been fired through a rifle or not—a rifle ball recently dis<lb/>charged from a rifle would present an appearance very little different indeed from that which it would present a fortnight afterwards—I think it would take rather a clever man to tell whether or not it had been recently. discharged; all I can tell is that this ball had been discharged from a rifle, and had received the rotary motion from a rifle—the gravel was struck up at my feet—I will undertake to say that that was the result of bullets—the two bullets came right into this heap of gravel—I did not search for them; I did not think it worth my while—I was in a hurry to get to the train to go where I was going—all I can say is that two rifle balls came into that heap of gravel within, I should say, a couple of seconds; immediately, as fast as they could fire, one after the other—they were not the only ones that came into the street the Same night, only I was not there—the sound of the discharge of a rifle could not be mistaken for the whistling noise of the ball—it is a matter of impossibility—a man who never heard a rifle before could tell the difference.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>grounds—I was not prepared for it, it took me by surprise but I know the report came from the direction of Mr. Beasley's grounds—I heard the first ball hit the window—the target is in front of the sand-bags; they are piled up behind the target, and rise up above it—the height of the sand-bags is, as near as I can tell you, eleven or twelve feet from the bottom of the cutting—I should think the depth of the cutting is about eight feet; so the sand-bag would be about three feet above the surface of the embankment, and above the level of the road behind, and then on the top of the sand-bags there are some of those wooden faggots placed—with the exception of the faggots, the top would be three feet above the surface of the road behind, where I was standing—I think those houses are properly represented on the model—I should almost fancy they came nearer towards the back of the butt—the Marquis of Cornwallis stands more that way—that would be the gardens, and a piece of kitchen garden—the kitchen garden comes right up behind the butt; the Albert-road comes up as far as end of the houses, and behind those houses is another road—you can go right into Victoria-park; right through, leading right into Victoria-park—there is no obstruction between the back of the butt and the Victoria-road, and the Victoria-park-road—there is nothing to prevent shots passing over there—the distance from the butt to the farthest road, the Victoria-park-road, would be about seventy yards—the whole range is 150, so that a bullet would range some 600 yards even beyond the Victoria-park-road—a bullet ranges 800 or 1,000 yards—I dare say it would destroy life at 800 yards—quite at 800 or 900, if it would not at 1,000, and it would range a little beyond that as a spent ball—there is a class of rifle that will carry 1,200 yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Albert-road, Old Ford—that is three doors from the house of last witness—I remember the evening of 3d December—I know this butt—I had heard the reports of the rifles before that me, at night I had heard them on other days, in the evening, and have seen persons in the ground shooting at this butt about 8 o'clock—on the evening of 3d December, in consequence of something I was told, I went up into one of my front bedrooms, and my son gave me a shot that he picked up in the room—I did not see him pick it up—I did not observe the mark the wall at that time—I did next morning—it was dark when I went up at first—it was such a mark as might be made by a rifle bullet—I after wards saw Mr. Beasley with reference to this matter—he came round to my house—I went round there in the first instance—I met him and told him I had had a shot enter my window—I of course concluded it came from there, because I heard the firing there—he came round to my house—some gentleman who came with him from the rifle ground said that he shot picked up under the window, had been thrown through the window—I said, "No one could throw it through; it took a piece out of he Venetian blind"—I had observed the state of the blind—it was a Venetian blind, made of wood, and the ball had taken a piece right out of one of the wooden laths—the hole in the wall which I saw next morning was in a position corresponding with the hole in the blind—Mr. Beasley said he had no doubt the ball had come through the window—he did not say anything more—I did not see him again with reference to this matter—he has been round to my place once or twice, but I happened to be out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Second Tower Hamlets' Militia—I know the grounds occupied by Mr. Beasley—I had hired them formerly for two or three days from Mr. Beasley—I hired them on 2d August last, and I gave them up on the 6th because they were not safe as regards the public—the butt has been altered since I gave it up—since the time I had it it has been raised above seven feet, but now, in consequence of the wet weather and so on, it is not above five feet—it is not sufficiently high in my opinion—I saw it in December last—it was not much higher then than when I had it—it was dangerous then in my opinion.</p>

I reside at 14, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square, and am a commercial traveller—I have known the prisoner five or six years; he is connected with me by marriage—I remember the officers coming to my place—I gave them some articles which I had received from the prisoner—I pawned some microscopes and mathematical instruments—I received them from the prisoner—I pawned them by his desire—the microscope was pledged for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid the money to the prisoner—I received five per cent, commission—the day before the police came to my place, I told him I was frightened the things were not right, that I ought not to sell them—he said, "I have the right to sell them, because I had the order from Mr. Spier before I came from Paris"—so I said to him, "But if Mr. Spier was to tell you I had no right to sell for you, what am I to do?"—he said "You have no business about it; you sell for me, and I will give you a receipt," and the receipt was given to me—I sold for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one day, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. another, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. another day, and gave him the money; and when I told him I liked to have a receipt he gave me the receipt, so that nobody should ask me for the money I had paid once—it was about the beginning of April that he gave it me—the duplicates that I gave to the officer I received from the pawnbrokers for these goods; one I received from the prisoner to fetch it out—the one to Slater was pledged by me, not the eye-glasses—he gave me the money a few days before he went away to France, to take them out and keep for him till he came back.</p>

I got drinking up there, and playing at skittles. I played a man for sixpence and a pint of ale, and I lost; on the last two games I lost a shilling, and had two pints of ale to pay for. I said, "Here, take your shilling and give me eighteen pence out of this half-crown, and we will have two pots more, and then go home." On my coming home I went into this lady's shop. I was sitting down eating and the policeman came in and took me. Do you think, if I intended to get my living by uttering, I should go in two days running, with counterfeit shillings? I must be sure that she would know me or lock me up. I can prove where I was; I was not in the city all day long; at the time she charges me I was at Stepney fair. I am perfectly innocent of what I am charged with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Green Man public-house, Hoxton—on the morning of Wednesday, 17th April, I was called out of bed about 2 o'clock by a policeman, and my attention directed to the cellar-flap—I found it raised—the policeman told me somebody was in the cellar—I went down and found the two prisoners in the cellar—the cellar-flap had been secured the night before with two bolts, one on each side.</p>

Calvert, brewers—they serve the prosecutor's house with beer—on the afternoon of 15th April, I was down in that cellar—I removed the two bolts which fasten the flap down—I let down the barrels and afterwards fastened the flap the same as I found it—I am quite sure of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Munton's Defence.</hi> We are unprepared with legal advice to assist us, and I hope you will pay attention to what the witnesses, have said. The prosecutor states there is no hole in front of the flap; the constable tells us there is a hole where he put his hand down and tried it; the bolts on the flap are at the back; there is no necessity for any breaking to raise the flap, because there is no fastening to the front; the blacksmith had been at work. You can't rely on this evidence as to breaking; then, as to his dwelling-house, it is not his dwelling-house; the flap is on the pavement in the street, ten yards from his dwelling; you have to go up a flight of stairs, and go into another house, so it has nothing to do with his house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller and baker, residing at Three Coltlane, Bishopsgate—the prisoner carries on the same sort of trade—he is my wife's sister's husband—I had, for some two months before, joint dealings with him in business—we were together three weeks—the amount of profits were not sufficient and he left me—he did not tell me he was going to leave—on 22d April, about 8 in the evening, he came to my house—he said he had come there to obtain satisfaction from me—I asked him for what, and he said he could settle with me outside—we were then standing at the street-door—I asked him inside, and he came in—he then began to abuse me in a most shameful manner; said I had taken his trade away, and swore at me a great deal—I said it was false, and whatever he might have heard it was untrue, I did no such thing, and if he could bring any one forward, to do so—he continued to abuse me—I told him it was no use going on in that way before the children, if he had no more to say the interview was at an end—with that I got up and walked to the street-door—he followed me, and began to abuse me again outside—while he was doing so a friend went by, and I</p>

               <p>ran to him to speak to him about selling a horse—I returned, and the wind had blown the street-door to—the prisoner was still standing at the door—I was in the act of putting up my hand to knock at the door and he said, "Take that," and put a pistol to my ear—I caught sight of it and dropped my hand from the knocker and knocked it down—I jumped from the step (there is one step at the street-door), and made a grab at the pistol—he raised it again and knocked my hat off—I was so flurried that I ran away—I made no further effort to get possession of the pistol—when he raised the pistol at me again I ran behind two men, and my daughter came out at the time—he raised the pistol in the direction of me, and I ran behind the two men and asked them to protect me as the man was trying to shoot me—in raising it he pointed in the direction I ran—he was, perhaps, as far as I am from you at the time—I saw my daughter lay hold of him, and I ran round the next street—I did not see him again till he was in custody of the police, about three or four minutes afterwards—I did not see the state of the pistol or hear anything connected with it till I got to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French gentleman and an English merchant—I have resided in England twenty-four years—I live at East Pavilion, Sloane-street—on Monday, 15th April, I left the goods department of the Eastern Counties railway at a quarter-past 5—I took a cab and three minutes after I was in the cab I fell among these people; the cab was broken and fell down—on getting out of the cab I was immediately stopped by Morley, the one nearest to me, and immediately Mary Ann Welsh came and tried to unbutton my coat—I had the same coat on which I have now—they were all six of them after me—this was in Lower Keate-street, and about twenty minutes past 5—I struggled with them all and some who were behind me, about two or three minutes, with my hands, and crying as much as I could for help, but it appears that in that street they are all thieves, and no one came to my help—there were a great many people there—then Coker, after having unbuttoned my coat, succeeded in putting his hand in my right-hand trousers pocket, and Mary Ann Welsh put her hand in my left pocket, assisted very actively by Ellen Welsh, and they were saying, "Quick! Quick!"—when Coker put his hand into my right pocket I felt my keys, and some receipts, and all the bank notes taken from it—I had 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—they are all in the hands of the policeman—they were in my right-hand pocket—12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and a small bag were in my left—Mary Ann Welsh took that, assisted very actively by Ellen Welsh—the man Tucker took my gold chain, and snapped it from me—the ring went, fortunately leaving the watch in the bottom of my pocket, but at the moment I thought it was gone—I could see them very distinctly, because I was standing pushing at them—the Cokers were taken up first to the police-court, the same day—I recognised them again—I am quite sure that these are the people—I must state that during the time they were busy about me, the one in the black dress, Ann Coker, was throwing something red before my face—I do not know whether it was a handkerchief or an apron—I stopped the notes that very morning at 9 o'clock—I have not recovered the gold since, or an eye glass which I lost—I lost my hat in the struggle—they beat me on the back, and the more I struggled the more they pressed upon me, and beat me—Tucker snatched my chain—they were all struggling, but these two women did not leave me a second—they were at me exactly like dogs, and they stopped my voice with</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 114). I was near Keate-street, on Monday, 15th April, about twenty minutes, or from that to half-past 5—my attention was called to a male voice crying out, "Help! police! I am robbed!"—I went to the bottom of Keate-street, lending into Lower Keate-street—I was from fifteen to twenty yards off when I first heard the cry—I saw a cab broken down in Lower Keate-street, against the corner—I then went up to see what was the matter, still hearing the voice crying not," Police! I am robbed!"—I saw the prosecutor going away from the mob, and I also saw the female Coker running away from the mob—she ran into a lodging-house, in the same street, followed by the male Coker—just before he went into the lodging-house door, I saw him pull a handful of notes or papers of some description, I could not distinguish whether they were notes or what they were, out of his right-hand pocket, he looked at them, and put them in again, and then he ran into the door—I should have been soon enough to have taken him into custody then, only there was such a mob, I could not get through the mob, and in those streets they stop a policeman as soon as they can see them after any person—I then followed the last witness—before I came up to him I saw a boy kicking his hat about the street—he is not in custody—I picked the hat up and took it to the prosecutor—I asked him if that was his hat, and he said, "Yes"—he was in a very exhausted state—his mouth was bleeding—he made a complaint to me, and he went with me to the police-station—on going there I found this piece of chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging round his neck, underneath his coat—I heard the charge given at the station—I went in search of the prisoners the same night, with Harvey, another police-officer—I went with him to the lodging-house where I had seen the two Cokers go, found them there, and took them into custody, to the police-station—the prosecutor saw them the same night—nothing was found on either—when I saw the Cokers in the mob of people, I did not recognise any of these other prisoners.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">John Coker.</hi> About 6 o'clock, I was in a public-house drinking—the policeman and sergeant came in—I was standing at the door—he said, "Will you allow me to pass?"—I said, "Yes"—if he knew me to be the party, why not take me then? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Because I wanted to get hold of the others, but I knew if I apprehended one without the others we should not be able to get the others.</p>

I received a description of some of the prisoners from the prosecutor, on 16th, in consequence of which I went to No. 1, Henry-street, Whitechapel, and found Tucker and Mary Ann Welsh there—I told them I should take them in custody for being concerned, with two others in custody, in robbing Mr. Bessett of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and notes, in keate-street, Spitalfields—they said they knew nothing about it—before taking them out of the house, I searched the room and found some bills relating to clothes which they had been and purchased that day, on the mantel piece, put in some shells—I have produced them to-day—we found some new clothes in the room—the prisoners were taken to Leman-street station—I was present when the prosecutor saw them—two women were put with Welsh, and he picked her out directly—Tucker was placed in a room after the women were put on one side, and there were three men put with him, I believe—the prosecutor selected him directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is one of those letters the one which encloses an invoice from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the bill was not sent with the letter—it was sent next day, not in a letter; I passed it through the bankers—the value of these hats is 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am not aware that the selling price of them in this country is 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is impossible—even at the factory, to us, they cost far more—I had not known the prisoner before that letter.</p>

I am a lace-manufacturer and commission-agent, at Bread-street, Cheapside—I do business with Mr. Leopard—I did not receive from him in February three samples of straw hats—I went with him to White cross-street, and saw the prisoner, who said he had a lot of goods to sell, in order to get out of prison—I asked him what those goods were—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the Corporation of London, and by the Commissioners of Sewers, as one of the inspectors of meat in Newgate-market—I have been so twelve years—I have had considerable experience in regard to food that is brought to London in the shape of meat—on 16th February last, my attention was called to four quarters of beef which were at the shop of Messrs. Larner and Greatrex, meat salesmen, at Tylor's market—the meat was in a hamper—Mr. Greatrex had sent for me—the hamper was shut when I first saw it—they opened it to show me the meat—it had been opened before—it was not fastened in any way when I saw it—they keep a shop—it was open for the public to go in or out—in the hamper were four quarters of beef, the carcase of a cow, which were totally unfit for human food—I was there about half-past 6 o'clock in the morning, I think—business generally commences in the market about 5 o'clock—these quarters of beef were in a very bad state; what we call wet, which was, I apprehend, from disease—the fat was turned into actual serum—finding them in that state, I seized them and condemned them—part of the fat had dissolved, and by the liquid so produced the meat had become wet—that is the effect of disease—the meat was wetter than good meat would be—the whole of what ought to be fat was turned into serum—each quarter of this was dressed for the market in the usual way that good meat would have been dressed, and was packed in the hamper with cloths, in the usual way—I know the difference between tainted meat and meat bad from disease—this was not tainted—I should call this meat unusually bad—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050048"/>
               <p>it would present some such an appearance the day before, as it presented when I saw it—it would look worse next day from having been packed; it would not look so well as it did the day before, but the general appearance of it would not be altered as to the wet and the serum—it would decidedly, in my opinion, have been in such a state the day before, that a person in the trade, a butcher, would know that it would be unfit for human food—any one with ordinary judgment, on merely looking at it, would know that it was unfit for human food; I mean a butcher, of course; one does not know that people would be sufficient judges if they were not acquainted with the business—the weather was cold at this time; it was in February—I called the attention of Mr. Newman and Dr. Lethe by to it—the hamper had no label on it—I was present and was examined at the trial of a man named Thomas Spencer at the last sitting of this Court, before Mr. Justice Williams, on Friday, 12th April—Mr. Newman and Dr. Lethe by were examined—I also heard the prisoner, Peck, examined on' behalf of Spencer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it make those appearances worse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would make them worse if it was packed hot—if it was wet when packed it would not be dry next day—if sound meat were packed hot it would not deteriorate the quality of that meat; it would not look so well; and it would be the same with respect to cow beef—supposing it to come up by railway with a number of other hampers placed upon it, the great heat would alter its appearance—it would depend on the weather, whether a carcase coming 100 miles, packed perfectly fresh, would be more than tainted before its arrival; in cold weather it would not, in hot weather it would—I have seen carcases arrive in a putrid state—supposing meat was washed warm, and then packed up before it was cold, it would alter the appearance, and might cause it to be tainted—I heard that it was slaughtered, not by Peck, but by a regular butcher, who stated that he ate the heart of it—supposing a butcher had killed it, a man coming in casually and seeing it hanging up, would be able to see at once what state the meat was in, after it had been washed by the butcher, merely by taking a bird's-eye view of it; he would see the quality of it; that it was unfit for market—it was about fourteen years ago that I was a butcher; I was brought up in the trade—when I saw this meat it was in the hamper—I do not know whether it had been out of the hamper—it was outside the shop by itself—there was nothing on it—it had not been exposed for sale, I believe—Greatrex and Larner are very respectable men; known to be first-rate meat salesmen—they do not buy meat at all—I know that there are persons who buy inferior meat and make it up into sausages—if there were not such customers they would not get rid of the bad meat—I. dare say a good deal is sold in London to persons who turn it into such things; I do not know, it of my own knowledge, I suppose it is so—I looked in the whole of the carcase for the fat—I looked where the fat is to be found; inside the loin, not inside the long ribs, we do not find fat there—I did not find any fat at all—I found the serum where the fat usually is—in a cow, it is in the inside of the loins or the kidneys—there was very little fat; if it had been fat it would not have been much—as there was not much fat, there was not a great deal of water.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity was there I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot state the quantity, but considerably more than one thimbleful or 100—it is my duty to check the sale of bad meat, and I do so wherever I find it—meat that gets warm in packing presents a very different appearance from that which I have described here; in that case the fat would be soft instead of hard, but there would be no liquidity—the meat did not present any appearance of taint or putridity—the whole of the flesh presented the appearance of disease—an experienced person, at all events a butcher, would see at a glance that it was diseased meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What appearance does unsound, or comparatively unsound meat present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It does not look so bright—the colour would not be altered materially without it was packed very hot, and that they would never do—I can hardly say how it would look if it was packed very hot—such a thing is hardly ever done with good meat—if it got over<lb/>heated from warm weather, it would become green and tainted—I saw nothing of that sort here—there was nothing at all of taint—if meat becomes tainted or putrid it has a smell—there was none here—the fleshy part of the meat was wet as well as the other—if there is disease that wetness would go on increasing the longer it. is kept—it must have been coming on for some considerable time; I can't form an idea how long; far beyond twenty-four hours—I should think the wetness would exist in the animal when living—in animals of that kind the carcase never gets stiff—the fat never gets set—the wetness is a consequence of disease, I should think, while the animal was living—the wetness, which is indicative of disease, would exist in the animal when alive, if it was diseased—I went to the shop of Messrs. Larner and Greatrex because I was sent for by Mr. Greatrex—they have been salesmen in the market for twenty years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am also one of the inspectors of meat appointed by the Commissioners of Sewers—on 16th February, about half-past 8 in the morning, I went to the shop of Larner and Greatrex, in Newgate-market—it is called Tylor' market—it belongs to Mr. Tylor, the brass-founder—my attention was called to a hamper of meat by my brother inspector, Mr. Fisher—there were four quarters of cow-beef in the hamper—I examined it—it was wet, diseased, and totally unfit for human food—it was a wetness from disease; not from rain or anything of that sort—it was wet all through—the word wet has a meaning in the trade—a wet one means a diseased one—when I speak of wet, I mean it was diseased all through the meat—I think that any ordinary person in the habit of seeing meat, much more a butcher, would know that it was diseased; a butcher decidedly would—I did not pull the meat out; it was in such a bad state—there was a cloth over it, and a cloth underneath at the bottom—I lifted up the cloth—supposing the cow had been killed the day before I saw it, I think the marks of disease would exist at the time the animal was killed—I have been an inspector about five years—I had been a butcher before that—the animal had been diseased for a long time, I should think, according to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050050"/>
               <p>appearance of it—it was very bad as meat—it was not fit for human food at all—it was decidedly unwholesome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long ago is it since you were a butcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eleven years—I do not know what the man who sent this meat to the butcher would know about it, but the butcher who killed it would know that it was diseased, no doubt—the butcher who slaughtered it and washed it ought to know much more about it than the man who sent it to him—a person casually observing it, not taking much notice of it, would be decidedly less likely to see its diseased state than the butcher who slaughtered it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer to the City of London—on 16th February last some meat was brought to the Guildhall, where I was at the time, and I was asked to see it, by the inspectors, and I think by the Alderman on the bench—I inspected it—I think it was between 1 and 2 in the day—I had it cut, in order that I might see the condition of the flesh within the animal, and I found that it did not present that firm and solid appearance which good wholesome meat always does; the tissue was flabby, and filled with serum in the place of fat—the fat had degenerated into serum; that is, the whole of the meat had become infiltrated with a sort of serum—there was the absence of fat; but that might arise from many causes—the quantity of serum which had infiltrated the meat, was an undoubted evidence of disease; serum is produced by the degeneration of fat, and also by disease—I noticed particularly that there was on the surface of the lining mem<lb/>brane of the ribs, the pleura, the signs of inflammation—that is what is commonly called the lung-disease—that must have existed during the life-time of the animal, because it is an effusion which can only take place during life; it is a vital act—that trace of the inflammation seemed rather consi-derable—it existed nearly over the whole, if not the whole, surface of the pleura—I can hardly judge whether its unfitness for human food would be evident to an unpractised eye.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you explain to what extent the surface of the pleura was exposed during the time the animal was dressed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was impossible to dress the animal without seeing it—it would be seen by the butcher—it would be on the surface of the ribs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of your experience you have seen a great many cases of diseased meat; was this badly diseased meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very badly diseased, I think.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean unwholesome for food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so; no doubt of it; from my experience I am sure of it—it was as it were impregnated</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion that these marks of disease were existing immediately after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately before—they would show themselves after death, but would exist before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing a person in the country who had never seen pneumonia, or anything of the kind, and suppose this animal had been cleaned by a butcher, and he casually saw it, would he see it at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You are putting a case of a butcher never having seen a case of pneumonia; such a case is hardly possible, but, of course, the man would not know what the effusion on the surface of the chest meant—this has been very common within the last three years—it has been what we term epidemic within the last three years, but sporadic before—if an animal had the seeds of disease, and had been diseased, and the appearances after death were not very great, it would depend on two circumstances whether the carcase soon became corrupt; if the animal had been feeding very recently before death, then the matter charged with the recently absorbed fat, would, in the case of disease, quickly become corrupt; that is, in the case of inflammation—that would be putrefaction, but we must not confound that with disease—I could tell pretty well what advance the disease had made, without seeing the lungs, from the extent of the inflammation on the surface of the pleura, which is the last part to be attacked—no doubt the lungs must have been extensively diseased—the heart and the inner membrane of, the chest are both lined by the pleura—the disease attacks the lungs, and when it has pervaded the lungs then it affects the pleura, and that is the part that is in the carcase—I do not ordinarily expect the pleura to be affected until the lungs have been—the man who cleaned them and took them out would see that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course you have seen putrid and tainted meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this was not at all putrid or tainted; it was very fresh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just explain what is the character of putrid bar tainted meat; is it a discolouration or smell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two things, first, the appearance of it, it is flabby, and it becomes darker coloured—those are the two appearances, and it evolves an unpleasant door, varying from what we call taint merely, up to actual putrefaction—I infer from the appearances I saw on the pleura the existence of disease to a considerable extent, if not of long standing—if I had not seen the pleura at all, I should have said that it was a diseased animal—I could not have said what the disease was; but seeing the pleura affected, I could also say, not only it was diseased, but the character of that disease—I could tell, without the indications of the pleura, that it was diseased, as distinguished from taint—the appearances I saw must have existed some time before death, for this reason, that the tissue of the animal was degenerated; a thing that cannot happen after death; it must have arisen from disease before death—the muscular tissue of a sound animal is firm, dark coloured, well set; that is a condition of health—in disease we find the fibre of the muscles to be weak, never contracting or becoming rigid, and it is infiltrated with the serum infused into it during life; and it is therefore gelatinous and flabby, and pale coloured, which is never the character of putrefaction—that arises from disease in life—in other words these are vital appearances, not <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—they require some vital power to set up and go on, and when the vital power ceases they remain—I think it impossible for a butcher to have had his attention directed to it, if he had any experience whatever, without being at once satisfied that there was disease—I now speak of the</p>

               <p>flesh of the animal, without regard to the tissue—looking at the fleshy part of the animal, there must have been such an indication of disease as a good butcher, with an opportunity of examination, would discover it—I think so decidedly; there is no doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of Messrs. North, Graham, and Co.—I posted the statements of account that we have heard of to the prisoner, constantly, with the names of debtors and the amounts of goods due, and so on—this is one of the blank forms—I posted a letter on 13th March, 1861, directed to Mr. E. Chater, the Swan Hotel, Birmingham—this is a copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a letter book. This contained the following</hi>; "Such buyers as you call on don't know a bargain when they see it; we have desired you more than once most peremptorily to hand us, in every letter, your receipts for the day, and your reasons whereof over-due accounts in the places you have been at are not paid, but we have no list to-day").</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I submit that the evidence does not establish the relation of master and servant between the prosecutors and the prisoner, but that of an agent; although the characteristics of those two relationships sometimes trench very closely upon each other, the difference is to be maintained; there are distinct statutes applicable to servants, and distinct statutes applicable to agents; there is nothing in the case which at all abrogates or increases the terms of the original written agreement, and any duties performed by the prisoner voluntarily or beyond that agreement, cannot be taken into consideration. The question is, does that agreement constitute him a servant or a mere agent; the manner in which, and the place where, he was to perform his business, was left to his own discretion; no action could lie for a breach of that agreement upon the prisoners part; it does not make him a servant, but he stands exactly in the same position as an agent to an Insurance Company; no doubt a person might be a servant, although authorized to exercise a discretion in certain matters, but there is no case of a servant where that discretion is not subsidiary, and subject to the master's orders, which in this case the prisoner clearly was not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COMMON SERJEANT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">If the discretion is not liable to be interfered with authoritatively by the employer, then that is an absolute discretion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think that distinction is a sound one, and fairly arises upon this agreement. In the case of Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Tite, the Jury found the prisoner to be a commercial traveller; a person who might be in one sense a clerk or servant; in this case the prisoner acted simply as an agent, I therefore contend, first, that Hue prisoner is bound by this undertaking, and that alone; and secondly, that upon the foundation of that undertaking he is neither a clerk or servant.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on the same side). To establish this indictment, there must be a contract of hiring and service, and that necessarily supposes that the master has a right to order what shall be done, and also how and when it shall be done, and the right to terminate the contract—that is not pretended here; the agreement amounts to a simple undertaking to do business on commission, the prisoner even having to bear a portion of the bad debts. See Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Carr, Russell, and Ryan, page</hi> 198; <hi rend="italic">Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Tite, Sessions paper, Vol.</hi> 53, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 273; <hi rend="italic">and Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Walker,.</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">Cox Criminal Cases, p.</hi> 1.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

The prisoner travels, collects money, and transmits it to his employers; if that is not a contract of service, I cannot see how inference is to be made stronger. I do not see how this case is to be distinguished from that of a commercial traveller. My friends rely upon the term agent; an agent, after all, has no definite legal meaning attached to it.

                  </hi>. I am inspector and collector at Newgate-market—about half-past 7 on the morning of 29th March last, in consequence of some information from a Mr. Shreeve, I went to the shop of Messrs. Allen and Shreeve—Mr. Shreeve showed me some meat in a hamper, consisting, I believe, of three quarters of cow-beef and the head, tongue, and heart—one fore-quarter was missing—I could not see any signs of the animal having been killed—I saw the skull, and I could not see any indication of its being knocked down in the usual way—the meat was in a very bad state—it was dressed and quartered in the usual way that good meat is quartered, and packed as usual, as a butcher would do it—in my opinion it was the three quarters of an animal that had died—there were indications of disease in the ribs, and also from the appearance of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the indications on the ribs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The usual indications in the pleura that we see on an animal with the lung complaint; and the meat altogether was in a very bad state, totally unfit for human food—what 1 saw in the pleura was indicative of inflammation in the lifetime.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is some term known, I believe, among butchers to indicate meat in that condition; wetness, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there were traces of wetness—it was not so dry as good meat would have been—it was not very wet—inflammation can only be set up in lifetime—if I am light in saying there were indications of inflammation, that goes to show that the animal was diseased in life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to these indications on the pleura, were they visible on slaughtering the animal; is it in a part of the animal that is exposed on opening it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is immediately seen on opening the animal—it do not</p>

               <p>require any dissection of the animal beyond slaughtering; it is quite obvious—the whole condition of the meat presented an appearance of the animal being diseased, and to the eye of a butcher, or any one experienced in meat, they would say directly that it was unfit for human food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you condemned the meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I called in my brother inspector, Mr. Newman, and it was destroyed in the usual way—there was "G. James, Semley," painted on the hamper—the meat was also packed in three cloths, as good meat would be—a calf was pointed out to me as having come in the same hamper—the calf was good meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said something about the meat not being very wet, but not quite so dry as good meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I mean is that I have seen diseased meat wetter than that—it was not so dry as good meat—the state of the animal must have been obvious to the butcher, who opened it—the indications must have presented themselves immediately on the killing and cutting up of the animal—that is my opinion—I know sufficient of it to swear that that would be so—I have frequently been present when an animal has been killed and cut up—I have seen a great many cut up that have had slight inflammation—supposing there to be a slight inflammation of the pleura there would be an adhesion of the lungs to the pleura, and it would also affect what we call the brisket—the fact of this animal being cut into four quarters would not prevent that adhesion being noticed—it is cut across, so that the whole of the ribs would be on the fore-quarter—it would be quite apparent to a butcher—he could not slaughter it without observing it—the inside of the beast must be taken out before it is cut into quarters—it must have necessarily presented itself to the eye of the person who killed it—I should think it is very seldom that a beast is cut up warm and sent off directly—it never is cut up warm—they always let it hang till it gets cold and stiff—I have been a butcher all my life—I was born in the business—I should think that a beast is never cut up warm and sent off at once to the London market—the time which it would be allowed to hang would depend on the season of the year—in hot weather they would send it off sooner than in cold weather—of course, there is a great difference between a bullock in first-rate condition, intended for the west-end market, and a cow in a poor state—there would be a great difference in the meat—the cow would get tainted sooner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And if it were suffering under any disease, that disease would spread itself over the carcase in a shorter time, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not after death—in warm weather the meat would not keep so long good as meat free from disease—Mr. Wace, the proprietor of the premises, saw it before it was destroyed—the prisoner was not communicated with before it was destroyed—it was destroyed the same day—the prisoner had no opportunity of seeing it after it was seized—I am not aware that a bullock is sometimes killed by a knock on the back of the neck—they are generally hit on the top of the skull, by a pole-axe, and that enters into the centre of the brain—that is the usual way of killing beasts in this country—other methods have been tried, but they have failed—I have seen experiments made—a cow is not frequently killed by cutting its throat, not without being previously knocked down—it is either by a stroke on the forehead, or on the top of the head—they try to get at the brain at once—that is supposed to take away sensation—sometimes a butcher might make a mistake and hit it in a wrong place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you see any indication on the head of this</p>

               <p>animal of its having been stunned in any way preparatory to being slaughtered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not—when meat is destroyed it is the usual course to give the salesman a note of condemnation, and he accounts to his principal for the meat, by sending that note of condemnation to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If meat becomes tainted or putrid from bad packing, or from hot weather, what is the appearance it usually presents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Portions of it would become green, and there is a very disagreeable smell—I am quite able to distinguish between taint, or putridity and disease—they are quite dis<lb/>tinct and separate things—I have seen some meat wetter than this was the wetness is always an indication of the animal being in a very advanced state of disease in life—the meat never becomes stiff and dry—supposing an animal is diseased in life, the appearances of disease do not vanish upon its being slaughtered—there would be the indications where inflammation had been—the pleura was not so badly affected here as I have seen it in some cases—the meat altogether was in a high state of inflammation—inflammation of the pleura generally follows disease in the lungs—the disease shows itself: in the lung first, and after it has been there some time it—is shown in the pleura by inflammation—the pleura is easily seen on slaughtering the beast, and the lungs also—the disease in the pleura is the result of the disease in the lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector to the Commissioners of Sewers to the City of London—I examined the meat in question, together with the last witness, on 29th March—I examined it carefully—from my experience I should think it was the meat of a cow that had been diseased, and had died diseased—I do not think it had been killed—it did not present the usual marks—if it had been killed, I have no doubt there was disease in it before death—I think it died from disease; but it was diseased during life, however it came to its death—I have heard the evidence given by Mr. Fisher—I concur in the description he has given of the state of the meat—we could not judge of it so much as if we had had the whole carcase before us—I believe the quarter that was kept away was the one where the disease was more strongly developed—I have reason to suppose, from what I saw of the three quarters, that the other quarter was not free from disease—there were signs of disease on the ribs—I think it was the right fore-quarter that we had—the lungs are sometimes situated on one side and sometimes on the other—they are between the two fore-quarters—the disease shows itself more on the fore-quarters—I have nothing to add to what Mr. fisher has said of the symptoms he saw—it was decidedly unfit for food.</p>

I am a meat salesman in Newgate-market—on the morning of 29th March I received a hamper, containing a calf and three quarters of cow-beef—it came between 6 and 7 o'clock—we generally begin business about 5 or a little before—I know the defendant—he is a butcher at Donhead—I believe that is close to the Semley station—in consequence of the state of the meat when I opened the hamper, I sent for the inspector—he came and condemned it, and gave me a note of condemnation—I sent that in a letter to the defendant—I have from time to time corresponded with him, two or three times a week—I cannot recollect whether I sent two letters—I know one was sent with the condemnation note—I afterwards received a letter from the defendant, dated 14th April—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Donhead, St. Andrew, Wilts, April 14,1861; Messrs.

Q.</hi> About how many carcases might he send? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend on circumstances—during the last three days of the latter week we received from himself and sons very nearly 70 carcases of very superior veal and pork—we have received as much as that on many occasions during what we call the veal season—that generally commences about February, and ends about the latter end of May or the beginning of June—that is the west country veal season—Semley is in the west of England—the carcases come up by the South-Western Line—the veal and pork we got was of a very superior quality—some of it making nearly 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—he is not a sender of beef—I never knew him to send but one carcase of beef before—he chiefly kills veal and pork, not mutton, I think—I believe he consigns entirely to us—I do not think he sends, on an average, one caroase of beef in a twelvemonth—he has sent to the firm to which I belong, for eight years, but altogether he has been thirty years a consignor to the London market—during all the time I have known him and received from him, he has never sent any meat improperly; in fact, we never had to raise a question before about any of his consignments—whenever we have anything brought to us that has the stamp of poverty upon it, we always send it to the inspector, for our own protection—we are not licensed as salesmen—we keep a shop—we are not under any obligation to send for the inspector, but we do so for our own protection, it is an end of all dispute, he is supposed to possess the mind of the case—we send for him whenever there is the least doubt about a carcase—we never had the slightest doubt about any of Mr. James's meat before this—the general practice is to kill a bullock or a cow by hitting it on the star of the forehead, but I have seen scores of beasts knocked down by a blow on the back of the neck, which touches the spinal marrow, and that produces the same effect—I have seen them knocked down in all sorts of ways—they sometimes do it with a pole-axe—we sometimes have carcases of meat sent to the London market that you would not suppose a butcher had had anything to do with—I do not know how calves are killed—I am not a calf butcher—report says that they bleed them—I think it right to say that in the country the almost invariable practice is in what is called scalping a bullock, to cut a large portion of the skull off to go with the hide, because it makes the hide weigh heavier, and in that case the axe hole would be on the hide and not on the head—I did not notice whether this animal came up with the hide on it or not—I did not examine it at all—I saw it was a poor body of beef, and sent at once for the inspector—I did not inquire how it had been killed—the calf which came up in the same hamper was good, and was sold by us and accounted for to the prisoner—that was not cut up in pieces, it was in carcase.</p>

I am medical officer of health to the City of London—I have had considerable experience in the examination of meat I have heard Mr. Fisher, Mr. Newman, and Mr. Wace describe the appearance of the meat in question—assuming them to be correct in the description of the meat, it would no doubt be quite unfit for food, and injurious to human health—it would either at once produce great irritation of the stomach and bowels, producing vomiting and diarrhoea, or it would become absorbed into the system and produce a low kind of fever—I have known death result from it, and have had to inquire into such cases—if there is diarrhoea and sickness the effects are got rid of, if not it is absorbed into the system and generates low fever—I am not alluding to the effects of tainted or putrid meat, but of diseased meat, even when comparatively fresh—the indications of taint or putridity are so essentially different from those of disease, that they cannot be confounded—I think it would be impossible for a person who understood it to make any mistake between the one and the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police, atttached to the Brighton Railway—on the morning of 3d April last, I received a telegraphic message from the witness Capelin; in consequence of which, I went to Deptford Wharf, where Mr. Capelin pointed out to me the place where the truck had stood—close by there, I saw that wheat had been scattered on the ground, and eight or ten yards from there, I found some more had been scattered on the ground; and also some footsteps of a man; at least a large footmark—and from there, I traced it across the yard to a garden wall, immediately at the back of where the prisoners live—that wall is about six feet high from the garden side, but it is level with the top of the company's yard—you have to get down six feet into the garden—there was some wheat scattered inside the garden, and also some footsteps there of a man—from further inquiry I was led to go to the lodging of the prisoners, which is in the top room of the house, No. 10, Grove-street, Deptford—the garden wall is at the back of a row of houses, but a little at right-angles from the prisoner's house itself; but the footsteps went in that direction—it does not belong to the house itself, but there is an opening from that house into the garden—I saw the female prisoner Fling there—I asked her what had become of the wheat that she had had—she said, "I have had no wheat; I know nothing about any wheat"—on looking round the room, in a corner I saw a clothes' basket, and on pulling some things from the top, I found this dish full of wheat in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050073"/>
               <p>the basket—I then said to her, "Where did you get this from?"—she said, The little boy brought it"—I said, What little boy?"—she said, "My little boy"—I then made a further search of a bed that was in the room on the floor, not a bedstead—I lifted up the bottom part of the bed, and under it found this bag of wheat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is about a bushel as near as possible—I then removed the bedclothes; and in the bed I found this bundle of wheat, which is about another peck, tied up in an apron in the bed, covered over with the bedclothes—I asked Fling if it was her apron—she said it was—I asked her how she accounted for the wheat being there—she said the little boy had brought it in—at this time the prisoner Brian came into the room—I asked him if he lived there—he said he did—I told him that I was a police-officer, and that some wheat had been stolen from a truck on the railway last night, and that I had found it here, and asked him what account he could give of it, or wished to give of it—he said, "Last night I came home from work, and was having my tea about half-past 6, when the little boy brought it in"—I did not see the little boy on the premises at that time—I said it was impossible that a little boy could bring this in—he said, "He brought some last night, and some this morning"—I said, "It is also utterly impossible that a little boy could bring it over that wall, as the wall is over six feet high; a little boy could not get up;" if he went more than once, he would have to get up again—the woman then said that the little boy had found it honestly on the line, and had brought it home—I then left them in custody of a police-constable of the M division, and went downstairs, and in the passage adjoining the house, I found the boy—I asked him what his name was, he told me it was Kilty—I then took him upstairs to where the other two prisoners were, and showed him the wheat, and told him what the other two prisoners had said; that he had brought the wheat—he said that a man had told him to bring it home—I asked him how he brought it home, and he said, "A little at a time"—I have compared the wheat found in all these places, and also that in the sack that it was taken from, and that on the ground, and I find that all of it corresponds—there are two peculiar sorts of black seeds among it in each sample, in the bag, the dish, the original sack, that in the basket, and the apron; and I found the same on the ground, and in the original sack—no person is permitted to go on the line except those employed—there are caution boards up—it is utterly impossible that a boy of Kilty's size could get down with anything like the quantity of wheat that was there, or without help it would be next to impossible for him to get up to the truck door, it would be quite six feet high—the whole quantity of wheat here, is, I suppose, a bushel and half a peek; and that littered on the ground, would account foe the remaining portion missing from the sack—two bushels were left in the sack—the proper amount in a full sack is four bushels.</p>

I told my neighbours about it, and said I should chuck it away; but they told me to leave it there.

                  </hi>. I live at Barnes'-alley, Deptford, and am a labourer—on Tuesday night, 5th March, I went to bed about ten minutes to 9—I live with my uncle and his wife and family—they did not go to bed till after that—I was awakened between 10 and 11 o'clock, by a loud noise of kicking at the street door—my uncle opened the window—the prisoner asked for one Sullivan, or Barret—my uncle told him there was no such party there, and that if he did not leave he would give him in charge to the police—the prisoner said that if it was his fortune to come down, he would lay hold of him and knock his brains against the wall—the prisoner was breaking the door—I got out of bed, came downstairs, opened the door, and said, "Is it not a shame for you to be making such a noise at such an unreasonable hour of the night as this; would not it be better for you to be at home and in bed like a decent boy"—the words were scarcely out of my mouth when he struck me in the nose with his fist—my nose bled—I laid hold of him and knocked him through the passage—I knocked him down and fell a top of him, and then he struck me with a knife, here, in the belly—when I found the knife going in, I cried, "Uncle, uncle, take me up"—my uncle was in the passage then, and laid hold of me by the waist and pulled me in doors—the prisoner then made three attempts with the knife at my breast; he struck me with it in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I put up my hand to save myself, and he cut me slightly—I got faint and weak then with loss of blood, and did not know anything till the following morning—I was sent to Guy's hospital—I went there on 6th March, and left on 19th April—the prisoner was under the influence of liquor—I had not had any quarrel with him before that—he was not drunk; I could tell that he had been drinking—I knew him by sight before, but had had no conversation with him, except twice; once last September, and once either before or after that, I do not know which—I saw him there once when my uncle was there—when I found the knife stuck in me at first, I pulled his hand away, and in coming out the knife scraped me slightly towards the hip.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Barnes'-alley, Deptford, and am a labourer—the last witness is a nephew of mine—he lodges at my house—on the night of 5th March, between 10 and 11 o'clock, the prisoner came to No. 2, Telegraph-court—he was knocking at the door; I did not know who was outside or what it was about—I raised the bed-room window, put my head out, and asked him what he wanted there—he said he wanted Michael Sullivan and Barret—I told him they were not in the court at all, and to go away from the door and not to make any more noise, and that if he did not go away I would call out for a policeman and give him in charge—with that I hallooed out for the police as loud as I could ten or eleven times, and as I hallooed he hallooed out the same as me to bother me, so that the police should not hear me—he said that if he found me down he would knock my brains against the wall—I did not see any other person—Michael Collins got out of bed in his shirt, and so did I, and came down after him—the door was locked when I got down—Michael Collins was at the door first, inside; I was just behind him when he had the door open—the knocking continued all through—I saw the prisoner strike Collins as soon as he went outside and asked him to go away from the place—after he struck him Collins caught hold of him, just by the door, and knocked him down, and then Collins hallooed out, "Oh, uncle, he has a knife and he has stabbed me in the belly with it"—he had nothing on then but his shirt, nor had I—I got him in and pulled him up, and the prisoner kept hold of his linen smock which he had outside his shirt—I was outside trying to pull my nephew up again, and I caught hold of him in my arms to get him away—I turned and locked the door and put the bolt firm on it, and then went upstairs and lit a candle—I had then got my nephew in doors, and took him upstairs with me—when I saw the state he was in, the blood running about the room, I got a handkerchief and tied round him, and put him into bed; and I made two attempts to turn round to the clock to take one of the weights off, to knock the prisoner's brains out, but God Almighty put it into my heart not to do it—the prisoner was then outside the door—I did not put him out—he was outside when I got my nephew away and locked the door—he did not go away—there was a water-pail outside the street-door, and he began to knock at the door with it—it had three iron hoops on it, and an iron handle—I wanted to go down then, and Michael Collins hallooed out and said, "I have no one but myself, and you have a family," and he bade me stop in doors, and I did so—I went to the police-station before 7 o'clock in the morning—when the policeman came back with me, my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> had been picking up the staves of the water-pail, which the prisoner had broken in pieces, and she said, "Oh! here is the knife that done the injury"—I saw the policeman take it out of her hands—it was all full of blood, both the blade and the haft.</p>
