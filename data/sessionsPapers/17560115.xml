He said, the man behind me had got it. He turn'd himself about, and threw my handkerchief on the ground; he then ran away, and was taken by a gentleman's servant in St. Mary Axe.

               <p>Sise. No, I did not; but as I was going to take her out of the park, I saw her put forth her hand to the centinel, as though she was going to give him money. The justice was not to be spoke with that night, so I took her to the watch-house at Covent-Garden, and the next morning before justice Fielding, to whom she owned she had pick'd my pocket of something; but could not say how much.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>As I was going through St. James's-park I met with this man and another; they asked me where I was going: I answered, Home. They wanted me to take them with me: I said I could not. Then they asked me if I could take them some where else: I said no, I could not. Then this young man said, if I would let him go and lie with me, he would give me some money. He shew'd me some silver, and desired me to lie down on the grass: I said, no, I would not. He said if I would lie down he would give me some more: then I lay down, and he lay with me. When he had done he called for the other man to come and lie with me: He came, but I would not let him; then he pulled me down, and I call'd out. After that the man that is here said I had rob'd him; but he gave it me to lie with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not lie down with her, neither did I give her any money. I believe my fellow servant was concern'd with her for his 6 d.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On Christmas evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, the prisoner brought this mug to me, and desired I would lend her 15 s. upon it. I took it in my hand, and asked her whose it was: She said, It is mine. I said, Pray how long have you had it: She said, A great while. Who bought it? My husband. What might he give for it ? She said there was some old silver in exchange, so she could not tell the price it cost. She said she wanted but 15 s. to make up some rent, and she would fetch it again next week. Don't you, say'd she, know me? I brought a tea-spoon before. I said I did. I lent her the money, and she went away. The next day about 11 o'clock I read in the Advertiser, '' A silver pint '' mug, marked E. M. M. stole out of the Two '' Chairmen, in Warder-street, Soho.'' I sent my daughter to the house, to desire

M. M. on the handle, and it is very much bruised. I said, Is there any thing else: A wooden bottom, said he. I said, I have your mug. I asked him whom he suspected: He said a woman nam'd Eliz. Davis (a name the prisoner went by) and that he had lost two silver tea-spoons. The prisoner brought me another tea-spoon when she brought the tankard.

He said, Give me some halfpence, I will mark them; and you shall see me lock them up. This was done the 8th of Dec, He gave me the key the next morning when I missed 10 d</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mark?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. Four shillings in halfpence, and 6 d. in farthings. The drawer was always lock'd, and I found it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to the drawer?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. No, never but he lived in the house, and might go into the shop when he would. I concluded, to trust him another day so on Tuesday after we put in 6 s. in halfpence mark'd. The next morning I took them out, and gave them to Mr. Kendal to count them; there were 1 pence halfpenny gone. I had a little before missed a crown piece out of the drawer. Mr. Kendal and I went and brought a search warrant to search all my servants; we took up the prisoner, when the constable told him it was on suspicion of robbing his mistress. Then we took him backwards, and he pulled out his money. Mr. Kendal took up a halfpenny, and said, I'll swear this I marked. In all they found 21 halfpence, all marked; then the prisoner cry'd, and desired me not to take him before a justice. The constable said, Young man how much do you think you have rob'd your mistress of? He said he never rob'd me of any more than about 6 or 7 in half pence. The constable said, How could you rob her, for she says her drawer is always lock'd? He said, if you will go round the counter I will show you. He went and took up the counter and pull'd it up, then put the bolt out, and took the draw out. I had before found the drawer up by so doing, and knock'd them down. We took him before the justice, where he confessed the same and shewed us, by his table, how he lifted the counter up.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What Justice was you before?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. Before justice Trent.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages did you owe him at that time?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. A year and a half's wages were in day hands, and other money to the amount of and odd shillings, that I have paid him since, and him his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had he to rob his mistress of six or seven shillings, when she owed him so much money?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. It was not six or seven shillings, but a great deal of money I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he rob'd you?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. He said he had never rob'd me of any more than about six or seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to receive money for you?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. When I sent him out with a bill he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not use to give change in the shop in a morning?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear that, when you was in bed at the time ?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. He never was trusted to do it. I always confined that to my daughter; no body had the key of that drawer but she and I.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Kendal?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. A great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>S. Pool. He is a master painter; my husband and he were as brothers.</p>
               <p>John Kendal. Mrs. Pool told me she suspected her servant (the prisoner) had rob'd her of a good deal in money at different times. I said why do you suspect him? She said by his dress and the money he spent; and that he took up no wages. I said the best way will be to mark some halfpence, and put them into the till, and by that you'll be able to find out the thief. I marked some on the 8th of December, and look'd them in the till, and gave her the key. The next morning she took them out, and delivered them to me. I counted them over. We missed nine pence and two farthings (he was then gone out of some errand). The next night I marked six shillings worth of half pence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150005"/> and farthings more, and put them into the till. The next morning we missed fourteen pence halfpenny. Then she, I, and Mr. Laybourne went and got a warrant, and took up the prisoner, and taking him backwards, desired him to pull out his money; he took out some from his breeches pocket and laid it in a chair, amongst which were twenty-one halfpence which I had marked the over night. Then Mrs. Pool said, Joseph, how could you rob me who have been so good a mistress to you ? Then he began to cry, and said he never took any more. The constable said you had better confess what you have taken; he said he believed he had taken six or seven shillings in halfpence. I said I wonder'd he never took silver or gold, he said he never did. Then he said he'd shew us, if we would go into the shop, how he got the till open, which he did by lifting the counter up with both his hands to get the bolt clear, then he drew out the till, and shew'd us how he used to take a handful of halfpence promiscuously as they lay. We took him before the justice, where he confessed the same.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any halfpence being put into his pocket?</p>
               <p>Kendal. No, I do not. There could be no such thing, he had them in his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the money have been in the coat pocket before it was in the breeches pocket?</p>
               <p>Kendal. He had not his coat on, that was then above stairs.</p>

            . I served the prosecutrix with goods. I call'd to see her, to know if she wanted any thing in my way; she told me she was rob'd. I went with her and Mr. Kendal to take out a warrant to apprehend the prisoner. We got a constable, who told him he was his prisoner, and took him backwards to search him; then the prisoner pull'd out some halfpence from his breeches pocket, and laid them down in a chair. I saw some of them were mark'd (a parcel of halfpence were produced in Court.) These are the halfpence which were marked, and were amongst those which the prisoner took out of his pocket. I was present before the justice, and heard the prisoner confess there that he believed he had rob'd his mistress of about six or seven shillings in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Douglas. I am constable. On the 10th of December last Mr. Kendal and the other evidence came to me with two warrants, one to search the prosecutrix's house; the other to take up the prisoner for robbing her till. I went along with them to her house, the prisoner was in the shop; Mr. Kendal said that is your prisoner. Then I told the prisoner I had got a warrant against him on a strong suspicion of his robbing his mistress's till; he said God forbid he should do such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him confess anything ?</p>
               <p>Douglas. I saw him take hold of the counter, and lift it up, and it draw'd the nails on each side the till, by which means the till could come out with ease. He said he just put his hand in and took out a handful of halfpence, and then left it as he found it. I ask'd him how much he thought he might rob his mistress of; he said if I would ask her not to take him before a justice, he would return her the money that he thought he had rob'd her of; which he said was about 6 or 7 s. He said his mistress owed him fifteen pounds. She said she would pay him that at any time. These halfpence here have been in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>These halfpence were not in my breeches pocket, they were in a waistcoat pocket of mine (put in by somebody) that had hung up in the shop two or three days.

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Poynting. On the 18th of November, and on the 9th of Dec. the evidence Holmes was brought to our house. The person that brought him asked, if we had lost any handkerchiefs. I went to justice Rickards's, and got a search warrant, and searched the house of one Plump, in Rag-fair, where I was informed they were sold; but I could see nothing of them, neither have I seen them since. The prisoners were taken up the night before, and carried before justice Rickards, who committed them to Newgate, and Holmes to Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners own any thing of it?</p>
               <p>Poynting. No, they did not confess any thing at all.</p>

Shervil ran his hand thro' the paper, and took out a parcel of handkerchiefs, and put them in his apron. This was about 5 or 6 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you and the other at that time?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We were on the other side of the way. Then he gave a whistle, and we went to him. I said, How many handkerchiefs are there? He said, About seven. They went into Plump's shop and sold them; but would not let me go in: so I stood at the door. When they came out Shervil told twelve shillings in his hand, which he said he had for them; out of that he gave me one, and they kept the other eleven themselves. Two or three nights after, as I was going along Tower-Hill with one Barnes, he snatched a sixpenny pye; the pastry-cook ran out and took me; he went to my mother, who told him I was got in a gang of thieves. Then I was taken before justice Rickards, and gave an account of this; and the prisoners were taken up, but they denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Plump live?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He lives in Rosemary Lane, facing Well-close square. I have sold many handkerchiefs and things, which I and others have stolen, to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you they were going to Mrs. Halsey's?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes. They had observed the pane of glass being broke in the day time.</p>

            . I saw the deceased coming up from the workhouse. [she belongs there] as the dray was turning at a corner; the drayman call'd to her to turn back, but she would not. She was about ten foot before the fore-horse. She kept forward, and he could not stop his horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she have avoided the dray in the condition she was?</p>
               <p>Wells. Yes, if she had turn'd back.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pett. Could she hear well?</p>
               <p>Pett. Yes, she had her hearing well.</p>
               <p>Wells. The dray was going down hill, and the cattle were strong; the prisoner call'd to his horses as much as he could to stop, and he pull'd the horse he had hold of; the place being so very narrow, people could not meet a dray as it comes down without running a hazard. She got as far as the dray-man; he clap'd his hands on her shoulder to get her clear if he could, but he could not; the dray took her against her stomach, just as the horses had turn'd the corner, and the dray stop'd against her, and her back drove in a plank of the boards she was drove up against. As soon as the dray was drawn back, she drop'd down, and I saw her carried away for dead.</p>

            . On the 16th of January, between nine and ten o'clock, the deceased came up on the same side the prisoner was on; he was driving his horses, gave her a shove, and said woman where are you going? But she did not stop, but went forward, up to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he shove her?</p>
               <p>A. Littleby. To go from him; he pull'd with the halter and call'd wo! but the horses were going down hill, and he could not stop them; it jamb'd her to the corner of the wall. She had a tin pot in her hand, and when the dray was drawn back, she fell down dead with it in her hand; she never stir'd afterwards, for the dray took her by the breast.</p>

            . The prisoner was going to turn down the gateway; the horses turn'd in very short, it being a very narrow way. I heard him hollow to the woman, and I saw him shove her to clear her, but could not. I don't think there is room for any body to pass a dray there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does that dray belong to?</p>

            . The deceased was my husband. He came home with his forehead full of blood, tied up in a handkerchief, and was not easy all night. I asked him how he came by that hurt, but he would not tell me; this was on Sunday, Dec. 7. He went out the next morning, and return'd about 5 in the afternoon; he then complained his head was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to drink much?</p>
               <p>S. Jolley. He did, more than he should; he was not a sober, regular man. On the Tuesday I found his head was sadly swell'd; he had a cut over his eye, and his eyes were black. I asked him how he came by that: he said he believed it would be his death; and told me it was Mrs. Mathews at the alehouse; tha t he went into her house drunk, and she struck him with a quart pot, and push'd him out at the door upon the ground. I went to her. The maid said, She can't be seen: then I went away. His head swell'd so that he could not see at all on the Wednesday; then I and another woman went to Mrs. Mathews's house, when Mrs. Mathews was sitting by the fire side. I said, I understand my husband was here on Sunday night, and you have used him very ill. The woman said, He is very ill, and if he dies he will lay his death to you. She fainted away, and, when she came to herself, asked me if I had had any advice for him, and sent me to her surgeon, and said she would pay him; the surgeon's name is Hewit, who sent him to Hyde-park infirmary. Mrs. Mathews paid 2 chairmen for carrying him there. He was carried on the Wednesday night, and died on the Saturday following.</p>

               <p>Crambourn. There are steps coming out of the door, and he ran down, and was a considerable time before he fell; he fell with his head near the channel, and his face to the ground: when he got up, his face was all over dirt.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Kren. I live in the Hop-Yard. I went to see the prisoner with the deceased's wife. We told her that Mr. Jolley was in a very bad way. She said she did push him out of doors, but did not think any thing bad would have attended that: she said, when he went in again she wash'd him, and said, she was very sorry for it, and fainted away: when she came to herself, she said if he died she should not desire but to be hang'd for him, for she should never enjoy a happy hour. She ordered me to go and fetch surgeon Hewit to attend him: I went, and he gave me a note to send the deceased to the hospital. I carried the note to Mrs. Mathews, and she ordered a chair for the deceased, and gave me the money to pay for it.</p>

The day after this accident happened I saw the deceased, when he said he had been at the woman's, at the Angel and Crown in St. Martin's lane; that she hit him with a quart pot, and push'd him out of doors; that she hit him once or twice with the pot, and that he was not able to work. He used to work with me. I saw him again on the Tuesday morning: he then could not hold up his head at all. I never saw him after that till he was dead.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Mathews. The deceased came into our house on Sunday in the afternoon, and made a great noise; my master was then dying. My mistress was up stairs, who came down and said, Pray Mr. Jolley don't make such a noise, for my husband is dying. Jolley was very drunk, and said, Whenever the constable dies his soul will go to hell. My Master was constable. She said get out of the house, for I cannot bear those words. He said, You are a Welch woman, let me have a halfpenny worth of gin. My mistress said, Pray go out: He refused to go out, upon which my mistress took him to the door, and shoved him out, after which I saw him fall down; if he had been sober he would not have fallen down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a quart pot in your mistress's hands ?</p>

I attended the deceased there; I found a small wound on the fore part of his head, on which was a sticking plaister, which was a very bad thing, and under that was a quantity of matter; there was a very great swelling and inflammation all over his face, and the fore part of his head. After he was dead I examined the wound: it did not go so far as the skull. I opened the head: there was no fracture on the skull, nor any kind of contusion. I examined the durn &amp;c pie meter of the brains: they were not at all affected; I thought they look'd a little red, but not inflam'd: upon the whole, I do not think the blow he receiv'd was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would have died so soon if he had not received that wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkins. No, I think he would not. He had not been properly taken care of by a surgeon, and I understood he drank hard, which made the wound worse; and the sticking plaister did him harm.</p>

The prisoner came down stairs, and said to him, Dear man go out, for my husband is dying: he would not. She held the door in one hand, and shoved him out with the other, and he, being in liquor, fell down; had he not been in liquor he would not have fell.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Lenard. At Mr. Rose's in Wood-street. There were three persons standing in the street, of which the prisoner was one. I received a blow from one of them, as I was passing, on my forehead, which stunned me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the three persons gave you that blow?</p>
               <p>Lenard. It was the prisoner at the bar. I was going to run away, and he ran after me, and stab'd me in the head with a knife; then he cut me on the face, and the blood ran prodigiously. He thought to cut my throat; but I put down my chin, and received the cut thereon; then I went to hold his hand, and he cut my finger. He had two large long wounds, one on his chin, the other on his left cheek, and another on his finger. I never let go my hold of him till assistance came.</p>
               <p>Q. By what part did you hold him?</p>
               <p>Lenard. By his collar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Lenard. I could not understand what he said, I not knowing English: he stabb'd me on the shoulder, and cut me on the of my coat; but that did not reach my is in court. I call'd out for assistance, and a man came and bid me hold him fast. We secured him, and carried him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any money?</p>
               <p>Lenard. I had 33 s. 6 d. in silver, and half a guinea in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket was it in?</p>
               <p>Lenard. It was in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a purse or loose?</p>
               <p>Lenard. It was loose in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became on it?</p>
               <p>Lenard. I can't take upon me to say the prisoner took it, there being 3 of them. I was so disturbed in my brains, that I do not know which took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that one of the three did take it?</p>
               <p>Lenard. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other two men?</p>
               <p>Lenard. When the man came to my assistance the other two ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came to your assistance?</p>
               <p>Lenard. I don't know his name; I never saw him in my life before. That night at 12 o'clock I was carried with my wounds to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light?</p>
               <p>Lenard. It was not light, nor yet quite dark; but if I were to see I should to her.</p>
               <p>Q. if you first laid of him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150010"/>Lenard. The first blow I received was with a stick on my head; I went to escape from them, upon which the prisoner stab'd me on the head. I seeing myself in danger turn'd round, and laid hold of his collar, and never let go till assistance came.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Where was you when you was rob'd, in a house or street?</p>
               <p>Lenard. In the street.</p>

               <p>Lenard. They were men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two other men attack you?</p>
               <p>Lenard. I cannot be capable of giving any account of that, being so full of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the constable at the watch-house?</p>

            . I came home to my own house in Woolpack Alley, in Houndsditch, and was pulling off my shoes to go to bed. I heard a great noise at my door; and I heard in the German language call'd out, O Lord, shall I die such a miserable death?</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat it in the language he spoke it.</p>
               <p>Moses. [He did.] I did not care to go out. I heard a second time in the same language, O Lord, Almighty God, must I die such a miserable death, and nobody will come and help me! Then I came down and open'd the street door. There were the prisoner and the Dutchman lying on the ground, and two men standing by them; the two men were beating him with sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sticks?</p>
               <p>Moses. No, it was very dark, I did not. I began to speak to them, and said gentlemen, you had better go off, and not to murder the poor soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was uppermost, the prisoner or the Dutchman ?</p>
               <p>Moses. The prisoner was uppermost. One of the two men said blast your eyes, bare him through. Then I went in and shut the street door, and peep'd thro' a place that is broke in the door, and saw them pull the Dutchman about a yard and a half from my door to a little alley. Then the Dutchman call'd out again in his language Is there no body in the world can help me? Then I took my opportunity and ran out of my house and call'd out fire and murder, and with this great cry of mine the other two men ran away. I ran a little way; when I came back again the prisoner and Dutchman were still lying on the ground, the prisoner continuing to be uppermost. I ask'd what was the matter? The Dutchman said dem people rob me of my meony, and before I lose my moony, I lose my life. Then I took the prisoner off the Dutchman's body, and call'd to the Dutchman in Dutch, and said you must help me, for I shall not be able to carry him away. The Dutchman said in his language I am so barbarously used, I am not able. I said for God's sake help, or I am a dead man as well as you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Dutchman very bloody?</p>
               <p>Moses. All his face and every part of him were all over blood; he could not see me for blood. Then he took the prisoner by one hand, and I by the other, and we carried him to the constable at the watch-house. I saw a pistol in the watch-house, but did not see the prisoner deliver it.</p>

            . I am constable. I was standing at my door, which is in Aldgate high street, opposite the watch-house, a little before ten at night. I heard a noise of a great many people coming from towards Houndsditch. It being my watch night, I ran over to the watch-house. The prosecutor and the last evidence brought the prisoner arm in arm. The prosecutor was exceeding bloody, I never saw a man so bloody to be alive before, and his cloaths all over dirt. I asked the prosecutor how this came; he told me in English as well as he could. Presently after came a Jew or two that understood his language, and they interpreted to me. I believe I ask'd him twenty times if he was positive as to the prisoner; he said he was very sure, for he never let him go from the time they were on the ground together. My servant

               <p>Terry. He did, He lived but a few doors from me.</p>

               <p>Terry. I saw him fumble with their coats close together, but had no jealousy of any thing then, so did not observe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Terry. I have known him between four and five years; he lived in Whitechapel, in the Butcher-row, he is a butcher by trade. About a minute after my lad was gone out, my wife came in frighted almost out of her wits, and said is not this a pretty fellow to give your servant a pistol. I took and look'd at it; the prisoner said, that is my pistol. I searched the prisoner but found nothing upon him. We took him before Mr. Alderman Cockayne, and he committed him.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I and another man had only three pints of beer.</p>

               <p>H. Tindal. I sell fruit and fish. My husband, my child, my grand-child, and I, were drinking at the Angel, at the bottom of Devonshire-square shops, at pretty near 9 o'clock yesterday was a week: We had 3 pints of beer. My husband is a soldier, and in an ill state of health: He said, I wish you would go home and make the bed, for I am very ill. At that time I saw the Dutchman telling a parcel of money on the corner of the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of money was it ?</p>
               <p>H. Tindal. To the best of my knowledge it was most of it silver; there might be half a guinea in gold, but I think there could not be more. He had a little pipe in his mouth. I thought him to be a Jew selling money on his sabbath. He said something like forty, which I took to be 40. He swept it off the table with both his hands, and put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What pocket did he put it into?</p>
               <p>H. Tindal. I can't tell which pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might there be of it ?</p>
               <p>H. Tindal. There was a good bulk; there were above 20 s. in silver. After that I went home and made my bed, and came back to the alehouse as usual. Coming through the polls I met

               <p>A. Woolf. I lived over her head five weeks before that. I returned to the alehouse, and drank a pint of beer out with the young man, and then went home directly.

Watts happening to come, I said to Boswell what do you want here? he said I am come to see you. Boswell said to the Dutchman d - n your eyes, I have got none of your money; the Dutchman said I want my money, my money, he had a stick in his hand and lifted it up to Boswell, who was stooping down; he said let him beat on, let him beat on. The Dutchman struck Boswell with a stick as he had one leg in the alley and the other on the threshold of the door; he beat till the stick broke. Boswell was still stooping, I wonder'd what it was for; at last I saw him take a knife out of his breeches pocket, which, I'll assure you, I thought was a cutlass or a hanger, I saw it glisten; so I and the other young woman ran out at the back door.

               <p>Palmer. I am, but I have not lived with my wife for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I had been drinking a little cheruping cup, and they pick'd me up. I ask'd the way to the Old Bailey, they said they would shew me; they took me to a house; then I gave Cleverton a shilling to fetch some beer; she said the mistress of the house would not suffer beer to be brought in without sixpence for the use of the room. I was not concerned with either of them; they went to tye my hands, and got a handkerchief and struck me with it after they had pull'd down my breeches. I said, I did not like that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pewters. I attended at my Lord-Mayor's with Cleverton after she was committed. She said she would endeavour to find out the person that pawned the watch, if he would give her directions where she should send it to him.</p>
               <p>Cleverton's defence. I met the prosecutor on Ludgate Hill, and carried him to the house of Mrs. Williams, a disorderly house in Stonecutters-Alley; he paid sixpence for the use of the room; he had no beer. He ask'd us if we had any rods ? We said no; and if he would have any he must pay sixpence for them. This other young woman had a handkerchief, which she tied a knot in; he said she was a fool, and did not know how to tye a knot to flog a person with; he took it and ty'd 2 more knot in it; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150018"/> as he had no money, he gave me his watch to pawn, and when I went he kept Gray, and would not let her go.</p>
               <p>Gray's defence. I met the prosecutor and Cleverton on Ludgate-Hill; he ask'd me to go with them. We went to Mrs. Williams's house, and he gave Cleverton the watch whilst I was flogging of him; and when I had obliged him, he said you bitch, where is my watch? I said, did not you give it the young woman to pawn. This man keeps a very disorderly house in Bishops Court, in the Old-Bailey.</p>

I was servant to Mr. Lee on the 12th of March last; on that day, between five and six in the evening I had taken in part of those goods, which had hung up at the door, and laid them across the counter. The great coat was mine. I step'd out at the door to speak to a country customer for a little time, and when I came in again the goods were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been gone out?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. Perhaps it might be half an hour. We advertised the goods with two guineas reward. The Saturday morning Mr. Welch the high constable call'd on me and said, I fancy we have got some of your goods; if you will come to Mr. Fielding's about ten o'clock, you may see them. We went there, and there we saw them. I knew them well, being mark'd with my own hand. There were four articles not found, that is, my coat and three other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner taken then?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. No, he was not. Cain turn'd evidence, and declared the whole affair.</p>

               <p>John Cotteridge. I was coming along the Strand one day, and the prisoner overtook me in a poor shabby condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Cotteridge. I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Cotteridge. It was about 6 weeks ago: he asked me to give him some drink. I asked him how he came in that shabby dress: he said his brother allow'd him but a trifle a week; and he had got a note that he had found, since his wife was dead, in a snuff-box, from one Hawkins, that lived in such a place, and he could not get the money. I said I knew the man, and if I can be of any service to you, to see the note paid, I will. He said he would bring the note to me, which he did, to my house, the Tuesday before Christmas-day. I bid him go to the Three Tuns, and said I would come to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you the note ?</p>
               <p>Cotteridge. He did, and I gave it him again. I went to him and said, Now I will go to Mr. Hawkins. Said he, I will go along with you, and shew you his house. We went, he shewed me the house; then I went in, and he stay'd in the street. Mr. Hawkins was in his shop. I said, Mr. Hawkins here is a note fell into my hands, and I desire you would look upon it. He did, and say'd, This is not my hand writing, this is one Curry's writing, an attorney, that was in the Fleet. Said he, This note has been brought to me twice before, and I am sorry that you should be the messenger to bring it again. I have satisfied the original about a year and an half ago, and, if you will step up stairs, I will shew you my receipt of all demands for this note. I went up, and he shew'd me it, and also a copy of this note. He shew'd me the original note: I compared it, and found there was but one letter different. Then I began to tell him how this came about. He said there were some dealings between the prisoner's wife and he. I said, he tells me he found this note in a snuff-box. He said He is a rogue, But I should have told the court I asked the prisoner before, how this note was given, what valuable considerations he had for this note; because it is Value received: He told me he had sold his estate that lay at a place call'd Ramsey, in Hampshire, to Hawkins, and Hawkins gave him this note for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150020"/>Q. When did he tell you this?</p>
               <p>Cotteridge. This he told me in the first conversation. I had with him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Hawkins give you any account how this note came to be given?</p>
               <p>Cotteridge. Mr. Hawkins told me he purchased this thing on the 1st of May, 1754, and after it was all finish'd, the receipt was made, and he paid him his money. Then I said, How came this to pass, if you paid him all the purchase money in the year 1754 (which was on his receipt). What, did he write this himself, or Curry? Said he, Curry was a prisoner in the Fleet, and so was the prisoner; and Curry was going out once on a day rule, and Brinkworth desired him -</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by when he and you had this conversation?</p>
               <p>Cotteridge. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you must not give an account of it. It is not proper evidence.</p>
               <p>Cotteridge. After I came back from Mr. Hawkins's, the prisoner came to my house. I said, Are not you a villain to send me with a forg'd note? He said, It is the Tentical note that I had for the purchase money, and I'll swear to it. Then said I, You'll be hang'd for it; for I verily believe it is not Mr. Hawkins's hand writing; for I have compared the notes, and the writing is not alike: and another thing is, there is a receipt in hall which the prisoner denied, and swore he would have his money. I told him Hawkins will be here in a day or 2, and if you will call on me just after Christmas, Hawkins will be here, and I will see you both face to face, and I'll keep the note the while. Hawkins came. I believe it was the Sunday after Christmas day. The next day the prisoner met me in Stone-Cutter-Street, and said, D - n you, what do you mean, you are going to sell me. I said, Call on me to morrow, and I will go with you to Mr. Hawkins's house, and then you may take and burn the note, or do what you please with it; I'll see you face to face. I went: when I came there Mr. Hawkins desired me to walk out to the sign of the Golden-Lion. The prisoner soon came, and was sent to me there. I said, I am imformed they have got a warrant against you for that note; if it is a right note you need not be afraid; but, if it is a false one, you have cause to fear. He said he did not care a farthing for it; for it was the identical note he had of Hawkins. Presently the constable came in with a warrant, and he was taken before justice St. Lawrence. There he desired to see the receipt in full, which was produced, and the original note after that; he beg'd pardon, and said he was sorry.</p>

               <p>Harris. I never saw him write this letter R in Henry in my life. I don't apprehend it is like his writing in any shape.</p>

               <p>Q. to Harris. Do you know any thing farther concerning this note?</p>
               <p>Harris. On the 28th of Dec. in the afternoon, Mr. Hawkins desired me to take a walk along with him to Mr. Cotteridge's, to enquire after the prisoner at the bar. We went to a house in the neighbourhood for that purpose, and when the prisoner came, I told him I had got a warrant against him. We took him before justice St. Lawrence.</p>

               <p>HE said he would swear to the note, and that it was Mr. Hawkins's hand writeing.

He shewed him the original receipt, and said, Pray is not this your own hand writing? He owned it was, and seem'd a great deal concern'd; after which he pull'd Mr. Hawkins by the coat, and desired him to release him, when Mr. Hawkins told him it was not in his power.</p>

            . On the 11th of Dec. last I was with the prisoner in a lodging in George-alley, near the Fleet-market. She said they were her lodgings; but I found afterwards they were not. She took my watch from out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner that took it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Because the watch was found upon her; and I took particular notice of her person, to know her again; and I had been in no body's company but her's when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of which pocket did she take it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. She took it out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when you found your watch with her?</p>
               <p>Taylor. In her lodgings in Black-boy-alley, where we took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible at the time you lost it that she was the person that took it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Because when I went into her company I felt in my pocket to see if I had it, and I had it; but when I parted from her I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you parted with her was it that you missed it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I missed it just as I came out at the door, and then I thought she was behind me. I turned about, and asked the woman of the house if she knew where she was gone: the woman cry'd, and said, I hope you have not lost your watch. I said, I have. She said, Did not you see her whisper to me: I said, I did not observe it. She said, She whisper'd me, and said, He has got a watch, and asked me if she should take it, or not: I said, No, don't. I and my acquaintance followed her into Black-boy-alley.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150023"/>Q. Had you an acquaintance with you when you went into her company ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He went to see the man of the house, and was talking to him while I went out of doors with the prisoner to her lodging, as she call'd it. Then I went and told my friend of it, and he and I went to Black boy alley, where we went into a house, and asked for such a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she direct you where to find her?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No. We went up stairs, where we found the prisoner in bed with another woman. She got out of bed. I said, You have got my watch: She said, I know nothing of either you or your watch. I said, I know that you are the woman who took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. We searched the bed, and found it conceal'd under the ticking of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I was. After the watch was found I left it with the constable; and she was carry'd to the watch house, and the next day before a magistrate, and was there charg'd with stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did she make to that ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. She said I gave it her because I had no more money; but that was false: for I took it out of my fob, and put it into my waistcoat pocket, and did not know that she was sensible of my having a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not leave that watch with me for a crown?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, she was contented with what I gave her, which was what she asked.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Only the change that I had out of a sixpence, when I paid for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I am an apprentice to Mr. Car, a watch-gilder, in Little Britain.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether, when I was in the publick house, he did not beckon me out, and say, he wanted to pawn his watch, and I said to him, No, don't go to pawn it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. That is all false. She shew'd me the way to that house, at which I never was before.</p>

            . I am the constable. About 1 o'clock on the Thursday morning, the 11th of December, the prosecutor's friend came to me to the watch-house, and told me an acquaintance of his had lost his watch. I said, Do you know where the person is that took it? He said he believed she was in Black-boy-alley. I went with him, and took assistance with me, to a house there. We found the prisoner and another woman in a bed together. I said to the prosecutor, Do you know whether either of these is her? He hesitated a little, and made them get up. As she was dressing herself, he said, This is the woman, meaning the prisoner. I asked her where the watch was: she said she knew nothing of it. When they were both got up, by our shaking the rugs about on which they lay, out tumbled the watch. The prosecutor said, If that is my watch my name Thomas Taylor is on it; which we found to be true. Produced in court, and deposed to. I carried her to the watch-house, and from thence to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Harrow. She said he pledg'd the watch with her for some consideration.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was in a publick house where were this young man and his fellow apprentice. I had seen him several times in that house. He said, Betty, how do you do? I said, But indifferent. He said, Will you drink any porter ? I sat down, and drank part of two pots of porter with him; after that be beckoned me out to the door: when I came there I said, What do you want with me? He said, I want to go home with you, if you are agreeable: I said, I am if you are. Accordingly he went home with me. He had but one sixpence in the world when he was in the alehouse, and that he spent in two pots of porter. He said to the woman of the house where I lodge, My dear I have got no money, but I'll leave my watch in pledge with you for a crown. I said, What business have I in your company if you have got no money? He said. He would leave his watch. I asked the woman if I should take it. She said, Yes. Then he gave it into my hand. This was about 8 or 9 o'clock. About 12 o'clock he came and took me out of bed, and charged me with the robbery. There were three women in the house where I lay, for which reason I put the watch between the sacking and the tick of the bed. They startled me out of my sleep, and talk'd about a watch. I said, What watch? He said, The watch you rob'd me of. I said (before the constable ) he had left his watch with me for a crown.</p>

               <p>Q. to constable. Did she say so when the prosecutor demanded the watch of her?</p>
               <p>Constable. No, my lord, she denied to me that she knew any thing of the watch.</p>

               <p>Fell. I did; at about the latter end of that month, or the beginning of December, I gave him a coat and waistcoat to embroider, and it was done and brought home to my house; the last I know of him might be the Jan. or Feb. after that; he was paid his money, and I never employed him afterwards. I remember when I sent for him to do them, he came and undertook it, and left me a printed bill which expressed his name, what sign he lived at, the street, and trade of an embroiderer: to the best of my remembrance it was a copper-plate.</p>

All persons indebted to the said bankrupt, or that have any of his effects, are not to pay or deliver the same but to whom the commissioners shall appoint, but give notice to Mr. Goostree, attorney, in Sherrard-street, near Golden square.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cheshire. This was publish'd in the London Gazette, on Saturday the 26th of April last.</p>

               <p>She takes it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Wychart. I remember a copy of this notice being put upon the dining-room door. I had twice notice of it before it came.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that delivered to you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wychart. I can't tell the time, but it was deliver'd to me by this gentleman (pointing to Mr. Cheshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the date of it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wychart. It is dated the 24th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cheshire. Look and see which were the days appointed for the commissioners meeting.</p>
               <p>Cheshire. The Days were the 2d and 9th of May, and the 10th of June following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the commissioners meet at Guildhall on all these days?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. They did; I was present at the meetings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Thompson surrender himself upon either of these days?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. No, he did not; and the commissioners said till past 12 o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any excuse sent by him for his not appearing?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Goostree. Had you any notice sent to you for enlarging the time?</p>
               <p>Mr. Goostree. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cheshire. Had you any petition for longer time?</p>
               <p>Cheshire. If there had been any I should have noticed it, and inserted it in the Gazette.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was taken into custody and knew nothing of the statute of bankrupt being taken out against me; what effects I had I surrender'd up. I have been in the north of Scotland and had no knowledge of this notice. I have had nothing to subsist on, either victuals or drink. I was put into New-prison this day is a month, and there were strict orders given that I should not see or speak to any body while I was there. I had not liberty to set pen to paper.</p>

            . The deceased was a messmate of mine; about a quarter of an hour before he left our ward I had got a pot of beer, he ask'd me to let him drink; he drank, and then went down into the common hall; in about a quarter of an hour, one Townshend, another messmate of ours, and I, were called; we did not know for what, but went into the common hall, where we were told our messmate was lying on his back, and were desired to take care of him; he lay with his head against the wall, and could not speak. I helped him up upon Townshend's back, who carried him to his bed, and laid his body in it with his feet out; in about half an hour after, we heard him groan very much; the last witness's husband said, he did not think it proper to let him lie alone, then we went and put him quite in bed, and covered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150028"/> him over; we sat up with him that night and try'd to feed him with a pewter spoon, and he bit it almost in two; the next day we try'd the same; the 3d day we sent for Mr. Blackden a surgeon, who came; I had cut the hair from off the back part of the deceased's head, the surgeon lanced the place; there was a great deal of corrupted blood came out. Mr. Akerman came and said he was very sorry we did not let him know of this before; he sent him wine and sack-whey, which I gave him as he wanted it: the day before he died he came to his senses; as I was feeding him with sack-whey, he beg'd I wou'd give him the cup in his own hand, and said, I pray God to restore me to my former health and I'll pray for you; I have something particular to say to you. At that time I was called out; after I came in again, he said, pray sit down, I want to speak to you: then he said, liquor has indeed been my ruin. These were all the sensible words he spoke.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether he had not a fall some time before that in the ward, and lay for dead, and even lost his hearing?</p>
               <p>Dent. He had a fall before that by another man, and never had his hearing till his death; I was present when he had the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before ?</p>
               <p>Dent. That was near a month before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he well recover'd of that?</p>
               <p>Dent. He was, in all respects, except his hearing; he eat and drank, and appeared as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you believe I did it to hurt the man or no?</p>
               <p>Dent. I was not by when it was done, but don't think he intended to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blackden. I am a surgeon; on the 22d of December last, a messenger came to me from Newgate, and informed me that a poor debtor had had a fall, and had not spoke-since; I went and found a man lying on his back, senseless and speechless. I found a swelling on the back part of his head, and suspecting the skull to be fractured, laid it open to the skull, and found it fractur'd; I dress'd the part and took my leave of him: this was about 2 in the afternoon. On the Monday I waited on him again about 7 o'clock, and thought him somewhat better. On Tuesday, between 7 and 8 I went again; the person that sat up with him told me he had taken some sack-whey in the night, and had spoke something; I went to him that same evening again, and found him dying.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take to be the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Blackden. Undoubtedly that fracture on his skull.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend that fracture could be done a month before?</p>
               <p>Blackden. No, it could not; it was a new fracture.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>The deceased came down to the gate, calling me ram's-head, goat's-head and buck's-head. I said, Prithee Mr. Gresham, let me alone, if you will not let me alone to beg, beg for yourself. I thought he came with an offer to strike me; I clap'd my hand upon his shoulder and pushed him from me, that he should not strike me. I had no more intention to hurt him than I have to hurt your lordship now; he went from me about 3 or 4 yards, and stagger'd, and fell; if he had not been in liquor he cou'd not have fell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. I asked the evidences that saw it, they both told me it was not a blow, but a shove. The deceased had but one hand (which I observe the witnesses have not mentioned) or possibly he might have saved the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner to Dent. Am I of a quarrelsome disposition, or otherwise ?</p>
               <p>Court. If you can't answer that question without hurting the prisoner, you had better say nothing.</p>
               <p>Dent. I have done, my Lord.</p>

I sent for the prisoner, he came again, and said he had found where the case of instruments were pawn'd for a guinea and a half, and if I wou'd give him that money, he'd go and fetch them for me. I gave him a guinea and half; he said, if they were not mine, he wou'd return me the money; he went and return'd the same day with them; then I sent for a constable to know how he came by them; after which, he gave me a guinea and two shillings again.

            . On the 17th of Dec. the prosecutor sent for me, I am constable: when I came, he shew'd me a case of instruments and said to the prisoner, how came you to do it? He said, he believed the devil was in him, and hoped Mr. Row would not prosecute him, saying he was very sorry for what he had done, and own'd he had taken them, divers times; and before the justice's clerk he own'd the same, though before the justice he wou'd not speak a word.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. At the time he gave you the money back, did you promise you wou'd not prosecute him?</p>
               <p>Row. No; I told him I wou'd prosecute him; he said, he hoped I wou'd not.</p>

               <p>I came into Mr. Row's house that day, he had given us a commission to get a person to take it; so I brought a man, we look'd over the house, and he seemed to like it; this case of instruments lay in a corner cup-board, which was open. I look'd in the case and found a pair of scissors; I took them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150030"/> out and cut my nails, and after that went to put them down in a hurry, and put them in my pocket, and away I went with the man. Some time after Mr. Row sent to my lodgings for me: I went, and he told me he had lost a case of instruments; then I said, Don't you make yourself uneasy, for undoubtedly you will have them again. Said he, If I get them again I don't care what I pay for them, and nobody shall come into any trouble about them. I asked him if he would let me have a guinea and half, and said I thought I could get them out of pawn. He gave me a guinea and half, and said if I would bring them again I should not be hurt. I brought back the case at the hour appointed, and gave him a guinea and 2 s. back: then a soldier drew his sword in the room, and they secured me immediately. They carried me to justice Withers. I never owned any thing. I believe Mr. Row sent me word twenty times, that if I would but send him the 8 s. 6 d. due to him, he would not hurt me. He came once to the gaol, and gave me a shilling.</p>

On the 13th of Dec. in the morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, when my husband and I were in bed, she came to the bed-side, and took his breeches from off a chair, and carried them into the dining-room; she then brought them again, and lay'd them on the chair. I was awake at the time.</p>

               <p>A. Hopley. She instantly returned. She then came to the feet of the bed, and took off his coat, and carried that into the dining-room; she presently brought it back, and laid it where she took it from.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the waistcoat in the coat?</p>

               <p>A. Hopley. I can't say whether it was or not. As she was spreading the coat smooth as she found it, I stir'd in the bed, as though awaking: She shrunk behind the curtain for some time; then she softly went out of the room, and stay'd till the usual time she used to come up and call Mr. Hopley; then he awaked directly and answered her.</p>
               <p>Q. When he awaked did you acquaint him with what you observed?</p>
               <p>A. Hopley. I did. He got up in about half an hour after that; he went down stairs, and sent for a person to talk to her.</p>

            . When I awaked in the morning, on the 13th of Dec. my spouse related the thing of the maid's having been in the room, as she has now. We both suspected she wanted the key of the buroe out of my pocket. I had put the money out of my pocket over night, except a few halfpence, but whether there were any missing of them I know not. I had before missed money, and that very week a guinea; and the day before 1 s. 6 d. out of a drawer which was lock'd in my warehouse. I thought proper to send for Mr. Newton, when I got up, to hear her examined: She was call'd into a room in my warehouse: he examined her, and she denied every thing; then we open'd her box, in which we found some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150031"/> the things mentioned in the indictment. After she was committed she sent for her trunk, which was lock'd. I thought it to be empty; but finding it heavy, I refused to send it till it was opened. I had it broke open, and in it we found a deal box, and things conceal'd in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What things?</p>
               <p>Hopley. The following goods:</p>
               <p>Twelve yards of silk</p>
               <p>Eighteen yards of paduasoy ribbon</p>
               <p>Forty-one yards of other paduasoy ribbon</p>
               <p>Seven yards of taffaty</p>
               <p>Thirty-one yards of sattin ribbon</p>
               <p>Fourteen yards of figured ribbon</p>
               <p>Eleven yards of narrow ditto</p>
               <p>Twenty-five yards of narrow shaded ribbon</p>
               <p>Four yards of silk lace</p>
               <p>One yard of black gause</p>
               <p>Six yards of black silk remnants</p>
               <p>One yard of black sattin</p>
               <p>Three yards of figured silk</p>
               <p>Two yards and half of cheque gause</p>
               <p>Four pair of scarlet garters</p>
               <p>Two yards of plain gause</p>
               <p>Six ounces and half of sewing silk</p>
               <p>Eight ounces of black and coloured silk</p>
               <p>Twelve yards of silk</p>
               <p>One yard of Mechlin lace</p>
               <p>Sixty-nine yards of shalloon</p>
               <p>Thirty-six yards of black love ribbon</p>
               <p>The last I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you swear to all the rest?</p>
               <p>Hopley. I can to the first article, the 12 yards of silk, the 18 yards of paduasoy ribbon, and a quarter of a pound of scarlet thread; I can't to the others, but there were private marks to those I swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business ?</p>
               <p>Hopley. I am a haberdasher. These several things were found in a deal box, concealed within her trunk. This trunk was in the garret where she lay. At first she said she could not find the key of it; but when she found we would break it open, then she open'd it; after which, when we found the deal box in it, she owned in the compter, that when she went up stairs to dress herself, to go before a magistrate, she took the box from under the bed there was a padlock upon it) and locked it in the trunk, and took the key to prison with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found in the trunk at the first opening it?</p>
               <p>Hopley. There was velvet, and half a yard of black sattin, 3 gause handkerchiefs, a piece of shalloon, 2 yards of muslin, and a ruffled shirt, on which she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the shirt?</p>
               <p>Hopley. I know that is mine by the number on it, it being missing, and she owning she took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Hopley. I heard her say all the things mentioned were mine, and that she was exceedingly sorry for what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say this?</p>
               <p>Hopley. She said this in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the first search?</p>
               <p>Hopley. On the 13th of Dec. at the time I found the things upon which she was committed to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who unlock'd the trunk?</p>
               <p>Hopley. She herself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after her opening the trunk was it that she was sent to the compter?</p>
               <p>Hopley. Not till the best part of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the goods at different times?</p>
               <p>Hopley. It was impossible to miss every individual; but I missed some.</p>
               <p>Q. When might you lose the twelve yards of black silk?</p>
               <p>Hopley. I cannot say; but I lost it within the time she was my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose the 18 yards of paduasoy ? Was it at a different time from the other?</p>
               <p>Hopley. I can't exactly say at what time. To be sure there must be a good deal of time in collecting all these things together.</p>

            . I was the constable. Mr. Hopley sent a servant to me on Saturday morning, the 13th of Dec. When I came there I was desired to go up into the dining-room: there was Mr. Hopley and the prisoner at the bar. He said, I am very sorry to trouble you thus; but I must give you charge of my servant (meaning the prisoner) she has rob'd me. There lay some handkerchiefs and gloves, and other things, on the floor. He was looking at them, and said, These are my property, she has own'd it. I said, You base hussy, have you done this ? Yes, she said, I have, and they are my master's property; I have, continued she, the best of masters: What I did it for I know not! Mr. Hopley came to my house on the 28th of Dec. and said, I have a suspicion of a greater robbery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150032"/> committed by my maid. Is it not right to break open her trunk, for I suspect there are things of mine in it?</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Terry. She was in the Poultry compter. He told me she had sent for her trunk. We broke it open, and there we found some baize and stockings by the side of a box, which was withinside. Mr. Hopley said, What is in this box? There was a padlock hung to it. He said, I insist upon this being broke open, which was done, and there we found the things mentioned. They are all here ( producing a large bundle ) and she owned likewise she took them at different times. I asked her in what manner this box was conveyed into the trunk. She said, When you went home to stay till I had cleaned myself, I took that box from under my bed, and put it into my trunk.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he make this confession?</p>
               <p>Burr. This he made before Sir Samuel Gower; and said that he stole them at divers times, and that he sent them by a woman, who sold some of them for him.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner came to my house on the 10th of Dec. about 8 o'clock in the morning, and wanted a pair of shoes which he had pawned before. I went up stairs to see for them, but could not find them. I came down and told him: He said they were certainly in the house, and desired I would search further. I went up again, and when I came down he was gone. There had been nobody in my shop that morning but him and myself, this being before any of the family were up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you m iss any thing then ?</p>
               <p>Mure. No, I did not. On the 22d of Dec. he came again, about the same time in the morning. I went up stairs for what he wanted, and when I came down he was gone again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing then?</p>
               <p>Mure. No, I did not. On the 26th of the same month he and his wife came both together, before 8-o'clock in the morning. I missed nothing till the 29th, when I found some gowns were missing. I enquired among the pawnbrokers, and found one gown pledged in the woman's name. I took out a warrant from justice Wright, and carried both the prisoners before him, where the woman said she found that gown with another in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose gown was that you found?</p>

               <p>About six or seven weeks ago I had been at Drury-Lane to buy some leather, when I saw a man much in liquor without his hat. Going a little farther, by the corner of Queen-street, where Mr. Mure lives, I went to make water, and by the side of the stones I saw a bundle and a man's hat; I went to the sign of the Crown, and asked if a man had come in there without a hat: They said, No. I staid there, and had a dram. When I came home I opened the bundle, and found there were two gowns. I kept them six or seven days, and they not being advertised, I thought I had a right to sell them. I sent my wife to pawn one of them, which she did for four shillings, and the other for the same, to buy leather for me to work, and to buy things for my family. My wife never saw them till I carry'd them home to her. As to what Ratcliff Littler says, the things my wife had then in her lap was nothing more than a blanket.</p>

            , for these seven years, and I have employed him as a porter out of compassion to his family. He seemed to be poor and very industrious. I have entrusted him with messages, and have sent him with things and money to carry for me, and to take receipts; I have also sent him to my country lodgings, and left him with the keys, where plate and things of value were, when he has been there alone, and I never missed any thing, not so much as a glass of wine. I have often had him a guard over the fields with me, and sometimes with a charge of money, which I should have thought indiscreet, if I was not with a person I could have confided in.</p>

He said, he knew nothing of them. I told him he had offer'd them to sale. Then he told me he had taken a bottle from the window, and said he would bring them on the Monday morning. I said, let me have it now. He said, it is late. I said, It is not half an hour after 10 o'clock. Then he took me into his room; there was the bottle. I had sent for my master, he came; then we sent for the constable and gave him charge of him.</p>

            . The prisoner and another man brought this mill to my shop, I was not in the way when they came first. My servant came to me and told me there was a mill brought to be sold. I went home and ask'd the prisoner what he expected for it? He said, 12 s. we agreed for 10, and I paid the prisoner the money; when they went out at the door, the prisoner went one way and the man that came with him the other. On the Wednesday following, Mr. Russel's servant called upon me, I shew'd him the mill; he said it was his master's property; he and his master desired me, if I saw either of the men, to secure them: after which, my servant secured the prisoner; I desired him to go with me to Mr. Russel; he charged him with stealing the mill.</p>

I was present when Mr. Russel's man came to enquire if a mill had been sold there; and also when Mr. Russel, the prisoner and my master were together.

            . I am a Goldsmith, and live in New-Bond-Street; the prisoner came to my house about the beginning of December, and offer'd me four pieces of silver; three tops and one bottom of silver fork handles, in the same condition they now are, scratch'd upon the graving; (producing them) he offer'd them to sale. I asked him how he came by them? He said, he bought them at Harrow for 3 s. 6 d. but said, he thought them worth 13 or 14 s. Upon seeing them in this condition, I suspected he stole them, sent for a constable and stopt him; then he said he had an uncle who kept the Tennis-court in the Hay-market; we went there with him. The gentleman said, he was related to him. and he believed he was a very honest man. Upon which I let him go, but kept the things and advertis'd them the next day; the prosecutor came the Monday following and owned them. I went on the Tuesday to Harrow-on-the-hill and took the prisoner as he was at work in the fields, and brought him to justice Fielding's, there he confessed he stole them.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to those gentlemen. When we were inform'd they had been rob'd, the gentlemen order'd, that the men, who cut the goods into garments, should be search'd. Mr. Ware desired I would give him my assistance to see them examined. I was by, and held the candle, while he searched the prisoner's pockets, when I saw the canvas, here produced, taken out. I ran a piece of packthread through them, that I might be able to swear that they are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this warehouse ?</p>
               <p>Kentish. It is in Seething-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself ?</p>
               <p>Kentish. He said it was the first offence, and beg'd that we would forgive him, at another time he said somebody had put them in his pocket when he was asleep. The constable was waiting in the kitchen, and, upon the goods being found, was call'd, and had charge given him of the prisoner. He charged me to aid and assist: We then took him to the compter, and the next day, being Saturday, there was no sitting alderman. We brought him to his Lordship, it being the time of the sessions. My lord's clerk said, if he was committed, he must remain till next sessions; so he advised us to let him remain till Monday, to see the gentlemen, as they do not live in town. The prisoner was accordingly admitted to bail, and is now surrendered.</p>
