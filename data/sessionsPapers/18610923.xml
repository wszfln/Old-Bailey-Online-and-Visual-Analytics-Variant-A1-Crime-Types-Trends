I am a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Charles Preston, at 16, Water-lane, Great Tower-street—Mr. Preston does not live in London—the prisoner was in our service as managing clerk, at a salary of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—on 13th June I had some letters of administration to take out, and I gave him two Post-office orders, which I had received from the country, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, desiring him to pay the duty and get the grant of administration—this was in the presence of another clerk—I gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and the other clerk gave him, I think, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge, I afterwards referred to the prisoner's books—I have his petty cash disbursement book here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—on 13th June, I find an entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as paid for stamping bond, and 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid for the grant, Court fees 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., affidavit 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and receipt 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on 24th June, there is an entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stamping bond—these entries are in the prisoner's writing; he balanced every week—I have not got the papers here, I have since passed them—on 1st or 2d August, finding the money had not been paid, I spoke to the pri<lb/>soner—I accused him of not having paid the money—I cannot recollect the words I used—I called his attention to these sums, as not being paid at the time—he made some evasive reply; I cannot recollect what it was; he then left the office, and I never saw him afterwards till he was in custody—I then received a letter from him—this is it—it is in his writing (<hi rend="italic">This letter bore no date.; it asserted that he had committed no fraud, that he had lost the money, and implored the prosecutor, for the sake of his wife, not to proceed against him</hi>)—this other letter is also in the prisoner's writing—it is addressed to</p>

I reside at the Gate-house tavern, at High gate—the prisoner was in my service as ostler, and had been so for eleven months; it was his duty to receive money from customers during the day, for baiting horses and things of that kind, and to hand over at night the money he had received during the day—he used to account to me regularly every night, not the following morning—on Saturday night, 7th September, about twenty minutes to 12, he came to me to account for the money he had received during that day; I heard him tell the barmaid that he had taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the stable—I immediately went to him and told him that was not all the money he had taken—he said it was—I asked how he could make that out, enumerating to him at the same time the number of vehicles that had been in the stables on that day to my knowledge, which was a carriage and pair, and a gig belonging to the drill sergeant, which would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then gave me another sixpence—I asked him if that was all the money he had received; he distinctly said yes—I then told him that his conduct had been so bad upon previous occasions in embezzling money from me, or trying to do so, that I would not put up with it any longer, and I gave him a month's notice to leave—I had seen him about 8 or 9 o'clock on the Saturday evening, he was then perfectly sober, and so he was when I had the conversation with him—in consequence of what Mrs. Chapman said to me that night, I asked the prisoner what he had done with the money that he had received for one particular horse and gig, with two gentlemen in it—he said there had been no horse and gig in the stables—he declared he had not received any money for it, and had never seen it—next morning I sent for a policeman, and asked the prisoner for the money he had received for the horse and gig; he would not acknowledge having received it until he saw the policeman coming round the corner—he than tendered me a shilling, and said, "Well, I did take it last night; take 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. sir"—I said, "You received a shilling, why tender me 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; even in the face of a policeman you want to swindle me three times in one night"—and I told him to be off at once—I asked why he did not give it me last night—he said he was keeping it for me last night—I sent for the police<lb/>man and gave him into custody in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a superintendent of police—I took the prisoner—a gentleman named Russell pointed him out, having a warrant for his apprehension for robbing Mr. Kearcs—the prisoner was driving in four<lb/>wheeled pony-chaise in High-street, Margate, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—three others were with him; two appeared to be young gentlemon, and one was a sailor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I state something when I was taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you said that you had had the money, and had come to Margate for the purpose of obtaining it from a friend of yours, for the purpose of making it good to Mr. Kearns—you wrote a letter to Mr. Hudson—I did not see him come to the station—I heard that he came there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left the ship <hi rend="italic">Ada</hi> on, I think, Thursday; I paid as much of the freight as I could, and had a balance left in my hands of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I went to my lodging with the full intention of putting the money in a drawer, but I went away in a hurry and forgot to take the money out of my pocket. I then went up to Oxford-street, had supper, and then went down to the Haymarket; whilst there I went into Mr. Isaac's and met Miss Graham; I recollect being there and drinking—besides what I had from Mr. Kearns, I had about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a few shillings in my pocket, of my own; from that time to the following Monday, I was in such a state that I was not master of myself during any part of the time. On the Tuesday I left Miss Graham, having only 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket; how the other went I cannot tell; I had a slight attack of delirium tremens, and I went to Mr. Makiva, a friend, to ask his advice, being very unhappy; in a day or two afterwards, when I got better, I wrote a letter to Mr. Kearns. As to the bill of lading, I most solemnly swear I did not know it was in the pocket-book; I then wrote to Mr. Hudson, a gentleman who was stopping at Margate; I knew an old sailor down there who knew me and my family very well for many years; I wrote to him to search Mr. Hudson out; I got rather anxious at the end of the week; Mr. Makiva thought I had better go down myself and see after it; he went down with me; we missed the train that we were going by and took the steam-packet; when we got there we went to the Ship hotel and had something. I saw the sailor, and he told me that his mate had taken the letter to Mr. Hudson, who gave him a shilling, and said all right, be would attend to it. We then took a trap, intending to go and see Mr. Hudson and then to catch the train to come back directly to London to Mr. Kearns; to show that I had no intention of taking the money, the day before that I had 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Kearns in my possession, and the next day probably I should have had a great deal more. Mr. McDonald can prove that I started for Margate on the Sunday morning; Whilst I was at the station-house at Margate, Mr. Hudson came to see me with his cheque-book in his hand, but the officer that was with me, not knowing the case, would not let him see me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am under-warehouseman at Messrs. James Berry and Co., Queenhithe, wholesale stationers—their warehouse is in the parish of St. Michael's, Queenhithe—I have charge of the keys of the warehouse—I locked up the premises on the evening of the 11th of this month, about a quarter-past 7—I left them safe at that time—there were six desks in the office altogether; four in one, and two in another—they were all apparently secure—as the clerks leave they lock their own desks—in one of the desks there was a bowl with some postage stamps—I did not see it that evening—it is generally kept there—I did not notice the area railings that night the policeman, who was watching, outside went with me into the premises the following morning—I came there the next morning about half-past 7—when I found the place had been broken into, I sent for further assistance to the station—I found that the desks had all been entered and the contents strewed about—I noticed four coats lying on the floor in one of the counting-houses—they were in the same room that they had been the evening before—I know the prisoner—he had no business on the premises</p>

I live at 10, London-house yard—on Tuesday, 27th August, about 3 o'clock, I was in the parlour adjoining my shop—I saw the two prisoners in the street near my shop—their manner attracted my attention—I watched them, and saw Strong give Bradley something out of his side pocket—Strong had his back towards me—I could not say exactly what it was—Bradley put them into a bag which he carried—Strong took something out of his pocket two or three times, and each time Bradley put what he gave him into the bag—Bradley then left Strong, and went towards St. Paul's Churchyard—Strong had a small hand truck with him—it was a few yards from him—it contained two large paper parcels—he followed with it in the same direction as Strong had gone—I went through a court by London-house-yard, thinking I should meet Bradley in Paternoster-row—he did not come quite up to me, but turned into a passage leading into Newgate-market, called, I think, Paved-alley—I followed after him, and when I got to the top of the alley, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said "Bradley, I wish to speak to you"—he said, "Very well, Mr. Fox"—I said, "Come along with me"—I took him to my house, and when in the parlour I said, "What was it you received of the man with the truck?"—he said, "Some books"—I said, "Where are they?"—he said, "In my bag"—I said, "Give me them out"—he then gave me three books, saying, "Mr. Fox, these are my books; I ordered them of the man with the truck"—I then asked him who the man was that gave him the books, and where he worked; and after some hesitation he said, "Messrs. Routledge, of Farringdon-street"—I said that if that was the case, I daresay it would be right, I would go with him down to Farringdon-street; but when I got him to my street door he wanted to get away by</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police-sergeant</hi>). About 8 o'clock in the evening, on coming to the station, I went to the cell where Bradley was, accompanied by a constable—I asked him if he had any of Messrs. Rout<lb/>ledge's books at his lodgings, and he said, No, he had not—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he said, "Yes" I said, "Why you have got stock, have you not?"—he said, "Yes; but it is only old books' and pamphlets"—I said, "Now, be careful; are you sure that you have not any of Messrs. Routledge's publications at your house?" and he then repeated that he had not—I then said, "What will you say if I show you 142 which have been found at your lodgings?"—he made no reply to that—I said, "Come with me"—I took him to the office where the books were all placed, and he then said, "These are mine"—pointing to this packet of eleven books—" I bought them of Mr. Lowe"—I said, "But these are published by Routledge, you said you had none of Routledge's publications"—he made no reply to that, and he then went into the cell—when Bradley was first brought in, I questioned him as to what account he could give respecting these three books, and to the best of my remembrance he said that he he got them of a porter of Messrs. Routledge, and I think he said that he had ordered them—when Strong was brought in, which was perhaps twenty minutes or half-an-hour after, I said to Bradley, "Is that the porter you got these books from?" and he said, "No; that is not the man"—that was in the presence of Strong and of Mr. Routledge, and two or three other persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Robert and Henry Parnall, of 18, Bishopsgate-street, clothiers—Brown was employed on our premises as a cutter—I have seen the coat produced—it is one belonging to our firm—it is the one that was taken from Mead by Smart—I had seen it safe at 10 o'clock that same morning—I may say it was safe at half-past 12 o'clock—my attention was first called to it at 10 o'clock—there are three coats here; I have previously identified the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mead's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi>—"Yesterday, when Brown gave me the coat, I was not aware it was stolen. He asked me to take it for him to my place, and I was to meet him in the evening and give it to him. As to the pledge ticket, Brown asked me to buy the ticket, as he said he thought the coat would fit me. I gave him half-a-crown for the ticket, and took it out and tried it on; it was rather too large; I was not aware it was stolen, and pledged it in Whitechapel for the same money; and Brown gave me the half-crown back again, and I gave him the ticket; I pledged it in my own name."</p>

               <p>lamp there, I saw him distinctly—I stood and looked at him—I am per<lb/>fectly sure he is the man—I saw him afterwards in the cell at Whet<lb/>stone police-station, and identified him—when I saw him with the horses he had on a blue pilot jacket buttoned with one button—when I saw him in the cell he was dressed in the same way, except that he had a hat on instead of a cap—I heard of the horse being lost the next day from sergeant Sawyer, and I gave a description of the person I had seen.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, S</hi> 24). On Thursday morning I heard of the loss of the horses from the field—I went to the toll-gate and made inquiries—I afterwards saw Crouch—he made a communication to me, and gave me a description of a person—I then went with Mr. Ramsay to all the other toll-gates from Whetstone to Holloway, and traced up to London—we got to Islington about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but the toll collector, who had been on duty the night before, was not there then, and I had to stop till 8 o'clock in the evening to see him—next day I was with Mr. Ramsay in the Caledonian-road, and saw the prisoner riding a bay mare—it was the one that was afterwards identified by Mr. Harrington—I followed him to a public-house opposite Caledonian School—he got off there—a man spoke to him—he gave the mare up to a boy outside, and went into the house to get something to drink—I went and looked at the mare, and saw she corres<lb/>ponded with the description that was given—Mr. Ramsay went to find the prosecutor, and when the prisoner came out I asked him if the horse was his—he said it was—I asked where he bought it—he said he bought it the morning previous at Harlow-bush Fair—I asked him at what time—he told me about 9 o'clock in the morning—I asked which way he went to Harlow-bush—he said from King's-cross station to Barnet by the half-past 6 morning train, and that he arrived at Barnet by 7; that he then went to Barnet fair-fields, as he thought the fair was not over, to purchase a horse; and, the fair being over, he saw two gipsies in the fields where the fair was held, and he asked them if. they could sell him a horse; that they told him they had not one there to suit him, but they could take him to a place where they could get him a useful mare—he said he then went with them to Harlow-bush—I asked him which way he went—he said he walked up the hill through Barnet—I asked him which way ho turned when he got to Barnet—he said, "To the left"—I said, "You say you walked there, how</p>

               <p>far should you think it is?"—he said, "Seven or eight miles"—I then told him I believed that was the mare that was stolen from Mr. Ramsay's field, in Whetstone, about 11 o'clock on Wednesday night, and that his answers did not satisfy me; that I knew Harlow-bush to be twenty miles on the right of Barnet, and it was impossible for him to get there in the time, and he must accompany me to the station as the owner was sent for—I took him to the station in the Caledonian-road, and the prosecutor came and identified the mare—I then conveyed the prisoner to Whetstone and charged him—he repeated the same story there as before—on searching him, I found this toll ticket, issued at Holloway gate—it contains the figures 12, 9, which, I believe, means the 12th day of the 9th month—Thursday was the 12th—a person passing through that gate after 12 o'clock on Wednesday night would receive such a ticket—Harlow-bush is twenty miles on the right of Barnet—if he had got to Barnet by 7 o'clock, he could not have to Harlot bush by 9.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follow</hi>: "On Thursday morning I made my way to King's-cross station and took a ticket for Barnet; as I got down into the fair-field, I asked a couple of gipsies if they knew of a good horse for sale; they said they had not one, but could take me where I could have my choice; I agreed to go with them; we went over to Harlow-bush in a light cart, and I arrived there about twenty minutes past 9. After we got there I saw two black horses and two bay ones; I looked at them, and picked this bay mare, the one now in the street; I asked the price; they asked six guineas; I said I would not give it, I would give five; they would not take less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said I would split the difference and give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they said they would take it; that was all I agreed to pay, and did pay. They took the horses up to London; one of them rode the black horse and led the other; I rode up to Islington gate in the same cart I rode from Barnet, I and the other gipsy, and the cart passed them on the road; one said we would meet them through Islington gate; we stopped at a public-house, through the gate, till they came; the gipsy that brought the horses through the gate had a hand kerchief and a ticket; they left me the ticket and handkerchief, by dropping it; they said I could have it, so I picked up the ticket and handkerchief and put them into my pocket; they tied the two black horses and the hay behind the cart and left me with this mare, and said, 'Good afternoon, I wish you good luck with the mare, I hope she will do you service; that was a 11; I made my way home'")</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employ of Messrs. Durrant—the prisoner was their porter, and has been in their service nearly ten years—on the evening of 22d August, I shut up the premises about 7 o'clock, and left shortly afterwards, leaving the prisoner there—it was his duty to remain till 10, when the night porter Lomas goes in to sleep, and the prisoner leaves—on the night in question, I returned with Lomas at 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoner with a cap on, and a hat-box in his hand about to leave the premises—I asked him what he had got in that hat-box—he said, "A hat"—I requested to see it—he said, "Why?"—I asked him the same question several times, and at last he said, "Then I will let you see it"—he crossed the office into his own room, and began untying the string on the opposite side of the counter to me, tipped the lid on one side, and said, "There; nothing but a hat"—having a safety lamp in my hand I could not see, so I tipped the lid on one side and saw that it was this bundle of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I put it on the counter, asked him if that was his hat, and told him I must acquaint the gentlemen of the house—I asked him what he was going to do with it, and he said that he did not know—he was allowed to go home in a minute or two, and was given in custody next morning—on Thursday evening, just before 7 o'clock, he brought this bag, carrying it in such a manner as to indicate that there was nothing in it—I afterwards went up into his room while he was out, and ascertained that the box was quite empty—here are five pounds and a few ounces of silk, at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—the silk is kept in the basement of the warehouse—the prisoner had access to all the premises, but he ought not to go down to the basement after I left—I can swear to the silk—only Mr. Snewitt, who lives in the house, and the servant-maid, were in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 2, Salisbury-street, Strand—in con<lb/>sequence of the Coroner's order, I went to 47, Bedfordbury, to see the child—it was dead, and exceedingly attenuated—I never saw a child in such a state before—it was so exceedingly worn that its legs were not thicker than my finger, and its whole weight would not exceed 3 1/2 lbs.; certainly not 4lbs.—there was no external mark of violence—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion, and found the organs perfectly healthy throughout—there was no fat whatever; not there slightest—there was no disease that could in any way account for its death—want of proper nourishment would account for what I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How soon after death did you see the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Less than twenty-four hours—I was informed that it died on the Tuesday evening, and I saw it on the early part of Wednesday afternoon—decomposi<lb/>tion had set in—I do not think it would have been in a better condition if I had examined it immediately after death—my first examination was only an external one—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination did not take place till about seventy-two hours after death—I do not think it would have offered any more satisfactory results if I had examined it immediately after death, because the decomposition was more on the exernal surface—there was scarcely any internal decomposition there was a little—I think want of nourishment might have caused it to be in that state, and I formed an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230042"/>
               <p>opinion from what I saw and heard—a long course of want of attention to so young a child might have assisted very much towards the state I found it in—there was no disease whatever—when there is a tendency to atrophy in young children there is always a cause for it—I should say that atrophy does not exist without previous disease—I hare not seen it in young children—I do not know, from my reading, that in young children there is a tendency to waste away without any perceivable organic disease—if a mother's breast was diseased, and her milk bad, it might affect the child temporarily, because she finds it a painful operation to give the child nourishment with a diseased breast—if the quality of the milk is bad, that would affect a child—insufficiency in quantity, and badness in quality of the milk, would account for the appearances I saw—I had never seen the child before its death—Dr. Harvey was present with me at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I examined the lungs; they were perfectly healthy, and almost colourless, except the posterior portion, into which the blood had gravitated—there was bile in the gall bladder—the eyes presented a dull appearance, and were covered with a thickened mucus—they were partly closed—they were the natural colour—I do not think it is universally the case where persons have died of starvation, that the eyes are open and present a fiery-red appearance, as in a case of acute ophthalmia, and it is not the case—it is so in grown-up people, but this child was too young for this and in grown-up people it is only in some bad cases—I have seen very few persons, thank God, who have died of starvation, but I say so because the quantity of blood in the body is insufficient to produce the effect—I have never seen a child before that died of starvation—I have only read parts of Dr. Taylor's book—allow me to explain my views; the want of blood in this child was evident throughout the body: there was not a particle of blood in any of the vessels which I severed, not ten drops of blood escaped, and there was not blood enough in the body to produce those appearance—the same thing would not apply to an adult, unless it was a case of sudden loss of nourishment—in a short case it might be—in the case of a person who died from a starvation of twenty-three days, I think there would still be sufficient fluid to produce the effect, but if it was spread over many weeks I think it would be different.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 16, Tavistock-street, Covent-garden—I was requested to be present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of this child—I had seen it before several times—the mother had not brought it to me—I could find no disease—I feared mesenteric disease—that is an hereditary disease, or it may be brought on by bad living; either insufficient or Im<lb/>proper food—the proximate cause of the child's death was inanition, wasting—the organs were all perfectly healthy, which leads me to the conclusion that it died from want of sufficient nourishment—I form my judgment by comparing the symptoms after death with the appearances during life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there any disease of the mesenteric glands, com<lb/>mon to children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it might lead to atrophy—atrophy would be the symptom that would account for the appearances presented, if they were there, but I am able to say, from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, that they were not there—you would have enlarged mesenteric glands, and the mesenteric glands were not enlarged, they were not wasted; they were in a normal condition—I should not have been able to form an opinion better if I had examined the child earlier—the internal organs were perfectly fresh—I should say that a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination ought to be early—whether that rule would apply more strongly to the case of a young child would</p>

               <p>depend upon the condition of the child—I do not think it would be more so than in an adult, because in an older person you have more flesh and more than, and putrefaction is more rapid and where there is no flesh and nothing to decompose, decomposition does not set in so soon—I agree that food in<lb/>sufficient in quantity and bad in quality would account for the appearances I saw—I have a memorandum that the child was brought to me five times before its death—I saw it every time, and I believe it was brought to me on another occasion, but cannot say—whether that was by the mother I cannot say—I gave it tonics; iron was the last medicine it had—I was told that it was weak and sickly from its birth.</p>

I am a police-constable attached to the post-office—on the morning of 3d September, I went to the Northern District office before the letter carriers came, and placed myself in a position where I could com<lb/>mand a view of the water-closets—about half-past 6 o'clock I saw the prisoner come into one of them—he bolted the door as soon as he got in, and put a piece of paper against the ventilator of the closet through which I was looking—I pushed that a little aside, and still had a view of him—he then took two letters from his pocket, tore them open and took some coin from each of them—I could not see what sort of coin it was—he tore the letters up and put them down the pan of the closet—he then took a third letter from his pocket, tore that open and took something from it—he had not, during this timer unfastened his things at all—I pre<lb/>vented the water from flowing into the closet, and then went round to the door of the closet—whilst waiting at the door, I heard two pieces of coin drop on the stone floor of the closet in quick succession—about four minutes after I got to the door be came out—I took him to the comptroller's room, leaving Crocker, a police constable, in charge of the closet—at the inspector's room I saw Mr. Clare, the inspector of letter-carriers, and told him, in the prisoner's presence, that I had seen the prisoner tear up some letters and put them down the pan—the prisoner said he had not done so—I then searched him and took four sixpences, loose, from his waistcoat pocket, and also a purse from his trousers' pocket, containing 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a key—he gave me his address, and said the key would unlock his box in that room—he lived with his mother—I went there and found in a large box a smaller box, and also some keys, which he told me would unlock the little box—in that I found twenty-eight sovereigns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in postage stamps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230046"/>
               <p>—the stamps were in two pieces—they have never been put on letter—I afterwards went with Blackburn, the plumber, to the closet, and saw him take some fragments of letters and envelopes from the pan of the closet, which he handed to me—I pasted them together—I found six envelopes—one addressed, "Mr. G. Cunnington, 16, Metcalfe-place, Pentonville-road, near the Angel, Islington"—that bears the Margate post-mark of 2d September, and the Northern District mark of 3d September—the second is, "Elizabeth Rice, 9, Highbury-terrace, Islington, London"—it bean the Leatherhead post-mark of September 2d, and the Northern District post-mark of 3d September—there is a third addressed, "Mr. J. Hislop, 23, River-street, York-road, London"—that bears the Wellington post-mark of 2d September, but the London post-mark is not plain enough to see—there is a fourth letter addressed, "Mrs. Graham, 11, Church-street, Upper-street, Islington, London," bearing the Thetford post-mark of 2d September, and the Northern District office mark of 3d September—there is a fifth addressed, "Mrs. Preston, Lower-road, Islington, London," bearing the Torpoint, Devonport, poet-mark, of 2d September, and the Northern District of 3d September—the sixth is, "Mrs. Henry Wallace, 9, Royal Henry-walk, Pit<lb/>field-street, Hoxton, London," bearing the Guernsey post-mark of 2d sep<lb/>tember, and the Northern District of 3d September—I was at those water<lb/>closets, that morning, before any letter-carriers arrived at the office—one person came into the closet about 6 o'clock—I watched him—he did not tear up anything or put anything in the pan—no other person besides him came.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230047"/>
               <p>on the morning of 3d September—the prisoner was there on duty dividing the letters—that was about half-past 6 o'clock—I saw him leave his seat with three or four letters in his hand, and return without them—he shortly afterwards got up again and went towards the door leading to the letter-carriers' water-closets, to the water-closet of which Bingham has spoken—about five minutes, perhaps, after I had seen him leave his seat Bingham brought him to me in the comptroller's office, and told me what he had seen—I asked the prisoner if that was so, and he said, "No"—I asked him if he had any letters in his pocket—he said, "No; at least I think not"—I told the police-officer to search him, and he produced from his pocket four sixpences, and a parse, and other things—I gave him into custody—all those letters, which have been produced might have come to the prisoner's hand in the course of sorting—they were not for his district—I asked him if he had been sorting that morning—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what sort of letters, and he said, "All sorts of letters."</p>

I was on duty in Little Queen-street, Holborn, on Friday morning, 2d August—about a quarter to 3 I was called by Wakeham to assist him in taking the prisoner to the hospital—when the prisoner was brought into the surgery he was set down in a chair, and I heard Wakeham ask him "Where is your wife," or "Is you wife at home?"—I think those were the words—he tried to speak but he could not, and he nodded his head in the direction of Newton-street—he nodded his head on the right side, sideways (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—that was in the direction towards Newton-street—Wakeham then asked him if he had cut his wife, and he nodded his head, as much as to say "yes," as I understood him—he nodded like that, forwards; not in the same way as before—upon that I left the hospital with Wakeham and went to No. 3, Newton-street—Watts, another constable, who had gone with us, remained in the hospital with the prisoner—when Wakeham and I got to Newton-street, we went into the front room first floor—the street door was open—the room door was shut, but not locked; the key was on the outside—I put my hand on the knob and opened the door—I turned on my bull's eye, and saw the woman lying dead, with her throat out—Wakeham went at once for the doctor—I remained in the room until the doctor came—I touched the body before the doctor came—I took hold of the left arm, and it was quite warm; it was lying on her side, resting on her leg—after I had felt the arm I put it on the leg again or close by it—I think I put it where it was before, but I cannot be certain exactly—I did not move the body in any degree before the doctor came—I staid there until the doctor came—another constable was there; he did not move the body—there was a candlestick in the room on the table—the table was almost in the centre of the room—the candle was burnt out; the grease had run on to the table and was fixed.</p>

               <p>of blood, about three yards from the deceased's feet—I saw the razor before Watts picked it up—it was open, quite open, just as if you wore going to shave with it; the blade was turned right back from the handle—it was not in the pool of blood, it was at the right hand aide of the blood; the pool of blood was nearer the deceased than the razor—the deceased was lying with her back right on to the window seat—Watts kept possession of the razor until Inspector Mackenzie came—he kept it in his hand as he picked it up.</p>

Q.</hi> What distance is the hospital form where the prisoner came up to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not a quarter of a mile, I should think—I was not in the hospital above two or three minutes—I should suppose we were not above fire or six minutes in getting to the hospital; it might be tan minutes—I am quite sure that I heard the clock strike after I got to Newt-street—I went into the room first, with my light in my hand—I did not see the body at first, not till I had got about half-way into the room—I was looking for something—I did not walk round the room, I walked up straight just about within a yard or a yard and a half; and I then discovered the body on the basket—I turned my light on—it is not a very small room; I do not know the size of it, I never measured it—I should say that the distance from the window to the opposite wall was five or six yards, I can't say positively; it was not more than the distance from me to you—I dare say it was as much—I give it as my opinion that the pool of blood was about three yards from the deceased's feet—I am not mistaking yards far feet—I dare say I had been in the room about two minutes before I saw the razor—Wakeham had left before I saw it—I did not go searching about—after I discovered the deceased, and the other constable was gone, I turned my my light on to the floor—I might certainly move about—I saw the razor before Watts arrived but did not touch it; my intention was to leave it till the doctor arrived, but Watts picked it up; he did not come with the doctor, he was there before the doctor—the rug was in its usual place—the pool of blood was at one end of the rug, I should say about a foot or a foot and a half from the rug, from the end nearest the deceased—I still adhere to my statement that the pool of blood was three yards from the feet of the deceased.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 82 <hi rend="italic">F</hi>). On the morning of 2d August I went with Wakeham and Wensley to King's College Hospital with the prisoner—he was there put into a chair—I saw him put to leg to Wakeham, touch him on the side, and put his band towards him making a motion for him to come to him—I then heard Wakeham say, "Where is your wife?—the prisoner motioned towards Newton-street—he put his hand to his throat and motioned towards Newton-street, that is, he turned round and with his head motioned towards home with his hand, and nodded his head at the same time (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—Wakeham then said to him, "Have you cut your wife?"—he nodded with his head once, in that manner, as much as to say yes—upon that Wakeham and Wensley went to Newton-street and I remained with the prisoner—after they had gone I asked the prisoner if he had served his wife as he had served himself—he nodded with his head that way—I staid with him till Mr. Fortescue, the, house-surgeon, arrived, and after assisting the prisoner to bed I went to 3, Newton-street—I found Wensley there—I picked up a razor from the floor—when Mr. Paynter, the surgeon, came I pointed out to him the place where I had picked it up—when I picked it up I did not observe any mark on the floor where it had been; I saw no particular mark except the pool of blood—I should think the</p>

               <p>razor was about three yards from the feet of the deceased, as near as I can guess—there was a chair near where I picked up the razor; the razor was close to the leg of the chair, about two or three inches from it—the chair was facing the fire-place—the back part of the chair was towards the fire-place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you tell me the size of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about six yards in length; six or seven perhaps, and about five in breadth, from the window to the opposite wall—I saw the pool of blood—the rug was close to the fire-place, the pool of blood was between the deceased and the rug, quite close to the edge of the rug, it might be about a foot from the rug, something like that—from the extremity of the deceased's feet to when the razor was, I should think was about three yards—the blood was probably about two yards and a half from the deceased, or a little more; I did not measure it, but as near as I could judge—I should not think that the room was more than five yards in width—the fire-place is not in the centre of the room, it is in the corner—the pool of blood seemed to be in one place—it ran from the beginning of the chair towards a hole or opening in the flooring; it ran from the chair towards the deceased—before I put the question to the prisoner, after the other constables had left, he second anxious to say something to me—he motioned me towards him and second to say something, and I went to him—it took us about three, four, or five minutes to go from where I first saw the prisoner to the hospital.</p>

I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons and a Doctor of Medicine—on the morning of 2d August I was called by the constable, Wakeham, to go to No. 3, Newton-street, Holborn—it was about half-past 3 when I got to Newton-street—I went to the front-room first-floor—the constables Wensley and Watts were in the room when I got there—(<hi rend="italic">The witness, at the request of counsel, had sketched in court a plan of the room, which</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230063"/>
               <p>the window—there was a chair on the left aide of the body, between it and the wall—there was a large wicker basket underneath the body, such as they hawk poultry in about the street; it was nearly a yard in its longest diameter and upwards of a foot in depth—the body was lying in a sitting position upon the wicker basket—the bottom of the basket was not upper<lb/>most, the posterior part of the deceased had sunk down somewhat into the basket; she was in a sort of sitting position, but the large handle of the basket prevented the body from sinking down entirely into the basket—the handle went quite across the shorter diameter of the basket in an arch—she was not under the handle, she was as it were sitting upon half the basket—there was an old fashioned window-seat to the window, and the head of the deceased was hanging over it—the body was resting upon the basket in a sitting position, with the back of the body against the window-seat; and the head was hanging far back over the window-seat; underneath the left shoulder, on the window-seat, was an over-set flower-pot, the earth being scattered on the window-seat—her legs were drawn up underneath her, drawn up close to the basket—both the hands were lying in her lap—the blood from the body had run on to the window-seat, from thence on to the floor in a pool of blood, not running sufficiently far towards the fire-place to be apparent, being hid by her clothes; it was entirely under her. except what was on the window-seat—the window-shutter at her right side was very much splashed with blood, as from a cut artery having flowed against it—a large stream of blood had flowed upon the window-shutter on her right, as if blood had spirted from an artery—there can be no doubt that at the time the blood had so spirted from the artery, the body was in the position in which I found it—the thumb and three first fingers of the left hand were deeply cut on their inner sides by a sharp instrument—from their position I think that could have been occasioned by grasping a sharp instrument—it was a wound that might have been made at one cut, the fingers and thumb being flexed (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position to the Jury upon his own hand</hi>)—it might be caused by a grasp, if the fingers were flexed the cut on the three fingers and thumb would be in a straight line—there was a large cut on the throat of the deceased eight inches long—it commenced nearly at the centre of the back of the neck and proceeded downwards and forwards across the right side of the neck, across the throat downwards to the centre of the left collar bone (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position</hi>)—it was a very deep wound; it had cut nearly all the muscles—I cannot give its depth by measurement; it had first severed the skin and some muscles, it had then cot off the top of the transverse process of the third neck bone—that is a prominence of bone which projects on either side from one of the back bones, it was the top of the transverse process of the third cervical vertebra—that was towards the commencement of the cut; it had cut through the muscles and arteries at the aide of the neck, and had then severed the thyroid cartil<lb/>lage, Adam's apple as it is commonly called—the carotid arteries lie there, and all the large arteries and veins—in the case of the deceased the cartilage was ossified; it had cut positively through it—it is above the wind-pipe, the wind-pipe begins below the thyroid cartilage—the wound then became shallower to its termination—death would have followed very soon after the infliction of the wound—when a person's carotid artery is cut through, I cannot possibly say how soon death would ensue—in my judgment it would be within a very few minutes—cases has been recorded of persons being capable of exertion after the carotid artery was cut through; I can imagine that a person might walk a few feet, stagger a few feet I might say—there</p>

               <p>were no Indications of that in this ease—there were do marks of footsteps of blood at the feet of the deceased—I saw the cap of a man on the window eat, at the right side of the head of the deceased, I think it was lying partly on the side of the head and partly under—I removed it—at some distance from the feet of the woman there was a chair standing very near the fire-place—one of the constables, I believe Watts, pointed out to me the spot where he had picked up the razor—I saw a mark on the floor in that spot; it was a mark of blood supposed to have been made by the razor; it was within an inch or two of a large pool of blood—the spot pointed oat to me where the razor was picked up was a few inches from the leg of the chair, and two of my own full paces from the skirt of the deceased's dress—that would be about two yards; not the nearest part of the pool of blood, but where the razor was lying—there was a pool of blood flowing in a direction from that chair, and in the direction towards the deceased's feet—it flowed so in consequence of the declivity of the floor—I could tell that that pool of blood had flowed from the chair towards the deceased, and not from her, because the end of the pool flowed into a large crack in the floor—I did not measure the distance of the hole in the floor from the skirt of the deceased's dress, but I believe it was a full yard—that would be about half way between where the razor was picked up, and where the woman's dress extended to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you saw the position of the body of the deceased and the nature of the wound—in your opinion, as a surgeon and medical man, taking into consideration the circumstances you have described, could the deceased have inflicted those wounds herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should be sorry to swear it was impossible, but it is most highly improbable—it would require very great force to cut through the transverse process of the vertebras and the thyroid cartilage—the flap of the wound towards its left lowermost extremity had the skin torn up from the tissues beneath to the extent of about an inch in depth, by about three inches in length—it is rather difficult to explain—the upper flap of the wound was torn up from the tissues beneath—if the flat part of the blade of an instrument was carried underneath the skin it might tear it up from the tissues beneath; that is to say if the cutting edge was not carried vertical to the skin, but the flat pushed against the skin and pushed underneath, as it were, that would tear up the skin from the tissues beneath—that would indicate that the weapon had not been drawn cleanly through towards the end of the cut—there were also splashes of blood on the window-shutter—I have no doubt that the wound was inflicted where the body was lying—I did not examine the prisoner, not so as to give evidence about him—I have no doubt that the blood on the window-shutter had shutter immediately after the infliction of the wound—by immediately I mean directly—I have no doubt the body fell where the wound was inflicted—there were marks of bruises about the face—there was a bruise on the left jaw bone, and the inner side of the upper lip was out as if from having been knocked against the teeth—that out was quite a recent one; the body was quite warm when I saw it, even the fingers were warm—I did not see the wound made by the teeth on the lip at that time; it was at the post mortem examination that I discovered that—it had not cicatrised, it had been made recently before death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever seen any wounds of this description before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, many—I will not swear it was impossible, but it is highly improbable that such a wound should be self inflicted—I have read Dr. Taylor upon this subject—I am aware that there are instance on record, of cases which come within the category of what I call highly im<lb/>probable</p>

               <p>cases—the deceased appeared a very strong robust woman—I did not observe a rug in the room—I do not know whether it had been removed before I got there; the pool of blood was very near the fire-place—I visited the prisoner at the hospital, but I did not attend him—I examined the wound on the deceased's left hand very closely—it had the appearance of having grasped some instrument—she would get those cats by grasping an instrument, the instrument then being withdrawn from the grasp—one single grasp done in that way would do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the window shut or open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Open; and there was a mating space where the flowerpot that was overset might have stood—it was a fine night—the cut on the hand must have been occasioned by a very sharp instrument, it was so clean—it had one edge—one cut would do it—the cat on the thumb would have been upwards—I observed the direction of the outs, and closely examined them, thinking it might be important to observe hem—it is my belief that an instrument with one edge, and with out stroke might have made the cuts—I added the words, "and being with<lb/>drawn," because I do not think that simple pressure directly down upon the edge would have produced so clean a cut; not simply taking hold of a sharp instrument and pressing it—no other instrument was found—a closed razor was found in the room, but that was not bloody—a very blunt carving knife was also found on the table, which stood in the centre of the room—that was not such an instrument as could have inflicted the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in the firm of Coster, Beater, Dennant, and Russ, 3 and 4, Aldermanbury—the prisoner was a clerk in our employ—he was chief cashier—his duty was to receive monies, for which he was to account to Mr. Dennant—he was to enter them in his cash-book, which was kept by him alone—from something that came to my knowledge, on Monday, 5th August, I had an interview with the prisoner in the counting-house—I told him that I was quite sure there was dishonesty on his part, that if such was the case, he had better confess it, for I was determined to find it out—Mr. Lovell, the ledger clerk, was at this time also in the counting-house, and I said to him, "Lovell, do you know if Ward has robbed us?"—about that moment Ward left the counting-house, leaving Lovell there alone with me—Ward came back in about ten minutes and flung down this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The ledger was kept by Powell, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By Lovell—hi has posted that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he posted the ledger from the cash-books—there, was the credit cash-book also, kept by the prisoner—Mr. Dennant, my partner, balanced with him every two or three days—the prisoner's duty was both to receive and pay monies—one of the partners, either Mr. Dennant myself, signed the cheques—when a customer like Mr. Weeks, who was teemed very highly, wanted money for a few days, we had no hesitation in letting him have it—if it was of any amount it was lent by cheque—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be beyond all question by cheque—being by cheque the amount would appear in the pass-book, and in the cheque-book where the cheque was drawn—the cheque-book is here—the pass-book is not; it is in Alderman bury, I suppose—I do not know where it is—I have never seen it—the cheque-book I hare seen, and the banker's-book; they are here—I have not seen the pass-book—there would be no difficulty at all in testing the accuracy of an entry—there was not anybody, I believe, whose duty it was hi to check the cash-book with the ledger as posted—there are three partners in the firm who attend to the business; and one has been very ill for the last two or three years and been unable to give his attendance—there was no one whose duty it was to check the entries in the cash-book—nobody has ever done it at all—there was no one whose duty it was to check to accuracy of those items there, of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and such sums—it would be put in the balance-book, and would be assumed to be correct—I have been in the firm some fifteen or sixteen years—that is the mode in which the business has been conducted ever since I have been in it—I belive there is not any check at all upon the accuracy of any items, either a the cash-book or ledger, and never has been since I have been in the firm—the amount of transactions which have passed through the books in that way in the course of the year is, perhaps; 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is the case that that is the way of business; that there is that amount passing through the books in the course of the year, and that there is no check to the items, great or small—that position up to recently, eight or ten yean ago, was filled by one of the partners, and consequently no check was required—for that eight or ten years, since the duty has devolved on a clerk, that sum has passed through the books without any check being made on it at all—Mr. Weston was the chief cashier up to the time the prisoner entered on that position—I should say, from memory, that he has ceased to be cashier eight or nine years—the prisoner has been chief cashier eight or nine years—certainly there has been some investigation into the state of affairs during that time—we always knew exactly our position—there was no yearly or half-yearly audit of accounts—the accounts have never been audited since I have been in the place—balance-sheets were made up twice a year on an average; occasionally, only once a year—I was not is the habit of borrowing from time to time sums of money from the chief cashier privately—I was in the habit of drawing money for my private expenses through the chief cashier, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as I wanted it—it may have been perhaps, as much as 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I drew in that way in the course of last year—it may have been as much as 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I do not think it was.</p>

               <p>year, at various times, sums to the amount of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in that way—I will not swear, because it might be about that amount—sometimes I had cheques direct, and therefore I cannot divide the amount.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you were debited to the extent of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., advanced to you in sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, could you check that, whether it was accurate or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would never be the case—it would be impossible that such a case could arise, as I balance with the prisoner every three or four weeks—it is never more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that goes before my partner sometimes every two days—there was an account kept of advances made to me—there was the prisoner's balance-book showing the monies that I had; the book which went before my partner every two days—there was no entry made at the time—I have kept memoranda, but I have destroyed them or thrown them away—there is no book which is handed to me and in which I make an entry at the time, of the amounts—there was no book which it was the prisoner's duty to keep, in which from time to time, as the advances were made to me, entries ought to be made—I believe he did keep an account—I never saw any such book—he would keep a memorandum on his file—nothing more, I believe, than a mere slip of paper—that was the way in which monies to the amount of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year in the aggregate ware handed to me; but never more than 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—my brother borrowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the prisoner, I do not know how long ago—I did not know it at the time—it came to my knowledge some eight or ten months ago—my brother has nothing whatever to do with the firm—there was no other loan from the prisoner to him—I only know of that one—the prisoner was never required, that I am aware of, on the occasion of the balancing every two or three days, to hand over the balance in his hands—I did not transact the counting-house matters—I have never known him required to hand over a balance—he simply gave I O U's for the balance—I O U's for any balance which appeared against him at the end of the two or three days were treated as a debt against him—he accounted for the items in that page of the banker's book—I know nothing about whether he kept a banking account himself—sometimes he has had as much balance as 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that would chiefly consist of half-notes, bills, I O U's, traveller's expenses—there would never, I should say, be large amounts of cash in his hands; never more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—I cannot tell—I judge so—some of them were cash balances in his hands so far as I know—I do not know anything about how much they were—Mr. Dennant is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the only book in which there was any account pasted between the prisoner and Mr. Dennant? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, The only book which showed the results—it was Mr. Dennant's duty to check them, not mine—that book was an account from the prisoner to Mr. Dennant of the balance every two or three days—Lovell has been our ledger-clerk for, I should think, eight or ten years, I cannot tell—he is here—I am not aware that I have mentioned in evidence, before this morning, the statement that I made, "You can do so if you like; but mind, I hold out no promise or inducement"—I have spoken of it before this morning; not in the prisoner's presence, that I am aware of—I was not present at any consultation between me and my Counsel—I am quite sure that it is the very expression I made use of to the prisoner—I made no memorandum of it—I have no written memorandum of anything that transpired—I did not say, "Remember what I told you yesterday"—nothing of the sort—this was on the same day—I did not make any allusion to what had taken place in the morning—I did not know that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230074"/>
               <p>held out any promise, and therefore I made no allusion to it—when I said he had better confess; I did not use the words in that sense—his words were, "Whether you prosecute me or not, I shall do so"—they wore his words so nearly that I could not tell them nearer—I mean to swear that he said, "I shall come to-morrow morning and point out those things"—he said that, after he had made a statement; those very words, so that it is impossible for my memory to speak to them nearer—what he said was not that he would come presently and give me information; that was previously—he said he would come to-morrow morning and give me every information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the expression he made use of, "I will give you every info Infor<lb/>mation;" and not "I will point out those things?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really am not prepared to say so nearly as that; it was either "point out," or, "give information"—it meant the same thing—I say the words made use of were "I will come to-morrow morning and point out those things," or that which ex<lb/>presses exactly the same thing—I would not swear to being correct in any word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did he not, instead of the words "I will point out those things," my "I will come to-morrow morning and give you every information in my power?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I apprehend it is ridiculous It suppose that I can give every word.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your memory on the matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My memory is, that he said those words, as near as I can recollect, "I will come in the morning and point out those things"—my memory is very strong on that point; but it may have been "and give you information"—whether he added "in my power," or not, I don't know.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>square of glass had been broken, and a half-penny lay beneath it in the, private passage—we got into the warehouse and found all the desks broken open—we then went up stairs—I found this box, knife, two screw drivers and this iron wedge (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); and up stairs this other box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the two bundles of cigars in it, and this boot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying nearly alongside of it—one of the screw drivers was lying on the desk, not in the box—the iron chisel was lying in the counting-house, but I could not say exactly where, because I did not pick it up—it was not in the cigar box—I put them in the box to take care of them—I saw a hole, where any one could have got in; that was up in the top of all—I did not get out at that hole—at about ten minutes past 6, I went to another warehouse, about two warehouses off—I did not go along the roof—I went to Thames-street and down a lane before then, and underneath a barge I saw Evans taken out by another constable just as I got there—I went down to the station and from there I came back to another warehouse, where I found these three pain of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were all wet and dirty—Evans afterwards said at the station-house, "That is my pair" (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a pair</hi>)—he said, "Yes will find two pair and an odd one."</p>

I went on this Monday morning, the 16th, to Mr. Baylis's premises—Offer was there when I got there—I went from information that I received—I saw several desks broken open, and proceeded to make a search after the thieves—I went to the top of the house and found two tiles removed; I removed three more and broken away some of the woodwork, and I and Sergeant Turner passed through the aperture—I proceeded over the roof of about twenty houses till I got to the top landing window of 120, Pudding-lane, where I saw footmarks on the outer sill; one as from a foot with a stocking on, and one the marks of a person's toes—that was a private dwelling-house—I looked over the parapet and found a police-constable stationed there below—I called out to keep the door—I then got in at the window, and saw the marks as of some persons wiping their feet on the mat—I was followed by two constables—I told one to stop at the window and I hastened down stairs; when I got within six stairs of the bottom, I heard the bolt slip; the front door opened and I saw the prisoner Murray leave the house—I followed him, kept sight of him, and saw him stopped in Lower Thames-street by constable Tibben<lb/>ham—I sent him to the station by Tibbenham; I afterwards went to the station, where I saw Evans in custody as well—whilst I was telling to the station-sergeant haw I followed them, Evans said to me, "Ah! hid I met you in the house you would not be here now"—I saw a pair of shoes and a black cap picked up outside the door from which Murray went—the shoes are identified by Mr. Baylis; the cup is not identified by anybody—I believe the house is 120, Lower Thames-street, but the door is in Pudding-lane—</p>

               <p>Murray had not cap on, I think, when he was taken; I will not be sure—he had so shoes—at the Mansion-house, when the boots were being tried on the prisoners, Evans reached over and said, "These are my shoes; I will not deny them."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 54, Golway-street, St Luke's, and am foreman to Mr. Hector Baxter, of 49, Bartholomew-close, as a bookbinder—the prisoner has been about two years in his service as a porter, carrying out books—he left about five weeks before the robbery—I discharged bin on Saturday, 17th August, I closed the premises as usual about ten minutes past 6—I closed the counting-house door, saw that all was fastened, and then locked the street-door—there is a yard at the back and a yard door, and a back door to the warehouse from the yard—I bolted that—it is a half-door, coloured glass at the top and wood at the bottom—the panel are not perfect, the glass is broken; and where the glass it broken it is covered with paper—I suppose the bolt of the door is about eighteen or twenty inches from the paper squares—if the paper squares were removed, a person from the outside could put his hand in and take hold of the bolt—the paper is over the door—it does not move with the door—the bolt is, perhaps, five feet from the ground—no one sleeps on the premises—I took the key with me when I had locked all the doors—on the following Monday morning I went there about a quarter before 7—when I opened the street door, I found the counting-house door open—that drew my attention, because I remembered distinctly closing it, before I went out—there were two desks in there—I found desk had been broken open and the paper strewed about, and found a knife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230083"/>
               <p>on the desk—one desk was not closed on the Saturday; the other was looked, and Mr. Baxter had the key with him—a hand had been pushed through the paper over the back door, and the bolt pushed back—the bolt and staple of the yard door were knocked away, but the lock staple had been pushed in agai, and the door pulled to, so that any person passing would think the door was firmly fastened—the staple of the bolt was not put in at all—I found three pieces of cloth in a book bag in the yard—I went to the place where the gold was kept and found 2,500 gold leaves taken away, in books of 500 leaves each—there were five packets taken of twenty books each packet—they were taken from a corner recess in the shop; a shelf which I keep on purpose—I then went upstairs to the workshop where the gold leaf is kept in use, and it was all taken away—I cannot say exactly how much was gone, but to the best of my recollection, between 800 and 900—it was worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the gold dust and gold rags about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—the first 500 were in a corner were I work, tied up in packets, and the other was in little recesses where it is put ready for use.</p>

I carry on business in Manchester, and at 63, Fleet-street, London, as a washing-machine manufacturer—I employed the prisoner at Manchester as an assistant clerk at wages of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I subsequently caused him to come to London to manage the business there Mr. Giles is my managing man there—the prisoner's duties were to receive money and take orders, and to send whatever money there was beyond paying the servant's wages, to Manchester every week—when he received money he had to enter it in the cash-book—in consequence of information I received, I came to London and spoke to the prisoner—I had previously been up to London and discovered something wrong, but he had not given me a full statement of what was wrong; and when I came up on 16th, he handed me this book in his writing—on the previous occasion I said to him, "There is something wrong here, Bate"—that was about three weeks ago—I had got some papers that he had left, which I showed him, and he said, "Yes, there is Sir; I confess that I have been doing wrong"—I said, "Well, now tell me what you have done, whether it is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., let me know the worst"—he then gave me this list in writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the amount then deficient was about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said there was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which he had not accounted for—I said to him, "Mr. Giles is coming back to-night: you must go through the books, or I cannot allow you to go from here"—I returned to Manchester and subsequently came to town again on 16th—I then bad another conversation with the prisoner—I said I was very sorry to see that he had not told me all—he was silent—I said it was a very serious matter as to whether he thought I could stand it—he begged for mercy, and said, "Well, Sir, I confess that I have done wrong"—I said, "What have you done with the money?"—he said, "I have spent it."</p>

I had to come up to London to take Mr. Giles's place, and put up at a coffee-house; I thought I was only to come up for two or three days; it cost me 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week there. I had to buy fresh clothes, as I had only brought one change of linen. As regards Mr. Hade's account, I recollect the circumstance very well; he said he owed another balance and would come and pay it shortly. It is not likely that I should deliberately and dishonestly take money; it is very probable that money was paid to me and I have put it in my pocket when I was called away for something else; it is possible that certain accounts, without intention, were omitted. As to embezzling or stealing I totally deny that I have done it; I could have run away with double or treble the amount. I surrendered myself; is it likely that if I was guilty I should have done that? I was put into a situation that I knew nothing about; I am a bad book-keeper, and could not live on 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; that is my only fault.</p>

I live at 7, Duck-court, Great Peter-street, West<lb/>minster—on 2d September, about 10 minutes before 12, I saw Mrs. Maloney—I asked her how she was—she said quite well—I asked how her children were—she said they were quite well; and I asked how her husband was—I asked her where she was going; and she said she was going to get her husband's dinner—she was quite sober—about 10 minutes past 12, from something that was said to me, I went into the court—I saw the prisoner standing outside his own door with his hands behind him—I did not say anything to him—I went into the room to Mrs. Maloney, and she was quite dead on the floor—she was lying with her hand on her forehead, like that, and this hand (<hi rend="italic">the left</hi>) on her chest—I came outside, and said to the prisoner, "Mr. Maloney, your wife is dead"—he said, "Yes, I knew that my wife was dead about 10 minutes"—I did not hear him call for the doctor; I came down the court then and sent a young boy for the doctor—that is all I know about it—I did not hear the prisoner say anything about the doctor.</p>

I am a labouring man—on 2d September I was at work at the new house of the Duke of Buccleugh—the prisoner was working with me that morning—I had gone to work along with him in the morning—we had had two pots of beer among four of us before we went to work that morning, about half-past 7 o'clock—we began work at—the prisoner was one of the four that partook of the beer, and the others were two men that we met in the street—we had a pint of beer each at 10 o'clock, and half a quartern of rum each about half-past 8, just as we were going to work—the prisoner had a pint of beer along with me at 10 o'clock, we had a pint apiece—at 12 o'clock we left work to go home to our dinner—the prisoner came with me as far as the bottom of Victoria-street, and he turned off from me there to go to his dinner—before we got to Victoria-street, as we went I along Parliament street, we had a pot of beer between three of us, the pri<lb/>soner was one of them; that was at the Red Lion, in Parliament-street—I separated from him at the bottom of Victoria-street—he said to me, "Don't you come away from home before I call for you; I shall not be long having my dinner, and we will have a pot of beer before we go back to work; don't you start away from your home till I call for you"—the prisoner was quite sober at this time—I live in Artillery-square, Strutton-ground—that is about two or three minutes walk from Legg-court where the prisoner lives—while I was at my dinner my boy came in and called me, and I went at once from my place to Legg-court—there were not a good many persons collected in the court when I got there; I did not see above two or three—the prisoner was in the house when I got there</p>

I am a surgeon, residing at Denbigh-street, Pimilico—I am also a Doctor of Medicine—about the middle of the day, a little after 12 o'clock, on Monday, 2d September, I was called to a house in Legg-court—a young man, seventeen or eighteen years of age, came for me—I do not know his name—I recognised him here yesterday—I went into the room on the ground-floor—there were a good many persons in the room, quite a dozen, I should say—it is a very small room; I heard it stated as nine feet by ten, and t have no doubt that is correct—I did not measure it myself—I judge it to be about that—as I entered the door there was a table; the door just escaped the end of the table—I saw the body of the deceased lying on the floor when I entered the room; indeed I had some difficulty in passing into the room—the feet of the deceased were against the door, so that I had to push a little on one side to enter the room—the body was lying across the room—the table was between the lady and the window—her feet were towards the door, and her head towards the fireplace—her feet were at the corner of the table—the door opened inwards—the hinges of the door were towards the bedstead—as the door opened it would go against her feet—the fire-place was facing the door—her head was within, probably, eighteen inches of the fire-place; perhaps it might be two feet—her body nearly covered the whole floor—the prisoner was among the other persons there when I went in—I could not speak to where he was—before I removed the body from the floor I observed a wound on the left side, of</p>

               <p>the neck—it was half way between the perpendicular portion of the neck and the apex of the shoulder on the left side (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position on his own person</hi>)—it was nearer the shoulder than the base of the neck, just over the collar bone—I subsequently made a doable post mortem examination—finding she was dead, I asked assistance to raise the body on to the bed—I called on the prisoner to assist me; he was one man present among others—I did not know that there was any connexion between them at that time—I said, "Just assist me with her on to the bed,' and he objected—he said, "No, I won't"—O'Connor and a woman came forward and assisted me—the first examination I made was a superficial or external examination—I found the wound measured exactly three-quarters of an inch—the direction of it was from the apex of the shoulder, towards the neck—it was a logitudinal wound, not a transverse one, along the line of the collar bone—the weapon must have been in a longitudinal position when it inflicted the wound, not held transversely—it did not penetrate the shoulder; it penetrated the cavity of the chest—the wound descended almost perpendicularly down<lb/>wards—the probe yielded a measurement of an inch and a quarter in depth, but upon my second examination, when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination from within, I found that the wound had penetrated the cavity of the chest; upon my first examination I was unable to state that—I cannot say to what depth the weapon had penetrated the chest, because upon penetrating the cavity it might have gone the whole length—I should say the whole depth of the solid structures from without inwards would not measure more than an inch and a half, scarcely that—when you had passed through that inch and a half you would get to the cavity of the chest—it had to pass through the integuments, the cellular tissue, and the pleura, which is in<lb/>cluded in the cavity at that point—the knife had divided the subclavian artery which crosses that particular spot—it is immediately underneath the integuments at the particular point where it was divided—I have seen the knife produced—I should say that knife would cause the wound I saw—it was placed in my hand for the purpose of ascertaining that fact, and I found that it corresponded exactly with the external and internal appearances—all I can say is that such a knife would have done it, and this knife corresponded with the wound—it might be done with a knife of that shape and size—I did not see the knife the day I went to the house—I saw it afterwards at the police-court; I think on the succeeding day, I am not quite sure—it is a sharp knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it require any force to inflict the wound you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it would require a very sharp blow—the wound was three-quarters of an inch longitudinally—the knife is scarcely as much as that—I have no doubt that in withdrawing the weapon from the wound it must have been with drawn in the same direction—when I had seen the nature of the wound I spoke to the prisoner—I believe I first asked if the deceased was his wife—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "How did it happen; have you been quarrel<lb/>ing?"—he said, "No; I had come in to my dinner, and had taken my knife and placed it beside my plate, when she took it up and stabbed her<lb/>self"—I understood him to say he had taken his "penknife," but no doubt it was his "pocket-knife"—the wound was not a transverse one—it was in the direction of the apex of the shoulder—there was nothing to indicate whether the edge of the wound was towards the shoulder end of the apex or towards the throat—when the prisoner told me about her having inflicted the wound herself with the knife, I said, "Where is the knife?"—he said, "After she had done it, she threw it away somewhere about the room."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at the wound as you subsequently ascertained it to be upon our <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, its position and direction, was it a wound which in your opinion the deceased could have inflicted upon herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, certainly, she might do so—in order to inflict it herself the blow must have been perpendicular; in this manner (<hi rend="italic">describing it to the Jury</hi>)—on my second <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, examination I found that it had a slight bending back<lb/>wards, that is to say the lips of the wound externally and internally did not correspond exactly—it was not precisely vertical—it had an oblique direction, the point going towards the back—I mean the wound within the chest did not exactly correspond with that on the surface.</p>

September in consequence of Mr. Dales bankruptcy—I cannot give you the amount of our debts—our liabilities included some acceptances we gave to Dales, and the whole amount, including those, was upwards of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but not a great deal upwards—I do not know what amount has been realised: I have not the smallest notion—it is more than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not prepared to swear that anything has been realised because I have not had access to the books, and have heard nothing of the matter—the first conversation with Dales was in January—we had had previous small transactions in December—we were not at this time dealing with Parker at all—the first parcel we sent to Parker on his own account was February 29th, 1860—(I saw Parker in Dales' office)—this continued for about three months: it closed on May 9th—the total amount of goods which Parker had on his own account was 3,267<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we had a person largely indebted to us named Debeck—I cannot tell you the amount of his debt, because I cannot tell what bills are paid—I have no means of telling you how much he is our debtor—I have not the particulars of bankruptcy here—I do not know whether those bills have been paid or not—I cannot tell you the amount of the debt at the time of the bankruptcy or of the goods not paid for without the balance-sheet—I can give you the total amount of goods we supplied to Debeck, it is 1,769<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I may be in error 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but under 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—I have not attributed our bankruptcy at all to Barker and Debeck's debts as well as to Mr. Dales—Dales made an assignment of all his property—I certainly did not press him to do so, on the ground that Barker and Debeck's debts, and</p>

               <p>some others in Glasgow, had to involved us, that we must have his property to help us—we pressed him for the assignment because he promised us 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and afterwards 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then he reduced it to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had a telegram saying that we should have 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the following morning; but we were under no pressure from our bankers—we pressed him because we wanted his money to go on with, and I think I did say that in consequence of Debeck's and other losses we could not find the money; but we should not have stopped on that account, because we had 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—we did not have a meeting in Birmingham or London before that assignment, in which we pressed Dales to take goods and got 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent advanced on them—I never dined with Mr. Dales near London-bridge—he dined with us at Ander<lb/>ton's hotel—that is the only place.</p>

               <p>at which my partner was present, at which we agreed to assist Mr. Dales to the extent of a considerable sum of money to carry on the patent—we never agreed to assist him at all—I remember an interview at which we agreed to accept bills for Mr. Dales; that was, I think, 5th May, 1860—on that oc<lb/>casion we accepted bills for his accommodation to 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a bill of his due on 26th May, for 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was also a bill of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then running—those two bills the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not cover over transactions at that time—on April 24th we sent him 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the total amount of debts that we claim now from Mr. Dales; it is about 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including the bills; I am speaking from memory only—that is for goods, and for the accommodation bills—when we gave him accept<lb/>ances which he wanted for his patent that includes the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accommoda<lb/>tion bills—I do not think they have been paid, they fell due after the bankruptcy—the total amount of our goods is 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sorry I have not his balance-sheet here, or I could tell you exactly—I say that he cannot our bankruptcy—I did not say that we received nothing during July; certainly not—from the commencement of the transaction we received in bills paid and in cash 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we received 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash in July.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At this interview which I have alluded to on 5th May when the 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills were accepted, I believe a conversation arose about a contract with the Brighton Railway for some works? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ton are in error about 5th May, because it was in London these bills were accepted, in Dales' office—it was in London that I agreed to give them—he was not in Birmingham on 5th May—I was in London—I would not fix the date at all—I said that it might be 5th May—there was an interview in London at our office, and not at Birmingham, at which it was agreed to advance 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was not shown on that occasion; I never saw it before—I do not remember that it was explained to me that the contract on the Brookvills and Ottawa Railway required a large amount for its completion; some<lb/>thing? did not occur—it was not explained to me that a very large sum of money would be required for completing the contract on the Brockvills and Ottawa railway, nor to either of my partners, in my presence—I did not know that the contract was not completed, I never enquired, because it was on the door of his office—I had not such implicit confidence in him that I enquired nothing about it, but he said that he had agreed with Mean Gurney to advance upon them when they arrived—I did hear Simpsons name—the goods were supplied for shipping—Mr. Dales did not tell me that a person named Simpson would advance eighty per cent directly they was shipped—he told me nothing about Simpson—I asked him at the recasting at Manchester, when we had Mr. Dales with us, about his patent—I was asked if I had heard that the goods had gone to Simpson, and I said, "No, I never heard of his name"—the first time I heard Mr. Simpson's name was when he said, "No, that he had sent them to a person named Simpson—that was on 23d August, 1860—at the meeting of our creditors in the office of Sole and Worthington, solicitors, Manchester, I asked him the question, and he said that Simpson had made no advance upon them—I never heard of the Brighton Railway contract—I heard that he was trying to get a contract for a branch of some railway, but I do remember the name—he said that he had taken a contract with a railway company—we did not agree to advance him money and supply him with the means of going on with it—I do not know when we heard about the contract with the railway company, heard so many things; it did not interest us any more than if we sold the goods and got the money, and those were inducements to us give him</p>

               <p>credit, because we believed he was making money very fast—I do not know. then I first heard of the railway contract; it has gone altogether from my mind—on 10th May, the bill of 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due, and was dishonoured—on 11th July the bill of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., became due; that was before any of these goods were supplied—that was honoured—I do not know on what day I was first examined before the Alderman, it is about three months since—I do not know whether the examinations of myself and the other witnesses extended over a month—I neither suggested or produced these letters until to-day—I saw Parker there one day—I did not know that he was subpoened as a witness—he was not examined during my stay—I do not know how I happened to get these letters addressed to Carlton and Co.—they are people who we do business with, large merchants in Manchester, and to whom we were largely indebted—the bulk of these goods were supplied by Carlton and Co.—I think they are the largest creditors we had—it was in June that we had first knowledge of Dales' bankruptcy—it is impossible to fix a day; perhaps Mr. Thompson might; he is here—excuse me, I think I can tell you the date (<hi rend="italic">Looking at the bill-book</hi>), no, I cannot, for these bills are not entered here; they are in the official assignees hands—it was in June—on that occasion I believe I saw the piece of paper which you have put into my hands—it was not explained to me that the claim upon the Ottawa and Brockville Railway Company was in consequence of that uncompleted contract—he said that he had been bankrupt with his brother—we were not aware that his brother and he had been bankrupt—he said that he had paid all the claims of the bankruptcy except some 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had no farther liabilities—I was sure he had not any contract with the Canada Railway since 1858, and had not become possessed of 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bonds since the bankruptcy—I presumed that that was before the first bankruptcy, and that he had that left after satisfying all demands, and that he had met those demands, with the exception of 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we asked him for the 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of bonds, and he said that they were delayed in consequence of the new issue, and had not arrived in this country—the statement to us was, that he had 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest in the Brockville and Ottawa Railway Company—that was previous to our knowledge of his bankruptcy—I am referring to a conversation in June, when we heard that he had been brankrupt with his brother, and we asked him the question—he told us of his former bankruptcy, and that he had satisfied all the calls except 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bonds due to him—he produced that paper, and said that the whole of the liabilities of that bankruptcy had been satisfied except 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stated that since his first bankruptcy, he had still that 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that all was satisfied, and that this was die to him; that he had got 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest in the railway to meet the 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he still owed—I did not ask him if he had acquired that since his bankruptcy—he said that the Railway Company were in difficulties, and could not pay, and there was a new issue, in consequence of which he said was the non-arrival of the bonds—he did not tell me that the contract with the Railway Company was not completed, and I did not inquire—I mean to say that distinctly—he made no representation as to the sale of the patent for the fluid to the Leicester Manure Company—I heard him say once that he had some patents which were in use at Leicester—I did not wish him to go down and sell the patent in order to raise 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in order to get some cash—I supposed he was entitled to 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not go to the Bankrapley Court to make any inquiry—I am certain of that—I never said that I went to inspect the schedule of his previous bankruptcy—it never occurred to me</p>

               <p>to me to do it—we understood that hit former bankruptcy was discharge except that 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and therefore we made no furthern enquiry about it—we made no inquiry about the Brockville and Ottawa Railway Company farther than what has been stated—we obtained an assignment from Dales on 10th August of all his property in it, and I suppose Mr. Hall, the solicitor, who made out the assignment for us, took possession of all his papers—on the 17th, we petitioned the Court of Bankruptcy for a adjudication; I believe that was superseded on the ground that it was made against good faith—I do not know whether it was the insufficiency of the act of bankruptcy, or the insufficiency of the assignment; I am not a lawyer—I never heard anything from Mr. Dales of the completion of the contract—I presumed he had done with the railway when he had got his bonds—there is a letter enclosing the bond which was seat over, allowing under what circumstances it was sent—I have not got it—there was no arrangement before the letter to send one as a specimen; we never asked our bankers, but Mr. Dales I believe did, to see whether they would advance him money upon it—I believe he went—we showed the bond to our bankers, not to ask for an advance of money, but to show that the bonds were arriving—we gave the bond into the hands of our solicitor, and it afterwards appeared that the bond was only borrowed, and not his—we were not pressed for money at all; we never were in difficulties with one banker's at all—our bills for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due on 5th August, and we were to have had 5,000., previously to that from Mr. Dales, and we received a telegram saying that he had completed a loan of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the money should be at Lubbock's on the day following—I went there and showed the telegram and requested that they would not honour our bills until they had the money—the bills were coming due on 4th August—it was about August 2d that I went to our banker's—they did not advance us money; you understood me wrongly, I said that we had bills coming due on 4th August, and we should have all this money on 1st August—Mr. Tomp<lb/>son come up on 2d August to see about the money, and telegraphed that on the following morning we should have the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at that time we were indebted to our banker's to a large amount, and these bills were coming due on the 4th, which would have made our account about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I went and showed the telegram, and said "If the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is there meet our acceptances, if not, refuse them, and we must call a meeting of our creditors because we cannot go on without"—we were indebted to our banker's between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in consequence of that we directed them not to honour bills then coming due.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission merchant, and carry on business at Sise-lane, London—I believe my first transaction with Dales was on 1st May, 1860—here are my books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the account I rendered to the bankrupt's estate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a fact that I received into my possession all these goods; they appear in my books—my first transaction with Dales was on 1st May; he gave me goods to ship—I had some conversation with him—a person named Eli Read, I believe, introduced me to him—he asked me whether I would take any goods on consignment, to ship for him—I said, "Yes, if it will suit me; I will take them"—Eli Read gets his living, I suppose, as well as he can, it is not my business; as agent or something, I do not know—they were of the nominal value of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he said he came from Mr. Dale's—I suppose he was employed by Mr. Dale—I had known him for years—he was not a servant of mine—I never pay him anything—I have given him a shilling now and then, but that is not paying—if a man asks me to lend him a trifle, I do so—I have lent to Read half-a-crown at a time for many years—he introduced me to Mr. Dales and asked me if I would take goods on consignment—I said to Mr. Dales that I should export them to Hamburgh—I did not say so to Read—I was to export them to my correspondent there, J. Hezekiel—he is not a partner or relation of mine, merely my correspondent—I advanced Mr. Dales money on the different deliveries—I have got the first transaction entered—it is "Goods consigned value 351<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I gave him in addition 234<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I charge a <hi rend="italic">boneficiatio;</hi> that is what you term a commission—I charged Dale 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—he paid me my commission—I did not get paid back again—I paid him 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent out of that—I advanced 5 per cent. on the 234<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the nominal value of the goods was 351<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also find the amount of my advance in my cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I consigned these goods to Hezekiel—there was an account between us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any account between you and Dales to be paid over to him beyond the sum originally advanced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have advanced the money and I have got a lien upon the goods—if the goods fetch more than the advance I shall have to pay the amount to the bankrupt or to his assignees—I have not got the book of sales—I went on receiving these things from May to August—I shall not send in the account to the bankrupt till all the goods are sold, then I will make up my account, and what is due to the creditors I will pay—I have my ledger here—this is Dales' account.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that what you call exporting to Hamburgh? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could do what I liked with them, and when I bought them for the German market I shipped them—I had authority to do what I liked with them—I cannot tell whether Dales owes me any money upon this transaction of Wilhelms' till I make out the account—I have made out the account, and he paid me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you to pay money to Mr. Dales, or does the estate owe you money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never looked into it—if I have 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every farthing over I shall hand over to the assignees, if the goods do not fetch so much then I shall have a claim which I suppose I shall not get.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, C</hi>). I examined Mr. Weedon's premises in Warwick-street where the robbery was committed—to the beet of my belief the parties entered by a skeleton-key to the passage-door—I ex<lb/>amined the door leading from the passage into the shop, and found air marks between the door and door jamb, as if caused by a small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—the outer door had marks of being forced—there were some desks in the shop, on the right-hand side, behind the door—they were broken open by means of a small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I received the three prisoners into my custody—the lad Anderson came to the station and into my office—I said, "To the best of my belief we have got three men for the robbery in Warwick-street; I will have those placed with a number of others, so that you may have the means, in a fair way, of identifying them from the others"—I spoke to the superintendent, and by his orders I had eight or nine men, living in the section-house, dressed in plain clothes, brought up and placed in the reserve-room with the three prisoners—I took Anderson into the room, and he picked the three prisoners from the others—I won't be certain whether there were eleven or twelve altogether—none of my men had on police trousers or police boots—it was the particular order of the superintendent that they should not wear them—the prisoners were not placed in any peculiar position—they were mixed with them.</p>

               <p>some steps to the section-house—they communicate with each other through the basement—the reserve room is at the rear of a passage leading from the front door—my room is half-way between the passage and the reserve-room—that passage does not communicate with the section-house at the other and—you have to go down some steps close against the reserve-room, and they lead into the section-house—a person going into the section-house from the station, would not pass along by my room—a person seated in my office could not see any person entering the reserve-room—the passage runs right through from the front door—about the centre of the passage is the door that leads into my office—then there is another outer door owning from our office, which leads into the reserve-room; you have to come out into a further passage to go into the reserve-room; and at the commencement of the reserve-room there are steps which lead into the section-house—Anderson remained in my room while the men were brought into the reserve-room, and he could not have seen them brought in—the three prisoners were placed in the dock before they were brought into the reserve-room—they were in the reserve-room when Anderson was taken into my office—they did not come past my office to go into the reserve-room, while Anderson was there—the men were not standing all in a row against the wall, but grouped together, standing in and out—it is not true that the three prisoners were as one side of the room, and the other men on the other, nor in a line against the wall—I am quite sure of that.</p>

               <p>the door of Mr. Weedon's shop, and the prisoners Duvall and Hamilton each brought out a roll of cloth and pot it on the cab; there was a great quantity inside the cab—it came out at Mr. Weedon's private door—I have made a mistake, it was Hamilton and Goddard that came out—Duvall got on the box and drove off—I heard afterwards of the robbery and then gave the number of the cab, and the description of the men—I took the number of the cab—Hamilton had on a dark coat that day—I saw the three men when they were in custody, amongst nine private clothes policemen—I was takes into a room where they were mixed with the men, and I picked them out—I did not know any of the policemen before—I did not know who they was when I went in—I did not know till afterwards, that they were policeman—I have no doubt about Duvall being one of the men that I saw, nor about Hamilton.</p>

I am rather hard of hearing—I am the mother of Henry Hamilton, and live at 13, Palace-road, Westminster-road—the prisoner Hamilton was residing with me up to Wednesday, 21st August—I think it was about 10 o'clock when he left that morning—my daughter was sent for to go into the country on the 20th, and she went on the 21st, and he took her to the station—the train went at a quarter-past 10—Helyer, the last witness, also went with them—he called between 7 and 8 o'clock-Hamilton did not leave my house between 7 and 10 o'clock, because he was with me the greatest part of the time, assisting me in what I had to do—I have no other reason why I know it was Wednesday, the 21st, only I know that was the day—I remember there being a fete at the Crystal Palace on the 20th—my daughter was sent for by an aunt to go into the country—my son was at home on that evening—I saw him from about 9 o'clock till 11, when he went to bed—no one else was present besides myself and daughter when Helyer called in the evening—I do not recollect any one calling on the Tuesday between 9 and 11 o'clock—my daughter is in the country now.</p>

               <p>does at some times—the next morning I was preparing ray daughter to go into the country, helping her to pack—I think I was tip at 6 o'clock—I went and called Hamilton about 7 o'clock, as I always did—I have a clock in the house—I did not not go and look at it—I can hear it, although I am rather deaf—I get my living by letting lodgings—the house is full of lodgers—my husband does not support me—he does not do much; he is very much deranged in his mind—I have been married twice—the prisoner is by my first husband—that is how his name is Hamilton, and mine is Swyer—if I had known anything about it I should have gone to the police-office, but I did not know anything about it—he wrote to me a day or two after he was apprehended to tell me of his apprehension—I did not go the examination at the police-office after his apprehension—I knew he was not guilty, and I did not think there was any occasion to go, or else I should have gone—he wrote to me to tell me that he was accused of a robbery on 21st August—he said it was false.</p>

               <p>Hamilton come out of the beer-shop and go towards Goddard's home, up Bark-place, with Duvall, who lived next door to Goddard—they went into Duvall's—I did not see them come out—I watched about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I did not know Hamilton at that time; I had known him before, but I had forgotten him—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the person—I remembered his face—I am perfectly sure about the time, because I remember that I left the Paddington police-station about—I returned straight back; I was on duty on that night, and I went home straight on purpose—I got back at about half-past 10; it might be a little later, a quarter to 11.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PATER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you enter the beer-shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was outside the whole time, watching them; a distance off—I went to another public-house and could not find them, and then I went to this beer-shop—I was waiting outside an hour and three quarters, at least—they were at the public-house all that time—I went to Marlborough-street police-court to give this evidence, but was not called as a witness—I presented myself as a witness, and was told by the inspector that I should be subpœnaed here—I cannot say whether Doble presented himself at the police-court—I remember warning him to attend, but whether he did or not, I do not know.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Duvall.

Caslons,' who are letter-founders in Chiswell-street—I have seen some of the packages of Bourgeois Roman type produced at the police-court by the officer—I identified those that I packed up, the Bourgeois Italic and the Bourgeois Roman—a day or two afterwards the prisoner gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it to him first and he made an addition to it—he told me to write out what sorts were wanted to com<lb/>plete the fount at Messrs. Skipper's, and also to complete the fount they were getting up for him—I wrote upon that card some description of type, to complete the fount—I filled in the letters and the prisoner filled in the quan<lb/>tities on the card—he told me to take it on to Messrs. Caslons' and to bring enough type to complete the fount that he wanted—I then took this card on to Messrs. Caslons' and got from them a small package of type—that was on Skipper and East's responsibility—Mr. Dredge sent me for it on their account—I got an invoice with the type—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a small quantity coming to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it is made out to Skipper and East—I took it to their premises direct from Messrs. Caslons'—I saw the prisoner at Skipper and East's, opened the packet, and he told me to take it round to his premises—I took it round some time afterwards—when I went with the officer, when the prisoner's premises were taken possession of, I found this identical package there—I kept possession of the invoice for my own satis<lb/>faction—the date of it is 7th May.</p>

Caslons'—Mr. Dredge's father was in the employment of Messrs. Skipper and East, I have heard, for fifty-four years—I believe young Mr. Skipper's father is alive—I have not seen him this last week or two—I do not think he is dead—he is about sixty years of age, I think—I cannot say whether it was two or three months ago when I last saw him—I did not see him at the Mansion house—I will swear that—I have not seen him at Mr. Humphrey's the solicitor's—I do not know whether it was in the street or in the shop that I last saw him—he looked very well—I have not spoken to him since the day I was apprenticed in 1854—I do not think he attends to the business, I have not seen him—the young gentleman is 23—I know that because he swore it at the Mansion-house—I have spoken to him since my apprenticeship, but I never saw him for two or three years after; I last saw him, last night at the place of business—the Bourgeois Italic, and the Bour<lb/>geois Roman type that I wrote on "Must not be opened," was never opened or used—Dredge told me he wanted to use them for a certain job when it came in—he had to chance getting the job, he hoped to get it—I think I am on friendly terms with him—I have not spoken to him since his apprenchen<lb/>sion—before that we were on friendly terms—I had no unfriendly feeling towards him; I am sure of that—I had not a friendly feeling towards him; I had no feeling—I have no enmity towards him whatever—I treat him as I do anybody else—I know that directly after the fire at Skipper and East's, in March, 1860, Mr. Dredge did a few jobs for them, not before to my knowledge—he had a middling stock of type for the use of his office it was a very small office; he employed an apprentice and an errand boy—he did not employ two or three men—I have worked there myself, for Mr. Dredge, but I was in Messrs. Skippers' employ—I did not work for them, not after the fire—I do not know that Mr. Dredge lent the whole of his type to them after the fire—I am sure he did not, he did his own work—I will swear that he did not—I do not know whether old Mr. Skipper is here, he may be; I don't know that he has purposely abstained from being here—all Skipper and East's type was destroyed by the fire, except one or two forms—Mr. Dredge printed the work they had to do after the fire—I know that, I am sure of it, at his office, and with his type—I did not work there myself, I believe one or two of Skipper and East's men were send down—there were a great many orders on hand at the time of the fire—the prisoner's father has left since this affair—I really do not know whether young Mr. Skipper is here himself—I have seen him this morning, within the last hour or hour and half—I cannot swear that he is here now—I know of a printing job for a Mr. Strawmeyer, a label for some cement barrels a portion of that job was printed at his office—I swear I do not know that Keeling's price current was printed from Mr. Dredge's type, it might have been; to the best of my belief it was not printed on Skipper and East prem<lb/>ises—I know that Ellis' broadside was printed by Mr. Dredge for skipper and East at his place—there is a person named Smith, a store-keeper, in their employ—I did not see him at the Mansion-house, he has gone now, he was there two or three days after the prisoner's committal—I have not heard that Mr. Humphreys has examined Smith three or four times—I should have heard it if it were so—printing was going on at Mr. Dredge's for one</p>

Skippers'—type deteriorates in Take by being used, it wastes; none of the Bourgeois Roman and Italic has been used, the panels hare never been opened—I do not know that the type that has been used by Mr. Dredge has been returned to Skipper and East's, I have been told that it has, I can't swear that it has—there was a young man named Tutt, an apprentice of Mr. Dredge's, he was examined at the Man<lb/>sion-house—old Mr. Skipper has never been examined to my knowledge—I do not know that a certain printing, called royal-broadside, for a Mr. Bate, was done at Dredge's, or that some was done for a Mr. Stamp—I believe some for Drake was done there, I cannot say—I know that some broadside for Ellis and Son was done—the prisoner was not supplied by Mr. Dredge—I know that he printed some royal headings for the Bank of Austria, at his own place, for Messrs. Skipper and East—I do not known any<lb/>thing of a copper-plate press that was destroyed in the fire, and which he his never been paid for—I have heard that old Mr. Dredge used to carry on the business before his son did—I do not know that he was in the con<lb/>stant habit of sending type to Skipper and East—I occasionally worked on type belonging to Skipper and East, or Dredge, on Dredge's premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing chemist in Dennett's-read, Hatcham—on 4th September last, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in an omnibus proceeding from the Montague Arms to London—it was the omnibus of which the prisoner was the conductor, and the deceased the driver—when the omnibus started the deceased was acting as conductor, and said the prisoner as driver—when they changed horses they also changed, the conductor became driver, and the driver became conductor—a dispute com<lb/>menced between them at the Shard Arms in the Kent-road, and continued until the accident—at the time of the accident, or just before, the conductor had been disputing, and he said, "What is that you say?"—and ran quickly up the steps of the omnibus—I heard him cross the roof, and I presently saw the driver and conductor come tumbling down the side of the omnibus, and I felt two jerks of the omnibus—I got out and saw the deceased lying apparently dead in the road, and the prisoner scrambling up—there were a good many angry remarks between them before this occurred—I was looking out of the window of the omnibus—I did not notice it until I got to the Shard Arms, and then my attention was called particularly to it had been going on before, but I had not noticed it—I think the conductor was quite sober—I could see him when he was acting as conductor.</p>

Cavanah said, "It is not me, I hope you don't think it is me." The prosecutor said, "You are a liar 1" and then there was a fight between them; he struck Cavanah; I don't know which struck first I wanted Thomas to come away; but he would not, but went and sat down on the kerb-stone.

Just as we came out, one of the females said, "There is a man going to be locked up." I said "Oh!" and saw three policemen, and one with a roll of carpet. On Thursday night I was at the Elephant and Castle, and a policeman tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Is your name Warre? "I said, "No; my name is William North." He said, "I want you for a robbery." I said, "I have done no robbery." I went down with him to the station. He said, "You know something of a roll of Brussels carpet?" I said, "No." He said, "Do you know a man named Farrell?" I said "No;" and then I remembered the man I saw a New-street with a roll of carpet. I said, "I do remember seeing a man with a roll of carpet with the policeman." He said, "That is the man." I thought they had taken me for that man. They are mistaken. I am inno<lb/>cent.

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Frederick Besley, the proprietor of Nicholson's Wharf, and Beale's Wharf—a large quantity of tea is bonded at Beale's Wharf—a great portion of it is disposed of by public auction at Mincing-lane—before those auctions take place, samples are allowed to be taken, on the production of an authority, in the shape of a card, signed by Mr. William Thompson, who is secretary to the Broker's Association—any person coming with a proper card would proceed to sample—it was the foreman's duty to take out the samples and show them—Storer was the sale foreman in our employ, and Bartlett was employed occasionally an assistant sale-foreman—both of them had been in our employ some years—they were perfectly well aware of the rules and regulations as to samples—if persons came there with a proper card, they would not be allowed to take away tea, without giving returns, in even quality and quantity—it was the duty of the party who served the individual to receive those returns—book was kept of the persons who came to sample—they signed the book—they sign their own names, and the name of the firm for whom they sample, and also the number of the card, and authority, and the size of the measure which they are entitled to take—it was more particularly Storer's duty to see that the book was signed by the persons requiring samples—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a show of tea at Beale's Wharf on Satur<lb/>day, 14th September, preparatory to public auction—I find a number of names entered in the book—it is filled up in the usual way, with the excep<lb/>tion that the signature of the foreman who attends to individuals is not here—I do not find any person named Harris here—I know Storer's and Bartlett's writing—I find no entry in their writing here on that day—I know Storer had charge of the book on that day.</p>

               <p>aware of the regulations with regard to the card—I was present on Satur<lb/>day 14th, when Bartlett and Storer were brought into the counting-house by Lloyd, the police-constable at Nicholson's Wharf—I did not ask then any questions—I heard Bartlett say something in answer to a question that was asked him—I did not hear the question—something was said about returns—Bartlett said they were going to be sent subsequently, and Storer <hi rend="italic">endorsed</hi> that observation—I hare never heard of samples being taken without returns being made at the time.</p>

Goddard &amp; Co's; my brother, Frederick Besley, is there now—he is in the habit of taking samples of tea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose he came without his card; left it behind by accident, would not the man allow him to come in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard of such an instance and I have been in charge of that department about five years—I should not know of it, or have any means of hearing of it unless some one told me—the men have no authority to have any option in the matter—I think Bartlett has been eleven years in our service, and Storer about fire—they were both there before I had the management at all—there have been other men besides them there, but not of late—if two or three people came in together, both men might or might not attend to one party—both their writing is in the book frequently—it is their duty to see that the person taking the samples make the proper entry, and sign their names and the quantity of things taken, and the person showing, signs in this column—there are a number of separate entries of Bartlett and Storer—this book is inspected by us—it is not examined from day to day—I have never known an instance of samples being taken by persons well known to ourselves and our servants without their actually depositing other samples in their place—I have known an instance where we have sent our clerk up for a card when it was left behind—I do not know of any case where a person has been to different sales and come to our premises late in the day with his stock of returns exhausted, and has obtained samples from our premises and then sent returns on the next day—I think there have been cases where samples have been drawn and left in our custody—even if my brother had not brought his card, strictly the duty of the man would be, not to part with the samples; whether they have done so or not, I cannot say—it is a large room where these shows take place—I believe Bartlett can write and read writing easily—I cannot say it for a fact—I should not have put him into that position if I had not known it—it is the practice of our firm that person employed should be searched when they go in in the morning and when they leave the premises—there is a gate-keeper whose duty it is to search them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 111). I have been engaged in watching Beale's Wharf since 12th July—On 13th July I saw Bartlett go into Langbourn Chambers, come out, and meet Harris about half-way across the road—they then returned into the office—Bartlett at that time was carrying a blue bag, pretty well full—I afterwards saw him come out again—he had nothing with him then—Harris came to the end and saw him away—Langbourn Chambers is full of offices—there is a long passage to the house—the name of "James-Harris" is up there—I have been into the place—he occupies a small room on the second floor—there is no warehouse whatever—I next saw Bartlett on the 15th (<hi rend="italic">Referring to some memoranda</hi>)—he first came and fetched Harris from the shop in Lime street, and they both went into the Chambers together—I noticed nothing particular on that day—they remained then about ten minutes and then Bartlett went away by himself—on the 16th I saw Bartlett go to Harris's, fetch him from the shop, and they both went into Langbourn Chambers, and I noticed that Bartlett was buttoning up his clothes, putting himself together; his waistcoat was undone—on 17th June I saw him go in—he had a black bag in his hand, pretty well full, and in coming out he was folding it up, it was empty—on 20th July I again saw him go into Harris's office with his pockets full of something, and in coming cut he had a large blue bag three parts full—I watched him from Beale's wharf—he went into the Swan public house in Ring William-street first, and, then went into Langbourn Chambers, that was the first time I had teen him come from the wharf; he went almost every day for the last two months, generally carrying something in with him, sometimes in his pockets, and sometimes in a bag—I saw Harris on almost every occasion, Bartlett would go into the Chambers first, Harris would not be there, and then Bartlett would go over to the shop in lime-street, fetch Harris from there, and they would both go to the Chambers together—I had never seen anything what<lb/>ever pass between them up to the Saturday that I took them into custody—on 3d August I was going myself to sample, and on getting to the door I met Harrris coming out; he had a large blue bag full of something; it was the</p>

               <p>same sort of bag that I have described as carried by Bartlett—I want and took samples and gave returns—I noticed the book, and saw that Harris's had not signed it—both the other prisoners were there—the book that has been produced was lying in its ordinary place—it was about midday, between 12 and 1—on that same evening I saw Bartlett go into Harris's office—I had previously seen Bartlett and Storer coming away from the warehouse together; when they got about three parts over the bridge, Bartlett would stap on ahead—sometimes Storer would take the other side of the way—I never saw them bring anything away from Beale's wharf—I have seen Bartlett bring<lb/>ing things away from the Swan, and from another public-house, and I have seen him before he has gone in—he has not taken anything in with him that I have seen—on 14th September I watched the entrance to Beale's wharf, and about I o'clock in the morning I saw Harris go in; I followed him ad went to the tea floor of the warehouse, he was then sitting at a table sampling, I took a seat at a table between the chest that was being sampled and Harris, Bartlett was at the chest and be took a tray of tea to Harris and called out, "Storer, here is a gentleman waiting when you art ready to come," referring to me, Storer then came to me and brought me a sample and then went away for a minute, I hallooed after hum "What is this folio and Bartlett hallooed to Storer, "This is the folio," and then Bartlett brought me my samples and Storer took two to Harris, Bartlett then took Harris another tray full of tea, and after Harris had packed the pareels up I saw him put them in his bag and go out of the tea floor—I got hold of my samplings as quick as I could, signed the book, and as I was going out Bartlett hallooed after me, "Have you signed the book?" I ran and caught Harris up in Tooley-street—he was then being followed by another constable, I signed the name of "Bow" in the book—I told Harris I was a police-officer, And I wanted to know the contents of that bug, he said "Tea," I said "Where did you get it," he said <hi rend="italic">"Nichol"</hi> going Nicholson, and he stopped and said, "Beale's wharf;" I said, "What description of tea is it?" he said, "Really I cannot say;" I said, "What quantity have you got or what quantity have you taken from Beale's wharf?" he said, "Can you re<lb/>member every one that you simple, if you can you are a clever follow I can-not;" with that I said, "You must come back with me to Beale's wharf;" going along I said, "Of course you have got your returns for what you have had;" he said, "I gave my returns when I had drawn my samples"—upon arriving at the wharf I took possession of the book and sent for Lloyd and Mr. Besley—upon their arrival they gave Harris into my searched—I searched him—I did Hot find any sample card upon him—I found in the bag, eight parcels of t en, which I identify as those he was packing up (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are five each parcel—I also found a canvass bag containing 7 lbs. of tea, and 15 1/2 lbs. loose in the large bag—this is the style of bag I bad seen Bartlett with—I subsequently searched Harris's chambers, I found no sampling card there or any bill-head of his business or anything of that kind—there was about 2 cwt of tea I should think—I was in a position to see what Harris did—I am quite sure Harris did not give any returns or show any card.</p>

Harris was facing me as I walked down—there were perhaps three or four samples before him—there are tables in the room whore the persons sit to examine the samples—I went to another table—I could touch Harris's table from where I was—Storer came and attended to me; it was Bartlett who called after me, "Have you signed the book?"—Bartlett and stored leave who called after me, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—that is the time their day's work ends—Beale's wharf is on the Surrey side of the river—Bartlett and Storer live on the Middlesex side—the nearest way would he over the bridge—they sometimes walked together fur a little way and there Bartlett would go on in front—I have been watching about two months; not from the secret place all the time—I could always see them leave—about the first seven days, I watched Harris's premises in Fenchurch-street—I have seen them over and over again come out of Beale's wharf after their day's work has been over—I simply took the samples up when I was sitting at the table—they are brought up in a tray and you fold them up in paper—I folded my own samples—I noticed every time they went and brought the tray full of tea—the blue bag was by Harris at the time—the tray was brought both by Bartlett and Storer, Bartlett brought the first tray them Storer brought two; and then Bartlett took the other and brought me two in the meanwhile.</p>
