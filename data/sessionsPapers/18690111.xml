                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have an office in Great James' Street, Bedford Row—I live at 55, Oakley Square—on the night of 18th November, about 9.45, I was walking towards my office, intending to call for some papers—I had left Brett's hotel at 9.30, where I had been dining with a friend—I turned into a urinal in Jockey's Field's—there was a gas lamp over the urinal, and a boy was there with lighted candles in each compartment—there are, I think, three compartments—there was another man in the urinal—I was just on the point of turning out of the urinal when the prisoner came up, turned into the urinal, seized hold of my guard chain, which I had attached to my watch and the button hole of my waist<lb/>coat, and attempted to take it from me—I resisted, and took hold of him by his coat and waistcoat with my right hand—I had an umbrella in his left hand—this happened just within the urinal—the lamp was quite near—I could see most distinctly, everything, almost as the light of day—the prisoner immediately up with his left fist and struck me a violent blow across my lip—which cut my lip very much—I still retained my hold of him, and called out for help, and then he still retaining his hand on my chain, up with his fist and gave me a violent blow on my left eye—it cut my eye a good deal, and gave me very great pain—the effect of it was to knock me down in the urinal—I had been suffering from severe illness and was rather weak—I was perfectly sober—while I was down he made another violent try at my chain—he got it away from my waistcoat but left my watch in my pocket—the chain he took away—as soon as I got up I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186901110004"/>
               <p>to my office first, and immediately made a complaint to a policeman whom I met in Lamb's Conduit Street—he accompanied me to the police station, and I there gave a description of the person—at the time I was in the urinal I saw that he was a dark man with peculiar features, rather a prominent roundish nose, rather a short man and stoutly built—on Sunday, 29th November, ten or eleven days afterwards, I was called by the police to look at some men—four men were shown to me, among them was the prisoner—I recognized him as the man who had assailed me—but I could not swear very positively to him at the moment—it appeared to me that his features had a little changed, that he had extended his nostrils by breathing through them—but on seeing him the next morning in the waiting room I had no difficulty whatever in recognizing him—I am positive now that he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you saw me at the police station were there not two other men with me, and two policemen, about six feet high? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I don't know who they were, I should think they were about five feet high—I think I first said "I think he is the man, but he has not the same suit of clothes on"—I don't remember that I had any conversation with the constables after that—I went and looked at you again, and was even more confirmed in my impression than I was at first.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 163). I was at the station on 29th November, when the prisoner was there—I called in two young men who were passing by, and placed them and a policeman with the prisoner, and two others who were charged with him, named Edwards and Hopkins—the policeman was in plain clothes, and was about five feet seven or eight in height—the persons from the street were dressed in the same class of life as the prisoner, apparently—the prosecutor went to the prisoner and pointed to him—he was told to touch the one he knew, and he touched the prisoner—he did not point to anyone else—at the Bow Street Police Court the prisoner asked to see me, I refused last Session—he asked the Judge to let him see me—I went to him—I did not hold out any inducement or threat to him—he said "I did not steal the chain, I know who did, I saw the chain just after it was stolen"—he said it was done by three men living on the Dials—he told me their names, and mentioned a house in Charles Street, but said he could not say they were living there—he told me to apprehend them—he said they had not been to see him or sent him anything—he said it was an old fashioned round chain, he saw it in the beer shop on the Dials—I asked him the beer shop, he said he did not know—he said he believed the chain was sold in Barbican—I asked him where, and he then said, "Well, I don't think it was sold there."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SMITH</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). It was a very old-fashioned chain, I should think sixty or seventy years old, with large gold links; what would be called a cable chain—I had had it ten or twelve years—there was another man in the urinal, but this was the only one that attacked me, the other seemed to go away at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am innocent of the charge. I saw the man that had the chain in a public-house, shortly after it was stolen, and I gave a description of him. Mrs. Perry, the landlady of the public-house, could prove that I was in her place at 9 o'clock, and never moved out. I had a very bad cold, and had a mustard plaster on.</p>

On Saturday night, 28th November, I was on duty near the corner of Gray's Inn Road, with Carter, Policeman E 117; we were in plain clothes—about 12 o'clock, I saw the four prisoners, and a woman not in custody, standing at the corner of Gray's Inn Road, in conversation together—I watched them—they remained there about ten minutes—they then went down Holborn as far as the White Horse in Fetter Lane, all five together—two of them, I believe Hopkins and Williams, went into a lodging-house there, the others stopped outside—Hopkins and Williams came out of the lodging-house again, and joined the other three—they then went up Fetter Lane into Holborn, down Red Lion Street, through Princes Street, down Bedford Row, and through Feather-stone Buildings—they stopped there some minutes, and separated—two of them stopped opposite No. 20, Featherstone Buildings, which is a working jeweller's, two went past, and the other stood against the lamp-post in the centre—they then joined at the end of Featherstone Buildings, and went down Holborn together as far as Brownlow Street, went up Brownlow Street, along Bedford Street, and got to the corner of Featherstone Buildings again; they stood there, and then went along as far as Red Lion Street, down Red Lion Street into Holborn and into Featherstone Buildings—Hopkins, Singer, and Williams, and the woman not in custody, stood in a corner there, which is rather dark, and Edwards went up to the door-step of No. 20—the other four were standing nearly opposite No. 20—I went to the corner of Featherstone Buildings, and crossed over to Great Turnstile—Singer saw me and called out, and they all ran out—the two women crossed over on the opposite side of Featherstone Buildings, the other three ran down Holborn, and we caught them opposite the Holborn Theatre—Carter took hold of Hopkins and Edwards—I caught Hold of Williams—some other constables came to our assistance—I told Williams I should charge him with loitering in Holborn and the neighbourhood for the purpose of committing a felony—he said, "I have done nothing, and I sha'n't go"—I said, "You may as well go quietly"—I got him as far as Eagle Street, No. 40, which is a lodging house where thieves live—just there he stopped, and tried to throw me—I called out for a constable to come and assist me; constable Smith came up—we then went about three yards further, when he again tried to throw me, and we both went on the ground—whilst on the ground he dropped something—I could not see what it was; I heard it fall—Smith picked it up; it sounded like iron—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is a crowbar—Hopkins was behind, in custody of Welch.</p>

It never entered nay head to rob or steal from anyone. I was not in my senses all the time, from that day till I was taken; in fact, I consider I was mentally deranged.

Mr. Lazarus gave me the bags for the money I had lent him to pay his mother's workpeople while she was away. I demanded my wages several times, and she would not give it me, and I left her because she did not allow me half enough food, and kept me up late at night to let her sons in, who kept such late hours.

Baker &amp; Co." on the door—I took the goods into the office, and saw a man there, not the prisoner—he said Mr. Baker was not in, he would go and fetch him—he did so—the prisoner came, and said that he wanted another piece, and he would go down to Messrs. Venables and pay for it altogether if I would accompany him he had a pattern of cloth in his hand—as we were going along, he said he wanted to call at a warehouse in Queen Street—he went into Messrs. Bevington's leather ware house, in Budge Row—that warehouse has two entrances, one in Cannon Street and the other in Budge Row—he told me to wait outside—he went in and Dame out again shortly, and said he was sorry to keep me so long, but he should not be many minutes now—he went into the warehouse again, and came out a second time, and asked me if I would have some cooper he said he wanted a receipt stamp, to receipt a bill—I happened to have one in my pocket, and I gave it to him—he went back into the warehouse spin, and did not return—I waited for some time, and then went inside—he was not there—they said he had gone out the other way next morning, I went with Monger, the police officer, to the prisoner's residence in Wen<lb/>lock Street, City Road, and gave him into custody—he said if we would let him off he would tell where the cloth was—he said the other man had part of it.</p>

I have been lying where I could for the last fourteen weeks; and I happened to be in this shed at the time. I went there to sleep. The policeman said last night at the station, that he followed three men down the yard. While in the shed, I heard someone come down, making a noise, as if clambering over the door."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> For the last four months I have been out of work, and I sold everything I stood upright in. I was obliged to leave my lodging. Since that time I have lodged anywhere. I had done a day's work on this day, for the first time, at the docks. I paid some money away, and I had a shilling left. I stopped at a house that night, and when I left I had six-pence in my pocket. I bought half-an-once of tobacco, and that left me 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I came along Bow Common Lane, and I went to some new buildings that were being made. The policeman found me there, and said, "You must not go there, or I will lock you up." I came to Mr. Chambers' yard, and saw some buildings down there that I could get into. I got into the shed, and laid down. I had been there some little time, when I heard some one come down the yard; and then someone clambered over the wooden</p>

               <p>partition; and then I heard the policeman come down. He was in the yard before. He came to the shed, and then came in, and turned to the left<lb/>hand, where I was, opposite the door; and I could have easily escaped then and been clear, if I had done anything wrong. He distinctly stated at the station, that he saw three men running. Mr. Chambers said he did not know how I could pass the dog, and one of his men was in custody at the same time; it must have been someone well acquainted with the place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Flitton, of 23, Spurston Road, Hackney—on Thursday night, 17th December, about 12 o'clock, I was awoke by a strong smell of fire—I got up and opened my bedroom door, and saw my son's room apparently in a blaze—it is the room adjoining mine, and was occupied by my son when he was at home; he was not at home then—the door was half open; I had shut it on going to bed—when I went into the room, I saw three distinct fires blazing on the bed—I put the blaze out by doubling the things up together, and burnt my hands in doing so—I then went up stairs, and awoke my daughter, who slept in the room over mine, and she assisted in putting out the fire—I then went to the prisoner's bedroom; she slept in the second floor back—she was my servant, and had been with me about six weeks—I had given her notice to leave on 1st December—I found her lying in bed and awake, although she pretended to be asleep; I could tell that from her manner—she had her night-dress on, but, in my opinion, she was partly dressed under it—I did not see that she had her things on, but I saw no stockings or underclothes about the room—she usually kept her boots, jacket, and bonnet in the kitchen; I noticed that they were in her room, and her box had been moved out of its usual place, and the cord put by the side of it—I said to her, "Sarah, what have you been doing?"—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "Mr. Charles' bed is on fire in three places, and I think you did it"—she said she did nothing of the sort—I took away her candle and matches, and sent for my son in the morning—I heard her deny it strongly to him, at first—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE KEATING</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the statement of the prisoner, after this observation, was not admissible</hi>)—my son afterwards gave her into custody—there was no other servant in the house.</p>

               <p>Miss Robinson, Miss Wilson, and George Bell were present on the night in question, 25th December, Christmas Day—we dined in the front kitchen—the prisoner sat beside me at dinner—the deceased was there, Mr. Wother<lb/>spoon, and several others—we dined between 4 and 5 o'clock, and were all happy and comfortable together—in the course of the evening the prisoner made himself rather noisy, and somewhat obnoxious to the company—I saw him have some words with the deceased, but what they were I don't know—he was in and out very often during the evening—at one time he put himself very abruptly between the deceased and a young woman, one of the party—some short time after that I missed my brother—Mrs. Wotherspoon came down and said something to me, in consequence of which I ran up stairs to the front room first floor—Mr. Archibald Wotherspoon was before me—I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair, and my brother lying on the floor in a corner right opposite to where the prisoner was, as I thought dead—I said to the prisoner, "Campbell, you know something about this, tell me all about it"—I suspected him, from his conduct during the evening—he said, "I have done nothing"—I pressed him a little further, and he said, "I liked Jack, and I don't mind swinging for him"—he did nothing, he sat coolly on the chair—Mr. Bell was present—a policeman and a doctor came—the prisoner was an old acquaintance—I can't call him an old friend—his father was an old acquaintance as well—the prisoner came to live with us about the end of September, and had been living with us ever since—he slept with the deceased and myself—the deceased was, as far as I knew, on friendly terms with the prisoner, and the prisoner with him—I always thought so—I saw a rifle when I entered the room—it was my rifle—I did not keep it loaded.</p>

I was at the police-station when the prisoner was brought there, about 11 o'clock on the evening of Christmas day—I afterwards went to 42, Alfred Street—I examined the room on the first floor—on the sofa I found this bullet—I also found a plug, with a portion of the bullet—I noticed a hole in the wall, by the side of the fire-place, 5 feet 8 inches from the floor; I compared the bullet with that hole, and it corresponded exactly—I went into the back bedroom (the adjoining room), and there found the pouch, cartridge box, cartridge case, and belt, hanging on the bed-post—the cartridge box was open, and the cap box inside was also open, where there are a number of caps, one whole cartridge, and a portion of two other cartridges which had been pulled to pieces; there were nine ball cartridges in the cartridge case—the distance from one room to the other is about seven yards, not from one door to the other, but from where the cartridge case was hanging on the bed-post to the inside of the room where the prisoner was supposed to have been standing at the time he fired the rifle—the doors are about three feet apart; it is a small landing—the lamp was standing on the table, on a small workbox—the height from the glass of the lamp to the floor was 3 feet 11 inches—from the door side of the table to the fire-place was 11 feet.</p>

               <p>months before this, the prisoner took up the rifle from the cupboard, and snapped it at my son—I took it as a piece of fun; I thought it was just in diversion, like—my son was standing up, and he just snapped the gun, as I thought, in fun—I could not say whether there was a cap on it; I I don't think there was; there was no sound or explosion—we were all on good terms at the time—the last thing I should have thought of was that he would hurt him; I am sure of that—but he is of a changeable disposition; he is very easily put up, and very easily put down—he had come from his friends in Scotland, and he had all his things packed up that night for the purpose of starting back to Scotland next morning, all except two pairs of socks and a pair of drawers, which I mended that evening to have ready for him—there is one thing I should like to say: I had a little drink in the house, in case any person should call, but there was not a person that called, and I never gave a glass to anyone out of my hand that day, not even to the prisoner, and if there was any drink got extra, he went up and took it him-self; if he was excitable, it was himself that took it—there was drink up stairs—there is something the matter with the prisoner's right eye; he hurt it at one time—he is nearly blind, I think, with his right eye.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On Monday, 7th December, I saw the prisoner Ball at King Street, Ockley, Birmingham—I spoke to him and said, "I am an officer of police, from London, and I shall put some questions to you, and you can please yourself whether you answer them or not"—I said, "Is your name Chester?"—he said, "No, my name is Walter Edward Mercer Ball"—I said, "Did you go in the name of Chester at the Belgrave Road, Birmingham?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Were you ever at Cardiff, in the name of Chester?"—he said, "Yes"—I then told him that he must consider himself in my custody for forging and uttering an order on the Paymaster-General's Office, for between 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 19th October last—I said, "Have you changed any Bank of England notes at Cardiff, Bristol, or Birmingham?"—I mentioned the endorsement that was on a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note that had been changed at Bristol, "Edward Harding, 22, Chester Terrace, Eaton Square"—he said, "Yes, I passed that"—I said, "Did you endorse a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note at a shop in Birmingham, giving the name of Edward Giffard, 17, Northumberland Square, Bayswater?"—he said, "I did write that, but I received that note from Joe Sullivan, who was with me at the time"—I said, "If your name is Ball, how is it that you give these various names?"—he said, "Sullivan told me there was something amiss, and that I had better remain quiet in Birmingham"—I said, "Where did you get these notes from?"—I had previously mentioned the names of Sullivan and McMichan to him—he said, "I received them from McMichan and Sullivan"—I said, "How much?"—he said, "150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—I said, "What did you receive this for?"—he said, "I had drawn up two deeds of composition, and had written several letters to the Treasury for McMichan, and I received that for work done"—he said, "I met McMichan and Sullivan at a coffee-house in Leicester Square, by appointment; McMichan had a large bundle of notes; I said, 'How much have you got?' they replied, 'Under 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,;' I said, 'I must have some;' they offered me, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards gave me 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—I then said to Ball, "What do you know of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was paid into the National Provincial Bank, London, on 21st or 22nd October, payable to Mr. Chester, of Cardiff?"—he said, "That is part of the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I received from McMichan and Sullivan"—I asked him if he had any bank notes in his pos<lb/>session, he said, "I think I have, about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—I saw him leave his house, at 160, Ockley, previous to my speaking to him—I had been in the house before—it was a small tobacconist's shop, and a room at the back where beer was sold—there was a name up, not Ball—I took him to the station, and when I spoke to him about the bank notes, he wrote this letter—I saw him write it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Nellie—you must give up the notes to this gentleman.

God bless you,—Walter Ball")—I took that letter to his wife, and I took possession of the documents—his wife gave me a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note, and four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes—the number of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was 01,218, dated 22nd September, 1868—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes were 81,954, 81,957, 81,979</p>

               <p>and I took the cheque into the Bank, and received notes in exchange, which I handed to Ball. We then went to a coffee-house in Leicester Square, where we met McMichan and Sullivan—they offered me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I refused to take as my share; they afterwards gave me 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—I said "Have you seen McMichan and Sullivan since?"—he said, "No, neither do I know where they are"—I said, "Do you know where Ball is?"—he said, "Yes, I believe he is in custody, in London"—I said, "Were you ever in Cardiff with Ball"—he said, "No, but I received instructions from Ball to go to Cardiff to receive 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from the National Provincial Bank of England, that was there in the name of Chester. I went to Cardiff and received the money, by signing the name of Chester. I received 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in gold; this I handed to Ball on my return to Birmingham the same evening. He paid my expenses, and gave me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for my trouble"—I mentioned McMichan's name to him, and he said "He was the ringleader of all this"—I asked him if he knew a Mr. Derry—he said" No, but I now remember that the name of F. Derry was on the red letter form which I took to the Paymaster-General's Office"—I said "Did you see Mr. Derry on that day?"—he said "No; I never saw him in my life"—he was then brought up to London, and taken before the Magistrate on the following day—I have had the charge of this case—I have tried to find McMichan; but can find neither him nor Sullivan—I have been to Croydon, and tried to find a Mr. James Aubrey there—the address given was "The Elms, Croydon, Surrey"—I have been to four places called the Elms; but cannot find him—I have communicated with the police and other persons; but they can find no such person there.</p>

I am a servant at Manor House—on 20th November, about 7.30 p.m., I went up to Mrs. Ulman's room, in front of the house—there is a portico at the side of the window—I had not been in that room before that day—I found it very much disturbed, the bed clothes pulled up, the drawers and wardrobe open, and a shawl spread out on the floor—the window was open, I do not know whether it had been left open—there is a fastening to it—I missed dresses, jackets, and other articles—I saw this desk safe on the drawers the day before.</p>

I was out in the street; the prisoner pulled off his coat and said to me, 'Feel my muscle; can you fight? Put up your hands, if I hit you it will be sudden death.' I burst out laughing, and he squared over right at me; and he had a knife in his hand, but I did not see it then, and he struck me on the left side, below the ribs, and I felt I was stabbed. I followed him a little way, and then I fell; then he ran away in the direction of Shadwell Church. I knew the prisoner before; I am sure he is the man.—(<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>) I never saw you before last Thursday week. I did not strike you, you were not on the ground at all.

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Martha Street, St. George's, and am foreman to the Animal Charcoal Company Limited—the deceased and prisoner were fellow labourers there—they had worked together for about seven years, and agreed very well indeed; they never had any words before this—on Christmas Eve they had had a little to drink, but were not drunk by a long way; the deceased was worse than the prisoner, if anything—they were working on a platform from 16 ft. to 18 ft. high; they were night workers—about 11.45 they were <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> one another which could get the most beer on credit—one said he could get so much; the other said he could not—the deceased said he could go and get beer at any public-house where the prisoner dared not show his face—the prisoner said he could not—with that the deceased called him some very nasty names, and the prisoner went and hit him with his fist, a slight blow, I believe somewhere about the face; it was not so hard as to mark him—the deceased then took up the shovel he was working with to strike the prisoner—I picked up a handful of grain, and said to the prisoner, "Howard, we will have no words here; go to your work"—the prisoner went to his work on that, and the deceased went to his work, but came back again in a minute with the shovel to Howard, called him a nasty name, and said he would fight him—with that the prisoner hit him and knocked him down, and he rolled off the stage—I descended the ladder, and helped to get him up—he had fallen into a canister, a thing about 3 ft. 6 in. or 7 in long, and about 2 ft. wide; a deep iron thing—I found him doubled up in this canister—he did not speak—I went for a doctor, and when I came back the man was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister at-law, and a native of Jersey—I am familiar with the law of Jersey—I have been examined before Sir James Wilde on the marriage law of the island—it is the fact that before 1836, a register book of marriages was bound to be kept by the law of Jersey—a marriage, without dissent by parents, celebrated by a clergyman in Jersey would be valid at that time, without the parties signing the re<lb/>gister—there was an alteration of the law in 1842, by order of her Majesty in Council, and that was the law previous to 1842—this marriage was just previous—it was solemnized by the clergyman, and entered in a book without the signature of the parties—the rector of St. Helier's was my cousin, the Rev. Corbett Hue, Dean of Jersey—he died in 1838.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEAST BALLATINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you an English barrister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never was a barrister practising at Jersey—I never was an advocate of the Royal Court of Jersey—I have special reasons for knowing the law of Jersey—I was for some time a special agent for the Appeals to our Privy Council for the States of Jersey, and for the Crown Officers—matters connected with the law of marriage came before me con<lb/>stantly—I have had a matter of this kind before me; I can't say how often—I am not aware of any particular appeal upon this point before 1842, but cases of this kind came before me—there was the general law of Europe as to the restriction as to age—a male of fourteen and a girl of twelve may contract marriage, if there is <hi rend="italic">consensus per verbal de presenti</hi>—I am sure of that—I am sure that a female of twelve may contract marriage, but not without consent of her parents, unless the banns are put up in church, and called in the ordinary manner three successive Sundays, under the Order in Council of King James I., which is binding upon the ecclesiastics of the island.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The ecclesiastics were bound to obey what the king had said, but did it govern the law of Jersey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That may be a moot point, but at all events, a marriage performed by a clergyman of the Church of England would be a valid marriage—I will not say that a marriage might not be valid, if it was by consent of two parties without the presence of a clergy-man, but certainly with the presence of a clergyman it would.</p>

               <p>but the banns might be forbidden by their guardians—I say, that before 1842, a female of twelve might have contracted marriage, if there were <hi rend="italic">con<lb/>sensus per verba de presenti</hi>, without the consent of her parents, if no oppo<lb/>sition was offered, if called three times in church by a clergyman of the Church of England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINF</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the banns were published of A. B. and C. D., which a clergyman would read without knowing the age of either? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If a couple of children were to come to the altar under those conditions, that would be a perfectly valid marriage in Jersey, if no negative was shown; but if the girl wanted a day of twelve, I do not think it would be a valid marriage—I cannot give any instance in which that has been laid down; my opinion is purely speculative—I am not aware of any case in which it has been held valid or contested, the case has not arisen—I should not give an opinion as to handwriting, unless I had seen the genuine writing before; but I give an opinion on a matter which I have never heard of, be<lb/>cause the law is known—very few persons in this country are interested in watching the law of Jersey.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am a widow, and live at Redruth, Cornwall—about 1835 or 1836 I was living with my mother and sisters at St. Heliers, Jersey—I lived there till my marriage in 1845—I there became acquainted with the family of the Haines's; the defendant is one of the daughters of that family; there were several daughters and one son—the daughters were Eliza, Sarah, Caroline, Charlotte, Harriett, and Geergiana—the defendant is Eliza, the eldest child; she was a school girl when I first knew her—she is older than me; but I was a school girl at the time of her marriage; she was very young—I knew Mr. Haines and his family, living in several dif<lb/>ferent streets in Jersey—I never knew the defendant as Eliza Haines; she was introduced to me as Madame Victor—M. Victor was my French master—I saw him and her from time to time together in Jersey, and at Mr. Haines' house with the other members of the family—I recognize Harriett Haines as Mrs. Brewer, who has been called as a witness; she was then living with her family at the time—Georgians was a little child; I cannot tell you exactly how old she was—both Harriett and Georgians were little; but Georgians was the youngest—the son was older than Harriett or Georgiana, but I do not know his age with regard to the others—M. and Madame Victor lived at times with the Haines's, and at times they lived in a house of their own—they continued to live on friendly terms with the family of the Haines's—I cannot fix the date of M. and Madame Victor leaving the island, but I know it was quite sudden and momentary, and quite unexpected by everybody—M. Victor gave me lessons twice a week, I think—I was not a pupil of his at the exact period he left the island; but,</p>

               <p>of course, he ceased to give lessons when he left the island—I saw the defendant in Jersey after Victor left, and previous to my leaving Jersey—I know that she left the island with him, and she returned alone; she was brought home by a relative of her family—she corresponded with me occa<lb/>sionally while she was away—I have not preserved one of her letters—she styled herself Eliza Victor—I answered the letters—I think they were at Bristol or Clifton, I cannot tell you exactly—I married in 1845, and left Jersey; she had returned to Jersey with a relation before that—her letters spread over some years; at long intervals we corresponded ever since—she was away from Jersey a few years, I cannot remember exactly; it was three or four years after her return that I married and left the island, I cannot tell exactly—the writing at the foot of this page (<hi rend="italic">the Register</hi>) is not at all like her writing—the letters I received are so long ago, but I do not think this is her signature; still it may be, I cannot say; but I believe that it is not—there may be some resemblance—I did not leave the defendant in the island after my marriage—she left before I did—she remained a little while before she returned with a relative; I cannot remember how long—after she went from the island I still got letters from her—I have not preserved them—she signed herself Eliza Haines—I do not know that I received any information from her why she changed her name—I did from her mother; I knew from her that she had separated from Victor—I heard from her that Victor had married her under an assumed name, and that he was a French convict—her mother spoke of a dissolution of the marriage, and the defendant said that they had separated—I saw her and Lumley together in 1850, or 1851, or 1852, or 1853—they visited me at Redruth, in Cornwall; but the first time Mrs. Lumley visited me alone, and afterwards he visited me, and I visited them at Truro—it was after her mother's return from France that I heard of the marriage being in a wrong name; it was before my wedding, which was in 1845—I knew Victor by sight, and I know Major Lumley; they are different persons, I should think—I am forty-eight years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Clifton—some years ago I became acquainted with a person named Victor, a French teacher; it was about 1842—I know the defendant—I became acquainted with her, it may have been in 1841—I lived in the same house with Madame Victor, at one time—her husband taught at Dr. Stone's—I have been there with her—I re<lb/>member going with her to the gaol at Bristol, and seeing the governor—I am not sure I went inside—she left me, and went in—they were lodging in the same house with me at that time—but Victor was not living at home, he was in gaol—I was not in the gaol—he was absent from home, perhaps some weeks—he afterwards returned, and there is no doubt whore he had been—I went with the prisoner to the gaol—I can't say that she said why she was going there, but the fact is most positive that she knew it—they did not leave Clifton until after Dr. Stone's examination, after the June holidays, 1842, after the rehearsals—I did not see the prisoner and Victor together after they left Clifton, but I saw Victor alone in 1847, in Brighton, and had a con<lb/>versation with him there—he was the same person that I had known in Clifton—I have no remembrance of seeing the prisoner after June or July, 1842, when she left Clifton—I can fix the exact date of seeing Victor at Brighton, by undeniable proof—I was there on 9th July, and slept at the Rev.

J. Farrer, as a token of his esteem—there is a date in the book—Mr. Matthews knew that—I offered to go and fetch it, but I don't know what Mr. Matthews said to that—I think he said the book was thought needful, that it would be a very important document—that was not the reason I left it behind; my health was not sufficient to let me go for it—I was not obliged to fetch it, but for the ends of justice I would have done so—Mr. Matthews said what I have told you—when I am driven to it, I will strain a point to do a thing—I can't go into the why and the wherefore of what Mr. Matthews said; he said he was sorry I had not brought it; he expressed his regret that I had not—he did it in perfectly polite terms—I</p>

King," that refers to a partition I took down, to throw a back bed-room and drawing-room together, and make an additional school-room of</p>

               <p>the two, as my number of boys increased, and you see this bill fixes the date as 1858—I know that Victor's call was after that, as he wanted to come to my house and have a bed-room, for which he would teach French in my school if he had permission to go out and teach French—I said that it was impossible, on account of converting that room into a school-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in Her Majesty's Indian retired list, on half pay—this is my signature to this register of marriage—I saw the prisoner write this signature, "Elizabeth Haines"—the marriage was solemnized in the parish church of Hampstead, on 9th July 1847—I had been in England about two years before that—I had known her about six weeks before I married her—I met her first at my aunt's house, at Ham<lb/>mersmith—I saw her very often during the six weeks—she bore the name of Miss Haines—she is described in the register as a spinster—the question was never mentioned by me to her as to any previous marriage—she never mentioned the name of Victor to me, nor did any of her family—I knew the members of her family very well indeed after our marriage, previously I never saw any of them—I saw her sisters constantly; I know their names very well—the prisoner is the eldest, she was called Eliza; the next was Sarah, who is still unmarried; the third, Caroline, is dead; the fourth, Char<lb/>lotte, went to Australia; the fifth, Harriett, married John Brewer; and the sixth, Georgiana, is now Mrs. William Brewer, and there was a son called Tom Haines, I think—he was the same age as Harriett, we have his baptismal certificate here, he was born in 1822—the first I heard of a pre<lb/>vious marriage was a rumour propagated by a relative of mine, Lady Lewis, at Boulogne, in the autumn of 1863—I was then living with the defendant, and had lived with her from the time of our marriage—I continued to live with her after I heard that rumour, for a short time—not a word was mentioned about the previous marriage between that time and the time of my first separating from her—I heard the scandal in the autumn of 1863, and instituted pro<lb/>ceedings against Lady Lewis—I did not believe it—I employed Mr. Keane, a solicitor, in the matter—nothing further happened, but we separated on 11th March, 1864, finally, as it were; I had been away a short time previous—I heard of the previous marriage again, about two years later—the settle<lb/>ment was made on 11th March, 1864—we did not separate on account of this rumour; I disbelieved it—I first saw the Jersey certificate last Sep<lb/>tember—up to that time I was not aware of the existence of any legal proof of marriage, but I had collected what I considered a great deal of evidence during the two years—(<hi rend="italic">The certificate was read, and certified the marriage of William Browning Lumley, bachelor, and Elizabeth Haines, spinster, on 9th July</hi>, 1847, <hi rend="italic">at St. John's, Hampstead.</hi>)</p>

               <p>hearing this report—I compounded with my creditors on 10th December, 1867, and again on 1st May, 1868, as far as I can remember the exact dates—I filed a bill in Chancery against both the trustees of the defendant, to set aside the deed, alleging want of notice of the previous marriage—I did not say that Lady Lewis mentioned these matters to me; she never said a word to me on the subject; she propagatd the scandal, which I re<lb/>sented—I never held the smallest communication with her from that time to this—she is a relative of mine—the first person who mentioned it was Mrs. Crow, a friend of mine—she said that it had been propogated by Lady Lewis—I don't know that Lady Lewis has been examined in the answer to the Chancery suit—I do not know that she has made an affidavit; I have allowed that she denies it, and alleges that I told her—she infers it—she is not one of the persons to whom I made an offer of marriage—I never made any other person an offer of marriage—I never heard that she said so, and if she did it is false—I did not make her an offer, nor did she say that I was married, nor did I say that that was nothing—I did not go away from Bou<lb/>logne for four months, I did for ten days—I went alone—somebody met me, not Lady Lewis.</p>

We had many serious conferences about it, before that deed was executed—I considered that she had entirely excul<lb/>pated herself—you have no right to ask who I went away from Boulogne with; my Lord will decide whether you have a right to drag in the name of another person; but I will say this, I did meet another lady—I mean I cohabited with another lady during the four months preceding the post<lb/>nuptial settlement—my head quarters were then at Boulogne—I occasionally crossed over to London—that was at a time when I had perfect confidence in my wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the way in which you exhibited it was to go away four or fire days at a time, and live with another woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so—I did not take a house for her then—I think I took it after March, 1864—I think the lease is here—it was 23, Kildare Gardens, Westbourne Park, or, suppose I took it for myself—she lived with me there under my name—she was not living with me in London under my name while the prisoner was living at Bou<lb/>logne—she was not living in the name of Lumley till she came to live with me, and that was after the settlement—I can't say exactly whether that was the day before or the day after the settlement—I was not cohabiting with her as early as March, 1863, or April—I will swear I was not cohabiting with her in May, 1863—I first made her acquaintance, in the sense you speak of, towards the end of the autumn of 1863—I did not take her to Mrs. Amphlett's as my wife, or to Mr. Amphlett's—I do not think I saw him in her pre<lb/>sence, but I will not swear I did not; I should have done so if he had asked me; she bore my name, and I should have introduced her to any casual stranger as Mrs. Lumley—I may have said to Mr. Brewer that I had married her, to cover the imputation that rested on her character; he is in Court, and will tell you—I certainly should have said so if he had asked me—I did not tell the prisoner that I had married this girl—I don't think I did; I don't think I should, but I covered her reputation with my name, which is a very common course in this country; it is very commonly done, I believe—I do not believe I did tell my wife that I had married her, although,</p>

               <p>for the reason I have already stated, namely, that under a pressure, I should have done that to her, or to anybody else—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a por<lb/>tion of a letter, and this seemingly is the rest of it—it is my writing—the date is February 2nd, 1864—the 1864 is not there, but I can see it must have been there—the date of the post-nuptial settlement is 11th March, and I left her about three weeks before—I left Boulogne about ten days or a fortnight before, but I cannot say exactly to these dates—I never returned to her after the settlement—I left her at Boulogne alone, at the Hotel du Nord, about the period I mention, a fortnight or a month before the post-nuptial settlement—I did not tell her I was going to leave her—I came to London direct from her to this very person you allude to—it is possible that I told my wife I was coming back in three or four days; I cannot say.</p>

About 11 o'clock on the 10th of December last, I went with the constable Smart to 30, Mount Street; Meyers gave his address there—we searched the house and found sixty-five bundles of unmade clothing, tied up, containing 144 garments—we conveyed them to the Leman Street police-station—Meyers was brought out of the cell, and I asked him if they were his—he said they were left there about a fortnight before, by his brother, who had gone on the Continent—the property has been identified by Messrs. Hyams' manager.</p>

               <p>the board—I belive Mitchell still mananges the business—I was to go to this shop and be pay by Mitchell—Mr. Alsop asked me if it would make any difference to me if I did not go, and I said I did not know that it would—it was in consequence of that that I took the coin directly—I got them and went to Mr. Alsop's office, I did not know Mr. Alsop's purpose—he marked them in my presence, there and then—I was before the Grand Jury—Mr. Alsop went into the Grand Jury room—I told the Grand Jury what I have stated to-day, as near as I could think of it—Mr. Alsop read over my depositions, and told the Grand Jury in my presence that Mr. Coutts had paid me money, and that I had been known to say that I would sooner suffer six months' imprisonment rather than I would punish Mr. Coutts—I would sooner suffer anything; I would sooner have my right arm plucked off than I would do any wrong to anybody—it has been said that I had had money paid to me to alter my evidence—I can't recollect whether that was said before the Grand Jury; I don't think it was there—when Mr. Alsop asked me if it would make any difference to me if I did not receive the money, I said, "I don't know if it will"—and he then said, "I will see that you are not the loser if you don't"—he said that he would pay me the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if I would do as he wished me—he said that Coutts was a long-headed fellow, but he thought he could catch him at last—that was on the first occasion—I believe that I saw him on the 11th; I believe it was on the 11th (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I can't say when I first saw this paper—I think it was about three or four days before I went to Bow Street—just before I got this paper Mr. Alsop told me he was going to send me a paper—I don't know who brought it me; I think it was Mr. Alsop's lad, that he keeps at Bromley, but I was not at home when it was brought—I spoke to Mr. Alsop about this paper afterwards—I went to him and told him I thought he had treated me rather badly in bringing me into a thing I was not aware of; he had made me a complainant, and "drawed" me along, and I did not know what I was doing—I listened too much to Mr. Alsop—Mr. Alsop said that he would give me this paper—that was what I had to say before the Judge, or the Magistrate at Bow Street—he told me if I was asked whether Coutts had called to pay the money, I was to say I did not know—I said, "But I do know"—he said, "You did not see him yourself"—I said, "No, but my wife did"—he said, "That is not evidence; you did not see him, so you must not swear to it"—I think I told him that Mr. Coutts had called again on the morning of the 12th, to see if I had got the money—I called on him on the 12th, in the evening—I think I told him so, I won't swear that I did—what Mr. Coutts said about getting a half-crown back, was said in a jocular manner; the three of us were joking about it together—I am no friend or relative of Mr. Coutts'—I never saw him until he subpoenaed me to go to Maidstone—I have not the slightest interest in this matter in any shape or way.</p>

               <p>Street—I think this was delivered to me after I signed that; no doubt it was—I had not written it out myself before I signed this prisoner anything like what is there; I will swear that—Mr. Alsop asked me certain questions, and I answered them, and he set it down, I suppose; and then he asked me if it was right—he read it over and I signed it—he was bringing me into a case that I did not know anything about—when I went to him in Brunswick Square, a paper was read to me, and I think he asked me if it was correct—I told him I thought it was—I went afterwards to Bow Street, and what I said was signed by me, and I said it was true—the first time I went I asked to correct one or two statements that were there, which I believed I had made wrong—I don't recollect Mr. Vaughan's saying, "No, you had it read over to you carefully"—he did not let me alter anything—I can't recollect what he said—I have not constantly seen the defendant since his committal; I saw his attorney once, and only once—I made a statement to him, because this was wrong, and I wished to have it set right—I said I would rather suffer anything than I would do anything wrong—I don't recollect saying I would upset the case before the Grand Jury; I positively did not—Mr. Alsop had said that he heard me say so—I don't think I did—I believe I said the case ought to be upset, on account of its being such a shabby affair—I was ashamed of Mr. Alsop, and myself, too, for allowing myself to be brought into such a shabby affair—it is a disgraceful affair—I went to the prisoner's attorney on my own accord.</p>

I live at Wells Street, Sydenham, and am a dust contractor for the Sydenham and Forest Hill district and Lewisham parish—I know the six prisoners—I knew a lad of the name of Henry Kemp, who is since dead—about 8 o'clock on the morning of the 13th December I was standing near the Swiss Cottage, in Stanstead Lane, Sydenham—I saw all the prisoners there with Kemp, the lad who is dead, and two men who are not apprehended—there were nine altogether left their carts—there were two or three in a cart—they all came round me—I had summoned Patter-son, Kemp <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Holmes, and Larkin, because they were making free—they came round me and wanted to know why I had summoned them, at the same time telling me that they should collect as much dust as they liked—I said if they did I should be compelled to summon them, for I could not allow them to take it—Patterson caught hold of me and commenced punching me—I believe Larkin struck me next—they were round me in such a cluster, they nearly had me down on the ground—Lewis struck me—all of them struck me—they were all on the ground to get me down—I tried to resist as much as I could—Holmes <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Kemp said, when we were on the ground, "Let us take his b—swear-by"—I never hoard the word before—after he had said that, Larkin held me down and Holmes put his hand into my pocket—I had a purse there, containing four half-sovereigns and a sixpence—the prisoners were all round me when Holmes put his hand into my pocket—Larkin and Holmes held me down—my purse was taken away—I felt Holmes draw his hand and shut it—when he took it out of my pocket I caught hold of him by the hand, and he struck me between the eyes with his clenched fist—the other prisoners were close round at that time—they all got up then, got into their carts, and drove off—I am quite sure when the prisoners came up my purse was safe in my pocket—I have known them a long while—I had not got a knife in my possession.</p>
