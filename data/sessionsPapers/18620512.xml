                  </hi>. I am a detective City-officerâ€”on 26th April, at a quarter to 9 in the morning, I was sent for to Messrs. Pritchard and Burton's, and found that an entrance had been effected by the removal of a pane of glass, after which a hand had been put through to remove the sash, by which means a person had got inâ€”there is a high wall in St. John's-court, adjoining the premises, from that to the window is a wall with iron spikes at the topâ€”they had got on to the palisades, tied a rope to them, and let themselves down to the windowâ€”three desks had been broken open, one in the private counting-house, and two in the clerks counting-houseâ€”I found in the yard two pairs of socks, and a bit of a lucifer-match under the kitchen windowâ€”these two pieces of matches were handed to me in the counting-houseâ€”they have been lightedâ€”I cut the rope from the railings, and took it to the stationâ€”I received this chisel from Mr. Burtonâ€”Inspector Leonard examined the floor with me, he was then going to Camomile-street, and on my way to the station I accompanied him to Jewin-street, and when we were at the Fore-street end, I saw the prisoners and another person on the other side of the wayâ€”it was then about 10 o'clockâ€”they had new boots on, and I thought new caps as wellâ€”I followed them into Aldersgate-street, to the end of Edmund's-place, where there is a pawnbroker's shopâ€”Giss went in at the side door, and Johnson and the other man stood at the end of the place; I passed them and then went into the lobby of the pawnbroker's, and saw Giss present a duplicate to the pawn-broker's assistantâ€”I went in front of the shop to look what the duplicate related to, and found it related to a coatâ€”I went back to the box where Giss was, and beckoned him out into the passageâ€”I told him I was an officer and should like to know where he got the money from to buy those boots with which he was wearingâ€”he said, "I worked for it and saved it"â€”I said, "Where do you work?"â€”he said Taylor and Greenings, of Grey-stock-placeâ€”I said, "You have got some parties waiting outside for you at the end of the place"â€”he said, "I have not"â€”I said "You have, for I saw you come together along Jewin-street"â€”he said, "I have never been near Jewin-street this morning"â€”I said, "Go in and get your coat"â€”he went into the box, and I stepped aside and beckoned to Johnson, who came up to meâ€”I told him I was an officer, and should like to know where he got the money from, to buy the new boots he was wearing?â€”he said, "Worked for it and saved it, to be sure"â€”I said, "You are waiting for some one here"â€”he said, "I am not"â€”I said, "You are, for I saw you come along Jewin-street together"â€”he said, "I am not waiting for any<lb/>body"â€”I caught hold of his collar, and we commenced struggling, he lifted up his fist but I stopped the blowâ€”while the struggle was going on, Giss came out with the coat under his arm, and I then noticed that his left<lb/>hand trousers pocket was very bulky, I put my hand on it and it appeared to contain moneyâ€”the assisant came to my assistance, and ultimately Gale, No. 670, seeing the struggle, came up, and we took the prisoners; Johnson endeavoured to put his hand into his pocketâ€”I told him, on the way to the station, that I should charge them on suspicion of committing a burglary, at Messrs, Pritchard's, King-street, Snow-hillâ€”they both said "We will make you prove it, and you shall pay for this"â€”I searched Giss at the station, and found, in the watch-pocket of his trousers, this bag con<lb/>taining 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and in his pocket I found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver</p>

I think, found on him, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it was in goldâ€”Mr. Burton said that he thought the bag found on Johnson was his, but that some of his clerks would be able to identify it no doubt, when Johnson said "That is my aunt's bag"â€”the prisoners both refused to give their addressesâ€”the fourpenny and threepenny <hi rend="italic">bits</hi> found on them both, amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.â€”this one with a hole in the centre was found on Gissâ€”I have ascertained Giss' address, but could hear nothing of him at the place he said that he worked at; I met Mr. Taylorâ€”I know him personally.</p>

We went, and stopped very late, and I drank too much, and was very ill the next morning. I went that afternoon to Notting-hill, and stopped there all the afternoon. As I was coming back, I met my brother, and stopped with him till about a quarter to 9, when I left him, and went to a house in Piccadilly to have some stout. I went home, and was in bed before the dock struck 10. On Thursday we started from home at half-past 10 to go to the Exhibition, where we remained till half-past 6 in the evening, and then my wife went home. I went to St. James's-street, and stayed there till about half-past 9. On the Friday, I went out to try and get something to do. I went up to the Edgeware-road. A man said, "I will give you half-a-crown and something to drink if you will help beat these carpets." I said, "Very well." It was about half-past 1. We stopped till nearly half-past 6, and then came back as far as Port-man-market, where I said, "I can't go any further," and we parted. He gave me the half-crown, and I bought threepenny worth of cheese with it, and received a two shilling-piece and a threepenny-piece change. I went to St. John's-wood, where I stopped about two hours and a half, and then I came back by this man's house, and, feeling rather thirsty, I went in and asked for a glass of the best ale. He drew it, and I was going to drink it when I saw him looking at something in his hand on the other side of the</p>

I am the prisoner's wifeâ€”on 30th April, we went to bed about 10 o'clockâ€”about half-past 12 my husband awoke me for the pur<lb/>pose of giving him some medicineâ€”he had not been well; he was in a very strange stateâ€”I gave him his medicine, and got into bed again after a short time; he told me to come to bedâ€”after I had got into bed again he tried to pierce me with a file in the stomachâ€”he had not said anything before he did thatâ€”he did not pierce me with the fileâ€”I got it from him after a long time, and threw it under the bedâ€”I had several scratches from it about my bodyâ€”I tried to get away from him as much as I couldâ€”he then got the axe from behind some fire-woodâ€”we were out of bed at that time; in the struggle we got out on to the floorâ€”he struck me on the left side of the head with the axeâ€”I was standing up at the time, trying to get out of the door away from himâ€”I could not say what part of the axe he hit me withâ€”it out my head, and the blood flowed on to my chemiseâ€”when I got from him I ran down stairs as fast as I possibly could, and he threw the axe after me on to the first landing, but it did not come near me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Kensal-greenâ€”on 1st May, about half-past 9 in the morning, I was called to examine the prosecutrix at her houseâ€”I found two incised wounds on her head, one over the left ear three inches in extent, and one over the right ear about an inch in length; they</p>

               <p>were to the boneâ€”this axe would be calculated to produce such woundsâ€”I found a great number of scratches and bruises on the belly, as if caused by the sharp point of a fileâ€”there was also a blunt wound on the right side of the belly, as if produced by the blunt edge of the fileâ€”I afterwards saw the prisoner at the stationâ€”I asked him how he came to do itâ€”he said, he had had <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens,</hi> and it was through jealousy of one Jem Trotman.</p>

Harmar and Pearsonâ€”on Monday morning, 17th April last, I was about to send a cask of gin to Mr. Chapman'sâ€”it left the warehouse about 9 o'clock in the morningâ€”the prisoners were the carmen who were to take itâ€”I have nothing to refer to now, but I think it contained 101 gallons when it left the warehouseâ€”I put down at the time, how much it containedâ€”I have not that entry with meâ€”I tested that gin about 8 o'clock that morning, and</p>

               <p>found it seventeen under proofâ€”it is not possible that anything could have been taken out of that cask between the time I tested it and the time was sent away, without my seeing itâ€”the cask was under my eye from half-past 8 to 9â€”no one could have touched it between that time without my seeing themâ€”I did not see it between 8 and half-past; I was not thereâ€”Mr. Frederick Pearson was thereâ€”he is a son of one of the partners, and is a partner himselfâ€”the cask was quite full when I tested it, with the excep<lb/>tion of the sample that was taken outâ€”that deficency was filled up from the vat that the gin was drawn from originallyâ€”the deficiency was about a pintâ€”I saw the prisoners leave the distillery with the waggonâ€”Mr. Chapman's name, the contents, and the strength, were written on the cask with chalkâ€”we always send out a delivery-note with casks sent out in that wayâ€”the delivery-notes are kept in a bookâ€”we do not usually tear them outâ€”the book is delivered to the carman, and he gets the receipt signedâ€”the delivery-note that was given to the prisoners is not in my possessionâ€”the carman should deliver it to the publican, and he would sign itâ€”the carman, if he comes home after the warehouse is shut up, would deliver it to me the next morning; if not, he would deliver it when he came backâ€”the delivery-note was brought back to me by the prisoners the same evening, Monday, 7th April, about 7 o'clockâ€”the whole book was given to meâ€”the note was not then torn out; it was in the bookâ€”this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same delivery-noteâ€”Church gave it to meâ€”it mentions 102 gallons as the quantity, and the strength seventeen under proofâ€”Robinson was present when Church gave me thatâ€”Church gave me the book, and said that he had had a row with Mr. Chapman at the Gate House, Highgateâ€”he had accused them of tampering with the gin, and that he had said to Mr. Chapman that he had never been accused of anything of that kind before, and he threatened to kick Chapmanâ€”Church said, in Robinson's presence, that it had been raining all day, all the time they had been out, and a little water might have got in the cans, which they supposed accounted for the deficiency that Mr. Chapman foundâ€”he meant deficiency in the strengthâ€”Robinson corro<lb/>borated the statement of Churchâ€”the prisoners appeared soberâ€”they said that Mr. Chapman accused them of being tipsyâ€”I received a telegraphic message the same evening from Mr. Chapman, about ten minutes before the prisoners arrivedâ€”Mr. Chapman came the next morning, and gave me a bottle sealed up, containing ginâ€”I tested it's contents in order to ascertain the strength, and found it fifty-three per cent under proofâ€”I tested it with the hydrometer and thermometer togetherâ€”those instruments sometimes get out of order, but we always keep a standard in our officeâ€”I do not know about there being many hydrometers made inaccuratelyâ€”they get inaccurate.</p>

               <p>much gin must have been taken out of that cask, (supposing it to have been full originally of gin at seventeen under proof,) and replaced by water, in order to bring it down to thirty-sevenâ€”I cannot tell when I made this calculationâ€”it is necessary to take out about three gallons of gin, and replaces it by three gallons of water.</p>

On the 14th December last, William Brittain, having left my employment as fore<lb/>man of works at Bennett's-court, Drury-lane, and having taken a contract to the amount of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to do certain works for the Central London. Dwellings' Improvement Company, Limited, asked me to advance him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enable him to procure some deals and timber to carry out his contract. I told him it was inconvenient for me to do so. He pressed me very hard, and I told him if the person of whom he was going to purchase the good, would take my cheque, dated for the 21st of December, I would oblige him. On the afternoon of that day, ie. the 14th, he told me that he could do with a cheque dated for the 21st, and thereupon I gave him one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated the 21st December. This cheque, by his own statement, he was going to pay to Mr. Putney, timber merchant, Elm-street, Gray's-inn-lane. On the morning of Wednesday, December 18th, about noon, Brittain came to me, and said that Mr. Putney's bankers would not take the cheque dated the 21st; and he asked me to give him in exchange a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the current date, on the understanding that it should not be presented until the coming Saturday, the 21st of December. I did so, and he presently sent me the cheque which I had given him on the previous Saturday, and which cheque, believing the transaction to be quite regular, I destroyed. In con<lb/>sequence of information which I received on this 18th of December, I requested the Bank of London not to pay this cheque, and two others,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120063"/>
               <p>dated the 17th instant, in Brittain's favour, for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. re<lb/>spectively. On Friday, the 20th of December, I gave Brittain in custody on a charge of obtaining money by false pretences, and he was remanded for a week; and on the evening of the name day, Mrs. Williams, the land-lady of the Harlequin Tavern, Drury-lane, called upon me and stated that she held my cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated the 18th December, which cheque I produce, and said as follows, viz.: that on Saturday, December 14th, Brittain lad asked her to change a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she had said that she could not do so, and that on Monday he had made a similar request to her, and that she changed it for him. That she paid said cheque away on Tuesday, December 17th, and that it was returned to her and refused, by reason of its being post-dated for the 21st December. That she there-upon applied to Brittain for a cheque of the current date, which he promised to procure for her, and that shortly afterwards he brought her a cheque (now produced), dated the 18th of December, whereupon she gave him back the post-dated cheque. This cheque Brittain returned to me, and I de<lb/>stroyed, same as before stated. I gave Mrs. Williams' cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (now produced) in lieu of that of which payment had been stopped. The first intimation which I had of the existence of the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> which I say is a forgery, was on Wednesday morning last, January 1st, when a Mr. Smith, baker, of 10, Peter-street, Islington, called upon me and stated that he was the holder of the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the payment of which I had ordered to be stopped, and that he had cashed for Brittain three cheques, viz., one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he had sent them in together to his bankers, the London and County Bank, Islington branch; that the two latter had been paid, but the former had been returned to him on the 23d ult. Since which time be said he had applied to Brittain and his wife for my address, and that he could not and did not obtain it until the after<lb/>noon of that day. I told him that I knew nothing of any cheque of mine for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being out; that I had only given Brittain one cheque for that amount, which cheque I had found out that he had cashed at the Harlequin public-house, Drury-lane. On the following morning, Thursday, January 2d, I obtained from the Bank of London the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. produced, and which I presume is the cheque referred to by Mr. Smith, as it appears to have passed through the Islington branch of the London and County Bank. I at once recognised it as a forgery. No part of it is in my handwriting, although, in many respects, it has ft similarity. I believe the cheque to be in the handwriting of Brittain, although I cannot speak positively on this point. This much I know, that on the 14th of December I gave him no other cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than that whioh was dated the 21st of December, and which cheque, it can be indisputably proved that he changed at the Harlequin Tavern, as before stated, and afterwards received in exchange for same the cheque dated the 18th of December, also before stated. I was in the habit of carrying a few blank cheques in my pocket for business pur<lb/>poses, and about the 14th of December I lost or mislaid a roll of these. Brittain was daily at my office, and my impression now is that he found them, and that the cheque in question is one of those which I lost. I named my loss to him. I had such confidence in him that I would have trusted him to any amount at that time, and therefore took his word that he had not seen the cheques I had lost. On searching at Brittain's office, in the works at Bennett's-court this <hi rend="italic">day,</hi> I found a piece of paper (herewith pro<lb/>duced), on which certain attempts to copy my signature are made. I believe them to be in Brittain's handwriting. He is at present out on bail, being</p>

               <p>committed to take his trial at the next Middlesex Sessions, for obtaining money by fraud and false pretences, full particulars of which charge have appeared in the newspapers.

There are one or two charges of embezzlement, and several of forged receipts. I have not the least doubt that he forged and uttered the cheque in question.</p>

On 3d December last Brittain, much against my wishes, having induced the Company to let him have some work on contract, as his term of employment was nearly ended, signed the contract which I inclose; he had no means with which to procure materials for the work, and he bor<lb/>rowed of me for the purpose. He commenced the work in the week ending December 14th, and during that week he borrowed of me as fellows:â€”December 9th, cash, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10th, cheque, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11th, ditto, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; total, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."â€”there are two crosses against these items, with a note at the bottom, "you (meaning myself) have both these cheques"â€”("On 14th December, I gave a certificate to him to receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of his contract, and he gave me a receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I gave him a cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was the balance then due to him, and at the same time I returned him an I.O.U. for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (exactly of similar kind to the one you now hold of his), the two sums of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. making up the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which I had given a certificate, and received his receipt, which receipt I handed to the secretary of the company.

               <p>Mr. Ferguson, would take my cheques, and accordingly I went into the office in Bennett's-court and there wrote, him two cheques, one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

Neither of which, as we know, he so appropriated, but cashed one with Mr. Smith, and the other with Mr. Putney, and actually got both the bricks and cement in my name, notwithstanding he was supplied with the funds to pay for them. His gave me an I.O.U. for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 14th December, and when he came to my office early in the morning of the 19th December, I gave him back the I.O.U. for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he put into the fire, and then he gave me the I.O.U. which you now hold, for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with authority to deduct the amount of it from the next payment received by him on his contract. But of this money I have been completely defrauded. It was on the evening of the 19th December that I became convinced that the charges alleged against him, of which I first heard on the afternoon of the 17th, for falsifying his paysheets, while in my service, were unfortunately too true, and after some further investigation, on the morning of the 20th, I gave him into custody on that charge.

I am the niece of Mr. Williams, the proprietor of the Harlequin public-house, Drury-laneâ€”I have seen the prisoner there occasionallyâ€”I know Brittain; he used to come there generally during the dayâ€”on Saturday, 14th December, he came there, and asked me to change a chequeâ€”I took it into my handsâ€”this cheque looks like itâ€”I declined cashing it; handed it back to him, and he leftâ€”I particularly noticed that it was dated the 16th, the very day on which it was brought to meâ€”next day, the 17th, he came again with Osborne, and brought a chequeâ€”I did not look at it, but sent a servant out with it, and it was cashed by a neigh<lb/>bourâ€”I took the money, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from the servant, handed it to Brittain, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120080"/>
               <p>he left with Osborneâ€”they both came back the same evening, and had something to drinkâ€”he missed a sovereign; a search was made for it, and it was found among some coppersâ€”he turned his pockets inside out, and I do not think there could have been any other money in themâ€”on the next day the cheque was brought back, and I made a communication to Brittain, who afterwards brought me another cheque, and I gave him the origial one.</p>

Pickford's office in Kink-street, consigned to Mrs. Matthews, of Newgate-market, which was condemned as unfit for human food, and that most likely a prosecution would follow, and he might be one of the parties prosecuted; if he chose to give me any information concerning the calf he might, but if he did say anything I should most likely use it against himâ€”I took down in writing what he statedâ€”he read it over, and signed itâ€”this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)â€”he said that on 26th March, Mr. Wildman, of Dane-hill Cottage, Leicester, called at his house, and said that he had a culf he wanted him to look it; that he went to Mr. Wild<lb/>man's and saw the calf; which was killed and dressed; and Wildman told him it was more dead than alive, which was why he killed it, and asked his opinion whether it would do to go to London to be sold, as the sheep was which he had sold to Wace, of Newgate-market: and he said that it was; that the kidneys were taken out, and it was put in Mr. Wildman's cart, and Mr. Wildman and he brought it to Pickford's office in Kink-street; that Mr. Wildman's son helped him to pack it, and he requested Mr. Beach to write "J. Wildman, Leicester," upon itâ€”he said that he saw the pluck, and the whole of the sound, and did not see anything the matter with the calf; it was fit for human food; that Mr. Wildman said that it was eating it's head off, and that was why he killed itâ€”I saw Mr. Wildman there; he is here to-dayâ€”he was in Court when the prisoner was examined before the Alder-manâ€”the prisoner did not call him as a witneas.</p>

When Mr. Wildman called at my house it was almost dark, and I thought the meat was good for human food. I asked him whether he had given it any physic, and he said, "No." I examined the heart, liver, and lights, and found them all sound. I said, "The best way will be to send it to London by the horse and cart. His son and I directed it, packed it up and sent it to London, and Mr. Shelly took Mr. Wildman's address. I heard no more about it till the detective came down. The most I can say is that it was an oversight; I should not have sent it if I had been aware that it was unfit for human food. I did not slaughter it; Mr. Wildman's son and another man killed it and dressed it, and the skin went up to the skin-market. All I did wan packing it up and sending it to market. Mr. Wild<lb/>man is here and will not deny it.</p>

I live at 2, Fairfield-place, Stepney, and am a book-keeperâ€”on the morning after the 22d April, about 10 o'clock, I was near the Royal Oak with my friend, Mr. Joiner, when the prisoner started out of a court by the Effingham, which is just by the Royal Oak, and struck me on the face with his fist, it was not a soft blow; he struck a cigar-tube out of my mouth, let his hand fall on my chest and took this breast-pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of my scarf, and ran up the court; the cigar-holder fell from the effects of the blowâ€”I went up the court a little way with my friend; and waited, the prisoner came down again, we turned round on him and said we would stand by himâ€”he then <hi rend="italic">shaped</hi> at me, and planted a blow at my face, but with some difficulty I warded off the blows for a few minutes; he tried to get up a fight with me; we gave him in charge within about ten minutesâ€”I kept him in sight, the prisoner is the man.</p>

Cardenâ€”the prisoner said that it was the same four quarters which I had passed in the morning, but they were not; these were the carcase of an animal which had died, they were wet and flabby, the other was drier beefâ€”I have known the defendant as a carrier for some years, bringing meat to the market, and I have had the duty of inspecting itâ€”the four quarters weighed fifty-five stones.</p>

I get my living by exchanging articles of hardware for old clothes. I was coming home and went into the public-house, not with the intention of changing Anything, but I thought I had three halfpence in my pocket, and when I got in I found I only had an old and new halfpenny, and thought it was three halfpence. I gave the sixpence for the gin. He never told me that I had given him a bad sixpence, and I did not know it; so I had no occasion to go out My wife came to the door to speak to me, and that is why I turned round. I am not the man who was in the house at all on the 29th, and I never offered him the bad shilling.</p>
