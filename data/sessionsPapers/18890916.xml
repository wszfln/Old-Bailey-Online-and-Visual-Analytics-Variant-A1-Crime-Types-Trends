I am one of the proprietors of the Court Theatre—we had in our employment a man named Julius Wadwicz as box-office keeper until the 1st July—at that time I was, with the assistance of an accountant, making inquiry into the state of the accounts—on 2nd July, among the documents returned from the bank, I found a cheque for £30, drawn by Clotilde and Co., returned unpaid—it had been put in apparently as part of the takings—I made some inquiry with regard to it, and, as the result, on 3rd July I saw the prisoner at a place in the Fulham Road, where some millinery business was apparently carried on—I asked him the meaning of that cheque being returned—he said he had given it to Wadwicz to help him out of a difficulty; he was very sorry it had come into my hands so soon, because Wadwicz had promised to keep it back for ten days—I asked him if he knew Wadwicz—he said, "Very slightly"—I said, "Then what made you give a man a cheque for £30, knowing him so very slightly?"—he then said he had known him at the old theatre for some time—I asked him for the money—he said he had not got the money at the bank, but he would obtain it and pay it by four in the afternoon—not receiving the money, I went next morning with my solicitor, and told him that unless the money was paid I should give him into custody—he said he had not anything like the sum to meet the cheque for £30 at the time he drew it—I have never received the £30—I made further inquiries, and communicated with other persons who had received cheques, and as a result I obtained a warrant for the arrest of the prisoner, and Wadwicz—Wadwicz has never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, St. Mary's Terrace, paddington—this letter marked A is in Jolly's handwriting, with the exception of two corrections, the "h" in the word "Rahgib" and "sub" before "scribes," which, to the best of my belief, are in Snyder's handwriting—I know his handwriting well—I received this letter "B" enclosed in "A"—both letters were enclosed to me under cover to my solicitor, Dr. Clift, Fancras Lane—I received them—I believe the envelope, which I fancy I destroyed, was in Jolly's handwriting—at the beginning of July Mr. Williams's solicitor asked me to hand over such letters as I had of Mr. Snyder, and I handed these over with a bundle of others (<hi rend="italic">The letter in question contained the following passage</hi>:—"I <hi rend="italic">am acquainted with Mr. Williams, and am more or less acquainted with his methods, and being desirous that his Imperial</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Sultan's</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Majesty's Government should not be swindled, I think it my duty, &amp; co.</hi>")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I called at Dr. Cift's office for this letter—I became acquainted with Mr. Williams in 1885—I then procured money from him to give to Snyder—Williams then informed me he had entered into a contract with Snyder, by which he had acquired control of Snyder's business, and I was helping Williams to raise money to float a company—I think it was in 1886 that I ceased to have business communications with Williams, and co-operated with Snyder alone—at that time a mutual friend of mine and Snyder came and informed me that Williams had no contract with Snyder, and made certain statements that were false, and induced me to go to Constantinople with Snyder to try and negotiate with the Turkish Government, because I had knowledge of French, and so on—I went out to Constantinople in 1886 to assist Snyder at the request of a friend—I had then broken off my connection and communication for the time being with Mr. Williams—I assisted Snyder as secretary, doing some letter-writing and so forth—while I was there he made me in all respects his confidant, so that I knew all that was going on between him and the Turkish officials—in March, 1887, my business was finished with Snyder, and when I was leaving Constantinople to come back to England, Snyder asked me to try and get certain moneys for him—a friend was endeavouring to raise money for him, and he did not answer Snyder's letters, and Snyder was urging me to press him to attend to his request—I was in Snyder's employment from the time I went out to the time I came back, and after that I did what I did as a matter of grace and friendship—when I say I was in his employment, I had no salary, but I was to have all my expenses, and in the event of Snyder making a profit I was to have £1,000; I was interested in his success—I did not think this letter was a confidential</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160008"/>
               <p>communication—I thought he wanted to get more money; he had already had many thousands—he wanted me to assist him in getting it—I thought I was intended to show the letter to the gentleman from whom Snyder intended to get the £500—after the date of this letter he has not continued to assist me with money; on the contrary, he borrowed small sums of me when he returned to England; I consider he owes me money—after my return to England from Constantinople he did not assist me with various sums of money from time to time—to the best of my recollection I never had money from him from the time I returned to England—I applied for money, I did not get it—I did not apply to his daughter to get money from her—I wrote this letter to her—I nave had certain sums advanced to me by Snyder in addition to my expenses, but they were not borrowed—I had about £30 altogether before I left for Constantinople—he advanced me £10, which he afterwards said was money of his daughter, and he got his daughter afterwards to write and <hi rend="italic">dun</hi> me for it—I have not paid her, nor him—I consider he is in my debt very heavily—I believe I introduced Mr. Williams to his present solicitors, Elwes and Sharp, about February or March this year—I did not volunteer to give him the letter of March with the enclosure—I did not tell Mr. Williams first that I had these letters; I took them to Mr. Elwes in a bundle, with other letters—I did not know they were there, they had gone out of my mind—I met Snyder from time to time up to last February or March, I should think—about the time that he sold his invention to a London company I took Williams to Elwes and Sharp—since that date I have been doing my utmost to assist Mr. Williams as against the prisoner—I gave up the letter in a bundle of others written by the prisoner—the solicitors have them—I had kept the letter from March, 1887, till I handed it over to Elwes and Sharp in a bag containing hundreds and hundreds of letters from various people—I sorted out the prisoner's letters, as the solicitors told me to bring them all—I handed over twenty or thirty, I think—I simply picked them out by the writing, took them to the solicitors, and went through them there—I left off having communication with the prisoner, and assisted Mr. Williams because I was deliberately informed by the prisoner and the mutual friend I have referred to that Williams had treated him very badly, that there was no agreement between them, and that I had been humbugged by Mr. Williams, and so on—I found that from beginning to end it was a tissue of untruth, and that Williams had been badly treated by the prisoner, and I went and worked for Mr. Williams—I did not know at the time that Williams was going to bring an action against the prisoner with regard to this dynamite—since that time I have done my utmost to assist Mr. Williams as against Snyder—it is false that I went to Mr. Williams because the prisoner asked for the return of considerable sums which he had advanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At a subsequent period an action was commenced by Mr. Williams against the prisoner in connection with the company—in view of an affidavit of documents I was asked to look out all the prisoner's and Jolly's letters, and I did so—until the letters were examined at Elwes and Smith's, I think I had not read any portion of the two letters in question, and I had absolutely forgotten them—before going to Constantinople £20 was paid me, and £10 the prisoner afterwards got his daughter to write to me for it was not handed to me—I had £30,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160009"/>
               <p>including this £10—after I received it the prisoner told me the £10 had been left with his daughter—I knew it came from a friend for the business—£20 was spent in going to Constantinople; the other £10 I asked him to advance to my solicitor, who had previously advanced him £65—when I received this letter I had no business relations with the prisoner beyond casually meeting and talking to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. There were negotiations with the Turkish Government about the invention—the Sultan, while I was there, allowed the prisoner to make a firing on the Dardanelles by way of experiment, and on the strength of that the prisoner sold the invention to a company here, which is still in existence—I understood Mr. Williams had entered into certain contracts with the Turkish Government—things had been arranged when the prisoner upset them; then Mr. Williams made a claim on the Turkish Government, in which he was supported by the American Legation, and the Turkish Government offered Williams a certain sum for damages—I believe that was not paid—it is absolutely false that I have acted out of revenge, and because I was pressed by the prisoner for money lent; on the contrary, I was asked by the prisoner to send in a written claim for my services, and it would be satisfied; but I did not do it—I was satisfied that statements made by the prisoner against Mr. Williams were without foundation, and that Williams had some grievances against the prisoner and some claim against him—the civil action is pending.</p>

On Saturday night, 3rd August, soon after eleven, the prisoner came to Snow Hill Police-station, he was perfectly sober—he made a statement which I took down—he said, "On Saturday, 13th July last, between eleven and twelve at night, I was in company with Michael Walsh, hawker, no fixed abode, who I believe to be at Brighton; by means of a false key we entered the premises, having a bottle of paraffin with us, with which we saturated some rags and papers. Walsh gave me a box of matches, and I set fire to the same; we at once left the building. Walsh gave me £5 for my part in the matter on the following morning. The reason I gave myself up was that I was told Walsh was going to round on me with a view of getting the reward"—he made another statement at the Old Jewry to Detective Dowse.</p>

I saw him again four days afterwards, when he accompanied me to London, and I saw him from time to time until we entered the premises with a key."</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier of the London and County Bank, Limehouse Branch—Dr. David Fennell kept an account there—£80 or £90 stood to his drawing account on 27th June, and £1,100 or £1,200 to his deposit account—on the afternoon of 27th June this letter was brought to me by a lad—it contained a cheque for £190, and stated: "17, Commercial Road East.—Please send by bearer a cheque-book as usual, and also place the enclosed cheque to my credit.—David Fennell" (<hi rend="italic">The cheque was on Cox and Co. to Dr. Fennell for</hi> £190, <hi rend="italic">signed Arthur Gooch, and endorsed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">David Fennell</hi>"—the clerk stamped it, and it was returned marked "Forged"—I gave the boy a cheque-book, Nos. E18551 to 18575—the first of those cheques was presented about 10.20 next day, filled up, "Pay J. Frances, Esq., or bearer, £430. David Fennell"—it was endorsed,' but that was unnecessary—a man brought it, who I have a very imperfect recollection of—I gave a description of him, to the best of my recollection—I cashed the cheque with three £100 notes, ten £10 notes, 94479 to 94488, and £30 in gold—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of the £100 notes—it would require a clear day for a cheque paid in to a customer's or edit to come back from the Clearing House if it was wrong—there could be no possibility of ascertaining it at 10. 30 next morning without sending a special messenger—I believed it to be a genuine cheque of Dr. Fennell's or I would not have cashed it.</p>

I am an engine-fitter, of 274, Waterloo Road, Lambeth—on 19th August I was near the <hi rend="italic">Pictorial News</hi> office, and saw the prisoners round a gentleman, and they went from him to the prosecutor, who was looking at the pictures—Linskey got on his left side, and Smith on his right—Linskey put his arm down at the bottom part of the window and put his hand like this, and tried to get the watch out with his left hand—I crossed the road and went into a public-house on the opposite side to watch them, but Smith stood in front so that I could not see, but I saw Linskey's hand come from the prosecutor's pocket with a watch in his hand—Linskey stopped about two yards from the window when he got the watch, and Smith walked to the kerb; they then spoke together, and I pointed them out to Eastwell, who ran after them, caught hold of Smith, and accused him of stealing his watch—I was waiting at the court for a policeman, and Smith came to me and said, "Why don't you let the poor s—get away?"—I said, "Yes, I will let him go away if I see a policeman"—Smith went behind to take the watch from Linskey, but he never gave it to him, and directly afterwards</p>

               <p>Linskey came down the court, and Smith made a running kick at Eastwell, and punched him in the back, and knocked him down—Linskey then gave him a kick, and they got away—on August 22nd I was in the Strand again, and saw the prisoners and another man at the Graphic—I spoke to Callaghan, and they were arrested—I am positive they are the same men.</p>

               <p>—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Salisbury, 8th August, 1889. Sir,—With reference to the business which I unfortunately took over from you, and, to my sorrow, found to be valueless, the result being an actual turn out of the office by the landlord, I regret to have to state that I have not since been able to recover my position, and find it hard to live, much less to settle my London liabilities. It has been suggested to me that now is the time I should make the arrangement with you, and wipe off any liability I may have incurred with respect to a certain deed. With reference to the divorce case of yesterday, the rule <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi> will not be made absolute for a period of six months, and the other side can move in the matter for the intervention of the Queen's Proctor. Now, a certain occurrence took place at 90, Chancery-Lane. A young lady called about 4. 30 p. m. to see the principal; at ten minutes to five the clerk was dismissed, the door was locked, and the young girl departs at 5. 25. There is evidence to prove this by four persons, and this would alter the whole features of the case so far as to the rule and damages granted waiting the result. I shall be thankful if I receive the paper from you to the following purport: I acknowledge that all claims made between Rt. Alfred Flather and myself have been duly satisfied in full. Mrs. Colbeck, of. 30, Wanser Street, will send any letter to me you may send by post—I shall understand no reply to mean a negative, and I shall act as I may be advised")—previous to the receipt of that letter I had not heard of any such suggestion about this woman—there is no truth in that statement in the letter—I at once handed the letter to my solicitor, and a warrant for the prisoner's arrest was applied for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 17, Fenchurch Street—about April 21, 1888, Mr. Antill introduced the prisoner to me, who said, "I have opportunities of discounting bills; it is my intention to do that as a part occupation"—I mentioned a bill of £173, and he said, "I will inquire into it"—on April 27th he called again, after which he either spoke or telegraphed to me that his balance was too low, and he could not discount the bill—at a subsequent interview he said, "I have £5,000"—I asked him if he had a banking account—he said, "Yes; at the Royal Exchange Bank"—he called on 10th May, which was mail day, and suggested our giving him an opportunity of discounting our drafts—I took a bill out of the safe for £131 7s. 11d., and said, "I will give you a turn; do this at something like 5 per cent, under the Bank rate, "and very foolishly handed it to him—he said, "No, I cannot do that; I will do the best I can"—he called next morning, and told me we should have the money before bank hours—we never had the money, and I never saw him again till he was in custody at the Mansion House—I met the bill—we sold the goods, and received an acceptance—the acceptors wanted to pay it, but I wanted to get hold of the bill, and not allow them to be annoyed in any way—I have lost every farthing—they are a large firm, and it would not be well for them to proceed against this man—they would credit us with the goods, but I had to meet the draft, so I sold my goods for nothing—it was a trade bill, given for cocoa nuts—after May 11th I inquired at the Royal Exchange Bank, and the result was that I applied for a warrant—I gave the bill to the prisoner because I believed the representations he made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the bill, it is drawn to Linton, Hubbard and Co.—I had delivered the goods to the acceptor—supposing the prisoner had never been heard of, Hubbard's would have met their own acceptance—they have paid for the cocoa nuts—I had to pay for them originally when we imported them—they would credit the acceptance in the account—there is no one here from Messrs. Hubbard—I swear I paid this money to the Central Bank of London, who discounted it for Goldring and Co.—the prisoner ran away with the money—this is my endorsement, and this is the prisoner's endorsement—they would present it to the bankers of the acceptors, but that was not done—I retired the bill; it was presented, but at my request they did not pay it; I took it up—the cocoa nuts have been paid for in the account—this was not an accommodation bill—we have had one or two accommodation bills with Hubbard's firm—we have not drawn on them when there has been no value—we have drawn on Hill and Co. against the value of goods—these people are larger capitalists than we are, and when a vessel is coming in we very frequently require to retire a draft to a foreign shipping house, and our own customers will let us have their draft and take back our own—when the cargo is on the high seas, and before we have anything to show, we have drawn bills on Hill and Co. for future payments to come—we kept the cocoa nuts at Cooper's Wharf—we wrote a delivery order for £131—I will swear this was not an accommodation bill—I was in the habit of discounting bills at my</p>

               <p>bank, but I did not go there, because the prisoner represented that he could discount cheaper than the banks could—the Bank rate does not rule the market—my bank is the New Oriental, they charge 1 per cent, more than the current Bank rate—I mean to say that he pretended to me that he could discount for less than the Bank rate—my discount account was not absolutely closed—I had known Mr. Antill before; he proposed to discount, but we never had any business with him—I gave the prisoner this bill, because he said that he had a banking account, and had £5,000, and also from his appearance—he said he could not discount the £173 bill, because his balance was smaller than he supposed—his money might be locked up—when he came next day he did not say that he had considerable difficulty in getting it discounted; that would have been an utter lie, because the names are well known in London—I could have gone to my bank that day and got it discounted, but at a higher rate than I wished to do it—I believed he could do it at a lower rate, because he would have a bundle of bills together, which he would pay into his own bank.</p>

On 9th August I saw the prisoner in custody at Glasgow, and said, "Are you John Dunning?"—he said, "Yes"—I read the warrant to him, and he said he was the man mentioned in it—on the way to London he said, "It is very hard on me, as I did not have half of the bill; a man named Goldring discounted it for me, and only gave me £60; I have a splendid thing on hand just now, and it is my intention to pay every penny back"—I found this passbook in his trunk, and another pass-book on the Glasgow branch of the Bank of Scotland, in the name of John Dunning; also another on the Bank of Canada, in the name of E. J. Dunning, and a cheque-book of another bank.</p>

I am postman at the King's Arms, Little James Street—on the night of 9th August the three prisoners were there, between twenty minutes and half-past ten—they were outside, and Denman went inside, and wanted to sing a song—the other two stood outside—Denman said, "You ain't going to refuse a chap that is hard up from getting 1d.?"—I had to go inside, and two or three complained of Denman that he was soliciting alms—finally he went in the other bar, and I turned him out—I afterwards saw the three prisoners standing outside Mr. Fletcher's cabinet factory at the corner near the King's Arms, twenty-five or thirty yards off—I saw Chappell go up to the door twice; the first time he stood up erect; the second time he was in a stooping position, and appeared to be working something—I was standing outside the public-house door when I saw this—after that he joined the other two, and went round the corner, and next time I saw him they were in custody.</p>

I am a joiner, and live at 1, Averell Road, Evison Road—on 28th July I had been to Brondesbury Chapel—on leaving it I passed Mrs. Handford and Mrs. Devison in Evison Road—I heard a report, looked round to see what was the matter, and saw the prisoner fire another shot, and then he fired at himself, and shot himself in the temple—I went up to him, and picked up a revolver, which I handed to a constable.</p>

I live at Glanville House, Didcot Road—on 8th July I and the prosecutrix went out for a walk—we met the prisoner at Walham Green, and went with him to the Red Lion—there was a quarrel there about a ring that belonged to a sweetheart of Crawley's—afterwards she and I went home; she went into her room and began to unpick her hat with the scissors—the prisoner came in, and she began to aggravate him—he asked her for sixpence—she said, "You have had too many b----sixpences out of me"—he followed her into her room—I did not hear the conversation; I only heard the scream—I went into the room, and saw her on the floor, and the prisoner standing against the door with the scissors in his hand—I found that she was stabbed; she said so, and she said, "Don't lock him up"—I don't know what became of the scissors; I found them at night when I came back from the hospital—he said, "Old woman, I will be hung for her;" he was the worse for drink—he went to the hospital with her—I saw the wounds, and put sticking-plaister on, but she pulled it off as fast as I put it on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I saw Mr. Miller at Judges' Chambers, after the Master had ordered money to be paid into Court, I suggested to him that he should make an offer to pay the debt and costs—on 16th May I received a letter—I afterwards saw Mr. Miller, and I think I proposed that if he could get £5 down I should be obliged to him, but that I could not accept £1 a month installment, unless the defendant supplied a guarantee—I should say Mr. Gladwish could not do it; it did not come off—on 25th July Mr. Clark swore the information at Guildhall—on 8th August I went before the Alderman; there was an adjournment for eight or ten days—I did not in the interval renew my suggestions to Mr. Miller that the debt and costs should be paid by instalments—I cannot say I did not say to Mr. Miller in the Guildhall justice-room, "Cannot you make an arrangement and pay the money?"—I do not think I authorised a subsequent proposal to be made for the settlement of this crime on the payment of the debt and costs.</p>

I am single—I am twenty-one years of age; I do nothing for my living; I have done nothing since last November—in July last I was lodging at 3, Lee Terrace, Homerton—I lived in the same room with Martha Forwood, and slept in the same bed with her, and her little girl and a young man; I don't wish to say who he is—I remember the prisoner and her three children being there; they slept in a bed on the floor—I have lived with Miss Forwood since last November—I moved with her to Lee Terrace from a previous residence—when we first had the deceased child it used to be fed three times a day; at the latter part of the time only once or twice; it was fed on scalded bread, and water poured off, and milk and sugar—it used to sleep a long time; once it slept for twenty four hours—during the latter part of the time it used to go to bed at six or seven, and wake up about two the next day—it used to have a bottle of milk sometimes when it went to bed, when we thought it wanted it—I used to go to bed about half-past nine or a quarter to ten—the last three or four weeks the prisoner only came home about twice in a week—she said she used to sleep with some friend in the City Road, I don't know the name; she said it was nearer her business—I never spoke to her about the baby—Miss Forwood looked after the other two children as well as she could—the baby had not many clothes; it had not sufficient to change and keep it clean; it only had two night-dresses, one rotted away and one other—we had to take them off and wash them when the child was in bed—the prisoner must have known what clothes the child had, because she supplied them—the child slept with the mother on the floor up to the last week; then it was put in a lemonade-box; once or twice it slept with me—one night when the mother came home she said she found the baby suffocated; that was about three weeks before July; that night Miss Forwood was at the foot of the bed with the baby, and I and the young man and Miss Forwood's baby at the other end—Eliza Newton occupied the back room to herself; there were folding doors; other people slept in her room—the child was washed; I have washed it many times—I was there on the 17th when the relieving officer came—they were then in a most abominable state; lice in their heads, and so on—I had noticed their state before the officer came.</p>

I am Relieving Officer of District No. 9 of the Hackney Union—in consequence of certain information I went on 17th July to 3, Lee Terrace, about half-past eight in the evening—I found the ground floor in the occupation of the witness Forwood—I found there three children, who, I afterwards learnt, were the prisoner's; one was described as George Marriner, aged six, Minnie, aged three, and Maurice, five months; the two elder, boy and girl, were in a very neglected dirty state, the little one was almost naked, with a piece of rag round its waist—I found the children in the kitchen—I asked to go into the sleeping apartment—eight persons slept in it—it was rather dirty and neglected—in consequence of the condition of the children I took them to the workhouse, with the assistance of the girls—I had received information about the children from Mr. Delahay, one of the officers of the Society for the Protection of Children—there was only one bed in the sleeping room, no sofa or couch—I am not certain whether there was a table—the bed was an ordinary one, four feet by six—the child was removed to the infirmary the same evening—next morning, the 18th, the prisoner came to the workhouse—I asked her how it was that she left her children in that state—she said she did not like to come to me for a medical officer, because she was afraid that we should take her child from Brentford School—that is an elder one; I did not know that we had one there—she said she had given Martha Forwood what she could to keep them, and the reason she stayed away so much was so that Forwood should be able to spend the money she had on the children, and not on her—she came to the Union, and I persuaded her to stay there—the child had simply a piece of rag round the waist, clothing had to be borrowed for the whole of them to bring them down.</p>

               <p>with milk in it; it was in an emaciated condition, and I immediately handed it over to the infirmary, where I attended it till it died at quarter to nine p.m., on 22nd July—between then and the 17th it had been properly fed, and received every attention—it could not retain food, after taking it, in a very short time it would all come back, the stomach was in such a weak debilitated condition it could not digest the food—the thumbs were marked regularly, as if it did nothing else but suck its thumbs—I made a post-mortem examination—there were no marks of violence on it—there was eczema about the genitals and buttocks, and excoriation as if excrement had been left in its clothes, and irritation had set it up—there was no disease whatever in any of the internal organs, with the exception of the base of both lungs there was a little hypostatic condition, not disease—there was not a particle of fat about the heart and kidneys, which is generally found—the muscles were flabby and bloodless; there was no fatty tissue beneath the skin where it is generally found—there was a little curdled milk with a little mucus in the stomach—the small intestines were contracted; the walls were very thin, and almost empty—there was a little faces in the large intestine—the brain and membranes were healthy—in my opinion, death was due to exhaustion, from insufficient or improper nourishment—I had the child weighed the morning after its admission; it weighed 7 1b. 6 oz.—the age was entered as five months—the normal weight of a child at that age is 12 lb. or 14 lb—it did not weigh quite what it ought to have weighed when born; 7 lb 6 oz. would be about the average weight of a male child when born—I was present before the coroner—I heard the girl Forwood give evidence as to the food given to the child, and I have heard her evidence to-day—the account she has given of the food was decidedly improper; you might as well not have given it any food at all—it was improper in quality, and not sufficient—a child of that age ought to be fed every two or three hours at farthest during the daytime.</p>

I stayed with a friend of mine when I did not go home, because I had no chance of a breakfast in the morning, and I was too far from my work; the last week I was at work I only got 2s. 10 1/2 d., and I took her four loaves of bread and a pound of dripping."</p>

               <p>got into an omnibus belonging to the London General Omnibus Company, at the Queen of England in Goldhawk Road; that is the starting-place for the 'buses to the City—before it started the deceased, Mr. Robert Bowman Diack, got into the omnibus—after we started I noticed that we were going very fast—getting towards Brackenbury Road, I noticed another omnibus driven by the prisoner—we were passing him—I noticed nothing particular until about a moment or two before the accident—when we passed under the railway bridge I saw that the horses of the defendant's omnibus were coming fast—I did not notice the prisoner doing anything to his horses—I saw the horses gallop just before they got through the bridge, but I did not notice any whipping or anything of that sort—as we got under the bridge I stood up and paid the conductor the fare, and I heard him ring the bell—the omnibus, instead of stopping, went somewhat faster, and pulled across the road from the near-side to the off-side—the driver paid no attention to the bell—as it did not stop I got on to the step—it took me about thirty yards from the bridge when I jumped off—my friend Diack followed me to get off—unfortunately he had a black bag and a walking-stick in his hand, he did not get off as readily as he would like, and the company's omnibus, having swerved across the road, turned again, and seemed to throw him right across the tram-lines on the off-side—it was about two feet from the kerb when the bell rang—the deceased got off, but he kept hold of the brass rail of the omnibus, and instead of letting it go, as he should have done, that seemed to throw him—he struggled to regain his perpendicular, but unfortunately fell across the tram-lines, and the prisoner's omnibus was so close that the deceased was under his horses' feet immediately—his horses were galloping just as they came through the bridge—there were not more than four or five yards, I should think, between the two omnibuses—the prisoner's omnibus ran over him, the forewheels went over his back, and he turned over, and the hind wheels went over his stomach—I saw fire or six gentlemen come to pick him up—the prisoner tried his hardest to pull up his horses, to prevent the omnibus going over him—he pulled up, and stopped a few seconds—both omnibuses did that, and away they went—I ran after the prisoner's omnibus—I was not certain which 'bus it was, Newman's or Scarlett's—I did not catch him—I daresay he was nearly a quarter of a mile off—I had the Company's omnibus in sight; the other had gone—I spoke to a policeman on the spot.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know that the prisoner sent back a man with a cab, but I saw a cab, as if coming out of a yard—I had known the deceased seven or eight years—he told me that morning that he had been home for a week, and he was going that morning to get leave for another week to go to Hastings to recover his health—he was on the Great Western Railway—I had not the defendant's omnibus in sight all the way from Brackenbury Road to the railway bridge; we were inside; I saw it now and again—I saw it when we passed him, and I saw him coming up behind us, somewhat fast—I saw the horses galloping; they may perhaps gallop eight to ten miles an hour, perhaps ten or twelve—there are tram-lines along the road—when our omnibus swerved to the off-side it was getting on to the tram-lines; they are very bad; the 'bus slides with the lines, and then comes suddenly off—I expect our omnibus crossed the road in that way for the purpose of keeping in front of the prisoner's omnibus—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160067"/>
               <p>could not say whether it jolted in swerving again to the left—I was off the omnibus then, in the middle of the road, about twenty yards away from it; it had gone from me when the accident occurred—the deceased was not thrown to the ground by the shock of the omnibus turning; I think he was not absolutely thrown to the ground by the omnibus; he was thrown to the side, and he was struggling to regain his perpendicular—I suggest that he must have been thrown to the side of the road by the omnibus, and having got there without any wish of his own, he struggled to regain his perpendicular, but fell; that must have been at the time the omnibus was crossing to the near-side, that threw him under the prisoner's horses, across the off-side lines—the prisoner was coming up on his proper side for passing the company's 'bus; that was the reason the company's 'bus pulled across—I don't think it would be correct to say that immediately before the prisoner's "bus ran over the deceased it swerved to the near-side; the deceased fell immediately in front, within a few yards of the horses, and the prisoner did all in his power to pull his horses up—there was no traffic in the road at that time, only these two omnibuses; there was no other vehicle near, except the cab coming from the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The deceased never got on to his feet; when he was thrown to the ground I was in the road where the 'bus had put me down, about twenty yards behind the Company's 'bus; the prisoner was before me at that moment—the omnibus was one with a staircase down the back, with a parallel rail—when I first got into the omnibus I sat next to the conductor, and Mr. Diack sat next to me.</p>

I am a schoolmistress, and live at Shepherd's Bush—about half-past eight on the 29th August I was in Goldhawk Road, going from London in the opposite direction to that in which the omnibuses were going—when within about sixty yards of the London side of the railway arch I saw two omnibuses on my left; I saw that they were driving very fast indeed—both 'buses were swaying about a great deal—the drivers were whipping their horses, and I should say the horses were galloping—after they had passed the arch I noticed a gentleman standing on the footboard of the Company's 'bus, as if he wished to alight; he got off—after he got off he held on to the rail of the 'bus, and took a step or two with the 'bus—the 'buses were swaying about a great deal at the time, and whether he let go of his own accord or the omnibus swayed him I cannot Bay, but just at that moment the horses of the other omnibus (the prisoner's omnibus) swerved towards the left, and the gentleman was knocked down—I was then between four and six yards from the place where he was picked up, looking towards him; they had not passed me at the time—the gentleman's face was towards me—I was a little to the London side of the silversmith's shop—I can't say that the gentleman did let go of the rail of the 'bus—I saw the horses trample on him, and both the wheels go over him; after the first wheel went over him he rolled, and the hind wheel went across his back—some people ran out into the road and picked him up—the 'buses went on some distance—the prisoner's 'bus stopped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I was standing at a small draper's shop, two doors from the silversmith's—my attention was wholly drawn towards the gentleman; I was not looking particularly at the prisoner's 'bus at the moment—I am quite certain that the prisoner was whipping his horses;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160068"/>
               <p>I saw them both whipping their horses; I have no doubt in my mind about that—the prisoner's horses swerved to the left immediately before the accident; it was the near-side horse that touched the deceased—it was not the Company's 'bus that swerved to the left; I did not see it; they were swaying about the whole distance down the road—I said before the Magistrate that I was very much alarmed, and might be mistaken as to distance—the prisoner's 'bus was a very short distance behind the other; it was more on the off-side when I saw it first, and I think if the horses had not swerved the gentleman would have been safe; I don't think the omnibus would have gone over him—I have no idea at what rate the prisoner was going; it was exceedingly fast.</p>

I live at 6, Rodney Street, Pentonville—I have no occupation—I was at the Claremont Club, Penton Street, on 27th August, about 5. 15 a. m., drinking with friends—the prisoner and some companions were at the same bar when the proprietor called time, and they went out first—the prisoner molested one of my companions—I strolled on about 100 yards, and the prisoner attacked me by threatening me—I</p>

               <p>said, "Don't hit me, I don't want any bother"—he hit me—his companions came to his assistance, and I struck out with my umbrella in self-defence—to save further squabbles, I ran down Pentonville Road—they pursued and overtook me in Collyer Street, where I received a blow on my mouth, which knocked me down, and then a kick here (<hi rend="italic">Near his right eye</hi>), which rendered me insensible—when I came to, I saw a policeman with the prisoner in custody—we went to the station, and I charged him.</p>

The club has two rooms in the basement—the entrance fee is 1s., the annual subscription 2s. 6d.—we drink, and play at whist, and nap, not bokhara, faro, under and over, hazards, pool, nor with dice—there is a billiard table—the umbrella had a silver mount—I swung it, and something stopped it; I believe it was the prisoner's head—I had a bad black eye when I attended the Police-court the next day—I went to a doctor, who gave me a lotion—I had bruises about my body—my eye was "bunged up."</p>

I was on duty in Collyer Street about five a. m. on 27th August—I saw the prisoner strike Tompkins a blow in the face, felling him to the ground; I walked gradually towards him, both men were kicking him in the back, then the prisoner leaned over him as if robbing him, while his companion was kicking him in the back—several people shouted "Police"—I went quickly towards them—they ran down Southampton Street, I doubled and crossed Winchester Street to Wharfdale Road, when they turned into a public-house—I ran again and broke into a wharf—I saw the prisoner leaning on some railings—I took him by the left hand and by the throat—he threw me to the ground, I carried him with me—I got up; he said, "I always try to get away from you men if I can"—I said, "I shall take you back for assaulting the prosecutor"—I took him back, met the prosecutor, and asked if he would charge him; he said, "Yes"—I took him to the station; on the way I asked the prosecutor whether he had lost anything, he said he had lost two gold ear-rings, but had picked them up—the prosecutor was sober, but silly through the kicks, I believe, on his face.</p>

I am almost positive the prosecutor was kicked in the back by the prisoner and the other man as well—the prosecutor had an umbrella with a silver-mounted top—he put it up in self-defence—the knob might have grazed the man's head—I saw the umbrella in the air in the prosecutor's hand—I have been in the force some time, and have seen assaults—I should say the prosecutor had more than a black eye, there was a very big dent, and a swelling all over—his mouth was bleeding very much—he spoke intelligibly the next morning—I have not known the prisoner to be in trouble before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Chapman, Messell, and Co., chemical manufacturers, of Mark Lane—the prisoner carried on business at Battersea, as Kingsford, Field, and Co., oil refiners—in October, 1888, he owed our firm £80 or £90, but about £10 of goods were undelivered—applications had been made to him in my writing for payment—he came to the office, and saw Dr. Messell, but I was not present; I got some instructions, and afterwards saw the prisoner—he presented this bill to me. (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> £200, <hi rend="italic">dated October</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1888, <hi rend="italic">at three months</hi>)—it is drawn by our firm, and accepted by the prisoner—we gave him this cheque for £111 17s. 10d. for the balance; it is not crossed; he 'asked me to leave it open, so that he might go and get the cash, and it has been met by our bankers—he afterwards wrote to the firm about a second bill—he was to have £200 at 5 per cent.—Dr. Nichols was to accept, and it was to bear his mother's endorsement—I drew the bill and gave it to the prisoner—he brought it back bearing Dr. Nichols' acceptance—I said that it must have his mother's endorsement before I could hand him the cheque—he took it away, and brought it back with this endorsement, H. A. Field, on it—I then caused this cheque for £200 to be drawn and given to him, deducting 5 per cent. and stamps—that was an open cheque; it has been paid; it was endorsed by him—both those bills were duly presented and dishonoured, no money has been recovered under them—we have got judgment against him, against his mother, and against Dr. Nichols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot tell you whether we have issued execution—I did not doubt the mother's solvency at the time I asked for her name, but I have now, from what I learn from our solicitor—everything has been done; a writ was issued against the mother, and we found there was not a chance of getting the money—the bills were dated October and November, and were due early this year; we have not proceeded criminally till now, because he was continually writing letters and promising payment—at the time I took the first bill I did not take a charge against certain agreements he had, and I believe Dr. Messell did not; I should certainly know it if it was done—I do not know that anybody was collateral security as to charging certain patents.</p>

I am the prisoner's sister—I am single, and live with my mother at Cornwall House, Addiscombe, near Croydon—my mother is in mental trouble, and is incompetent for business—the signatures, "H. A. Field," to these two documents, are not her writing—she was not able to understand anything at all in October and November last year in the shape of business.</p>

A. Field" on it—I afterwards saw him again, and gave instructions to Mr. Smith, our cashier, and the bill was brought to me, with the acceptance of Dr. Nichols—I have received no money.</p>

I am a tailor, of 1 and 3, Goodge Street—on 30th August, between 1 and 2 a. m., I was awoke by the police, and found the gate forced, and marks as if some instrument had been used—I missed eighteen pairs of trousers, two coats, and a waistcoat, value about £15—I had tried all the doors at 12. 15, everything was safe, and I went to bed at 12. 30—these six pairs of trousers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine.</p>

On 30th August, about 1 o'clock p. m., I was making inquiries at a pawnbroker's in the Caledonian Road respecting some stolen property, and someone in another compartment, who I could not see, offered a pair of new trousers in pledge—I asked to be allowed to look at them; the pawnbroker handed them to me, and the prisoner ran out of the shop—I ran out and saw him running down the street—I pursued him, brought him back, and said, "How do you account for being in possession of these trousers?"—he said, "A man gave them to me to pledge"—I said, "Where is the man?"—he said, "The other side of the road"—I took him outside, but he was unable to point out the man—I took him to the station, searched him, and found he was wearing another pair of new trousers which answered to the description, and which the prosecutor identified—</p>

I live at Winkfield Terrace, Leyton, and am a bricklayer—about three o'clock on the morning of 30th July I was awakened, and looking out saw the two prisoners and two other men directly underneath me, trying to effect an entrance through the fanlight over my street door—I opened the window and said, "What are you doing there?"—they ran away in the direction of Clapton—there was sufficient light to see them—I went to the police-station, and made a complaint—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I pointed the prisoners out to Crickmay—Shaw was then half-way, and Grout was three-quarters of the</p>

I am a railway porter—on 5th July, about 5.50 p. m., I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) lying at the side of the railway on some brick rubbish, as if somebody had thrown it from the road, a little above where the scuffle took place; a person going along the road could have thrown it on the line—there was what I took to be rust on it; I cleaned it and gave it to the police two or three days afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 35, Martin Street, Charlton, and am a marine store dealer—on 23rd April I bought these spoons from the prisoner—I asked him where he got them, and he said, "I picked them up in Greenwich Park on Easter Monday"—that would be the 20th—he wanted me to buy them—I said, "All I can afford you for them is ninepence"—he took ninepence, and left the spoons; they were lead and brass—I put them in the window for sale, and two or three days after the police saw them there, and came in with reference to them—I do not think the real value of them was more than half-a-crown new.</p>

On 25th April I received information about this robbery—in company with Alexander, I made inquiries at the marine store dealers', and saw these spoons in Shillingford's window—he told us something, and the same evening we went to Rope Yard Rents, Woolwich, and inquired for the prisoner; he was not in—I called again about two hours afterwards, and was then told that he was gone—I did not see him until last Thursday week, the 14th, when I met him in Church Street, Woolwich, shortly after twelve—I told him he would be charged with breaking into the church in Beresford Street—he said, "I did not steal the things; a man gave them to me to sell on the road"—at the station he said, "I bought the things of a strange</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at 175, Kennington Road, and am divisional surgeon of police—about four in the morning of Saturday, 29th June, I was called to the police-station in Kennington Road; I there saw the prisoner—I first said to him, "What brings you here?"—he made no reply—he looked wild and excited in his eyes—I said, "Have you been drinking?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—he smelt of drink—he had been drinking a good deal, as one who had been drinking for some days, but he stood perfectly erect, and seemed to understand everything perfectly—I then had hold of his hand, and was feeling his pulse, and I proceeded to examine his hand—I said, "I want to look at your hand"—I then noticed some blood on the outer part of his left wristband—I said, "How do you account for this blood on here?"—he said, "Oh, I had a row with some fellow-lodgers last Monday night, and my nose bled, and some of it dropped on there"—I said I thought it looked fresher than if it had been done the week before—I then attempted to turn up the cuff of his coat—he said, "Wait a minute, I will take my coat off "; which he did, and threw it on to a seat behind him—there was no more blood about him anywhere, except on the outer part of the right hand; there was a spot of blood about the size of a little more than one-eighth of an inch in circumference, between the base of his little finger and his wrist, that was quite dry—I said it was blood; but he could not account for it, he did not make any statement about it—there was no trace of blood about his clothes or anywhere else—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was shown to me at the station by Inspector Martin; that was not in the prisoner's presence, it was about a quarter-past four, after seeing the prisoner—it is a two bladed knife—I found the whole of the large blade thoroughly saturated with blood, from point to shank, and about a halfinch or rather less on the handle of the knife—the back of both sides of the blade were all equally covered with dry blood—the blood on the handle was more on one side than the other, but there was a little on both sides—the blood on the blade did not appear to have been dropped on it—it had the appearance of having been plunged into something, as having been thrust into some flesh up to the, hilt, as if it had been used in that way, and went home—the spot of blood on the hand corresponds exactly with that; it is not now in the same condition as it was when I saw it; some of the blood has been rubbed off, off the handle entirely—it still shows on the hilt, but not so much; it has undergone some atmospheric change—having seen the knife, I went with the inspector to St. Thomas's Hospital, and there saw the deceased George Howard—he was then dead—I found an incised wound on the left side of his neck about the width of this blade—that was all I saw—I afterwards heard evidence as to that wound given by the gentleman who made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I also, at the same time at the hospital, saw Margaret Webb—I did not examine her wounds there; she was removed next day to the infirmary, and there I examined her—there was a punctured wound just at the entrance to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160102"/>
               <p>ear, and a superficial wound along the outer part of the cartilage of the ear—it was a wound that might have been produced by this knife—the two wounds were such as might have been produced by one blow—I believe the wound in the ear had severed an artery; it was closed when I saw it; I am not able to say more—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, would the condition in which you found that knife be accounted for by its having been used to stab that woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I certainly think not; in my judgment it would be accounted for by having been used to inflict the wound on the man Howard—the stabbing of the woman would not account for it, because hers was a very superficial wound; although dividing a small artery, the point of the knife would go in a very little way before it came in contact with the bone, and my opinion was, upon examination, that the knife had been struck down into the ear, and the superficial cut had been caused by withdrawing the knife—I say that the knife could not have been so thoroughly saturated with blood by inflicting that wound in the ear, because if the artery had spurted to the extent of being able to saturate the knife so thoroughly, it must have been more on the handle as well; and not only that, but I say it was impossible, because the man must have been sprinkled with blood, and there was not any on him except what he had on the arm; he must have got blood on his clothes, and he had no opportunity of removing it; he was not lost sight of from the time of the infliction of the wound till I saw him at the hospital; there must have been some blood on his clothes to account for the knife having been so thoroughly saturated with blood; that is why I state my opinion; I think the dry condition of the blood on the knife, which I found at four o'clock, is consistent with its having been used at two or three the same morning; it would be impossible to say for an hour or two how long since it had been used—as to the spot of blood on his hand, that is equally consistent with its having come there at two or three that morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went to the station about four I do not think the prisoner had been charged—I knew what he was there for, and expected he would be charged with murder—I was sent for to examine as to his general state; he had been drinking—I did not go there for the purpose of asking him questions—I merely said to him, as I have to hundreds, "What brings you here?"—I did not question him particularly—I asked him to account for the spot of blood on his shirt—I was called on account of a man having been murdered, and a woman stabbed, and as the prisoner was at the station I was requested to examine him—I considered it part of my duty to ask him questions; I made no note of the conversation—(<hi rend="italic">shirt produced</hi>) there is a spot of blood on the underpart of the cuff; it might have been there two or three days; I could not say for a day or two—I said it could not have been caused by his nose bleeding and dropping on it—the version of it I gave at the Police-court was, "I had a tussle with two fellows at my lodging on Monday night, that made my nose bleed, and that is how I account for it"—he said it dropped on it—I did not hear a description of the tussle; I was not present when it was given; I did not hear the whole of it probably; it was that a fellowlodger pulled his nose—if he put up his hand to prevent it blood might have dropped on his cuff on the inside, but it would be awkward—I don't think it could have happened in that way; I don't say it is impossible—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160103"/>
               <p>I may have said that the blood was fresher, and that it was not caused in the way he described—I was not inviting him to make some further statement—I could not say whether the knife had passed through two or three hands before it reached me; it was open—I did not inquire whether it was shut or open when it was found—if the blood on it was wet, I don't think shutting it would spread the blood over the blade—I went to the station with Inspector Martin; I did not talk the matter over with him or with anybody before I saw the prisoner; I think a constable was sent to my house for me—I knew nothing beyond that a man had been stabbed; I knew nothing about the knife—I don't think it was of importance whether the knife was found shut or open—in the case of the woman, I believe that an artery had been severed; I did not see it; I only saw the wound after it had been closed with suture—I should probably have been able to form a better opinion if I had seen it before that was done; in that condition it would not be an easy thing to form an opinion as to what sort of wound it was—I did not see it Weeding; the artery in the neck would not spurt blood; it would if in the ear—there would be a very small jet from it; it might not go on the knife, not to saturate it to that extent; I think that would be impossible—the blood might or might not spurt on to the knife—I say it was impossible for the knife to have got covered with blood to the extent it did from that wound in the ear—when I use the word "saturated," I mean "covered" with blood—in order to express a confident opinion about a wound it is desirable to be present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I should like to have seen it; I don't think my opinion would have been more valuable—I think it would have been an advantage—I was disappointed at not seeing it; I don't think it would alter my opinion, because I heard the evidence of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> afterwards—I should like to have seen the wound dissected; I went to the hospital for the express purpose of doing so—I was present at the inquest; I did not give evidence—I heard Mr. James give evidence; he had the advantage of performing the <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi>—I heard the expression of his opinion with regard to it; I did not hear him say that the blood from the woman would account for the blood on the knife, nor" The knife might possibly inflict such a wound; I should not think it went in to the hilt"—the room was a very long one, and I was not near the Coroner at the time the evidence was given—there were some disagreeable circumstances connected with this matter—I had an appointment to attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>: I went there, and I was told it could not be made that morning, because the man who had charge of the mortuary had the key; and it was performed without my having the opportunity of being present—I was not treated properly—I expected the Coroner would have called me to give my opinion—I heard Mr. James' evidence as far as I was able, but I did not hear him say," I should not think it went in to the hilt of the knife"—that is quite new to me—I did not hear him say, "There might have been as much blood on the knife from the woman's wound;" and I do not agree with it—I express a confident opinion to the contrary, and I hope I have explained why.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on Saturday morning, 29th June, about twenty minutes past two, George Howard was brought there; blood was trickling from a wound in his neck, and was coming more freely from his mouth; he was unconscious, and died in a few minutes—I only examined the wound externally that night; it was on the left side of the neck, half an inch in length, a cleancut wound, and in a transverse direction—a little after half-past three the same morning Margaret Webb was brought to the hospital—I found on her two wounds in the right ear, one a transverse one, superficial in nature, just above the lobule of the ear, another a small punctured one just at the entrance of the passage of the ear, the drum of the ear—in this there was a spurting artery; it was spurting at the time I saw it; the artery had been severed by some sharp instrument—I have the original sketch of it which I made at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in my opinion both those wounds might have been inflicted by one blow from this knife—I tied up the artery and sewed up the superficial wound—she remained in the hospital till next day—on the Monday following, 1st July, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> of the body of the man—I minutely examined the wound in the throat—it was a transverse clean-cut punctured wound, an inch and a half below the angle of the jaw; it passed through the sterno mastoid muscle, and severed or half-cut through the common carotid artery—it was about half an inch in width, and entered the cavity of the pharynx, the upper end of the gullet—that wound was about an inch in depth, till it got to the pharynx, the artery is actually lying on the pharynx—the total depth of the wound was a little over an inch—it then entered the pharynx, which is a potential cavity; the wound would end there—in my opinion that wound was inflicted by a sharp instrument, such as this knife—I first saw the knife at the inquest on July 2nd—I noticed its condition then; it had stains of blood on the blade, it was in very much the same condition that it is now except that there was a little blood on the handle as well—I thought it might have caused the wound, and that the blood on it might have come from the man's neck—there was just a little blood on the handle; it did not go from point to hilt—it is much in the same condition now—I thought that a little spurt of blood from a vessel might have caused the blood on the handle—it need not have been plunged in the whole length of the blade—I was asked that question at the inquest, and I said that the little flange at the end might have caused the wound to be a little more ragged, as it was perfectly sharp—I did not think this little bit had gone over—I do not think that the whole blade had been the plunged into the wound; that is my opinion—I should have expected to find some ragged appearance, and I should have expected some bruising of the muscle if it had gone in; but I could not say conclusively—the blood on the shoulder might have been the spurting of arterial blood; that would be a common result—the knife might have effected the wound on the woman's ear; I could not say definitely—in my opinion the condition in which I saw the knife on the Tuesday was consistent with having effected the wounds on the woman—there was nothing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160105"/>
               <p>in the condition of the knife inconsistent with having occasioned that wound alone; I should not like to say definitely—I understand that Dr. Farre said at the Police-court that both sides of the blade were smeared with blood from point to hilt; that was not so when I saw it—if it was so, of course that would not be consistent with the wound in the woman's ear—if the blade had been completely smeared on both sides down to the shoulder, that would be inconsistent with having caused the wound on the woman alone—assuming the condition described by Dr. Farre, I should say that was consistent with having inflicted the wound on the man's neck—my opinion was entirely formed from the condition of the knife on the 2nd July—assuming Dr. Farre's description to be correct as to its condition on the 29th June, I should then agree with the opinion he has expressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew that Dr. Farre had desired to be present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I made arrangements for him to come on the Sunday morning, but unfortunately when I turned up I could not find our man—the body was taken away from the hospital, and of course it could not be done till the Monday—the wound on the man, after penetrating an inch, would come to a cavity; the breadth of that cavity would be over an inch; beyond the cavity it is speculation as to how far the knife went; there was no mark on the farther side—I thought it probable that the hilt had not gone in, because it was a very clean wound—the length of the blade is over two inches; if the knife had been plunged in the whole length to the hilt, I should have expected to find some mark produced by the small flange; the blood on the handle would be produced by its running down the handle—with such a wound on the man there might be no blood, or very little on the knife; a knife might cause such a wound, and yet be almost clean—the woman was bleeding freely—the small artery I took up and tied would spurt a small jet of blood, and that might be spread in handling or shutting the knife—I said before the Coroner that the knife might possibly have caused the wound on the man—there might have been as much blood on the knife from the woman—it is of course a great advantage in forming an opinion about the nature of a wound, to trace it on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I should place more reliance on observation made at a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> than on hearing an account of it afterwards—if the knife had just gone into the pharynx, the ragged edge of it would not have come into the wound at all, and it would not have gone in up to the hilt—I have no doubt the man died from this wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, living at 79, Hamilton Road, West Norwood—on Saturday morning, 29th June, I was charged with drunkenness at the Lambeth Police-court; a man named Baldry was charged there at the same time; before we were taken before the Magistrate we were put into a waiting-room together—about ten minutes afterwards the prisoner was put into the same room; that might be about ten or soon after—I and Baldry had some talk together, and then I said to prisoner, "I suppose you will get off by paying a fine of 5s.?"—he said, "Very probably"—I said, "What are you brought in for?"—he made no remark then, but after he heard me and Baldry conversing together a quarter of an hour he said, "I am charged with stabbing a man"—he was dressed very superior to us; we were in our working clothes—I said, "Nonsense, man!"—he said, "Yes, I am, and they have got my shirt"—I thought he had got a shirt on; I said, "Nonsense, man! never, I hope"—he said, "Yes, and they have got me, because there is a stain of blood on my wristband; he afterwards lifted up his sleeve, and I could see he had no shirt on, and was wearing a flannel—he said he could account for the blood on his wristband, because he was having an argument with one or two lodgers who were staying in the same house as he was; I said I thought it was nonsense he was speaking about; he said no, it was not, because they had got his shirt, and stripped him of everything—I said, "How came they to arrest you? were you talking to the man; was there any argument, or a fight with the man?"—he said, "No, I never saw the man before"—I said, "Then how did they come to arrest you; was there a crowd round the place?"—he said, "No, there was a very few people; the man was standing there, and I saw him stabbed, and saw blood running down the stones or the steps," I can't say which; and he said he saw the man carried up the steps to the hospital, and very soon afterwards heard he was dead—I said, "But how did they arrest you?"—he said, "I was running away"—I said, "Why?"—he said, "Because I was frightened, and saw other people running away"—I said I thought it impossible for such an occurrence to take place—he said he was running away, that was all—he said a lot of other things afterwards—he said, "The man was stabbed there;" lifting his right hand—during the conversation a constable entered the room, and he asked the prisoner if his name was "ar" or "er"—he said his name ended with "or"—I asked him if he lived about here—he said, "No, I never lived here, I lived at Mare Street, Hackney"—I said, "Have you got any relatives or friends about here?"—he said,</p>

I am an ironer—on the early morning of 29th June I was sleeping on a seat on the Albert Embankment—I had thrown a handkerchief across my face, and was asleep—about three in the morning I felt something like a blow from a fist—I jumped up to see who it was, and I saw the prisoner walking away—I felt the blood running, and I called out" Stop that man"—I saw a woman, who I now know to be Elizabeth Ford, not far from me—the prisoner, when he had got up to her, put something in his pocket, and walked round by the side of the drinking-fountain—Mrs. Ford went after him, and then returned to where I was—I was standing up then—I told her what had happened—she called the police, and they assisted me to St. Thomas's Hospital—while I was going, my ear was bleeding very much—that continued till I got to the hospital—Mr. James attended to me there—I remained there till about twelve in the day, and then left—I was in the Infirmary for about a fortnight afterwards—during that time the wound was very painful—I was then discharged practically well—I had never seen the prisoner before that night—when I was awakened I think my handkerchief was thrown aside—I did not see it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Ford, of 7, Fountain Court, Lambeth Walk—on the early morning of Saturday, 29th June, I was on the Albert Embankment going towards Westminster—I saw Margaret Webb asleep on a seat with a handkerchief on her face—I saw the prisoner walk down from the steps in front of the seat where Webb was lying—in about a second or so, he walked a step, took the handkerchief off her face with his left hand, and with the right hand gave her a blow—she stood up almost directly, and said, "Stop that man"—he was walking towards where I was—I went and sat on the seat—Webb continued to call out; I said, "What has he done to you?"—she did not answer—she said, "Stop that man"—the prisoner passed me towards Lambeth Bridge; he increased his walk as he came away from the girl—I spoke to him before he came opposite me, and said, "What have you done to the woman?"—he did not answer; he came direct in front of me; I said, "What have you done?"—he made a sort of pause, with his right hand in his pocket, in the act of pulling it out; then he passed on faster muttering something, and went round the fountain; I followed him—I saw two policemen, and spoke to them, and they went in pursuit of him up Palace Road, I stood there—he was at the place looking where the man was murdered—I went back to the girl, and saw no more of him till at the station—the girl was bleeding; she did not say what he had done; but I could see blood on her handkerchief and neck—I got assistance, and took her to the hospital as quickly as I could—that same morning I went to Kennington Road Police-station—I there saw eight or ten people—among them the prisoner, and picked him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Coroners for the County of London—on 16th July I held an inquest on the body of a child, named Lucretia Lydia Goodman—in the course of the inquiry the prisoner was called as a witness—he was present throughout the whole inquiry—he volunteered his evidence—he was sworn, and I cautioned him that whatever he said would be taken down in writing, and might be used in evidence against him—I took his evidence; it was read over to him, and he signed it—on 16th July my officer, Saxby, handed me this medicine bottle, marked A; "Best fluid magnesia" is on it—the word "fluid" is in ink or pencil—I took it to my office, and on 10th July handed it to my officer, John Mason, to take to Dr. Stevenson, who produced it at the adjourned inquest on 25th July—on 16th July I also received these three other bottles, B C and D—B contained sulphate of magnesia; that was by my orders taken from a bottle of Mr. Bartlett's by the inspector—C contained carbonate of magnesia, also taken from Mr. Bartlett's shop, as a sample—D was a bottle of fluid magnesia produced by Dr. Bartwell at the inquest from another chemist's; that was produced that the witness Partridge might be able to taste, to test whether the bottle A had the taste of ordinary fluid magnesia—a fifth bottle E was obtained by the inspector by my orders, as a specimen of the liquor potassæ from Mr. Bartlett's shop; that was taken to Dr. Stevenson to be tested—there was also a bottle containing nitric acid handed to me by Mason at the inquest, as having been given to Mrs. Partridge, called alum—here are also some towels, which were taken by Dr. Pitt, and a leather chair-cover which is more or less stained.

On 16th July, after the inquest, I went with the prisoner and Mr. Bartlett to Mr. Bartlett's shop in High Street, Battersea—it is two shops knocked into one, 141 and 143—the shelf on which the bottles were kept was pointed out to me—this is a correct plan of the premises—there would be no difficulty in reaching that shelf by a man of ordinary height; it is about five feet high—opposite it are three gas-burners in the window, and one at a little counter, where the medicines are mixed—all the four burners would throw light on the shelf—I saw the three bottles on the shelf—the carbonate of magnesia and the sulphate are in light bottles, one slightly tinged with green—the liquor potassæ was in a darkish blue bottle, and smaller than the other two—the prisoner pointed to the bottle labelled "Liquid Magnesia," and said, "That is the bottle from which I firmly believe I took the medicine that was supplied"—I took a sample from each bottle, the carbonate, and sulphate, and subsequently I took all that remained of the liquor potassæ, and gave them to Dr. Stevenson, with the leather cover.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am one of the analysts to the Home Office—I have had all the bottles produced for analysis—A contained a small quantity of carbonate of potash and carbonate of magnesia in solution, and in the form of a deposit; it would correspond to about three drops of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188909160115"/>
               <p>liquor potassæ in the pharmacopœia—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Bartlett—I rinsed out a bottle of liquor potassæ, poured it in, and then reproduced a precisely similar mixture—B contained sulphate of magnesia—C had fluid magnesia, and D also; that was a sample from another chemist's—E contained liquor potassæ; that is a solution of caustic potash or hydrate of potash of the British pharmacopœia; it is a corrosive and irritant poison when in its concentrated state, when highly diluted it is innocent, but when taken in a strong form it dissolves the mucous membrane of the tongue—I have heard the symptoms described of the child's death; I examined the organs; I have no doubt whatever that it died from the effects of the liquor potassæ—the magnesia would simply act as a purgative; it would not corrode the tissues—liquor potassæ is an alkali; sulphate of magnesia is not—I analysed some crystals that were given by Mr. Bartlett to Mrs. Partridge; they were citric acid, useful as an andidote for liquor potassæ and other alkalis, but in no sense an antidote for sulphate of magnesia; it would not have any effect on it—I have heard what Mr. Bartlett has said about it—I cannot understand his explanation, nor can I understand if a chemist tasted liquor potassæ how he could mistake it for the sulphate of magnesia; the two things are very distinct—nitric acid is an antidote for one, and is none for the other, the sulphate not being an alkali, the liquor potassæ would be dangerous to life—I have no doubt that it did kill; it has a very alight earthy smell, but it requires a skilled person to detect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were about three drops of liquor potassæ in the small quantity of liquid brought to me, which was a spoonful or two—it had been diluted more than 90 per cent., perhaps twenty or thirty times—it had no smell in that diluted condition—even when concentrated it is practically destitute of smell; it is colourless—I do not know of any obligation on a chemist to keep a qualified chemist for the purpose of selling medicines in his shop; for the sale of poisons there—liquor potassæ is not set out as a poison in the schedule to the Act—there was no organic disease in the child, except what was induced by the liquor potassæ, there was corrosion—bottle E contained undiluted liquor potassæ, which came from the prisoner's shop. <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner received an excellent character.</hi>

I live at 59, Felmore Road, Old Kent Road—on Monday, July 1st, I cashed a cheque for £15 7s.—my brother was with me—I gave him £6, and the remainder I had in my pocket—about three in the afternoon I went to the Duke of Clarence—I there saw the prisoner—I had known him about five or six months—there were one or two more with him—I treated them with a drop of beer at a public-house, and afterwards some tea at a coffee-house—I then got into a tram, and went to the Surrey Theatre—the prisoner went with me, and we met one or two more down there—that was about eight or half-past—I took the money out of my pocket, and paid for all—they could see me pay—they all knew that I had money—about nine we came out of the theatre, and had a drink, and then walked down Walworth way—the prisoner, his son, and one or two more were with me—the prisoner said, "Give me some money"—I said I would not—he said, "If you won't give me any, I will knock you down, and take it all from you"—he then knocked me down with his fist, and he drugged me—he gave me some stuff in a bottle, and put it into my mouth—I swallowed some of it, and I was insensible for ten hours—before I became insensible they cut my pocket out—I found myself in the hospital about eleven in the morning—I lost £4 10s. in gold in a silver case, and about 7s. in loose silver and coppers.</p>

On August 1st I went to a workshop in the rear of 7, Queen Street, Clerkenwell—the door was open, and no one was there—I examined a room above the workshop, and found all this property, and a pot of jam, similar to the one produced—on the morning of August 4th I went with Maroney to 7, Furnival Street, Holborn, found the prisoner there, and took him in custody on another charge—I have got a silver milk-jug and two silver candlesticks here, cut up into pieces—it is not necessary to cut up silver to re-burnish it—I found some molten metal in a crucible under the other things—the room was not used as a workshop—there were no benches; not even a stool.</p>

                  </hi>. I am usher at the Lambeth County-court—I was in Court on the second trial of Thomas Scully against the South Metropolitan Gas Company; I should not like to swear as to the first trial; I administered the oath to Scully; this is the original plaint, and this a copy; particulars of claim are dated 13th May; they claim for damages to cab and horse, and loss by illness of horse, £20 18s.—this is an affidavit for a new trial, in consequence of a policeman not being at the first trial—these are copies of the two judgments of 6th and 27th June, taken by me from the minute-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first trial lasted till 6 p. m., and the second till very late; a great deal of evidence was given on the second trial by the gas company about the purchase of the horse at Aldridge's; a clerk was called from Aldridge' s, with books, to show the horse had been sold to Scully for four guineas; Scully said he bought the horse some time before the first trial; I fancy something was said about a black horse he had had as well as about this chestnut mare—the first trial was on the 6th of June, and on the 20th of June a new trial was granted by the Judge, on an affidavit made by the defendants that a police constable had not turned up as a witness, I think it was—the new trial came on on 27th June—Mr. Howard was called on the first trial, not on the second—on the second trial the gas company called five or six witnesses they had not called on the first trial—some question arose about Mr. Howard being called after he had been in Court the whole time, although the witnesses had been ordered out; he said he did not anticipate that he would be called, and I believe he was only called on account of a particular question that arose—the verdict on the second occasion was for £25—there was another application by the gas company for a second new trial, and the Judge was then told the company had taken proceedings for perjury against the prisoner, and they were then pending in the Police-court, notwithstanding that the Judge refused a new trial the second time—our Judge never directs criminal proceedings; he has power to—I often find diverse swearing to an amazing extent in our court—I think the Judge said as the case was coming into the High Court he must apply to the Judge there for stay of execution—I know nothing of any application to Mr. Justice Wills, or of his refusal—I saw Mr. Price, a veterinary surgeon, at the first trial; I don't remember his giving evidence; another veterinary surgeon did—the question of the value of the mare was put to him—I don't remember his saying the horse was worth £20 or £25—I don't remember Mr. Price being called at the second trial.</p>

Washington; their office is near Mr. Boardman's—at the end of the second trial the Jury came into Court a little after eight, I think—I, with others, of whom Mr. Howard was one, swore an information against the prisoner to get proceedings instituted—Mr. Howard has been instructing me for the gas company—at the first trial he did not leave the Court, I believe, although witnesses were ordered out—at the second trial two witnesses were not called who were called on the first trial; and we called two or three other witnesses—we got the second trial on an affidavit with reference to the non-attendance of a constable—on the second trial evidence was called to prove the prisoner bought the horse at Aldridge's for £4 4s.—we had an official from Aldridge's, with his books, and notwithstanding that the Jury found again for the plaintiff—the first Jury found £36, which the Judge reduced to £31—I do not think the chief element of damages in the plaintiff's claim was the loss of earnings at 12s. a day—on the second trial the claim for loss of services of the horse was still an item—the Jury returned a verdict for £25 on the second trial—Tracy was called for the defendants, and swore, I believe, the stone was not against the lamp-post, as the officer says—other witnesses for the company had sworn that the stone was against the lamp-post when they left it the previous night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On the first trial it was not known that the chestnut horse had been bought for £4 4s.—at the second trial the constables were called who were on the beat, and a plan was used, showing the position of the stone against the lamp-post—Tracy said the stone was not touching the lamp at all, but two or three inches from it, and the other men said it was against the lamp—Price was not called because he was not there till the day after—when the application was made to stay execution the County-court Judge said as the case was in the High Court, the matter had better go there.</p>

I am a cab proprietor, of 63, Upper Mare Street, Chelsea—on 14th May, 1888, I bought a chestnut mare from the last witness for £4—I sent her away the same day to Aldridge's, St. Martin's Lane, for sale—Aldridge accounted to me for £4 4s., the price of her—I went with Mr. Moore, of the Gas Company, to Mr. Fenn, Eltham, in July, where I saw the mare.</p>

I live at 110, Westmoreland Road, Walworth, and am salesman and general manager to Robert Willis, at the West London Cycle Stores, Wells Street, Oxford Street—on 26th August Davis came by himself, and said he wanted a tandem tricycle for a few hours—I said, "We don't let them out like that; we only care to let them out for the day"—he said, "Well, I know Mr. Stead; you let Mr. Stead have them"—I said, "Yes, he is a good customer of ours, and we don't mind obliging him"—he said Mr. Stead had recommended him to come to us, as we would very likely let him have a machine on his recommendation—I thought it over a few minutes, and said, "Very well"—he said he would bring Mr. Stead's card to prove he came from him, and he went away—one or two hours afterwards I came in, and found the prisoners there—they took the tricycle away with them—I next saw the tricycle in the hands of the police on the following Monday, I think—the machine was a Hillman, Herbert, and Cooper's "Premier, "value £20—I identified it in the Police-court yard.</p>

I am a bicycle manufacturer, living at Pelham Road, Wimbledon—on Monday, 26th August, the prisoners came to me about six p. m. with a tricycle—Brett remained outside; Davis came in, and asked me to buy the machine outside—I went outside, and looked at it—I asked Davis how long he had had it, and where he got it from—he said he had bought it at Wolverhampton, the place where he lived—I said, "Have you got a receipt for it?"—he said, "No, we don't carry receipts with us when we are on tour; we have just ridden up from Wolverhampton"—I considered his answers unsatisfactory—I asked him if he had any objection to my trying the machine—he said he did not</p>

Jewell"—I never heard any more of the deal boards nor of Mr. Ritson till he was in custody; I never saw this bill of exchange for £73 16s. 9d. before it came back from the bank to me; it is not accepted by me; I did not authorise anyone to accept this or any other—it is a very good imitation of my signature.</p>

My attention has been directed to this bill of exchange for £75, and to the two letters directed to Spooner and Gregory, signed, "Ritson"—I say the hand that wrote the letters signed the signature and wrote the acceptance of the bill in disguise—I have not the slightest doubt that the body of the bill is in the writing of the person who wrote the letters—I can point out my reasons if the Jury desire it.</p>

I am a decorator, of 6, College Place, King's Road, Chelsea—on Saturday, 7th September, about 8 p. m., I was in Battersea Park Road—I went into a public-house, and had a glass of bitter—I came out, and was walking along; I was perfectly sober—the prisoner got on one side of me, and another, man on the other, and ruffled me about—they both pushed me on one side, and then knocked me down, and the prisoner kicked me in the ribs when I was on the ground—I don't remember seeing anyone else about—I am sure the prisoner was one of the men—I should know the other man if I saw him—I lost my consciousness for about five minutes—when I came to, the men had gone; I only saw a woman there—I missed a sovereign from my left trousers pocket—I last saw it after I called for the ale—I had it in my pocket then, and when I came outside—I got up and went to the station, and gave a description—about twelve that night the police came to me, and I went with them to the station, and picked the prisoner out of twelve men without difficulty; directly I saw him I recognised him as the man who had assaulted me—I had no talk with him and the other man before—I did not offer a woman a sovereign to go home with her—the prisoner asked me at the Police-station it I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Gladstone Terrace, Battersea Park Road, and am a retired police officer—on this evening, about seven o'clock, I was standing between Gladstone Street and Lockington Road, reading a newspaper; about 100 yards from the Masons' Arms—I saw the prosecutor running as fast as he could down Lockington Road, and two men running after him, one about twenty yards and the other might have been about thirty yards from him—one of them was the prisoner—they turned the corner, and ran into a little narrow place called Stewart's Lane, and disappeared—about an hour afterwards I went to the Police-station to see the inspector—Cripps came in to make a complaint, and gave a description of the two men, or one in particular—I was with the police when the prisoner was apprehended, about a quarter to eleven the same night, outside the Rock public-house—I did not go out for the purpose—the Rock is about fifty or sixty yards from the Masons' Arms, and 150 yards from the place where the robbery and assault were committed—he came across the road towards the public house, and we apprehended him—when I saw Cripps and the two men running in the direction of the place where the alleged robbery was committed, I had a good sight of the prisoner—I have no doubt about him; I have known him a long time personally—when he was apprehended the prisoner said, "I have got a b----y pair of new boots out of the <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>"—a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> is a sovereign—I looked at the soles of his boots; they seemed to be a new pair, hardly soiled—they might have been new that evening—that was said before he was charged—he said that to me about the <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> when he was waiting in the inspector's office to be identified—I had not spoken to him—he was sober—the fact of a sovereign having been taken had not been previously mentioned in his hearing—after he was identified he was charged, not before—when the constable took him he told him it was for highway robbery with violence; I heard nothing said about a sovereign—he also said, "There is another thing; it is all through you that I was apprehended, and I will put your b----y lights out when I get a chance."</p>

I saw William Ella hand a perambulator out to a boy, William Cooper I followed Cooper and the perambulator, which he went on with, seeing it answered the description of the one stolen from 36, Glengall Road—Ella was about 100 yards behind the boy—when Ella got into Wells Street, Camberwell, he saw I was closing on him, and he ran—I followed the boy, who went to Camberwell Green, and waited there—I took him and the perambulator to Camberwell Green Police-station—then I took a cab and went back to 54, Bird-in-Bush Road, where I met Sergeants Leake and James—from what they told me I went to the house in company with them—the door being opened we walked upstairs into the first floor front room, and there saw the whole of the prisoners, three of them in Ella's apartments—it is a three-storey house, let out in apartments; only two rooms were occupied, back and front, by Ella and Cox—Cox occupied the back room—Ella paid the rent of one room, and Cox that of the other; each is a bed and living room—I said to Cox, who was in Ella's room, "You will be charged with these two with breaking and entering 36. Glengall Road"—she said, "This is my room at the back"—I went into the back room and searched it; I found twenty-three duplicates under the mattress, a shell purse, two plated salt-spoons, two pairs of nutcrackers, three metal egg-cups, eight plated forks, five knives, and three silver-plated candlesticks—I said, "Do the pawn-tickets relate to your own property?"—she said, "Yes, all but two or three"—I said, "How do you account for these knives and forks and this property that we find here?"—she said, "He gave them to me in the next room"—I said, "You mean</p>

               <p>Ella?"—she said, "Yes"—I took her into the room where the other two were, and repeated what she said, in Ella's presence—she said, "It is untrue; I? ever said so"—I said to Ella, "Did you give her these things?"—Ella said, "No"—I said, "Cox tells me you have; she made a statement in the next room to me that you gave them to her"—Cox said, "It is a lie, I never said so"—the other two sergeants were with us—I took her to the station—Cox said, "I know who has put us away; if I get hold of the b----I will stamp her guts out"—she was charged at the station; she made no further reply—I saw Harriet Ella in the front room with Ella; she said nothing—she is no relation to him, hut she is living with him—some of the pawn-tickets relate to the articles produced.</p>

I had rather you shot me than that I should <hi rend="italic">he pinched</hi>, on my oath I would; this is what you get for minding things for people"—<hi rend="italic">pinched</hi> means being taken into custody—when charged at the station with breaking and entering, he made no reply—Mr. Wakeley has identified nearly all the property I produced as his—the candlesticks and eggcups have not been identified—some of it has been identified by Mr. Bettson; nearly all his property was pawned.</p>
