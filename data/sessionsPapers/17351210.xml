               <p>Lawrence. I have been Constable two or three Years on the other side of the Water - A Neighbour of mine having had his House broke open, I suspected the Prisoner, because he had been an Evidence against Williams, Isaacson, and Gulliford (in February last.) I and G. Holderness went to look for him, and making Enquiy, we heard that the Prosecutor's House had been broke open too. We found the Prisoner abed in his Room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100003"/> in Black-boy Alley in Chick-Lane. We secured him and four or five Women who were in the same Room. Perceiving a loose Board in the Floor we took it up, and found a Dark Lanthorn, a piece of Wax Candle, a Tinder Box, and these two Iron Instruments. I asked him what he did with them. He told me they were his Mills, with which he could open any Door in England - This with the Claw at the End of it is to wrench with, and this with the Round Hole is to put over the Head of a Bolt to force it out. Next Morning he desired to be made an Evidence. I asked him how many Accomplices he had. Why, says he. If you had let me alone but one Night longer, I and three more were to have milled a Silversmith and then I could have jamm'd three or four, but now I can do but one, and that's

            . On the ninth of June about Ten at Night I met two Women in Fleet-street, who asked me to give 'em a glass of Wine, I thought one of them was like a Maid who had been my Servant, but had rob'd me of a pair of Silver Spurs, for which I dismist her, and so to be satisfied I went with them to the Prisoner's House in <placeName id="t17351210-8-crimeloc35">Hind-Court in Fleet-street</placeName>

However, I trea ed them with a Tiff of Punch, and after that, with another, and then they went away, and then I and my Landlady (the Prisoner) had another Tiff. I had been drinking before with a Captain on board a Ship, of which I was part Owner. - And so I fell a Sleep - When I waked I asked what was to Pay. The Prisoner said I had nothing to Pay, and that was true enough - for she had left me nothing in my Pocket ( except three Pence ) as I found when I came home. So I went to her next Day, and asked her if she knew the two Women that were in my Company over Night. No, says She, but they were merry free Girls, and you gave them a Shilling a Piece, and went out with them. I told her, I mist some Gold and a Gilt Metal Watch, and an old fashion'd Tweezer Case. She said she would endeavour to help me to 'em again So we had a Tiff of Punch, and we agreed to Advertise the Watch and Tweezer-Case, to be left at her House, with a Reward of a Guinea for the Watch, and a Crown for the Tweezer-Case. I Advertis'd accordingly, and in two or three Days went to the Prisoner's House again. And she told me a Woman had been there with the Watch, but would not leave it because I had not left the Money. Why Madam, Says I you might have laid the Money down for me, when you would have had the Goods for your Security. But however, there's a Guinea for the Watch, and a Crown for the Tweezer Case. So I left the Money and came again next Day, and had another Tiff of Punch, and then she produced the Watch. But where's the Case Madam? - What Case! is not the Watch in the Case? - Aye but the Tweezer-Case, Madam - Lord Sir, I know nothing of the Tweezer-Case - Why Madam did not I leave a Guinea for the Watch and a Crown for the Tweezer-Case? I swear Sir I thought you had meant the Watch Case, for I never read the Advertisement; but D - the Bitch, I know where she lives, and she shall never sting me so, for I'll make her bring the Case. So we parted, and when I came the next time, she told me, truly the Case was Pawn'd for a Crown, and she must have a Crown to redeem it. Why Madam this is a sort of a Bite upon me, did not I give ye a Crown for the Case! - Aye, but Sir I paid that for the Watch-Case. Nay Madam if that's the Case I am as far off as ever, tho' it has cost me three times more to get this Case than ever the Case was Worth. And with that I went away and resolv'd to go no more after it, for I thought with myself I might chance this Woman to Eternity, about my Case, and all to no purpose. However, about two Months afterwards I received 100 l. at the Bank, and paid away 75 l. of it. And going home about twelve at Night with the rest of my Money in my Pocket, and seeing the Prisoner's door open and a Woman in the Window, a Whim came into my Head to call once more for this Case, And so I goes in, and there was Madam mighty glad to see me, and wondring what was become of me, and why I did not call for my Case, Well, have ye got it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100004"/> now? - Aye, Sir, but shall we not drink first - With all my Heart, let's have a Tiff of punch. So the Punch was brought, and then she bid her Maid fetch the Case, but the Maid told her it was too late. Upon this I gave Madam half a Guinea to Change. I can't change it says she, but shan't we have t'other Tiff. I answer'd No she replied, yes but we will, and I'll join with ye. I was not forward to join with her, but, she brought in another Tiff. I tasted it and told her it was to strong, for it was almost all Brandy. She said she loved it so, for if it was not Stiff it would give her the Cholic. Then I ask'd her for my Change, and she said she'd fetch it; but she stay'd so long that I fell asleep, and when I waked I found her leaning over my Chair with her Hand in my Pocket I ask'd her what she meant by that? She pulled her hand away with my Gold in it and said, Here is a fine parcel of Money to carry along the streets at this time of Night. Do ye think I'll let you go out of my House with so much Gold about ye? - No - if you should fall into ill Company and lose it, you'll think you have lost it here, and then I must bear the blame, and therefore I'll take Care of it till you come again. But Madam, says I, is that a Reason for Picking my Pocket? Why Dovee, says she, do you think now that I would rob you of this Money? No, it shall be as safe as if you had it at home. I'll assure you I keep as honest a House as any in London. - One Night a Gentleman went up stairs with a Girl, and left his Gold Watch upon the Bed. I found it after he was gone, and gave him it the next time he came, and so I did by another Gentleman that left his Pocket Book with a 100 l. Bank Note in it. - Madam I'll have my Money says I, before I go, D - ye but ye shan't says she, and if you stay much longer I'll have your Watch too. - But by good luck I had left my Watch at Home. I continued telling her I would not go without my Money, she threatned to fetch them that should silence me, and so she went away and I expected some Mischief for she had told me before that she kept a Soldier to assist her when People would not conform to the Rules of the House. But in a little time she came in again by herself, and said, What, han't you made an end of your Punch yet? get you out of my House? And so she dragg'd me to the Door, and tossed my Hat and Cane after me. I was so disabled with Drinking that I could not defend my self; I made shift to get Home, but being very sick I lay a Bed all that Day. The next Day I went to her House again to enquire after my Money, and then she said I had not been within her Doors that Night. - My Tweezer-Case was sent to me after she was committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parrot. The Prosecutor told me he had got the Slut in Newgate. I went to see her there; she said she was afraid this unhappy Affair with him would be the Ruin of her. That she had sent one to offer him all his Money to make it up; and had likewise sent to a Man that keeps a little Baudy-Ken, and sells Ale in an Alley in Fleet-street, to tell him that if he did not return the Tweeser Case to the Prosecutor, she should be obliged to discover all.</p>

            , Watchman. Between one and two in the Morning, going up Hind Court, I found a Hat, and looking forward, I saw this Gentleman standing as if he was making Water. I asked him if he had lost his Hat, he said yes, and his Cane too. I found it and gave it him, and asked him where he lived. He said, in Nevil's Alley in Fetter Lane. I went home with him, and at parting he said, he did not know but he might be one thousand Pound the worse for that Night's Work.</p>

               <p>Henry Lee. I being a Country-man. and a Stranger in this Town, was going to my Quarters between eight and nine at Night, and meaning no harm. I happened upon these two Women in Long Acre, and they asked me to go to their Lodging in <placeName id="t17351210-16-crimeloc69">Earl's Court, in Drury lane</placeName>

So they took me up one pair of Stairs, and ordered a Bowl of Punch, and a Fire to be made. I grew uneasy, and was for coming away. for I did not much like them; but they shut the Door, and kept me with them an Hour longer than I would have been if I could have helped it. I had no disorderly Dealings with them, though they did what they could to bring me to it, for they took up their Coverings, and shewed me what Ware they had, and then they would needs examine mine - When the Punch was out, they called for Drams, we drank three Quarterns of Brandy, and then I paid the Reckoning. I had Silver in my Pocket, and Gold in my Fob. As I was going down Stairs, they knocked out the Candle, and the Landlady went out with me pretending to shew me the way to my Quarters. We had not gone one hundred Yards before I mist five Guineas, and a Moidore out of my Fob. Landlady, says I, what sort of People do you keep in your House? I have lost my Money; sure you have not, says she, but if it is so I will go back and see you righted. But instead of going back, she took me down a contrary way to lose me, when a Man hearing me complain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100006"/> of losing my Money, said, why do not you lay hold of her Countryman? And with that she run away, but tumbled down, near her own House, and so we took her. Upon which the two Prisoners came out and swore and called us all to Naught. We went to call the Watch, and so the three Women all run away. When we had got the Watch, we went to the House again, and took the Maid and another disorderly Creature, who said she was a Whore, but no Thief, and she would go with us to find them. We found

             had gave her two Shillings of the Money to pay her Lodging, and that they were to share the rest in the Morning, and told us that Allen was gone home again. We went back to the House between One and Two in the Morning. It seems Allen was then a Bed up one pair of Stairs with a Gentleman, but hearing us come in, she left her Bed-fellow, and run up into the Garret, and got to Bed with two other Creatures, we brought her down into the Room she went from, and Searching about, we found Four Guineas, a Moidore, and fifteen Shillings, hid between a Board and the Wall.</p>

Jordan bid the Prisoner, take the Candle and make the Bed; and while she was doing that I undrest. I put my Breeches under the Pillow and got into Bed. My Money was sew'd up in my Fob. The Prisoner came pretending to take the Candle, but took hold of my Breeches. I got a grip of them. But she cryed, Let go ye Old Dog, or I'll cut your Neck, and so pulled them away from me, and run down Stairs and out of the House, tho' I got out of Bed and called to Jordan to stop her. I put on my Coat and went down to follow her, but he stood at the bottom of the stairs, and would not let me go out, for he said if I did, the Mob would kill me. He gave me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100007"/> a pair of his Breeches to put on. I would have-gone out the next Day but he would not let me. At last I took him up, then he found out the Woman. It was I that made her a Woman, for she was a ragged ars'd Beast before she laid hold of my Breeches.</p>

            . I keep an Alehouse in Rag Fair. On Friday in the Afternoon, the Prosecutor and Jordan and four more, were five Hours, at my House, and got drunk, and squabbled about the Reckoning - Next Day I was told that the Prosecutor had lost his Breeches - Jordan was sent to New Prison, where he lay for a Week. The Prisoner came drunk to my House, and said to me, Jordan is taken up, but poor Man he is innocent, and knows nothing of the matter, for I took the Breeches my self.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor came to me in Newgate, and said. Do not be dead hearted, poor thing! For when you come to the Bar, I won't hurt ye.</p>

D - ye, Sir, says he, more Money. or I will shoot you through the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100008"/> Head. I offered him some Copper, but he swore it was Silver that he wanted and would have. I told him there was all, and he was welcome to search me if he pleased. Then he demanded what Money the other Gentleman had got. That Gentleman's a Lady, Sir, says I; for on the side she sat it was so dark, the Window being drawn up, that he could not by light distinguish the Sex. His Companion then went and drew that Window down, and robbed the Lady, that being done, towards Covent Garden, the Prisoner went, and we drove on.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bardin. Indeed it was not Moon-light: But opposite to us there was a Lamp, by which I clearly saw the Prisoners Face. A Face, I well remembred I had seen a hundred times before, but in what place I could not recollect - When I came home, I met with Mr. Taylor, told him how, and where I had been robbed, and then described the Prisoner's Face, and Voice, and Dress exactly. Taylor, next Day went to the Golden Lyon in Russel street. Thence to the Theatre in Drury-lane, he sent for me. I went; and there immediately the Prisoner I singled out, and seized him by the Shoulder, Sir, you're the very Man that robbed me! I, Sir? Yes, you Sir! Then a Constable was called, but he was so drunk, he could not carry himself, much less the Prisoner: So we called another. In a little time the Prisoner was conveyed to Justice Mitford, and by him examined. Nothing would he confess, but only said, he had been a <rs id="t17351210-24-deflabel109" type="occupation">Drawer</rs>

In an Hour the prosecutor came in, and turning his Back to the Fire, looked wishfully on the Prisoner, and then reaching over took him by the Shoulder, and said, You are the Man that robb'd me. Sir, says the Prisoner, you're mistaken.</p>

             died. In two or three Days after they came, my Wife, and Maid, told me they miss Victuals out of the Closet, and watching to see how it went, saw the Deceased come out of the Closet. I ordered the Cupboard Door to be locked, and then she came to them, and asked for Victuals, and said she was almost starved. I bid my Wife give her some Bread and Cheese, or Butter - It was five or six Weeks after this, the Deceased complained she had had no Victuals for two Days, but a Bit of Liver. I willing to examine into the Matter, peeped through a Slit in the Partition, and saw the Prisoner and Miss Dony [Dorothy] sitting at Dinner, and Miss Charlotte, and the Deceased standing by them, trembling. The Prisoner gave the Deceased a Bit of Bread, and about half an Ounce of Meat. I looked another time when they had pickled Pork for Dinner, and after the Pork was taken away, the Deceased had a Bit of cold Liver, as big as my two Fingers. When her Mother gave her Victuals, she commonly used to eat it cautiously; but eating this Liver more eagerly, her Mother knocked her on the Shoulder, and said, Hussy! how you cram it in?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever expostulate with the Prisoner for using her Child thus?</p>
               <p>Falkner. I did speak to her about it once; and she told me I was a lying Scoundrel. I did not expect such an Answer, for excepting in this Case, she was as civil a Woman as ever came into a House - The Deceased died on the seventh of November. There was no Apothecary to attend her, nor was any of our Family called to see her, nor do I know that any other Person was - Her Mother had a Fire in the Parlor, but the Deceased was kept in a back Room, where there was no Fire, and where she lay upon a Bed without a Bedstead, and she has been locked in for two or three Days together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this in the Summer?</p>
               <p>Falkner It was between April and November.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no Carpet, or Matt under the Bed?</p>
               <p>Falkner I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Charlotte lye in the same Bed?</p>
               <p>Falkner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was not she used in the same manner?</p>
               <p>Falkner. She could help her self, because she used to draw the Beer, and lay the Cloth - The Deceased told me she never had any Beer, but only Water - When she first came she looked something better than when she died, though from the first she was vastly thin, and emaciated: but when she was dead she looked like an Anatomy, as if she had nothing but Skin drawn over her Bones - I looked another time when she stood at the Table, and she had only a piece of cold Cabbage given her.</p>
               <p>Q. But might not she have had Meat given her, before or after you looked?</p>
               <p>Falkner. The Mother, and Miss Doney dined first, before I saw them give her any thing - We have a Charcoal dust Tub that stood by her Garret Door, and under this Tub my Maid used to hide Victuals for her - One Day a Roll as hard as Iron was thrown over from the Roll's Buildings into my Yard. I ordered my Maid to butter it, and put it under the Dust Tub; she did. I saw the Girl take it out, and eat it greedily.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Children work?</p>
               <p>Falkner. Doney work'd with her Needle, but Charlotte did most of the House-work.</p>
               <p>Q You say the Deceased was locked up in the back Room? Did not she (the Week before her death) go out with Charlotte to see my Lord Mayor's Shew.</p>
               <p>Falkner Yes; they went out between nine and ten in the Morning, but I don't know what time they came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the Deceased walking about the House the Day before her death?</p>
               <p>Falkner. My Journey-man told me she came down Stairs dangling her Arms, as if they were hung on with Wires.</p>

            . In two or three Days after the Prisoner came to our House, the Deceased asked my Maid for Victuals - Once I saw the Deceased come from my Closet, I asked her what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100011"/> she had been there for; she owned she took a piece of Bread - We used to put Victuals for her under the Dust Tub.</p>
               <p>Council. When you gave her any Victuals did she eat it?</p>
               <p>A. Falkner. She used to cram it in her Pocket -</p>
               <p>Q. And would she have done so if she had been ready to starve.</p>
               <p>A. Falkner. I have peeped through the Crevice, and seen the Prisoner give the Deceased Beef - and Pork - and Cabbage. But I think not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q Do you know any thing of her being locked up?</p>
               <p>A. Falkner. The Mother, and Miss Dony used to go to Market, and when the Basket Woman came with the Meat, Miss Charlotte used to lock the Door while she came down to the Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is at the Expence of this Prosecution?</p>
               <p>A. Falkner. The Parish, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to the Parish?</p>
               <p>A. Falkuer. I do not know - I went out on Friday Morning, and when I came home, my Girl, said, she believed Miss Nanny was a dying. Mrs. Funnel who likewise lodges in my House, went and knocked at the Prisoner's Door, and said, Miss, How do you do? Answer, was made, she is dead! Mrs. Funnel, clapt her Hands, and said, O ye wicked Devils! are ye not ashamed to starve the Child to death? The Thing was soon noised about. and I went for the Searchers. When they came the Deceased was in bed, and they gave their Opinion, starved to death - The last Victuals I gave the Deceased, was two Months before she died. It was Bread and Cheese, and she pinned it up in her Petticoat for fear her Sister should take it from her - The Searchers said, the Bed was very clean, but not thick enough.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever complain to the Prisoner, of her keeping the Child without sufficient Food?</p>
               <p>A. Falkner. Yes; I have said to her, Miss, looks very poorly, is she not well? and she answered, Yes, very well, she eats more than Doe. I said no more, for the Child had begged me not to tell her Mother, because her Mother would beat her, as she did sometimes. When she told me that, I said to her, Miss Nanny, you are a great Girl. and if your Mother beats ye, I wonder I never heard you cry. Madam, says she, my Mamma stuffs her Handkerchief in my Mouth when she eats me.</p>

I have peeped through the Crack, and seen her standing, when her Mother, and Doee were at dinner with boiled Pork, and Turneps, and saw them give her Turneps, but no Pork - I cannot say, but they might have given her Meat before I looked - I found a hard Roll in our Yard, and laid it under the Dust Tub for her, but did not see her eat it.

I never heard Mr. F. nor his Wife complain that she wanted, but indeed I have heard them say she looked thin. I told them she had a good Stomach, and wanted for nothing.

            , Esq; I have known the Prisoner ten or twelve Years in Tottenham; she visited my Family in her Husband's time, and always behaved very modestly. The Gentleman went by the Name of Thorn, and lived in a handsome manner, at the Rate of two Hundred Pounds a Year. They were visited by Lord Colrain, and the best of the Parish She was a most indulgent tender Mother that ever I saw; nor did I ever see a more sober and sedate Woman, and was company for the best in the Parish - 'Tis an unaccountable Prosecution. These two Children came home since her Husband died, and her Circumstances being then reduced, she lived more privately - She was as good a Woman as the best in the Parish. Since she was committed to Newgate, she has lain on the Commonside, and been reduced to the utmost Straits rather than make her Case known.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marsh. I have known her twenty Years, she was often at my House in Friday-Street, and I at hers at Tottenham, she was as much of a Gentlewoman, as ever I convers'd with. Her eldest Daughter used to be drest up, and visit with her; but the other two were at nurse, and drest plainer: She was no way cruel, angry, or hasty; but meek and tender; and I can't believe it posible, that she would starve her Child; and I saw no manner of Distinction, that she made of her Children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Husband. In the twenty Years, that I have been Minister of Tottenham, she behaved well, was frequent at Divine Offices, came to Church and received the Sacrament, and was respected by the best part of the Parish; I never heard that she was unkind to her Children, and can't believe she would starve any of them - I am sure I was mightily supriz'd to hear such a Report.</p>

As soon as I went in I found another Man who was his Acquaintance, and they two went to Cards. The Prisoner sat close by me, and asked me to Cut. I told them I did not understand Cards, and had no mind to meddle with them. But however, they persuaded me to lay a Shilling upon the Game. I lost that and another, and then I won three Shillings, and at last I ventured fourteen Shillings out of a Guinea that I had in my Pocket. I grew very uneasy, and wanted to be going. I put my Hand in my Pocket to pay, and had got the Guinea between my Fingers, when the Prisoner husseld my my Hand, and said sit down, but presently I mist my Guinea The Prisoner, and his Companion jumpt up. The Landlady shut the Fore-door, and opened the Back Door to let them out. I went to follow them, but she stopt me, and said, I should pay the Reckoning before I went, or else I should leave my Goods. I accordingly left Goods to the value of thirty Shillings, and then pursued the Prisoner, and seized him in Nightingale Lane, and brought him back to the House, where when I came, they put out the Candles, and I fearing some mischief, shriek'd out. At last I got a Constable, who carried the Prisoner before the Justice. The Prisoner told him that I laid the Guinea in the other Man's Hand.</p>

               <p>John Dickson. I went to an Ale-house in Drury Lane, where I met the Prisoner. We drank together, and went to another Ale house in Long Acre, where we staid till past twelve at Night. She said then it was so late, that she should be locked out of her Lodging. I told her she should be welcome to lie in my Maid's Bed. So we went home together. I took her to the Maid's Bed. She asked me where I lay, and I shewed her; she said she liked that better, and so without any more to do, she undrest and went into it. I told her I would not lie out of my own Bed; she answered, I might do as I would, but for her part she would stay where she was. I found there was no remedy, and so I went to bed to her. When I awaked in the Morning, my Lady was gone, and had taken my Breeches with her, and all that was in them: she could not get out at the Yard Door, but by the help of a Ladder, she found the way over the Wall. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100014"/> six Months before I could find her again; and then she confest where she had sold my Watch, and to whom she had given my Breeches. <rs id="t17351210-39-verdict161" type="verdictDescription">

The Play was almost done and they were making Preparation for the Entertainment, when the Prisoner came in and sat down next to me. And high Words rose between him and the Deceas'd about a Stock-Wig for a disguise in the Entertainment, the Prisoner had play'd in this Wigg the Night before, and now the Deceas'd had got it. D - ye for a Rogue, says the Prisoner, What Business have you with my Wig! I am no more a Rogue than your Self, says the Deceas'd. Its a Stock Wig and I have as much right to it as you. Some of the Players coming in, they desired the deceas'd to fetch the Wigg and give it to the Prisoner. The deceas'd having found another Wig, he fetched the Wig in dispute, and gave it to the Prisoner, and said to him, Here is your Wig, I have got one that I like better. The Prisoner sitting by me, took the Wig, and begun to comb it out, and all seemed to be quiet for half a quarter of an Hour. But the Prisoner begun to grumble again, and said to the Deceased, G - D - ye for a black Guard scrub Rascal, How durst you have the Impudence to take this Wig? The Deceased answered, I am no more a Rascal than your self. Upon which the Prisoner started up out of his Chair, and having a Stick in his Hand, he gave a full Longe at the Deceased, and thrust the Stick into his left Eye, and pulling it back again he looked pale, turn'd on his Heel, and in a Passion, threw the Stick in the Fire. G - D - it! says he, and turning about again upon his Heel, he sat down. The Deceased clapt his Hand to his Eye, and said it was gone through his Head: He was going to sink, and they set him in a Chair. The Prisoner came to him, and leaning upon his left Arm, put his Hand to his Eye, Lord! cryed the Deceased, it is cut. No, says the Prisoner I feel the Ball roll under my Hand. Young Mr. Cibber came in, and immediately sent for Mr. Coldham the Surgeon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I shew any Concern afterwards.</p>
               <p>Arne. I believe he was under the utmost Surprize, by his turning about, and throwing the Stick in the Fire, and he shew'd a further Concern, when he felt of the Eye-Ball.</p>

            . I am a Dresser in the House, under a Comedy player. On the Fryday Night the Prisoner asked me to lend him a Comedy-Wig to play Sancho, in the Fop's Fortune. And the next Night, the Deceas'd came and asked me for the same Wig. I told him I had it not, and bid him go to the other Dresser - As I was afterwards waiting in the Hall for my Money, the Prisoner came in, and asked the Deceas'd for the Wig, the Deceas'd answered that he should not have it, and the Prisoner reply'd, you're an Impudent Rascal, and ought to be can'd for your Impudence. Mr. Mills, who was acting Juba, came and said. What's the matter with you? We can't play for the Noise you make, the Prisoner answer'd, This Rascal has got a Wig that belongs to me. Mr. Mills said to the Deceas'd, Hallam, don't be impertinent, but give him the Wig. Hallam still refused, upon which, the Prisoner said, G - D - ye, such little Rascals ought to be made an example of, and so turn'd out of the Room. I being drest in Shape, went up, and undrest. Mr. Woodford bid me bring down a Scimitar, which I did, but, when I came down I could not find him, and so I went into the Scene Room: The Deceased was then standing still between the Door and the Settle. The Prisoner was about three Yards from him, and starting up, he made a sudden Longe (whether stepping or running, I can't say) the Deceas'd clapt his Hand to his Eye, and made a Reel, as if he was throwing himself into the Settle - The Prisoner seem'd to relent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cole. The Deceased came first into the Scene-Room, and complain'd that the Prisoner had used him ill about a Comedy-Wig. The Prisoner soon followed, and said the Deceased had used him ill and impertinently, and he insisted upon having that Wig - They went out separately. The Deceased came in again. Mr. Fabian, the Author of a Farce to be acted that Night, Mr. Mills, and others, advised<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100015"/> the Deceas'd to see the Prisoner have the Wig, and Mr. Kitchin the Property Man promis'd to help him to a better. The Deceased fetch'd the Wig and gave it to the Prisoner, and then Mr. Kitchen gave another Wigg to the Deceased. The Deceased held out this Wig to shew it, and said he lik'd it better than the other, you saucy impertinent Rascal, says the Prisoner, I wonder how such a litle Scoundrel dared to take a Wig out of my Dressing-Room; the Deceased told him, he had it of the Dresser - D - ye you Dog, says the Prisoner, do ye prate? And rising up from the Settle, he push'd at the Deceased, who then stood stock still, between me and the Settle - I was so near him, that I was afraid my own Eye would have been hurt; he reel'd, and I catched him in my Arms.</p>
               <p>Council. Who does the Dressing Room where the Wig was kept, belong to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cole. Not to the Deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Has every one a particular Room to dress in?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cole. There were three or four who drest in that Room, but the Deceased did not belong to it. But he said the Dresser gave him the Wig - I believe the Dresser's Name is Greenwood.</p>

The Deceased reply'd, No more a Scoundrel than your self. Some other Words passing, the Prisoner rose up, and I think said, D - ye, you little Dog do ye prate, and then gave him the Blow. He clapt both his Hands to his Eye, and cry'd, O' Lord ! I believe my Eye is put out, and would have fal'n in the Fire, if Mr. Cole had not catch'd him.

Had the Blow been elsewhere, it might have had a less fatal Effect. I was astonished that a Man should die by such an Instrument - when I first attended him, the Prisoner shewed much Concern, and desired me to take all possible care of him.</p>

               <p>Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I plaid Sancho the Night before, and the Wig I then used was proper for the New Play, and absolutely necessary for my Character; the whole force of the Poet's Wit depending on the lean meagre Looks of one that wanted Food. This Wig therefore being so fit for my purpose, and hearing that the Deceased had got it, I said to him, You have got the Wig I plaid in last Night, and it fits my Part this Night - I have as much right to it as you have, says he. I told him I desired it as a Favour: he said, I should not have it. You are a Scoundrel, says I, to deny me, when I only ask that as a Favour, which is my right. I am no more a Scoundrel than your self, says he, and, and I went to the Prompter's Door to see for Mr. Cibber. Mean while the Deceased went into the Scene Room, and said, that I had used him like a Pick-pocket - The Author persuaded him to let me have the Wig, and the Property-Man brought him another Wig. He threw the first Wig at me. I asked him why he could not as well have done that before. He answered, because you used me like a Pick-pocket. This provoked me, and rising up, I said, D - ye for a Puppy, get out. His Left-side was then towards me, but he turned about unluckily, and the Stick went into his Eye. Good God! says I, What have I done! and threw the Stick in the Chimney. He sat down, and said to Mr. Arne's Son (who was drest in Women's Cloaths) whip up your Coats ye little Bitch and Urine in my Eye; but he could not, and so I did. I begged them to take the Deceased to the Bagnio, but Mrs. Moore said, she had a Room where he should be taken care of. I had then no thought that it would prove his End, but feared that his Eye was in Danger. But next Morning I saw Mr. Turbut, who advised me to keep out of the way, or I should be sent to Jail - I begged him to get the Assistance of a Physician, and gave him a Guinea, which was all the Money I had - From the Beginning of the Quarrel to the end, it was but ten Minutes, and there was no Intermission.</p>

            . I had played that Night, and was in the Scene Room when the Deceased came in, and seemed flush'd, and said, Mechlin has used me like a Pick-pocket. I had this Wig of Mrs. Greenwood, the Dresser, and now he wants it; but I think it is as proper for my Character as for his - The Prisoner then came in, and demanded it. Upon which, in a merry way, it was put to the Question, which of them should have it, and it was agreed that the Prisoner should. Mr. Kitchen came in, and said, Here is another Wig. The Deceased then tost the former Wig to the Prisoner, who said to him, why could not you have done this before. He answered, because you used me like a Pick-pocket - You lye, says the Prisoner; and you lye, says the Deceased - You are a Scoundrel, says one, and You are a Scouudrel, says another. At last the Prisoner rising up, said, Ye Puppy, get out, and pushed at him, but I believe not with any particular Aim.</p>

            . At five in the Evening, I locked my Stair Foot Door (but not the Street Door) and went over the way. I returned about six, and found my Stair Foot Door open, and a Gown upon the Stairs. Coming into my Room I mist my Goods, and found a Man's Hat upon the Floor. I was informed that Sarah Miller (who buys and sells in Rag Fair) had pawned such Goods as I had lost. I met with her, and she told me she had them from Belmosset, and Sears. I found some of them pawned at Mr. Martins, against White Chappel Church. Some she sold to the Prisoner Weston. The Constable went with a Warrant to search for the rest, at the three Blue Balls in Mansell Street in Goodman's Fields, but the Pawn-broker would not let him search.</p>

He took from me a Gold-Watch, two Keys, some foreign Silver and Gold Coin, and one Shilling and six Pence in Money, one Window of the Coach was drawn up (I think it was Canvas) so that I could not see if any Body was on that side. Maccray attacked me on the other-side between the Coach and Hedge, at his going off he bid the Coachman drive slow. When he was gone, I got out of the Coach, and saw three, four or five Men on Horse-back in the Road, I can't exactly say at what distance they were but I believe one might be about fifty Yards of, another a hundred, another two Hundred, and another three Hundred. I held up both my Hands thus to alarm them. They did not seem to regard me. but rode on towards London, which was contrary to the way which Maccray went. I met with some Persons on Foot, and told them I had been robb'd, I described the Man and Horse, and desired them to pursue him.</p>

               <p>Dr. Lancaster. Finding Brown in a very weak Condition, I allow'd him Meat and Drink for his Subsistence, but no more than was absolutely necessary. I consulted some Lawyers, and looked into Law-Books myself on this Occasion. Brown's Confession was made before Col Deveil, before I knew any thing of it, and the Colonel advised me to go and see him. I said I had been so ill treated, that my Life was in danger, and I had often fled for it. However, I went, and I laid before Brown in the strongest light I was able, the danger of Perjury both here and hereafter He told me among other things, that Wreathock offered him One Hundred Guineas to kill me.</p>

So I take a de Horse, and he meet a me by Moumot-street. and ve go togader to Shelsea-Road, and dare ve find Maccray first,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100019"/> and he say, Stand a you dis a vay at a distaunce. I vait for a Doctor in a Coash, and I shall rob him and ave his Money.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. He can speak louder if he will, for as bad as he pretends to be, he eat a whole Fowl yesterday for his Dinner.</p>
               <p>Council. I will ask you particularly, who was there with you in Chelsea-Road - Was Wreathock there?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes he was one.</p>
               <p>Council. Name the Rest.</p>

               <p>Brown. Shamberlain Two, Ruffit Three, Bird Four, Campbell Five, and I and Maccray, dat vas Seven.</p>
               <p>Council. And are you Positive, these were all there?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, very Positive - Wreatock ve call de General, because he gives Instrution - His Reverence de Doctor come in de Coash at seven minutes after Nine. His Reverence sit vid his Back towards the Horses, and dare vas a Gentleman and a Gentlewoman sit togader on de oder side, den Maccray come from de side of de Hedge and bid de Coash Stop! Stop! Den he clap the Pistole to his Reverence Stomack, and tell his Reverence to deliver vat he have, and I turn my Horses Head to look, and I see his Reverence deliver his Vash and Keys into Maccray's Hat. Wreatock vas den at a leetel distaunce, and Maccray run to him and trow de Vast into his Hat, Wreatock put it into his Vastcoat Pockate, and he say, ve must not go all togadar, and his Reverence come out of de Coath, and hold up his Hands, and cry Highwayman! Tees !</p>
               <p>- I did see a leetel Boy by the Coash, but I no take mush notice.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lancaster. I said to Brown, before I go on with this Prosecution, you must convince me by some private token that you was there. And then he told me this Sign, of holding up my Hands, and this encouraged me to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Brown. Ven his Reverence 'old up his Hands, I vas so far from him as to dat Vall in de Yard. Shambarlain vas in de middle of us, and he say to Maccray, D - you, vy you no blow his Brains out - Ven de Coash was rob, I vas so far off as twice dat Vall in de Yard - Bird, Campbell, Wreatock, and Maccray go all four togadar, and Chamberlain and Ruffit, go togader, and they say to me, You go that vay, I go vid mine self, and miss no Gallop. Ven I come to Atton-Garden, I meet Wreatock, coming out of his 'ouse and he tye my Horse to his Rail, and ask me to Drink Vine at de Tavern, in de Corner of dat Street. Ve go dare and drink von Pint at de Door, Den he said, I have business, I must go in de City, and in a couple of Days you may call at my 'Ouse - So ven I came again, he say to me. God bless my Soul Tom is taken Yesterday - dat is Tom Maccray - and I told Wreatock, Vat you do vid de Vash, O, he said, it is to soon to sell it now, but in a leatel time, I will sell it and den everyone shall have a Share.</p>
               <p>Bird Did you not on Maccray's Trial, Swear that you and Maccray were at an Alehouse in Holborn at the time this Robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, I did, I don't deny it, but there, I forswore myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you say so?</p>
               <p>Brown. Wreatock, had all de Witnesses at de Kings-Head in 'Oborn, and said he you'd give five Guineas a piece to swear for Maccray, and dere vas to be six Witnesses in de Hall, and four in de Court, I said, it is very hard for me to forswear myself. And he answer'd G - D - ye! if you don't, dey will swear your Life away. But ven I vas Sick nine Weeks, I tink it vas a very vicked ting to rob his Reverence and forswear myself, and so I make de general Confession and Information  to clear my Conscience.</p>
               <p>Council. What time of Night was it when you was at the Tavern with Wreathock.</p>
               <p>Brown. From Ten till Three in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Council. I don't mean the Night when the Witnesses met, but the Night of the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Brown. Ven I came to Wreatock's house vid de Horse, it was two or three minutes past Ten, and den ve go directly to de Tavern,</p>
               <p>Campbell. Did we go towards London, or Chelsea?</p>
               <p>Brown. I came directly home, for I turn'd myself and past de Coash, and dey took another way on de left Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wreathock go by the Coach.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100020"/>Brown. No, he was before it, and den dey vent to London and Maccray vid them.</p>
               <p>Campbell. We shall contradict that.</p>
               <p>Brown. Dere is no two suth Rogues in Europe to find false Vitness.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. How came you acquained with me?</p>
               <p>Brown. In your own House. Campbell brought me</p>
               <p>Campbell. Did Mac Cray ride towards London when he had robb'd the Coach?</p>
               <p>Brown. Wreatock, Campbell, Bird and Mac-Cray, all four come togader toward London.</p>
               <p>Campbell. The Doctor swears Mac Cray went directly from the Coach the contrary way.</p>
               <p>Brown. He might turn off anoder way, when he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. Did I or my Footman give you the Horse at my Door?</p>
               <p>Brown. Wreatock did, and he give me two Pistols just as I go avay.</p>
               <p>Q, How came you to make the Discovery?</p>
               <p>Brown. I vas nine Weeks very ill and bad, and expect my self to die, and I tink it very hard upon my Conscience, to rob his Reverance, and to lose my Soul and forswear my self: So I sent for Justice Deveil, and he say to me, Take care - consider - recollect - speak noting but de Trute, I beg you, for it is a great matter. He tell me dis an Hour before he write - I sent for de Doctor, and his Reverance tell me, Speak de Trute, I beg you for God's sake, and noting else; and so he say, fivety times every Day - I make dis Discovery to comfort my Conscience, for I tink of God to be my Judge.</p>
               <p>Justice Deveil. On the thirty first of October, while I was at Dinner with a Gentleman, a (Justice of the Peace,) I received a Letter from one Wolham a Prisoner in the King's Bench; I at first suspected it might be a Trap laid for me, but considering it was in a Prison, I took the Justice with me, and went. Wolham said he had a Man ready to carry me to 
               <persName id="t17351210-54-person366">
                  Julian

            ; when I heard his Name, I suspected a Design to murder me, but yet, as I was willing to know what he had to say, I took four Men well arm'd and the Justice with me, and went to Brown's House: I found him in a very weak Condition, he said he sent for me to take his Information; I charg'd him to be cautious, and not to accuse any Man wrongfully, for it was a Matter of the utmost consequence. He answered, that what he desired to do, was to purge his Conscience. I was above three Hours with him, tho' I could scarce bear the smell of him and the Room.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. What's his Character?</p>
               <p>Deveil. That he has been a very ill Man, but this was on his Repentance.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Did the Doctor mention the signal before the Confession was made?</p>
               <p>Dr. Lancaster, I never told that Circumstance to any one living, till after Brown's Confession.</p>
               <p>Campbell. Brown might have that Signal from Mac Cray.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lancaster. Mac Cray did not see that Signal.</p>
               <p>Campbell. The Doctor lifted up his Hands to some Persons (as he himself has sworn) and they might speak of it to others.</p>
               <p>The Defence of the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. I have been an Attorney these eighteen Years, and have acquired in this Capacity a small Fortune. I have lived (in Hatton-Garden ) eleven Years, in as much Credit as Dr. Lancaster himself I kept two Clerks, a Footman, and Women Servants and have constantly been in a Hurry of Business, and therefore under no Temptation to hazard my Life, by robbing on the Highway. I was not taken, but surrendered my self, which it cannot be suppos'd I would have done, had I known my self to be guilty: It is not indeed impossible, but far from being probable, that seven Men should ride out together to commit a Robbery. Brown says he has known me six or seven Months; it 'tis six Months since this Fact was done, and 'tis unaccountable that on such a short Acquaintance, I should venture to accompany him in such an Expedition, and espe-cially that I should do this in a Place where I was likely to meet some that knew me for having an Estate at Fulham, I often pass'd that Road.</p>
         
               <p>The Impatience of the Town for these Trials, obliges us to defer the Second Part for several Days.</p>

               <p>WREATHOCK, none of us were ever charged with any thing of this nature, before the Birth of this execrable Device, for such I hope it will appear to be. 'Tis very strange that a Man should this foolishly, and without being under the least necessity, put his Life into the Power of others.</p>
               <p>We should call the Coachman, the Gardener's Boy, the Turnpike Men, and others, to prove, there were not (tho' Brown swears the Truth there must have been) six or seven Men on the Road when the Robbery was Committed. And has to myself in particular, I shall prove that I was at the Kings-Head in Holborn from eight that Evening, till twelve at Night - What I observ'd as to the time of my acquaintance with Brown, has been only from his own Words but in fact, I never knew nor so much as saw him till about five Months ago, he was tryed in this Court for a Rape.</p>
               <p>Campbell. The six first Witnesses we shall call are Persons who were upon the Spot, and their Evidence will be in behalf of us all.</p>

            , Coachman. I drove the Coach when Dr. Lancaster was robb'd. There was he and another Gentleman and a Gentlewoman in the Coach, but how they sat, or whether the Windows were drawn up or not, I cannot say. Just by the Coach side when the Robbery was committed there was a Soldier and a Woman, who went towards Chelsea after the Highwayman went away, and I saw no other Persons. The Doctor got out at Bloody-Bridge, where two Men met him. He spoke to them and he and they went towards Chelsea. After the Highwayman, I saw no Horses on the Road, till I came to London, and if there had been any I must have seen them for I turn'd my Head and look'd about. I know not the Day of the Month or Week, but it was between eight and nine a Clock. A clear Evening but duskish.</p>
               <p>Campbell. I would ask the Doctor if this is not the Coachman.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lancaster. I don't remember that I observ'd the Coachman's Face. But I afterwards saw such a Coach, and enquiring who drove it at that Time, the Master of the Coach produced his Man.</p>

            , the Gardener's Boy As I was coming out of the Red Lyon Ale-house in the Kings Road, at nine or little after, I saw a Man turn from the Coach, and I saw no other Horseman on the Road. I followed the Coach to Bloody-Bridge, where my Master lives, and where it stopt, and the Doctor got out, and told the Landlord of the House there, that he had been robb'd, by a single Highwayman, and said he would give a Crown a Piece to some Men to pursue him - There was a Soldier and a Woman hard by.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. If there had been any Horsemen on the Road, do you think you should have seen them.</p>
               <p>Boy. Yes, I must seen them, for the Road is but twenty three foot Wide.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. Could not you see a quarter of a Mile, both Ways from the Lyon?</p>
               <p>Boy. No, not above three hundred Yards, for it was dusky, and the Road is not Straight.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Is there not one turning to Chelsea, and one to Chelsea-Common, near that House.</p>
               <p>Boy. Yes there is - It was a Haizey Evening. and it had rained that Afternoon.</p>

In the close of the Evening it was near nine a Clock ( but as light as it is now at half an hour past four) I went over the Fields with a Gentleman, on Foot from Hidepark Corner, and going towards Bloody-Bridge, there was a Crowd of People about the House. They said a Person had been robb'd presently a Horseman came full speed from Fulham. One of the Company said he believed that was the Man upon which the Gentleman who was with me, having a Bayonet at the end off his quarter Staff. Stopt the Horse and examined the Man. He told us he was no such Person as they took him to be, but that he had met a Man riding the other way - I saw no other Horseman on the Road.</p>

The Doctor came out of the Coach, and asked if I had any Men in the House, for the had been robb'd. My House was as far from where the Robbery was done as it is from hence to Newgate-street. I saw no body in the Road, but those that belong'd to the Coach, and a Soldier and a Woman that past by my Door.</p>

I was Smoaking a Pipe at my Door, and talking to an old Man, when a Horseman came riding full speed, towards Fulham: Says I, that Fellow rides as if he were drunk or Mad - I saw no Horseman on the Road but him; two Men on foot came up, and said that Man had robb'd a Person, between the lion and Bloody-Bridge and that the Parson between the Red Lion and Bloody Bridge, and that the Person would give a reward for pursuing him, they pull'd of their Coats, and left them in my House - The Doctor than came up, and told us he had been robb'd. The Turupike is just above my House, and was open, I stay'd at the Door till ten at Night.</p>

It has been sworn, that Mac Cray rid towards Fulham: Now I would once more ask the Doctor, whether when Mac Cray robb'd the Coach, he rode directly that Way or towards London.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lancaster. He did not ride towards London, but he rid the other Way.</p>
               <p>Wreathock. I thank you Doctor ! This is a full Contradiction to Brown, who swore that when Mac Cray left the Coach, he rid directly towards London.</p>

            . I live In Westminster, and have worked as a Carpenter to Mr. Wreathock, four Years. He told me he had a Mortgage on an Estate, in Little-Britain: The Houses not being finish'd, he asked me what it would cost him to finish them, and I computed it at two thousand Pounds: He said his was a second Mortgage, and he wanted some Goods upon the Premises to be remov'd, he desired me to do it on the eleventh of June, because that being a Holyday, the first Mortgagee could not then prevent it. Accordingly I got Assistance, and on the eleventh of June we moved the Goods from Little-Britain, to the Windmill Ale-House by Hicks's Hall. When this was done, we went to inform him of it: We found him at Mr. Lincolns the King's Head in Middle-Row Holborn. It was five or ten Minutes past eight when we came there, I supp'd with him upon Calves Liver and Bacon fryed, and staid 'till twelve at Night, and he was never our of my Company but once, when he stept into another Room to speak with a Gentleman - I am certain it was the eleventh of June, both by my Father's Books, and my own.</p>

I made the second Mortgage; and afterwards waiting upon the first Mortgagee; I thought by his Discourse, we had Reason to fear a Writ of Execution, upon which I advised Wreathock, to move the Goods; which he concluded to do, on the eleventh of June, because an Ejectment could not be taken out that Day, it being a Holyday. In the Evening I was with him at Serjeant's Inn Coffee-House, At near eight of the Clock, we went from thence, to the King's Head Tavern: Between eight and nine, Totteridge and Whitman came in, and said, they had moved the Goods; we said 'till twelve, and then Totteridge and I went out at the Back-door. I went through Chancery-Lane, and coming to the Temple-Gate, I saw the Embers of the Bonfire, that had been made that Night.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Freer.

She gave me a Box, a Gold Ring, and three pieces of Callicoe, I asked her if she had any thing else of my sisters, and she said no.</p>
               <p>Council. Did she say nothing about putting things up in a hurry?</p>
               <p>Mrs Freer. No - When the Goods were found in her Custody, she said, that I bid her take every thing that was in the Drawers, and so she took those things among the Rest. I told her indeed she might take all her Lady's (my sister's) Linnen and when she brought the Gowns and Petticoats to me, I took what I thought fit, and gave her the remainder.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Freer. My own.</p>

And its very likely that I might, when we were in such a hurry and Confusion, put some of my old Lady's things among my own. The Night before we went away, I would have settled with Madam Freer (my old Lady's Sister and Executrix) but she said she had not leisure then, and she would settle with me when the Family came to Town again - Sir Wolstan turn'd me away suddenly, and I return'd to London in August last, but Mrs. Freer has never yet called in to settle the Account, and the Five Year Wages and other Money is yet due to mes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Betts. I had her from her Friends, when she came about fourteen Years old, she lived with me two Years, and went from me to Madam Freer. I never heard a Word a-miss of her before, for she had an unspotted Character, and I always valued her for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Witham. I knew her before she lived at Mrs. Freers, she always bore a very good Character, without the least Aspersion.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Preir. I have known her ten Years, she had a very honest good Character - I visited her Lady, who had a very good Opinion of her.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Freer. Both these Diamond Rings were Lady Dixy's, but I do not know the Locket.</p>
               <p>Miss Freer. This Ring was lost a Year ago by Lady Dixy. The Prisoner said she had lost two Moidores, and her own Ring, and this, and that she believed one

               <p>Herbert. Here is a parcel of China-saucers, three Cups, three Sance-bowls, and one Punch-bowl - but several of them are broke.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan Dixy. This Locket was my Mother's, I believe there's my Grand-mother's Hair in it. I gave this to my Wife, with a Picture of one of my Ancestors (set in Gold) who was Father to the Lord-Mayor of London in 1585. I gave it to her in Leicestershire in July last, and have never seen it since: she said she would never give it away - I lost eleven Shirts, and fourteen pair of Stockings.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100029"/> This China was found at Smith's, all but one sauce Bowl, and that was at Smedley's; the last time I saw it, was at Bosworth Park. That Punch Bowl had a Cover, and cost me three pound; it was crack'd, but not broke when I had it last. This Blue Winesauce Bowl was whole in August. My Wife had a Respect for the Prisoner at first, but soon grew sick of her, for she used to sit up till two or three in the Morning, for which, and other Reasons, I was resolved to part with her: she was seven Days or more in packing up her Things: she endeavoured to keep out of my sight, but I met with her on Sunday, and told her she should go the next Morning: so she sent away six Boxes, and Trunks of Goods to the Waggon before I was up -</p>
               <p>Herbert. Here is ten Yards of silk and stuff Lacing, twenty five pair of Gloves, one pair trim'd with Gold, and one pair trim'd with Silver, part of these were found at Smedley's.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. This Lacing is the Remainder of what went round my White Damask Curtains in Leicestershire - The Gloves I cannot swear to, but I have paid twenty pounds for Gloves since I was married.</p>
               <p>Mr. West, a Glover. I know one pair of these Gloves, but I cannot tell whom I sold them to.</p>
               <p>Council. Two Yards of printed Callico.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. This I had in the Country before I was married.</p>
               <p>Council. Two Red-silk Aprons.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. I do not know them.</p>
               <p>Council. A piece of Yellow Damask.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith, Mantua-maker. This Damask is part of a Gown I made for Lady Dixy a Year ago.</p>
               <p>Juryman. How can you swear to that? Did you compare the Figure and Selvedge - I would not swear to a piece of Silk that was in my shop a Year ago.</p>
               <p>Smith. I heard her say she had a Yellow Gown of her Lady's, which Sir Wolstan bid her leave, but that she took part of it, and hoped her Lady would send her the rest.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. She had taken the Yellow Gown to pieces.</p>
               <p>Miss Freer. She had the Gown of Lady Dixy to pack up, but Lady Dixy asked for it again, and bid her leave it all; But the Prisoner said she would have part of it.</p>
               <p>- It was Lady Dixy's Night Gown at Bosworth. The Prisoner had it, and my Lady bid her leave it; and she said she would leave it; but then she said she would have half of it back; so that it should do no body any good.</p>
               <p>Juryman. It seems then it was given her, and she said publickly before the Family, that she would keep part of it.</p>
               <p>Council. A piece of pink Damask, three silver Girdles, thirteen silk Girdles, one pair of blue silk Damask Shoes, with silver Lace.</p>
               <p>Miss Freer. I believe these are Lady Dixy's Shoes, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Council. Eight Cambrick Handkerchiefs, two Fans.</p>
               <p>Miss Freer. These are Lady Dixy's Fans, she had them at Bosworth - She had a great Number of Fans.</p>
               <p>Council. One Scarlet silk Night Gown.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith. I believe I made this for my Lady; I have made her three, four, or five such in a Winter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Would not you have bought that Gown of me when I was going into Mourning for my old Lady?</p>
               <p>Smith. She offered to sell me a scarlet Gown before they went into mourning, which was about eight Months ago; and she said, her Lady gave it her - This may be the same for ought I know.</p>
               <p>Council. One Yellow silk Gown and Petticoat.</p>
               <p>Smith. I made such a Coat and Gown for my Lady.</p>
               <p>Q. How many new Gowns might you make the Lady in a Year?</p>
               <p>Smith. A great many - I believe a Dozen in a Year.</p>
               <p>Q. And what could she do with so many, if she did not give some of them to her Maids?</p>
               <p>Smith. The Lady used to give the Prisoner a great many Clothes, and she never denied or concealed them, but wore them in publick - She told me when her Lady married, she had given her all her Clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100030"/>Q. Is it not usual for single Ladies of great Fortunes to give away their Maiden Clothes when they marry?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, it is usual - And all these Clothes in Court were made before my Lady married, for when she married she was in Mourning.</p>
               <p>Madam Freer. My Niece had a good Fortune, and Sir Wolstan has a large Estate.</p>
               <p>Council. Here is a parcel of new Linnen.</p>
               <p>Sir. Wolstan. I doubt that Linnen was taken from me, for I had a great Bill to pay Mrs. Bingham for Linnen - I have had above one thousand Pound to pay since I have been married for things that I knew nothing of - It is very corroborating that the Prisoner should have fourteen or fifteen large Trunks, Boxes, and Scrutores filled with Goods.</p>
               <p>Juryman. You said, she sent but six Boxes from your House.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. Yes; but in searching, we found eight more, though as I found nothing in them that I knew to be mine, I did not charge her with them.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you not declared you would have her hanged before Christmass, if it cost you one thousand Pounds.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. No - I was told it would be an expensive Prosecution; and I said, I would have Justice done me, if it cost me one thousand Pounds.</p>
               <p>Council. You say your Lady was sick of the Prisoner, How comes it that she does not appear in this Prosecution?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. She is at my Country Seat in Leicestershire - She is with Child, and in her Condition, and the badness of the Roads, it might endanger her Life to come up.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you not said that you had prevented her coming to Town?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. No.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you not commanded that your Coach should not go above four Miles from home?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. I am not to answer all Questions.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you no Papers, or Notes due to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. No.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you seize none when you seized the Goods?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. I had some - The Constable found two. I think one was at Smith's, and the other at Smedley's; but he told the People at whose Houses he found them, that he had such Notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. I have them not - They might be left in the Boxes where they were found.</p>
               <p>Council. Had you no Letters?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. Yes; I found some of my Wife's and some of my own, and a Letter to one of my Footmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are they?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. I have them not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take Letters that did not belong to you?</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. Some of them are my own.</p>
               <p>- Produce the Letters.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. They are of no consequence. The Papers were chiefly Bills upon me - Shoemakers, Drapers, and other Bills of Parcels for Goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say to me at the Tavern the Night I was committed, that if I did not tell you what past between Capt. - and - you would send me to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. She writing to my Wife since I came away, mentioned the Names of Capt. - , and a Baronet; and told my Wife it was unfortunate she married so soon, for she might have had such, or such a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Council. Officer, Call Lady Dixy - We have subpoena'd her, and will prove that she was willing to come.</p>
               <p>Then Lady Dixy was called, but did not appear.</p>

She said, she was never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100031"/> more surprized; that she believed the Maid was very innocent; and that she would come with all her heart, but that Sir Wolstan had sent her down a Letter, and threatned it should cost her her Life if she came - she said she had been served with one Subpoena before by Mr. Street - I set out on Saturday Night last at half an Hour past eight.

            . The Prisoner sent for me to Newgate, and I knowing how she had been trusted, and what Character she bore, I took Horse this [Satur] day was a Fort-night, and arrived at Bosworth on Sunday. I told Lady Dixy, that Sir Wolstan had sent her Maid to Newgate. She said I am surprised that Sir Wolstan should offer such a thing, I believe she is as innocent as the Child unborn. He must know that she had a great many things of mine which I gave her. I told her among other Things, that she was charged with stealing a Locket and some China. She answered I gave her the China, and as for the Locket it was but a paultry Thing, that Sir Wolstan gave me, and I bid her lay it by among her other odd Things till I came to Town, and then I would settle with her, for I owe her a hundred Pound, I told her, when I came to London I would send her a Subpoena. She cryed, and said she would come with all her Heart, and would pack up her Things to be ready against next Friday - After the Prisoner came from Bosworth, but before she went into Essex, and before there was any Warrant against her she dined at my House, and told me, she had got a Locket of Lady Dixy's, that the Lady owed her a hundred Pound, and when the Lady came to Town they should settle, and the Locket should be returned. And she said too that Mrs. Freer owed her ten Pound for a Legacy and thirty Pound for Wages.</p>
               <p>Mr. Richards. When Sir Wolstan took out a Warrant against the Prisoner, we spent that Evening at the Tavern. I told him it was natural to believe that his Lady gave her the Cloaths, and therefore it would be proper to send for her up. No D - me if I do, says he, for then she'll be acquitted. Mr. Burdock was with me and heard the same - I remember in particular the Locket and Rings were then mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mrs Yates. My Husband is a Silk-Dyer, we live in King-Street Bloomsbury - Last Saturday was seven-night Sir Wolstan came to my House, and said he had a Warrant to search for Betty Barker's Things, and seeing some Silks in the Shop, he said, These are some of my Lady's Silks I suppose No says I, you should consider this is a Silk Dyers shop.

             had robb'd him of several hundred Pounds, and he had got her in Newgate and she should be hang'd. And yet at that very time, she was not taken, but was with her Friends in Essex. I told him I was sorry to hear him charge her with any such thing, when I knew she had behaved so well to good Mam Freer - I have known her seven Years and she was a very honest Industrious young Woman.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Colly. Sir Wolstan came one day to our House, and went up stairs and talk'd with my Sisters - My Sisters came out with him, and one of them said, Indeed it was none of I that said so He answer'd, Then it was your Sister. But she denyed it too, and then he turned to me and said, Then you say that she will return all the Things, and confess the Felony - No, God forbid! says I, for I believe she is as good and as honest a Servant as any in England. - He said if Mrs. Freer would not indict her she would not be hanged.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bainton. Sir Wolstan came to my House two Days after she was committed, and said, she had stoln a thousand Pound and was gone to Newgate. I was so surprised that I was ready to fall into fits. He told me and spoke it with great passion and violence, that he would hang her, let it cost what it would. Next Week he came again and said, I see you have all forsaken me, you all go to Newgate. I told him no, I had not been there, I hear says he, that my Wife is coming up, but if she does, she comes none to me, for I'll throw her off, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100032"/> she shall never live with me again.

               <p>Mr. Hubert. I have known Mr. Nelson four Years, and believe him to be an exceeding honest Man, and cannot think he would forswear himself on any account - I lent him five hundred Pound, and no security, but his honesty for it.</p>

One day as I was puting on his Shirt, he asked me why I gave him a torn Shirt, Sir, says I, they are all so bad the Maids can't mend them. Well, says he, I have got some new Cloth, and I 'll have Caps made of the best of these, and do you see that the Maids do not make Aprons af the rest. I told him I would take care of that for my own sake; but Sir, says I. you have got several old mouldy Wigs, what shall I do with them? He bid me take 'em, and do what I would with them.</p>

He was in Liquor too, and very much, but not so drunk as a beast, for he did not reel about the House. Harris had lent his Coat to the Prisoner, who went out and whited it, and coming in again he tost the Coat about till it fell upon the Deceased, and whited him He got up in a Passion, and went to the Prisoner's Brother and Sister (who kept the House, and were then at Dinner) and complained that he had been abused by their Black-guard Brother. Mrs. Gardner desired him to be easy; but he kicked the Grid-iron about, and threw the Candle and Candle-stick against the Grates. Upon this, the Prisoner struck him first, and gave him three Blows on the Face; I think it was with his open Hand. At the first Blow, the Deceased stood about half a Minute, and then fell back with the Nape of his Neck against the Bench. I took him up, his Eyes were fixt. An Apothecary's Apprentice being in the Room, let him blood, and then he spoke, and was something better, and I went away. He lived about twenty two Hours.

Harris's Coat was whited, and thrown upon him, and he flirted it off upon the Deceased, who I believe was a sleep. He got up, and thinking the Deceased had done it, he went to my Master and Mistress in the Bar-room, and said, D - me, must I be abused by your Blackguard brother? Then returning to his Seat, he took a Candle-wick, threw it violently against the Grates, and said, D - your Black guard House; and brustling up to the Prisoner, called him Names and abused him, and I think held up his Fist at him. The Prisoner struck him three times on the side of his Face pretty quick; but whether with his Hand open, or not, I cannot say. The Deceased spoke not a Word more, but stood half a Minute, and whether he was going to sit down, and thought the Bench just behind him, or was stunned with the Blow, or the Liquor was the Cause of it, I do not know; but he fell down backwards.

Pat, says he, It is a strange thing that I can never come home but my Neighbours find fault with you for scolding and quarrelling, and with that, she took him by the Shoulder, and threw him against the Wainscot, for which he gave her a slight Kick on the Tail of her things, and she took him by the Hair of his Head, and threw herself on the Bed, and dragged him to her, and gave him several Blows on the Face, and scratched him till the Blood came.

I wonder Mrs. Williams, says I, that you will carry the Kettle upon your Head when you know it is out of order - O, says she, It is not my Head that I stand upon, but it is my side, for I got a drop in my Eye, and fell over the Churn and hurt my side - At one o'Clock next Morning she was got so drunk at a milk Celler in the Strand, that she had much ado to get home; and when she was dead there was nothing but a bit of Oyl-skin on the Wound.</p>

            , Surgeon. On the twenty or twenty first of last Month, the Deceased came to my House in Pall-mall, and complained of a Wound in her Head - I found the Skull bare about an Inch long, a little above her left Temple, but no Fracture, nor Fissure. I drest it eight or nine times. She complained of a pain in her side. I let her blood, and gave her a Plaister for it, and she came no more. When dead, I took off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100035"/> the Top of the Scull, and all was right in respect to the external Wound. Taking off the Dura Mater (a strong Membrane that every where nes the internal Part of the Scull, and covers the Brain.) I found in the Top of the left Lobe of the Brain, two small Ulcers, from whence a small Quantity of Matter was discharged - These Ulcers might be the Cause of her Death; but I cannot say that the Blow was the Cause of the Ulcers; but I rather think they might proceed from some Obstruction in the small Capillary Blood Vessels of the Brain, which might be occasioned by an ill Habit of Body. On opening the Breast, I found a small Adhesion of the Lungs to the Pleura, and a pretty large Quantity of Matter on that side of the Breast: This with the Matter in the Brain, might be a concurring Cause of her Death: And I can hardly think that the Wound was partly the Cause - I found nothing else particular in the Breast, or any other of the Cavities.</p>

            . The Gown was sent me to alter, I have Lodgings in John King's House, I went out on Friday and when I returned I heard the Gown was lost. I enquired who had been there and was told only a Woman, who went up stairs to one that lodged above - I went to several Pawnbrokers, and among the rest to Mr. Heatons and shewed a pattern of it to his Servant, who said he could not or would not ( I forget which) tell me any thing about it. I advertised it with two Guineas Reward, and then Heaton came and gave me notice, that he had got the Gown, which he said was pawn'd for forty Shillings, but he expected two Guineas Reward. Next Day the Prisoner came to justify herself to me. I sent for Heaton and asked him if she was the Woman that pawn'd it. He said No, and then she fell upon me and abused me, and he seemed to be concerned for her. I afterwards got an Attorney to write him a Letter, that if he would not produce the Person that brought him the Gown, he should be Prosecuted, and then he said it was the Prisoner. When she was taken she offered to pay me a Crown a Week till the two Guineas were paid, if I would make it up.</p>

               <p>- Creech. As I was going to my Craft at Hammersmith, I met the Prisoner and another who is not taken, and they thought proper to take this Wilchin of Lamperns, and I was in my Skiff at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I take them, or he that run away?</p>
               <p>Creech. You row'd in the Boat, while he flung the grapplings over board, and haul'd the Wilchin to him. Then we row'd to Justice Barker's Rails. We went a shore and they were drest at night and I eat one Meal of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were concern'd?</p>
               <p>Creech. Concern'd? yes, or else what did I go there for? I could not be concern'd if I was not there, tho' I never laid finger upon them, till they were brought on Shore. <rs id="t17351210-66-verdict282" type="verdictDescription">

He was my Father's particular Acquaintance, and I going to School hard by, I used to go to his House in a Morning, and leave my Victuals there, and come back there to Dinner, and so go home at Night. I went there first in March, and one Morning about eight a Clock the latter end of April, as I was in the Prisoner's Shop, and no body at home but he and I, he shut the Street-door, and as I sat in an Elbow Leather-Chair, he first meddled with me with his Fingers, and I fell upon the Ground. He then took me up in his Arms, and set me in the Chair again, and then put my legs over his, and - into - half an Hour - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q Did you struggle, or cry out?</p>
               <p>Sarah Evans. Yes, I struggled as much as I could, and cry'd out as loud as I could all the while, but no Soul could hear me; for the Shop is in a narrow Street, and the backside of the House is a great Vacancy, tho' People go along the Street; but the Door was lock'd and the Window next the Street was filled up with Goods. Then he shewed me a naked Sword, and said he would kill me if I told any Body what he had done to me; and so I went to School and said Nothing. In two or three Weeks afterwards, I began to break out, and he told my Father it was the Itch; and so the Prisoner took me in Hand, and gave me Physick for six Weeks; and then it proved to be the Foul Disease, and I was forced to go into the Hospital. I never told any Body how the Prisoner had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100037"/> used me, till eight Weeks after he did it, and then I told my Mother - I was fifteen Years old last May - No Man ever medled with me but the Prisoner, and he never did but that once.</p>

He said, if he did do it, he could have done it at other times if he would, and he bid me get out of his House, and said if I gave him an ill Word he would trounce me. When the Girl first broke out (about Whitsuntide) he said it was the Itch, and undertook to Cure her, for he pretended to be a sort of a Surgeon, but it proved to be the Foul Disease, and so I got her into the Hospital.</p>

            . The Prisoner's shop is in such a Thoroughfare that if she cryed out, the People in the street must needs have heard her. She had been my Apprentice two Years, and went away about three quarters of a Year ago, she behaved but very indifferently, for she was a very bold Girl, a great Liar, and a Pilferer. She sometimes used to stay out late at Night, and has seem'd to be in Liquor, and hardly able to stand when she came home, and her Clothes have been very Dirty as if she had fell down in the Street. Her Father used to tell me next Day she had been at his House, and therefore desired me to excuse her.</p>

            , the Prisoner's half-Brother. Long before any thing of this, her Father complained to me, that Mr. Sikes her Master had attempted to ravish her. I sent for Mr. Sikes, and when the Girl saw him she run away. Her Father desired she might be discharged from her service, for fear she should be ruined, and he perswaded me to go with him and the Girl before a Justice, to get a Warrant against her Master for an intent to Ravish. And the Girl there said that he used her rudely with his Fingers, but that she did not offer to cry out. I have heard she is a loose Girl, and kept Company with a Barber that was Pox'd.</p>

            . (the Prisoner's Daughter.) The Girl has a very base Character, rather lewd than otherwise, and her Parents were always litigious People. When her Father first brought her to my Father it was to complain that Mr. Sykes had been rude with her, and had lain with her upon the Hearth - I lay in my Father's House in all April last, and the House was always open by six in the Morning, tho' its possible the Door might be shut by chance, and if she cryed out but half as loud as I speak now. she might have been heard on both sides of the House by the Passengers that were constantly going by. My Father is hard of Hearing, and therefore. I or my Mother were obliged to be in the way to attend the Customers - My Father and I have both charg'd her before her Father's Face, with having the Pox, but she always deny'd it. Her Mother had a sort of a Leprosy, and the Girl her self was a little broke out before she came from Mr. Sykes's, for Mr. Sikes had 'nointed her, and given her Flower of Brimstone, and made her wear a Smock two Weeks on that Account, and her Father desired my Father to give her Physick. She used to go from our House to her Writing Master, at Six in the Afternoon, and her Father has often come with a Candle and a Lanthorn at eleven and twelve at Night, or one in the Morning, to enquire for her - After I had told him I believed she had the Pox, he came the next Day, and said he had searched her himself, and was sure she had never known Man.</p>

I told the Prisoner this, and he refused - Her Father told me that his Wife was a base Woman, and had advised the Girl to swear this Rape, and was the Occasion of all the false Swearing about it - I have heard that she is a wicked vile base lying Girl, that she used to lye out till twelve or one in the Morning, and that a Barber gave her the Pox.</p>
