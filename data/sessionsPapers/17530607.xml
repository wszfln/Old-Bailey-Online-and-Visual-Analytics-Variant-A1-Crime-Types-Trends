            . I live in Change-court in the Strand, on the 8th of May about a quarter before Twelve o'clock. coming home there were two soldiers about a yard distance from each other, and the prisoner, who is a <rs id="t17530607-3-deflabel12" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Q. Could you see the prisoner's face?</p>
               <p>Mibous. Yes, my lord, I did, when he laid hold on me, which was on the bosom of my coat and arm : I said, friend, what would you be at, immediately came up the other two, one of whom took hold on my left arm, the other took hold on my other side ; on which I call'd out thieves and watch. Then the prisoner loosed his hold, and took off my hat: they all three ran away, and I pursu'd them, calling out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did none of them say any thing to you ?</p>
               <p>Mibous. No, my lord, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any weapon ?</p>
               <p>Mibous. No, I saw none. When they came near the Savoy steps, the prisoner quitted the other two, and made towards Savoy-hill: at the alley he said, catch me now if you can. I pursued him in the alley, and a soldier stopp'd him, but let him go: then, with some threatening language, the prisoner turned about and gave me a kick; on which I ran into the Strand, and went to call a gentleman that I knew, to go with me into the barracks, but he could not go: I then went by myself, and call'd for the corporal of the night, who call'd for two other soldiers, and they, with the corporal, went with me. We found the prisoner in Exeter-street at a door, and took him. We carried him to the watch house near the New-Church in the Strand, from thence to New prison, and from thence the next day before justice Fielding, where he said he was set upon and lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged with taking your's off your head ?</p>
               <p>Mibous. He was, but denied it. When the soldiers took him, he resisted and fell down, and his hat fell off his head, it had a cockade: after that he threw it into an area, which hat is mine that I lost, and I describ'd it by a particular mark in the crown, and a mark withinside: after they went with him to prison, the next morning, a little after six o'clock, they went and found it in the area. (The hat produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

            . I am a corporal in the Third Regiment on the Barrack-guard, the prisoner is in the Second Regiment: the 9th of May in the morning, between 12 and 1 o'clock, Mr. Mibous came and knock'd at the back door in the Savoy, and on my opening it he said he had been robb'd of his hat by a soldier, who came down towards the barracks; I asked the centinel if he had seen any person go past ; he said no. I told Mr. Mibous I did not know what to do in it, but that I'd go with him to any place he thought proper, which I did, with two soldiers, to a place of ill same in that neighbourhood in a court, but they were gone to bed. I found no body there; but going up Exeter-street the prisoner was standing at a door, seeming to call to a person to let him in. One of the men with us had been drinking with him that afternoon, and had likewise seen Mibous pursuing him, said that is the man: but Mr. Mibous said, I will not swear to the man till I see his face, so a soldier and I went and took hold on him, and asked him to go us, which he refused. After we brought him to the light, Mibous said, that is the man, I'll swear to him: the prisoner had a hanger under his arm, which one of the soldiers took from him, and in the scuffle he fell, he had a hat on at this time, I held him by his neck; a gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175306070004"/> came out of the house and said, don't murder the man, as he fell, the hat fell off upon the ground, one of the soldiers took him up, and the third soldier took up his hat, and put it upon his head, and going on five or six steps, the prisoner tossed his hat off into an Area; he had to hand at liberty. The next morning, when we had conducted him to New Prison, we concluded to go by the area to see for this hat; one of the soldiers got over, and took it up: I went to Mr. Mibous's house, and told him, by his description, I had got his hat; he came with us, and saw, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mibous. Had the prisoner a hat on his head when he took yours?</p>
               <p>Mibous. He had one without a lace, with a mettle button on it.</p>

            , the two soldiers that were at the taking the prisoner, confirmed the testimony of Woolfe; the latter of them, with this addition, that he had been drinking at an alehouse with two shoemakers (the prosecutor was not of the company) and two soldiers, that he parted with them, and they went towards Savoy Hill, and he home, he had got a candle in his hand ; about half and hour after he had parted with them he heard a cry of stop thief, he went out, and saw the prisoner running by, and the prosecutor after him, that the prisoner was stopp'd by a centinel, he went and was certain it was one of the soldiers he had been drinking with. That the prosecutor there said he had been robbed of his hat, while he was looking for it the prisoner got from the centinel; after which he, with the others, found him at a door in Exeter-street, and that they had a struggle, and his hat fell off, he took it up, and put it on the prisoner's head, that he then observed it to be too good for a regimental hat, and the cockade being loose, he was positive it was the same that was found in the area the next morning, were he saw the prisoner toss it from his head.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is this Hays?</p>
               <p>Garret. He keeps the earl of Stair's head in Vine-street. In July following, I lost the note out of my pocket which Hays gave me to pay me, or my order, 50 l. it was given me April 29, 1751, payable 6 months after date; I had it when I went to bed, and saw it, and in the morning missed it: the prisoner at that time lay with me, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it again?</p>
               <p>Garret. No, I never did. I went to Hays, and told him I had lost my 50 l. note that he gave me; he said what signifies 50 l. between you and I.</p>
               <p>Ann Boon. The prisoner at the bar lodged at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175306070006"/> my house in September 51, who told me he had done an ill thing by poor Garret, which was that upon the bond of 100 l. given to Hays from Garret. Hays gave to Garret a promissory note for 50 l. that as Hays could get nothing on the bond in the country, he desired the prisoner to get the note from the prosecutor, and give it to him, which he said he did; that he took it out of his pocket when he was asleep in the night, (as they lay together) and carried it to Hays, and Hays, in his presence, flung it into the fire and destroy'd it; he also said, that he was sorry, for that he had a hand in getting all Garret's estate from him, which was 60 or 70 l. a year.</p>

On December, 1751, I heard the prisoner confess to the evidence in her house, that if she would excuse him some little incumbrance (what I can't justly say) he'd open to her the whole scene of villainy; then he owned to the taking this 50 l. note out of Garret's pocket, and delivering it to Hays.</p>

               <p>I am as innocent of the affair as the child unborn. Hays and Mrs. Boon have both been at law for the fellow's estate; they wanted me to swear to serve their ends, but I would not, so am now prosecuted out of spight.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitewood. I keep a publick house near London-Wall, and know the prisoner and prosecutor, they behaved like brothers, and called each other so. I really believe the prisoner was got among a bad set of people, but believe him to be a very honest man. This very woman (Mrs. Boon) once came to me as the prisoner's friend, about making up an affair of a bastard child that was laid to him, and now she wants to hang him. I have seen the prisoner and prosecutor drinking together often since the time of what they call the robbery, in good friendship.</p>

               <p>John Stubbs. On the 14th of February last Mr. Hart, the king's closet-keeper, his daughter, I, my wife, and Mr. Buckmire, had been to Covent-Garden playhouse, coming home between 10 and 11 at night through the field leading to <placeName id="t17530607-11-crimeloc43">Chelsea</placeName>

                        targets="t17530607-11-off46 t17530607-11-crimeloc43"/>, two men came past and went before us, when we came in the narrow lane they turned back upon us, one of them took Mr. Hart by the collar, and with a hanger in the other hand told him, if he did not deliver his money he was a dead man; Mr. Hart said, if so, you shall have our money; then the other man came and took Mr. Buckmire by the collar. I was coming along leading my wife, that man had a cut-and-thrust sword, and seeing me by the side of Mr. Buckmire, he pointed out the sword, and swore, if I went an inch further he'd run me through; I said, I'd go no further. After he had robb'd Mr. Buckmire, he catch'd me by the collar, put his hand into my pocket, and took out 3 s. 6 d. then he search'd my, and took out a white net purse, in which went two gold rings, a crown piece, three half crowns, a queen Elizabeth's shilling, a pocket piece, and some other small pocket pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the other person to you when that person robb'd you ?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. He was about 3 yards from me, and was taking Mr. Hart's buckles out of his shoes, I saw him down on one knee at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner was one of them?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. I can't swear that, but think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. What dress was I in?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. In a flapp'd hat, and a sort of a brownish horseman's great coat, and soldiers cloaths underneath as they appeared to me, I saw something red.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark ?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. It was as light as ever I saw the moon shine in my life. When we were at justice Fielding's, after the examination, I told him my wife was frighted, and griev'd much after one of the rings, which she valued, and she is with child, and I feared the consequence would be bad: he said, I know where it is, come to me, and I'll get you the ring again. Since that, the accomplice, (the evidence) sent it me. Produced in court and deposed to, with the prosecutor's mother-in-law's name on it, and the date she died on.</p>

            . Corbee and I went from Westminster on the 14th of Feb. in the evening to Hide-Park, with intent to rob somebody, we staid there a great while and saw nobody, but going under the wall we saw these gentlemen coming from London, they went into the 5-fields, and we followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Ayres. This was between 10 and 11 o'clock, we passed them some way and turned back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them ?</p>
               <p>Ayres. There were 3 gentlemen and 2 women; the prisoner stopp'd one of them, and I the prosecutor, and took out of his pocket a net purse, two gold rings, a Spanish dollar, a queen Elizabeth's shilling, and I believe two silver groats and about 16 shillings in silver. The prisoner took some silver from the other gentleman, but how much I can't say, he took his buckles also out of his shoes. After this, we went cross the fields making the best of our way home, and shar'd the things. The prisoner sent one ring to pawn by his washer-woman and some of the things to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for your share ?</p>
               <p>Ayres. My share came to about 15 s. with the buckles and every thing (he looks at the ring produced) this is one of the rings, it is a mourning one, and was in the thread purse that I took from Stubbs.

               <p>Q. When did he confess this ?</p>
               <p>Peal.

The first thing I heard was I thought the snapping of a pistol, which seem'd to be at the head of the horses. Then came up one man and got into the chaise, and was near a quarter of an hour in rifling it; he took out of my pocket three handkerchiefs, and a paper snuff-box, and also my stock and stock-buckle: he took my brother's stock-buckle, and also something out of my brother's pocket, which he put into his mouth, and said to him, did not you say you had given me all. It was so dark I could not see to distinguish any thing of their faces; there were three of them, one in the chaise, the other two on my side at first, but-one went on the other side.</p>

               <p>Clifton. It is a four-wheel chaise and a coachman to drive; after I heard that snapping, which I thought a pistol, the coachman said, have patience I'll make my horses stand.</p>

            . On the 4th of March about seven o'clock, Corbee and I went from Westminster, and in crossing the fields we met Ayliff the other prisoner, with a naked knife and a broomstick in his hand; he said he had had bad luck, there were so many people together he dared not attack any of them. As we were standing together I heard a coach, we went and found it to be a four-wheel chaise, and Corbee took a pistol from me, and went and stopp'd it</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this ?</p>
               <p>Ayres. This was above Pancras Church-yard in the hollow way, they made me rifle it. Ayliff went first by the head of the horses, and one of them hit him by the shoulder, and lifted him from the ground; on which he told the coachman, if he did not stand still he'd shoot the horse, and he did strike him across the nose with the pistol. I asked Mr. C lifton for his money, who gave me half-a-crown and a shilling, I was then by the side of the chaise, but afterwards got into it, and took from him his hat, three handkerchiefs, a stock and silver stock-buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were there in the chaise?</p>
               <p>Ayees. There were two men: we took a hat, stock and stock buckle from the other gentleman, and some money; after which Ayliff pull'd me from the chaise by my heels, saying they thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175306070009"/> they heard some body coming, so we went away, and going a-cross the fields, Ayliff went to get over a bank, but fell down, and the pistol went off, I thought he had shot Corbee, but stepping back found there was no harm done. We then went to Holloway with intent to rob somebody, but met with none to rob : Ayliff had one shilling of the money and went home, and left us with the rest. I kept 1 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take from the other gentleman?</p>
               <p>Ayres. I took six shillings from him, Corbee sent the stock-buckles to pawn by his washer-woman, whose name is

               <p>Q. Had Ayliff stopp'd the coach before the horse bit him ?</p>
               <p>Ayres. He had bid the coachman stop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your intention in stopping them?</p>
               <p>Ayres. It was with an intent to rob them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you all dispose of yourselves after you had stopp'd the horses?</p>
               <p>Ayres. One went on one side the horses, and the other on the other side; but am not certain whether Corbee did not come to the side of the chaise, and I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a pistol snapp'd?</p>
               <p>Ayres. No, there was not, it was only a blow cross the horse's nose: the stock-buckle was pawn'd for 1 s. 6 d. we had six-pence each of that; one of the hats Corbee had, and lost from off his head in an attempt to commit a robbery near Cranbury house, and the other was sold: in our sharing the things that other hat was mine, and Corbee gave me a shilling out of the half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Corbee and you meet that night ?</p>
               <p>Ayres. We met first at a publick-house in Pye-street: in the pistol's going off the flint fell out, and the shilling that Ayliff had he took to screw it in again, which he bent in so doing, and then put it in his pocket.</p>

            . I having been attack'd and shot at by Ayres and Corbee near Cranbury house, where in the struggle one of them lost his hat, I went to Clerkenwell Bridewell and told the keepers there they were soldiers: they said they were sure it must be the two soldiers that were tried and acquitted in January sessions last, so I went to St. James's Park two days after and took Ayres. He produced a hat. This is the hat the person had on that shot at me.</p>

               <p>Clifton. I cannot say whether it is my brother's hat that he lost or not.</p>

When I went to justice Fielding, which I think was on Easter-Tuesday, Ayliff was under examination: the justice asked him how long he had followed that course of life; to which he answered about two years. The justice asked him if he was concerned in robbing a four-wheel chaise near Pancras-Wash the 4th of March; he said he did, and the horse had like to have bit him, and his pistol went off going over a bank, by accident, and that he had but one shilling of the money after some talk Mr. Fielding's Clerk said to him about signing the confession, Mind what you do, that may be hurtful to you on your trial: then said the prisoner if I am not to be made an evidence I will not sign.</p>

Hearing the prisoner had sold one, and knowing the prisoner had none of his own, (he lodged at my house) I mistrusted it must be he that took mine, so I went to the house in Wapping where he had sold the watch, and the woman inform'd me she had bought a watch of the prisoner, but that she had sold it again.</p>

Some of them were found at the prisoner's mother's house in Lamb-alley, others at the house of Mr. Hone who had stopp'd them, so I came by the knowledge of it, for it is impossible I should have missed them where I have a large quantity together. When I with a search warrant found the four covers and sack in a box at the prisoner's mother's, she at first denied knowing any thing of the matter; but the lad own'd the taking them all, and said his mother sold them for him to a woman that is here, one Emmerton.</p>

               <p>M. Emmerton. I gave her 9 d. per pound.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is that brass worth per pound?</p>
               <p>Pittman. If I buy 500 pounds weight together I can't have it under thirteen-pence halfpenny per pound.</p>
               <p>M. Emmerton. This is the usual price I give for old brass, and these were doubled up together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner ask you for it?</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say it was her own ?</p>
               <p>M. Emmerton. She said it was not her own, but that she had them of a brazier that was broke and could not go about his own affairs, so she was to sell the brass for him.</p>

               <p>M. Emmerton. I gave her 5 s. 9 d. in part, and bid her come to me on the Monday following, and I would pay her the remainder: then I sent the brass to Mr. Hone, who I sell mettal to, but he was not at home.</p>

            . I am a founder, and buy brass of the evidence Emmerton; I had bought some of her before this, such as we call scurff brass, which is chippings of brass that is trimm'd off round the edges, &amp;c. and might perhaps come the same way; at this time she told me she expected some more, and came accordingly on Saturday was se'ennight, and said she had not money to buy it with, so I let her have a crown, and that night these plates were brought to my house by her, but I was not at home. When I saw them on the Monday morning I suspected them to have been stolen, and was determined, if possible, to find it out, so mentioning it to a woman whose husband happened to mention it to Mr. Pitman it was discover'd. Mr. Pitman came to me, and I delivered these 14 bottoms, which the woman brought to him; and as Mrs. Emmerton had given me an account who brought it to her, and we knowing her son was apprentice to the prosecutor, they were both taken up.</p>

I live at the corner of Hosiar-lane, Snow-hill; the prisoner at the bar brought this saw to me to pawn on the 24th of April, he said it was his own saw, and that he had it made for him longer than ordinary, because he did not choose to stoop at his work, so I lent him three shillings on it. Some little time after I saw the advertisement and found it answered the descriptions, so I sent to Mr. Pond, who came and own'd it; but left it in my custody, in case the prisoner should come again to secure him. The prisoner came again in about three weeks after, and brought another saw to pawn, I jumped over the compter and secured him, he was taken before Sir

We went till we pass'd the Parrot, then I seized him and told him I believed he had committed a robbery: he said, indeed so I have, at a house near the Carlisle, that he had broke into the house at one o'clock, that he heard the clock strike while he was in the house.

On the 14th she went up to clean the rooms, and came down in about six minutes after, and desired my wife to let her go to a neighbour's necessary, there being people in our yard, she went and in about ten minutes after my wife went up stairs and found a drawer broke open and some guineas missing (she is sick at home and can't attend) she came down and told me, so I ran to the house where her mother lodged, and was informed my servant had been there but was gone. Six or 7 of us went in pursuit of her next day, but could not find her; a neighbour accidentally seeing her getting into the Barnet stage coach came and let me know, so I, and an evidence, took horses, pursued her, and near Whetstone took her and her mother out of the coach, carried, them to Barnet, and tax'd her with stealing my money; she directly owned that she had forced open the drawer with an old key, and took out 14 guineas. I can safely say there were 17 missing; she had left six behind in the drawer. I search'd her, and found six guineas in gold and 10 s. 6 d. in silver upon her. The old woman said to me, she would have had her daughter brought me the money the night before They had bought themselves cloaths with part of the money, being now both very tight, but were very ragged before. I asked them where they were going, and they said into Bedfordshire to the mother's sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon the old woman?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There were 7 s. found upon her, which the girt said was part of my money. The old woman pulled it out, and said, it is all I have got, it is what my daughter gave me.</p>
               <p>John Collier. I went along with Mr. Hudson in pursuit of the prisoners. We overtook them about, 3 miles on this side, Barnet. I ask'd the daughter, how she could be so base to rob her master of 17 or 18 guineas. She said, she believ'd it was not so much, it was but 14. We took her to Barnet before justice Haswell, where she said she found a key in her mistress's under drawer, with which she forc'd open the drawer in which was the money, and took 14 guineas, and that the devil put it into her head. The old woman said she knew nothing at all of the matter, till such time she was going to take coach to go out of town. She deliver'd 7 s. to the officer, and said it was money her daughter had given her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The officer that lives at Barnet has got the cloaths which they had bought with part of the money, but he is not here.</p>

               <p>I did not break the lock, it was left open, and I took the money. My mother did not know any thing of it. As to the 7 s. found upon her it was her own property.</p>

This was on the 31st of May between the hours of 12 and two. There was a lock broke open, and I had no lodger but the prisoner. I mistrusted him, so took him up, and had him before justice Chamberlain, where he confessed he broke the lock, and took the things laid in the indictment. Some of the things were found in his pocket, and some in the sides of his coat. He delivered them all to the constable.</p>

On the 17th of May, the two prisoners came into my shop, and asked me if I had got any hats to sell, I did not like the looks of them, so told them I had none for them, then they asked me for some ribbands, I shewed them four or five boxes with some; Evans bought a little remnant for her child. A gentleman came into the shop, and at the same time I was talking to him, I suppose, Perkins took the opportunity to take 4 pieces of coloured ribband, of which I shall give an account hereafter. The gentleman went out again; I took all the drawers, except one, with black ribbands in it, and put them on one side to be out of their way. Perkins said, you say you have no hats, I see you have got some; I said they are not fit for you, they are 4 s. a piece; she said, I suppose you'll take 3 s. 6 d. I fetched 2 or 3, then she said, there are more in that case ; I said they were the same, she said she chose to see them. As I was upon the counter, I saw her hand in the box, and take out two pieces of black ribband, and put them into her pocket; then she said, I think, I'll have a yard of this black ribband. The person that I am in partnership with was in bed, and by moving a small curtain could see what was done in the shop; he saw her take this ribband, he came out of the room, and ran to the shop door, and locked it; then Perkins took these four pieces of coloured ribband, and threw them into the box amongst the black ones, and the two pieces of black along with them ; one of the pieces of black fell on the ground. We sent for a constable, and he carried them to the warehouse, and from thence to Justice Fielding; there they both begged for mercy.</p>

I heard the prisoner was going for Barnet, I pursued and took him there, with all my goods upon him, except the shoes, which he said he had sold. Groom was along with me. (The goods produced, and deposed to.) The prisoner called at a house, and had two pints of beer, and there left Groom's two shirts.</p>

I paid her the six guineas bargain'd for, I had opened shop but about a month, upon which very likely they took the advantage of coming to me, for I had no advertisement concerning this ring being stolen. Just in the interim Mr. Flavel pass'd by my door, he was the jeweller I intended to have shewn the ring to, I beckon'd to him, and shewed it him, and desired him to give me his opinion of the value of this ring, he immediately put it on his finger, and said, Sir, this is my ring, and I'll swear to it. Upon which O Neal desired we would not make a mob to expose her, so we took them into the back parlour; Mr. Flavel sent for his wife, who, as soon as she entered the room, said to O Neal, I know you are one of the women, but I am not quite positive to the other. The other had not spoke above a minute or two, before she said, now I am positive you are the other person. As as soon as Mr. Flavel claim'd the ring, Clark said she had taken it in pawn, and had lent five guineas and half upon it, and that

When they were taken before the justice he examined them apart. Mrs. O Neal said her name was Robertson, and they each gave different names of the person that had pawned the ring, one said the name was Miller, the other said Jones.</p>

            . I had been ill for some time, and kept my room on Saturday before Christmas-Day, my servant acquainted me there were two women below; but I did not see them. My wife had call'd to me for the amethists to be sent down; after this my wife came up stairs with the rings from below, I open'd the case, and miss'd a 3 stone brilliant ring, then I dispatch'd my apprentice to some shopkeepers to detect the women, if offering them to sale. I sent another servant to the turner's shop; he brought word back that the turner and his apprentice answer'd the description given of them by one of the women; but the turner's wife was neither of the women who had been at my house. On Christmas day, being the Monday following, I advertis'd the ring, and the day following, with proper descriptions of it; but never heard any thing of it till last Tuesday. Passing by Mr. Portall's shop in the Strand, seeing people in it, I pass'd the door, he beckon'd his hand for me to come in, as soon as I came in, he said to the women (the two prisoners at the bar) it is very lucky, this is the very man I intended to carry it to to-morrow: he gave the ring into my hand, and ask'd me the value of it, I wiped it, and look'd at it. I know it from ten thousand, because I have wore it scores of times myself. I clapp'd it on my finger, and said it is my ring, and I'll swear to it. He told me he had given six guineas for it to those women. I begg'd his leave to shut his door too for a minute, and said, that ring was stole from me by two women that I had never seen, and insisted upon detaining them, till I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175306070023"/> sent for my wife, which I did, and said if she did not know them they might go about their business, but it was necessary they should return the gentleman his money.

             said return it if it was ever so much, which then she did; after that, they told me I looked like a good-natur'd man, and that they knew I was father to several children, and that I should have compassion ; and as to money, if I would accept of it, 20 or 30 l. was at my service, and produced to that value, in gold of different pieces : they afterwards found that would not do, they laid they'd make it a hundred; I said, if they made it a thousand it would not do. As soon as my wife enter'd the room, she said to O Neal, as to you, madam, I am positive you was one of the women that was in our house, and you had a red cloath about your face at the time. She said to the other, as to you, madam, I must think a little; for, if I mistake not, you was with child at that time, and by conversing, Clark said she had a child 5 months old; after that, upon O Neal's speaking to her, she said it was 9 months old. My wife said after this she was certain as to the other. They were taken before justice Lediard: they were examined apart, and made many blunders in their examination. One went by four different names.</p>

I went to the lapidary to have that stone cut less; when I came back they were both gone. I went up to my master, and he said, do you know them, I said I should could I see them. He sent me after them to the turner's shop, but the turner's wife was quite different from either of them. The man and apprentice answer'd the description they had given. On the Sunday at night I carried an advertisement to the Daily Advertiser, facing St. Dunstan's church, and it was put in, on the Monday, being Christmas-day. I was sent for to justice Lediard's.

I happen'd to be at Mr. Jeffery's in the Strand last Tuesday, he came in and said Mr. Flavel has been robb'd, and the two women are at Mr. Portall's, I went there, and saw them in the back parlour; I was there when Mrs. Flavel came in; immediately she said she knew O Neal, but the other she could not be sure of just then (she said it was the same gown, but there may be one gown like another ). As soon as Clark spoke, she said now I know you very well. Mr. Flavel went out to get a constable and a warrant. They both fell on their knees to me, and begg'd I'd persuade Mrs. Flavel not to prosecute them. O Neal said she had a husband, and desir'd not to be expos'd.

               <p>Macave. I don't think I should. I brought a pint of wine to the table, and Clark desired me to be present at the laying down the money.</p>

             my sheep were all gone, and the gates broke open. I made all the enquiry I could about them. I desired one Mr. Hill that buys skins, if he should see any such to take notice, and inform me, he knows my clip. On the 19th of May he sent me word he had three of them; I went and found them to be mine, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your clip?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. It is a clip down the face, and two clips on the off shoulder; they where red back'd sheep, but no brand mark; I bought them in Smithfield. As Mr. Hill told me he had the skins of the prisoner at the bar, I took him up, and search'd his house. I ask'd him how he came by them sheep, he own'd there were ten of them, and that he bought them in Smithfield. I ask'd him how he came to buy them with a butcher's mark upon them, (for when we butchers buy we have different clips and marks, so that we and the men that are used to the market know whose they are) he said he saw no mark at all. I ask'd him how he could handle them without seeing the marks, he said the sheep were not put in a pann, and that he cheapen'd them coming down Holborn, and bought them on Snowhill, in an alley; he said the same before justice Fielding, and that it was a little after six o'clock on the 11th of May, and brought them home about ten, and the man he bought of was nam'd Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live ?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He lives in Bloomsbury-market.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them ?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Seven of them cost me 23 s. a piece, and three cost 19 s. a piece.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hill that deals in sheepskins. I am employed to fetch them in for him, that is, to go round to the butchers with a horse, and carry them to market, where master sells them. On the 19th of May in the morning, about 10 o'clock. I met with the prisoner in Bloomsbury, he order'd me to take up three skins for him, and said to me, take no notice ; he laid them out at the door, I went and took them up, and carried them to my master at Wood's Close Market; they were very stale; I knew them particularly. I deliver'd them to Mr. Hill ; he took one of them in his hand, and said, this is Mr. Stevenson's mark, I had told him where I had them, and of whom. There was a clip down the face, and two clips on the off shoulder ; we observed the other two, they were the same. I took horse, and rode away directly by master's order to Mr. Stevenson, and informed him of it; he came and own'd them after market; we went and took the prisoner up. He first said he bought them in Smithfield, after that he bought them on Snowhill, in an alley, of one Brown, a Hortfordshire man; but he did not know the man. Justice Fielding ask'd him, what he meant by bidding me take no notice ; he said, he meant that his wife should not know of it.</p>

I remember on the 11th of May he call'd at my window about six o'clock in the morning, and said he was going to Smithfield; I got out of my bed, and bid him to make haste, and I'd send him the money. I sent my son to market with four guineas, he came to me a little after nine, and said he had bought 10 fine sheep, at 16 s. apiece, which is 8 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sheep ?</p>

I went up to the garret door, there I found a large nail fix'd to the lock, and a knife lay under it; I had a suspicion of the prisoner at the bar, she having robb'd me before, and I forgave her. She work'd with my wife at quilting petticoats. but did not live in the house with us. She came to work on the Monday morning as usual. A woman that work'd with us said she believ'd she had seen the nail and knife at a place in Beech-lane, where the prisoner was found when she robbed me before. I went to the place, they were own'd there by the two women; there came the mistress and the two women to our house, we call'd the prisoner from her work, she was tax'd with it, and immediately confess'd it, and told where the sheets were; one was pawn'd in Golden-lane, the other in Spitlefields, both in her name, she went with us, she call'd for them, and they were deliver'd</p>

(Produc'd in court, and depos'd to) I took the prisoner before my Lord-Mayor, he confess'd taking the goods; the waistcoat was found on his back.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say for himself.</p>

I receiv'd this order, which I proclaim'd, (they are all originals under seal from the council) from Mr. Ingham, and made two copies of it, which I examin'd on Thursday the 30th of June, 1748, and went to Southwold in Suffolk that day, it being market-day, and read over the order very loud, between the hours of twelve and one at the market-cross, after which I fixed up a true copy of it on the market-place, the most notorious place in the town; and on Saturday the 2d of July f ollowing, I went to Beccles, another market-town in the county of Suffolk, being the market-day there, I read over the same order again, betwixt the hours of twelve and one, at the market-cross, and fix'd up a true copy there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the two nearest market towns to Benacre, in that county?</p>
               <p>Swetman. They are reputed so to be, and I believe they are the nearest.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Beccles from Benacre ?</p>
               <p>Swetman. I believe it is about four or five miles.</p>
