               <p>On the 13th of February, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the Strand. She asked me to give her something to drink, I told her there was nobody up, and gave her a penny to get a glass of gin. She asked me to go and be concerned with her; she said she had not taken a farthing that night. I told her I had but a few half-pence in my pocket; she said she would go with me for those few half-pence. We went upon the <placeName id="t17800913-6-crimeloc39">Savoy Steps</placeName>

When I got on the Savoy Steps with her; I felt her hand in my coat pocket, taking my watch. Before I could get ready to pursue her, she got away down the Savoy Steps.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130007"/>Were you standing up? - Yes. I tried to catch at her, but she had got too far; I ran round the Savoy-square to the sentry-box, she had asked the sentinel to let her in, but he would not. She hid herself among the barracks. I never found her till the Friday fortnight. I have never seen my watch since.</p>

               <p>I never saw him before he took me up. He took up two women before, and swore to one of them; and she was cleared before the justice.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. How long was you with the woman? - About a minute; we were directly under the lamp. I wrapped some tow about my watch before I put it into my coat pocket. I had not lain down with her at all.</p>

               <p>I am a master plumber in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel. I went on the 1st of July, to charge the pipe in the cellar, where this man lives. I gave directions to the prisoner to open the ground to change the pipe. There was nobody employed but him and I. I ordered him to take the stone up; I was in the cellar all the time, but a little way from him when he took it up; when he had taken it up, I saw something in his hand; I do not know what it was, it looked like a rag, and I thought I heard something chink. I said, What have you got there? He said nothing, master, and thrust it into his breeches pocket. He said he was made for ever. I asked him what it was he had got once or twice after, he waved it, and would not let me know what it was. I intended to have told his master the circumstance, but it slipped my memory; he is the paviour's man. I thought no more of the affair till a month after, when the prosecutor came, and then he was taken up upon my information.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. What did you put the money in? - In a little silk purse, and wrapped a bit of woollen rag about the purse.</p>
               <p>Is this cellar a part of the house? - Yes, it is immediately under the dwelling-house.</p>

               <p>I dug up the ground by the direction of the plumber; there was nothing that I saw in the cellar but brick rubbish, so help me God. Four weeks after, this gentleman came to accuse me.</p>
               <p>To Clavering. Why did not you mention it to the woman of the house that you had seen the prisoner take something? - I did not know that it was money.</p>
               <p>Jury. You said the prisoner said he was made for ever; did not you from that circumstance think it was money? - I spoke to him about it once or twice after.</p>

On the 16th of August I had been to fetch Mrs. Gray, and three of my daughters from Sadler's Wells. From the city road turnpike there is a footpath goes across the fields to <placeName id="t17800913-11-crimeloc65">Hoxton</placeName>

I was a little before Mrs. Gray, I had passed three people who were standing at the rails, as we were getting over; I said I have got very little cash about me. The man put his right knee under my left ham, and bent me back, and then I felt my watch pulled out of my pocket very plain.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one person attacked you? - I was blind and could not see who did it, but when I got my eye-sight again, by his taking the handkerchief off, I saw there was but one man. He had then got fifteen or perhaps twenty yards off; then he ran and I ran after him. My daughter ran to the city road and cried out thieves and murder ! When I saw my children standing upon their legs, and none seemingly hurt, I ran after him and cried Stop thief too; he was never out of my fight till he was taken. It was a very bright moon-light night. There were people walking about, so that many people came about soon. He ran the same way we had come.</p>
               <p>Is that the man? - The prisoner is the man I am sure. I never found my watch again; they were pulling him one way and another, to search for fire-arms, but they found none upon him I believe.</p>
               <p>When you first got your eye-sight, was there any other man near you than the man you saw running away? - No other. I saw two men running at two hundred yards distance, I suppose. I had seen three people standing together at the rails as we got over.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice enough of him to know whether he was one of them? - No, and if he had ever been out of my sight I should not have known him again.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Petit's daughters to Sadler's Wells. Mr. Petit came to us to see us home. We had just got a little below the city turnpike; we went into the field; three men followed us over the stile. Mr. Petit's eldest daughter who had hold of my arm, said she did not like those three men. The next thing I saw was, the prisoner clapped an handkerchief over Mr. Petit's face, and held it behind him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - I am positive to him; he said curse and d - n your blood, if you speak or mention another word you are a dead man. I went up and took him by the collar. I said, curse you, you are not going to kill the man. He got from me and ran over the field into the road, there I saw two men get hold of him, but I never lost sight of him. I did not see him take the watch.</p>
               <p>How long might this be about? - I do not believe they were together two minutes.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had not been taken then had you observed him sufficiently to be sure he was the man? - If I had seen him among forty others afterwards, if he had not been taken at the time, I could have sworn to him. It was very light, and when I laid hold of him I turned him fairly round.</p>
               <p>Had he the same clothes on then which he has now? - He had the same coat and waistcoat on, but his hair was more tumbled down, it was not so well put up then as it is now.</p>

I saw many people run; I ran likewise, and being nearly at the head of the mob, the people who ran said, Which way did he go? I said I do not know. I did not see him run; I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130010"/> the man at all. Some people who were a-head, laid hold of me and said, I suppose this is the man. They held me till these people came up; the woman directly said, that is the man! that is the man! They searched me and took me to the watch-house. I never saw the watch nor the man neither. They searched me again at the watch-house to see if they could find arms or watch about me, but they found none.</p>

I had scarce passed by him but he turned round and presented a pistol, and I believe he asked me for my money, but I am not certain; I was exceedingly frightened. I said, if he behaved civil I would give him what I had; I gave him both my watch and money; he behaved exceeding civil. He said, he was very sorry he was forced to take this means to get money, but it was want drove him to it. I asked him for my watch. He said, he wanted money and must have it. He said he would leave money for the watch at the Spring Garden coffee-house. I told him I did not want the money I wanted the watch. He wished me a good night; I wished him the same and he went away.</p>
               <p>Could you discern his person at all? - I have some recollection of the person, he seemed to be dressed in a brown coat; it did not seem to be like the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury there was no one present at the time this robbery was committed but the person robbed, and he says he does not believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>

               <p>Who told you so? - The constable.</p>

               <p>He is sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived with Mr. Lloyd? - I believe I have lived there eight months.</p>
               <p>Did you go in July last with his linen any where? - I have been with it ever since I lived with that gentleman; this was on a Thursday night; I do not know how long ago; there were four of them met me in Gray's Inn-lane; two of them parted with the others in Gray's Inn-lane, and went up towards Holbourn; the other two followed me from Gray's Inn-lane to the Spa-fields; in the Spa-fields they met the other two again; they dodged me.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing to you? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to them? - No; when they took the bundle away I ran after them and cried stop thief! they ran towards the turnpike; a gentlewoman at the turnpike stopped the prisoner and asked him if he had taken any thing from that child who was crying thieves and murder? He said no, hang me; and in about five minutes after he said, indeed it was not me. The gentlewoman said it was, and then he threw down the bundle.</p>
               <p>You did not see him drop the bundle? - No; he threw down the bundle before I got to him; when I came up the gentlewoman had the bundle, and the turnpike man had stopped him; then Musgrove, the constable came and took him to prison.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk with them in Gray's Inn-lane? - They said they would cut my throat if I did not give them the bundle; they had a knife.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>How came you to go on after they said that? - I went on; I would not give them the bundle; I walked as fast as I could; I did not think they would follow me; I did not see them follow me; I did not see them again till I got into the Spa-fields, but I did not properly see them then for they came behind me.</p>
               <p>How came you not to call for assistance in Gray's Inn-lane? - I did not think they would follow me.</p>
               <p>Had you taken any notice of their faces in Gray's Inn-lane? - No.</p>
               <p>In Spa-fields, it was dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could not see them distinctly? - No, I could hardly see them.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the turnpike? - Not far.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No; they told me he was stopped; just as I got to the bottom of the field he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>What makes you think that he is the man? - Because I saw him in the prison and knew him to be the man, and I saw him at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had seen him any where else and the bundle had not been found should you have known him? - No; I did not take notice of him; all I know is that that is the man I saw at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough of him in Gray's Inn-lane, and when he took the bundle, to know him again? - Yes; he stopped me in Spa-fields.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130012"/>Did they do you any hurt? - They pinched me.</p>
               <p>It was the other man who pinched you, not this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As stout a man as this? - No; he was not so big; he ran the other way; there was a shirt and stock in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going across the field and heard somebody cry out stop thief; there were two men running across the field; I ran away for fear they should think it was me.</p>

               <p>I live in Tailor's-court, Islington-road, close to the turnpike. On the 13th of July I saw the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock; he was running along out of the Spa-fields towards the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Did you see a little boy there? - No, I did not see the child but I heard him cry out murder and stop thief! I went across the road and saw the prisoner. I asked him if he had taken any thing from the child who cried murder and stop thief? He said he had not, indeed. I said he had. Then he dropped the bundle; I picked it up and called stop thief! and the turnpike man stopped him directly.</p>
               <p>How long was it before the boy came up? - Not two minutes; I heard him crying, and told him the man was taken; this is the bundle (producing it).</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to the boy when he came up? - I told him I had got the bundle, and the man was stopped; and he went and fetched his mother, who lived just by; the turnpike man asked him if that was the man? He said it was.</p>
               <p>To Bolton. What was the shirt and stock in? - A bit of cheque rag; this is it.</p>

He described the men to me; I went back again to see if I could find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130013"/> them. I went down a lane just on this side the sign of the Cock, at Houndsfield. I could not find the men. I came back again and found Mr. White's parcel upon the hedge by the side of the road, with the goods in it. I took it and carried it to the waggon; there was another parcel, a small paper parcel containing tea, sugar, and coffee, likewise taken out of the waggon. I came back to look for that small paper parcel; then I found the two prisoners standing under the hedge, about twenty roods from where I had found Mr. White's parcel. Some people came up to my assistance and we took them to Ponder's end; I took two paper parcels out of Mouit's pocket; one contained half a pound of green tea, the other a quarter of a pound of coffee. They had taken these two little parcels out and thrown the rest away. I charged a constable with them. The other two little parcels were found by some children in the hedge afterwards. Upon the the outside paper was marked Oliver. I found that paper in the hedge. I was carrying that for one Oliver.</p>

               <p>I saw Jackson at the beginning of Edmonton, driving the Cambridge waggon; it was about five in the evening; I was driving a cart about thirty yards behind the waggon. I saw Bryant get up at the hind part of the waggon and take out a brown paper parcel, and give it to the other prisoner, then I saw them throw the parcel into the hedge; and then they both ran down the lane which was about five roods off. I went forward and told the waggoner what I had seen. They chucked it over the hedge directly as they got it out of the waggon. The waggon was partly close to the hedge. When I told Jackson of it, he went in pursuit of them and I took care of his horses. Jackson came back in about half an hour, and brought back the parcel I had seen them throw over the hedge; he went back to look for some more things, and I drove the waggon to an house we stop at, and left it there, the Two Brewers in Ponder's End. I live at Theobald's Park. I went home and then came again in the evening to the Two Brewers, there I saw Jackson and the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Where was the place you first saw them? - Before my cart, following the waggon. I did not see them above a minute or two before they got up behind the waggon.</p>

               <p>I lived at Lord Mansfield's in June last.</p>
               <p>What happened at the house on the 7th of June? - It was pulling down between three and four o'clock in the morning. A vast many people were assembled.</p>
               <p>Was there any particular cry among the mob before they began to pull down the house? - No. Just as they began to break the windows they made an huzza. I saw the prisoner in the two-pair-of-stairs room. There were about a dozen people with her; she was slinging the things out of the window, the room was destroyed in which she was, with the furniture and the lady's clothes.</p>
               <p>Was any part of the room itself destroyed? - Not till about a quarter of an hour after when the wainscoting was pulled down.</p>
               <p>Was it pulled down by the same persons who broke into the house first or by the same set of people? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How long was she in the house? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Was she there during any part of the time the house was demolishing? - Yes, in the two-pair-of-stairs room; the wainscoting was pulling down while she was there. I did not hear the prisoner in particular say any thing; she was only throwing the things out of the window.</p>
               <p>You saw her there about a quarter of an hour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see her at all afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the house itself entirely demolished in the inside? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>What led you to take particular notice of her? - I took particular notice of her clothes, her face, and her person.</p>
               <p>What light had you? - There was plenty of light there.</p>
               <p>Was there any other women in the room while you saw the prisoner there? - Yes, there were several more women; there might be about five or six in the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you take more particular notice of the prisoner than the other women? - Yes, I knew her perfectly well again when I saw her at Litchfield-street office.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of her in the house more than the other women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to do that? - Because she was throwing the things out of the window.</p>
               <p>Did not the others throw things out of the window besides her? - Yes, but there was none like her, she had the same cap on she has now, and an old black silk gown.</p>
               <p>Should you now know any of the other women? - I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>You are very certain that is the woman? - Very certain.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner go up and down the stairs backwards and forwards several times with wearing apparel which belonged to Miss Murray. I saw her no where but upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>What light had you upon the stairs? - There was a great deal of light, but what it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130015"/> was I cannot tell; it was not our putting out, we who belonged to Lord Mansfield's house. I took particular notice of her, for when she had been up and down and dressed herself in the lady's clothes, I received a great many things this young woman (Cradock) brought out of the rooms, and carried them up into our apartments, where she and I used to lay. When she had ransacked all she could get there she ran past me upon the landing place and pushed me down; I told her there was not any more for her there, or any thing that belonged to her because there were many men up and down stairs with them; she made no answer at all but went up stairs into the garrett.</p>
               <p>Did you see her do any thing in any part of the house? - No, I was never farther than the landing-place of the stairs; I saw her go down several times with aprons full of things; I cannot tell what she did with them. I was never down stairs till his lordship's house was so much in flames that I could not stay longer. There were a great many women there.</p>
               <p>How came you to take such particular notice of the prisoner? - Her pushing me down upon the stairs caused me to take particular notice of her, when she pushed me down; and I took particular notice of her before; that she was so active in carrying the things down.</p>
               <p>At the time you saw her in the house was any part of the house demolished, or were the mob demolishing it? - I saw all the furniture on fire in the street, and the apartments were on fire in the butler's pantry.</p>
               <p>At the time you saw her? - No, that was after.</p>
               <p>Was any part of the house destroyed at the time you saw this woman? - I cannot say it was when I saw her upon the landing place, it was afterwards, when I went to look; it was when the guns were fired.</p>
               <p>At the time you saw her upon the landing place was any part of the house destroyed? - All the two-pair-of-stairs floor was demolished, the house was entirely pulled to pieces and burning; there was no front to the house at all on that side when I looked.</p>
               <p>Was the wainscoting or bannisters of the stairs, or windows, or any part of the house demolished before you saw her the last time? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did the same mob continue together or was it a different mob which destroyed the house from that which came first? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was there any time when the mob ceased? - When the soldiers came, some went down and some continued; and others came up afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after the soldiers came that you saw the prisoner? - Before I heard say that they were come; I never saw the soldiers at all till after the house was destroyed.</p>
               <p>Was you before the justices in Litchfield-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What day was that? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How long after Lord's Mansfield's house was destroyed? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>To Cradock. When was it? - After the last Old Bailey session.</p>
               <p>Then you had not made charge against the prisoner till since last Old Bailey session? - No. She was taken up because she had bragged that she had been at Lord Mansfield's house several times, and was never molested till the last time, and then she was stripped of the things she had got on, which were a petticoat and apron of Miss Murray's.</p>
               <p>You had been before the justices in Litchfield-street before this time had not you? - No never before.</p>
               <p>Then you only went to charge this woman? - Yes.</p>

               <p>At about four in the morning I was below stairs in the servants' apartments; the prisoner came down; I imagine she had missed her way; just by the servants' hall she asked me the way out. I said if you will go along with me, my dear, I will show you the way out; I took her up the laundry stairs and went out into the stable yard; there is a longish passage there, then I ordered her to strip, seeing through her pocket-hole that she had got something better than became her dress. She said she had nothing but what was her own. I had got the porter's staff in my hand, I knock ed her down; she cried out murder ! I said if you will not be quiet I will give you some more. I struck her again. She begged for mercy. I said there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130016"/> had been none shewn that night, and none I would show for I would have her stripped before I parted with her. She begged me to give her time. I took her by her heels or somewhere thereabouts, and set her upon her shoulders; I then turned her up and found a white petticoat and apron upon her; I tore them off. I struck her several times with a stick I had, and would have put her in the cistern, but the butler told me I had better let her go as the mob was about. I took the petticoat and apron; I have not them here; they belong to Lord Stormont's daughter.</p>
               <p>Had any part of the house been demolished at that time? - A great part of it had.</p>
               <p>What light had you when she came? - It was quite day-light.</p>
               <p>Were you any time with her? - I might be ten minutes with her.</p>
               <p>Are you very certain that is the woman? - I am very certain of it. I made no observation of it till she happened to be discovered by her own bragging of what she had done; I was sent for to the office. She was taken up in consequence of what she had boasted herself.</p>

I did not take the people till the day the servants were to come to London, as I could not charge them with any thing myself. The day the servants came to London, I went up the street where I saw this woman frequently about; and fetched the prisoner. She staid in the round-house till the servants were sent for. She was taken up on a publican's information.</p>
               <p>Have you yourself heard the prisoner say any thing? - No. I was myself at Lord Mansfield's, but I never saw the prisoner there</p>

               <p>Did you hear her say any thing? - Yes, I believe she said they were Lady Mansfield's, and she thought she had a right to wear them as she had got them.</p>

Hyde bid me go out of the way several times, I said I knew myself innocent and would not go out of the way at all.</p>
               <p>To Hyde. Did you ever advise her to go out of the way? - No; I have taken a great many of the rioters, and have been struck and used very cruel for it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Price dined with me on the 5th of August, I was going with him into the city; when we got a few yards within Temple-bar, he put his hand into his pocket and missed his pocket-book. A woman came up and said she had seen a man take something out of Mr. Price's pocket. Upon that we went back again to my mother's, near the New Church in the Strand, and there we got into a coach to go to the Banker's for the numbers of the notes, and to stop the payment at the Bank. When we got to Temple-bar, a gentleman, who was in the coach, said he would get out and ask the woman if she recollected any thing of the man she saw take something out of Mr. Price's pocket. While he was talking with the woman, as I sat backwards in the coach, I observed a man stand at the corner of Shire-lane, with a surtout coat on; his pocket hung loose from it in which I saw the print of a book. I jumped out of the coach, with an intention of asking him what he had got in his pocket; upon my jumping out of the coach the man went through the Bar. I pulled my friend, who was talking to the woman, by the shoulder, and told him I believed that was the thief; we ran after him; the man upon seeing us run after him, ran up Ship-yard. I cried stop thief! and he was stopped at the top of the yard. I ran up to him, laid hold of his pocket, and took the book out of it; from thence we came back again, got into a coach, and went to Sir John Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Who is that man? - The prisoner at the bar. This is the book, I took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Price. This is my book; here are the notes; I cannot swear to the identity of them, because I had not taken their numbers. I had three notes in it, one of 50 l. and two of 10 l. each.</p>
               <p>Mr. FORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I was along with Mr. Price that afternoon, and Mr. Wilson. We were going into the city to send a packet to Birmingham. About twenty yards from Temple-bar Mr. Price said he had lost his pocketbook. A woman who delivers bills out came and said she saw a man at the gentleman's pocket, who had run up Shire-lane. Mr. Price was exceedingly frightened, and ran home directly to see whether he had put the pocket-book in his pocket or not. When we came back the prisoner was standing by that woman; he looked suspicious. Mr. Wilson got out of the coach, and said that man looks suspicious, we had better examine him; the man turned round and ran directly through Ship-yard. At the top of Ship-yard Mr. Wilson took hold of him and took the pocket-book out of his pocket. He first said that no pocket-book had been taken out of his pocket; but when he was before Justice Wright he said, he found the pocket-book.</p>

               <p>I was going from my mother's in Black-friars up Fleet-street; near Temple-bar there was a fruit-basket; I stopped there and picked up this pocket book. I asked the woman if she knew any body who had lost any thing? She said, she did not. I asked several people; I thought to keep it till it was advertised and then that the owner might have his property again. I staid upon the spot near a quarter of an hour.</p>

I was told the first cart was robbed; several of us were going out of town; I was following behind; it was half past five; upon which I got over the gate and found the two men lying down by the trunk against the wall by the work-house; upon my coming over they both jumped up; when I came within twenty yards of them they left the trunk. French, upon my coming up, drew his knife and said If I came nearer he would run it into me. However I kept to them, and then they ran away; I ran a field after them, then I could run no farther, and Woodhouse continued the pursuit till they were taken. I am positive they are the men; I had not seen them on the road before.</p>

               <p>I was in a field by Steward's-lane, facing Islington work-house, that afternoon; at about six o'clock I saw the two prisoners sitting on a rail where they might continue about a quarter of an hour; some carts came by; I saw French run to the first cart; he whistled through his fist, upon which the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130019"/> other followed him up to the cart and helped him out with an hair box, and they carried it over the stile behind the work-house; I afterwards heard Lloyd say, I will rip up any body who comes nigh me. There was nobody in sight when they went to the cart; the carts which were following them had not turned the wall, and therefore they were not in sight; it was just round the work-house; I was catching sparrows in a field, where, I believe, they did not see me; upon seeing this I went and told that man who was then just come in sight; by that time hey had just got it over the gate; they did not stop the cart but took it out as the cart went along; the people ran after them, and I saw no more of them (the trunk is produced.) I believe this to be the very trunk I saw them take out of the cart.</p>

               <p>I was sent on an errand to Islington; I came along the back road. I went to the corner of the work-house to ease myself; I saw this trunk lie there; I afterwards saw three men jump over the field; I jumped up and ran away. I thought it had been a press gang ran across the field. There were some gentlemen playing at cricket who ran after me and took me; I never saw this man who is here in my life, before he was taken with me.</p>

               <p>Who did he say this to? - Some person he was talking to in the street, near the Pitt's Head; I just came out of the house, went past him, and heard him repeat the words.</p>

               <p>At what time of day was this conversation? - I believe between nine and ten yesterday forenoon.</p>

Upon the 5th of July I had been spending the evening at the Lion and Goat in Grosvenor-street; at a little after one going away I desired a coach to be called for me; the waiter could not find a coach; he offered to walk with me to the end of the street where I should probably get one; we walked together to the end of <placeName id="t17800913-20-crimeloc116">Lower Grosvenor-street</placeName>

He asked me which way I was going and said he would go with me. I told him I was waiting there for a man; when the waiter came back to me we set off together; we walked arm in arm; the prisoner had hold of my left arm and the waiter, Nichols, of my right. I had, in the Lion and Goat alehouse, put my watch into my left-hand coat pocket; having a good many seals to it I thought it would be safest there; when we had walked about thirty yards from the alehouse bench I heard the chain jingle; I put my hand immediately to my pocket, missed it, and told the waiter that my watch was gone, and that the prisoner had robbed me; the prisoner still had hold of my arm. He said what did I mean by accusing him; that he was a gentleman and incapable of such a thing? I said if he would not give it up I would charge the watch with him, which I did. He said he would go to an alehouse to be searched, but as we were going along to the watch-house, going through Grosvenor square, he pretended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130023"/> to be siek; he leaned against the pallisades; he stooped down and unbuttoned the knee of his breeches; when he had gone a few yards after that the watch-chain struck against one of the people's legs who had hold of him, and the watchman took up the watch; I saw it drop from him at the time; it was a darkish night.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I had been drinking but was not so much in liquor but I knew every thing which passed, and the prisoner had I believe been drinking too.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a gentleman's servant? - Yes, out of service.</p>
               <p>Did not you spend an evening with the prisoner at the Sunderland-Arms? - No, nor any where else.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Smith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A weaver I believe.</p>
               <p>Did not you say he was your attorney? - No.</p>
               <p>You never was at the Sunderland-Arms, nor saw the prisoner there; you never sung songs with him and offered to make it up for twenty guineas, nor say that Smith was your attorney? - I was at that gentleman's house and saw Banbury there.</p>
               <p>Did you sing songs there or not? - Not in his company I am certain I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you sing songs in the house? - I might; when the prisoner was in the house I never did.</p>
               <p>You did not offer to make it up and appoint him to meet you at that house the next day? - I never offered to make it up at all.</p>
               <p>You did not desire him to meet you at your attorney's, Mr. Smith, in Web-square, Shoreditch? - I did not desire him to meet me there at all.</p>
               <p>Did you send Smith to make it up for you to Mr. Gillam, a gentleman you found out, who is attorney for this man? - I said if it could be done before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did you send Smith to Mr. Gillam in Clifford's Inn? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then all this I am speaking of never existed? - No.</p>
               <p>I will tell you fairly the people are all here who heard this, will you say you did not sing songs with this man, shake hands with him, and offer to make it up for twenty guineas? - I never did.</p>
               <p>You did not say Smith was your attorney and appoint him to meet you there? - No, I did not say any such thing.</p>

               <p>I am waiter at the Lion and Goat. On the 4th of July last the prosecutor came to our house with a friend, staid and supped there; about one he desired me to call him a coach. I said I believed there was one at the corner of Bond street. He said he would walk to the corner of the street with me; when he came there there was not one. I said I was going to Whitechapel and if he would stay till I went and got my hat I would go home with him, for he was a little in liquor; the prisoner sat down by him.</p>
               <p>Was he very drunk? - No; he was I believe sober enough to know what he did.</p>
               <p>Sober enough to walk alone? - Yes. I was absent about ten or twelve minutes; when I returned the prisoner was setting upon the bench by him. He said is this the gentleman you was waiting for? Mr. Sowter said yes. He said he was going our way and he would go with him; he took hold of his left arm, I took hold of his right arm; when we had walked twenty or thirty yards Mr. Sowter said my watch is gone; this man has picked my pocket of my watch. I looked round and saw the prisoner's hand go into his left-hand inside pocket, and I heard something like the rattling of a chain; I let go the prosecutor's right arm and took hold of the prisoner's, and desired him to give the gentleman his watch and go about his business. I thought he only took it out of a joke. He said he had not got the watch; he would go to a publick-house and be searched. I told him it was not a time in the morning for publick-houses to be open; that if he went to any house he must go to the watch-house. I asked him several times to give up the watch; he would not. I said I would charge the watch with him; the watchman was coming by the Haunch of Venison; I called to him and gave him charge of him; going up Brook-street we met two patrols; I desired them to aid and assist; they did;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130024"/> before we came to the corner of Grosvenor-square I observed him put his left-hand into his left-hand pocket and take something out and put it into his breeches; I mentioned it to the watchmen at the same time as we were going by the Marquis of Rockingham's house; after that, he said he was sick, he begged leave to cast his stomach; he went to the rails, put his left foot upon the kirb-stones and made as if he was going to vomit into the area; he unbuttoned his breeches knee and shook his leg as if he was going to shake the watch out into the area; I desired the watchmen to take him away, which they did; I then desired one of the watchmen to walk behind him, as we had him on each side; in less than ten or a dozen yards the watch fell out of the knee of his breeches upon the flat stones. The man said the chain touched his leg; I saw him stoop and take something up. He said, here is the watch; and I saw it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I have seen him before once or twice; I have been at his shop; he was a tobacconist.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - I was not at all in liquor; the prisoner appeared to be a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take the watch away from him instantly? - I did not know whether I had a right to do it.</p>
               <p>It never occurred to you to examine his pocket or breeches or any part of his person for this watch? - I did not know that I had a right to do it.</p>
               <p>Did you feel afterwards in his side pocket? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing there? - A snuff box.</p>
               <p>How can you distinguish the rattling of a chain from the rattling of a snuff box? - I do not know that he had snuff boxes in that pocket; he had five about him; I took it to be the rattling of a chain; he was dressed very well, and said he was a gentleman.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Lower Brook-street; after I had called half after one I heard a noise in the street; I got out of the box and locked the box door; these people were coming up together; they said they had got a man for stealing a watch. I walked behind them till they got into the square; there he seemed rather resolute; I got hold of the back of his coat and said he must go to the watch-house; when we came to the Marquis of Rockingham's he said he was sick; he went and laid hold of the rails and strained but brought nothing up; he lifted his foot up to the kirb-stone and seemed very busy with his hand at his breeches knee; we took him from the rails, and as we were going a little further the watch struck against my leg as it fell out from the knee of his breeches. I said to the watchmen here is the watch; I stooped and picked it up; his breeches knee was unbuttoned.</p>

Mr. Sowter said he had been robbed of his watch; we took the prisoner as far as Grosvenor-square; he seemed to be sick about the centre of the square. He said he wanted to vomit; he put his foot up against the rails and unbuttoned the knee of his breeches on his left side and endeavoured to shake out the watch, which Mr. Sowter said he had robbed him of; he could not vomit; we took him from the rails, and in about ten or twelve yards afterwards the watch dropped from the knees of his breeches. I actually saw it drop.</p>

I observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130025"/> that his breeches knee was open. I said you shall not stay here any longer; we pulled him from the rails, and he had not gone above ten yards before the watch dropped from him; one of the watchmen picked it up; we took him to the watch-house and left him there. I did not see the watch drop from him; I was on the contrary side; it fell from his left side, I was upon the right. I heard the man, who had hold of him on the left side, say,</p>

I went to the people; Mr. Sowter said I have lost my watch, this gentleman has got it, therefore you shall take him in charge to the watch-house. The patrol came up; we hauled the prisoner up to Grosvenor-square; he pretended to be very sick; he leaned his head towards the iron pallisadoes and strained much, but nothing came up. He put his left foot down upon the kirb-stones, and was unbuttoning his breeches knee. When I perceived his hand busy I said let us take him away, he is about no good. We gave him a shove away, and before we had got a dozen yards, I perceived the watch drop from his breeches knee. Before it touched the ground, I said there is the watch. Webb stooped and picked it up and said the watch knocked against his foot before it touched the ground.</p>

Banbury came to my house; I said go to my brother's, for there are the attorney and the prosecutor. I went there afterwards.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing about pulling out his money upon the bench, or bank notes? - No. I heard Banbury say so. The prosecutor seemed to wave saying any thing left something should come out against the prisoner; he would leave it to his attorney, one Smith; he said if he had the value of his watch, he would never trouble his head more about it. I have known Mr. Banbury seven or eight years; I have been his security as a marshalsea-court officer; he never brought me into any loss. He sells snuff and tobacco.</p>

               <p>Did they spend the evening together? - Not then. A week or a fortnight afterwards he came to my house; he sung two or three songs along with Banbury in the parlour; they shook hands together as soon as they came in.

               <p>On this day fortnight, the 30th of August, being at dinner, between the hours of three and four, with my sister, in the parlour, the man was in the other parlour, I heard one of my maids cry out thieves! and another murder! I got up and opened the parlour door; the street door was open. Somebody had ran out. My man had jumped out of the parlour window after the man who was found in the house; and I went after him. My man cried stop thief! all the way he went, and there was an uproar in the street. I did not see the prisoner as he had turned the corner before I got out. I saw him afterwards at a publick-house. The window at which he came in was almost eight feet from the ground; it is my dressing-room; I had been robbed at that window before.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at the publick-house? - Yes, he went down on his knees and begged my pardon. They said he had snapped a pistol; I looked at it, and said it was mine; it was taken out of my drawer. I saw one pistol taken from him.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of August between three and four o'clock, the maid servant coming up stairs past my master's dressing-room, she called out here is a man! My master was then at dinner; the dressing-room door was open; I went into that room; I saw the flap of a brown coat hanging across the bottom part of the window-frame; I got on the table which stood near the window; I went to the window and saw a man about four or five yards from it on the opposite side, running, in the same coloured coat I had seen in the window. I jumped out and called stop thief! several times; he ran up Wormwood-street, where I saw Mr. West stop him. When I came up to him his arm was extended, with a pistol of my master's in his hand; Mr. West took it from him. I picked up a cloak off the ground, near the prisoner, which belonged to Miss Messman, who was at dinner with my master. The prisoner was taken to a publick-house; he begged he might not be prosecuted, for the sake of his mother.</p>

The cloak was found under his coat. One of the pistols has a ball in it, the other has none.</p>

He came in and took a couple of pieces of handkerchief off the counter and went out of the warehouse, and I followed him; there were other persons in the warehouse, but I believe there was not any body else saw him. It was about four in the afternoon; they were at the farther end of the warehouse; I was in a desk above him; I believe he could not see me; he did not speak a word; he walked till he got out and then he ran. I followed him and overtook him about thirty yards from the door. He dropped the handkerchiefs just as I laid hold of him; here is a young man here who picked them up when I took hold of the prisoner.</p>

He said he was the book-keeper; he took me to a publick-house a little above the inn. I delivered the parcel to him and he delivered it to the other man who went away. I gave him sixpence and he gave me change, taking two pence for booking.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130028"/> I insisted upon seeing it booked; he took me to the publick-house and asked me to sit down. I said it was not customary for the book-keeper to ask one to sit down. He said he would book them in Grace-church-street; for, he said, the same coach which went from the Red Lion went from thence, and the books were there. He then said the goods were gone to Tower-street to his house; the prisoner wanted to go to Tower-street. Finding him shuffling I charged the watch with him; the goods were afterwards found at his companion's in Tower-street by the prisoner's directions.</p>

While I was standing at Mr. Warwick's door, between seven and eight o'clock on the 1st of September, I saw the prisoner jump up and take this box out of Mr. Health's cart while it was passing by. He took the box upon his shoulder and ran away with it. I informed the carter that a man had taken a box out of his cart; he went with me, and we found him in Fleet-market. I never lost sight of him but for about two minutes, when I went to tell the carman what had happened. I will swear the prisoner is the man. (The box was produced in court and deposed to by the witness.) When he was taken I observed this mark Spencer of Hempstead.</p>

On the 1st of August, at about ten minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, as I was on my knees lighting the fire in the parlour adjoining to the shop, I heard a glass case in the shop shut down; I lifted up my head and saw the prisoner in the shop; I kept my eyes upon him, but before I could get upon my legs he got out of the shop and ran towards the Palace. I immediately pursued him, and never lost sight of him; when I came to the Stable-yard, St. James's; he passed a soldier; I called to the soldier to stop that man, that he was a thief; that soldier and another pursued him; he was taken about twenty yards on the other side Penny's gate; I came up immediately; he had thrown the watches over the wall into the garden; there was a man in the Park appeared to be a friend to him.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of August, between eight and nine in the morning, I was coming up St. James's Park from Buckingham-gate; in one of the walks by the side of the mall, just as I came opposite the stable-yard gate I heard somebody call out stop that man! I turned my head and saw the prisoner run; he came out of the stable-yard into the Park, ran a little way down, made a stop, and drew something out of his right-hand breeches knee, and threw it over the wall into Lord Godolphin's garden; I could not distinguish at that distance what it was, but it appeared to be round, and something was hanging to it. I was in the farthest walk but one from the stable yard gate; he was in the coach-way; I saw several people, particularly some soldiers, run towards him; when I came up to them I saw Miss Hatche's servant a good deal confused; I asked what was the matter and what she had lost? She said she did not know justly, but she believed watches. He said I have no watches but one of my own, and pulled one out. Knowing he had thrown something over the wall, I desired the people to take care of him while I got the key to see what he had thrown over.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see distinctly two round things? - No, only one at that time. Some of the people said the garden belonged to Lord Godolphin; I went to Lord Godolphin's, and one of the servants and I went into the garden to look, and almost opposite the bottom of the garden, where I thought he threw them, we looked about, and his lordship's servant found two watches; I saw him pick them up. The people brought the prisoner round to his lordship's door.</p>

When I was in the park they cried stop that man with the apron! I having an apron on stopped to see who they meant, and they laid hold of me, and searched me, and took my watch out of my pocket.</p>

I put them there about a quarter of an hour before I missed them. The prisoner came to live with me the day before; I had him from an office; he gave me a direction to go to Westminster to enquire his character, but I had not had time to go. I missed him before I missed the spoons; upon missing the spoons I went to Westminster where he had directed me, but could not find that he had lived there. I took him the Tuesday following in Westminster.</p>

This gentleman (the prisoner) came and had a dinner at my house.</p>
               <p>In company or alone? - By himself; the waiter came out of the room, and when he returned the gentleman was gone. The waiter came and asked me if I had seen him, or he had paid his reckoning? I told him I had not seen him. He said the tops of the castors were gone; he went back and then missed the spoons. I have a letter (producing it) which came from the prisoner on Sunday last.</p>

I brought him a pint of beer in a china pint mug; I set it down on the table by him, and went out of the room; I staid out some time, and then went back to see if he had done dinner; when I went into the room he was gone, and I missed the things off the table; I am sure they were there when I went out. I went into the next room and missed a silver tankard off the side-board. I saw it in that room when I shewed the prisoner into the room where he dined. He went through the room where the tankard was. I went and told my master, and five or six of us went in pursuit of him; my fellow servant overtook him, and I saw him brought back.</p>

He asked me if I could give him change for a large note? I told him I could not. He said it was of no consequence he would give me an order upon the Bar of Gray's-Inn Coffee-house for the money, which was thirty shillings; he wrote upon a piece of paper</p>
               <p>"Please to pay to the</p>
               <p>"bearer thirty shillings; the Bar of Gray's Inn Coffee-house. J. Williams." I went and delivered the parcel and receipt at the Bar, and they paid me the money; that was on the 22d. On Monday the 24th he came to me again; he then agreed with me for a pair of silver sauce-boats; he desired I would pack them up and carry them to Gray's-Inn Coffee-house and he would pay me for them. I took them there; the prisoner was sitting at one of the tables going to breakfast. I went up to him and presented my boats. He took his purse out of his pocket and threw out about five guineas and a few shillings upon the table, and said; I have not quite money enough. I shall be glad of another pair of buckles, such as those I had of you on Saturday; can you let me have a pair? I said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130033"/> believed I had not a pair of the same pattern by me but I would see at my maker's whether there was a pair in hand. He desired to have them by twelve o'clock. I was going to take away the boats with me and to return at twelve to have brought them with the buckles. He said, Perhaps you may not be back here at the time; leave the boats at the bar and I will pay for them there, if you should not return. I had no objection to that. I went up with him to the bar and left them with the bar-maid. I said to her, You are to receive seven guineas of this gentleman for this parcel; then I went to see after the buckles. As I was going out the prisoner said, You will be back again by twelve o'clock? I said yes, I shall. I returned exactly at twelve, then I found he was gone and had got the boats but had not paid for them. They said he had left word he should be there at twelve or half after, but he did not come back at all.</p>
               <p>When did you get your boats again? - I have never got them again; he offered to give them up before the Lord Mayor if I would not prosecute him, but I rather chose to prosecute; he was taken up on the 11th of May, at the London Coffee-house; he was there upon the same sort of business; as I had given information he was stopped upon that business.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - I never knew him before that Saturday.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps you do not know what business he is? - No other than what I have heard.</p>
               <p>He offered to return your boats before my lord mayor? - He did, or to pay for them, but the lord mayor would not consent to it.</p>
               <p>I believe you first went before Justice Addington upon this business, and obtained a warrant from him against the prisoner? - I did.</p>
               <p>Have you got that warrant now? - I have not; the warrant was for obtaining goods under false pretences. Justice Addington would not grant it otherwise, the first warrant was drawn out for felony, but Justice Addington would not sign that warrant.</p>
               <p>That warrant was executed upon the prisoner? - It was backed in the city; the warrant was granted after he was committed for an affair in the county.</p>
               <p>Was that warrant of Justice Addington's lodged against him? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Then after that how came you to apply for a warrant for a felony? - From the advice of gentlemen whom I thought much better judges of the affair than myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The day I bought these buckles of you did not I say to you I want a pair of silver sauce boats; I was going to let out a first floor, furnished; you shewed me a pair of nine guineas; now if I had-had a mind to rob you might not I as well have taken those of nine guineas as these? - That was your policy to deceive me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Instead of leaving his bill and receipt with the people at the coffee-house for this money, he took the bill and receipt away again? - I left the bill and receipt.</p>
               <p>You left the bill and receipt with the bar-maid? - Yes, to receive the money for me; it was made for seven pounds, eight shillings. I said to the young woman, you observe the gentleman is to pay you only seven guineas, as we had agreed for that sum.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at this coffee-house; the first time I ever saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, was Saturday the 22d of April; he came to the coffee-house and dined there; he bought a parcel at that time of Mr. Marchant, which he ordered to be left at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130034"/> bar with a bill and receipt. He took the parcel from the bar and paid the money and went away. On the Monday following he came in the morning to breakfast at the coffee-house; after he had had his breakfast he paid me for it, and told me to give him a parcel which was left for him in the bar; at that time there was nobody in the bar. I went into the bar and seeing only one parcel lying there I brought it out and gave it to him, which parcel I saw him carry off; when the young woman came into the bar I told her I had delivered the parcel. She said, Good God! there is a bill and receipt, and the money was to have been paid, which I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Did you see the bill and receipt there? - Yes, I did then, but not before; I saw no more of Mr. Williams from that time till he was taken up at the London Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay in the coffee-room after you delivered him the parcel? - He went away immediately.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how long the woman had been out of the bar before he spoke to you to deliver him this parcel? - As near as I can recollect not more than two minutes.</p>
               <p>Was she not in the room at that time? - No, she was gone out of the room.</p>
               <p>How long was it before she returned again? - Not more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>(The counsel for the prisoner submitted to the court, that the case proved against the prisoner did not amount to felony. The learned judges were unanimously of opinion that under the circumstances of the case it clearly amounted to felony.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge going on the day the prosecutor says, and agreeing for this parcel. I had taken an house and was going to lett the first floor, furnished, at a guinea and an half a week. I made use of no false pretence to the waiter; I do not recollect that the maid ever went out; I went up to the bar; I saw the waiter; I asked for it, and he gave it me; neither did I go with the prosecutor up to the bar as has been mentioned. I offered to return those very boats five weeks after, as I had not sold them.</p>

               <p>I am a countryman; I came to town one day; a man told me he had got a watch, we were at work at Paddington; I saw him talking to a man a little way off; he said he bought this watch for fifteen shillings; I gave him seven shillings and sixpence for half of it; when the other man went away then I went up to a gentleman's at Paddington and gave him seven shillings and sixpence more for it, and bought it all. I met a bricklayer near St. Giles's, he said if I would give him a gallon of beer he would help me to work. I said I had no money, I had only got a watch. We went to a publick-house, he called for a gallon of beer to drink; the bricklayer made me leave the watch there for it; he was to call next morning to carry me to work; he did not call. I never released the watch from the publick house, but the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130035"/> lieutenant did. I told them the watch was mine; the lieutenant would not let me have it.</p>

On the 2d of August she came in between six and seven in the evening. I believed she had several times used our shop before. When she came in I was showing a customer some Irish cloth; I opened several pieces. The prisoner did not speak at all. I laid a piece on the counter; while I was showing the customer another piece I missed this piece of Irish from the counter. The prisoner was still in the shop; I was on the same side of the counter she was; I went close to her and asked her what she wanted, for I suspected her. She asked if I had any gymp or fringe? I said No. She turned round directly and walked out of the shop; I followed her into the street, between the two doors of the shop, I took her round the shoulders and asked her for a piece of Irish; she immediately said take it. I put my hand under her cloak and took it out. She had got it concealed under her cloak. She said do with me what you please, I do not care. A constable was sent for, and she was committed to his charge.</p>

               <p>I am a servant at Rotherhithe. I have known the prisoner four or five years; he is a <rs id="t17800913-34-deflabel195" type="occupation">dealer, and buys clothes and watches</rs>

I said I had some money to receive from an aunt of mine from Norwich; he went with me; we were going up the yard; there lay several bags on the ground; I had like to have tumbled over them. I said to Hart there is something lies here; I picked it up immediately and gave it him into his hand. He said it belonged to one of the coaches he supposed; he would go and carry them to the book-house; the coachman laid hold of him as he was going up the yard.</p>
               <p>Did he call any body? - No; he went straight up, and the coachman laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>When you went into the yard did you call out to any body or any coach? - No; I was going to the book-house.</p>
               <p>Court. How long were you in the yard before you saw the bags? - We saw them directly.</p>
               <p>You had business there, why did not you call out for any body? - I asked for the coachman; they said I could not see him that night, I must call the next day, that was after the prisoner was laid hold of.</p>
               <p>To Brown. Can you be certain whether in carrying out a number of things to the coach you might not have carried out these bags and dropped them in the yard? - I had not carried any thing out of the warehouse at that time.</p>
               <p>To Gray. You went to receive money, how much? - Two guineas; my cousin came the next week and brought it.</p>
               <p>How happened you to go to the Swan-with-two-Necks? - Because I had a letter.</p>
               <p>Have you it here? - No.</p>

            ; we walked to the corner, and then I felt her hand about my pocket; she looked about, and said, Stop, there is somebody coming; she ran away, and then I missed my purse; there were in it seventeen guineas, a gold ducat, a Queen Anne's shilling, a dollar, and eight little pieces of foreign money; I am sure I had it in my pocket before I met her.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish her? - Yes, I pursued her immediately, and came up with her on the other side Temple-bar.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of her? - Yes, in turning the corner of that street, but I soon had her in sight again.</p>
               <p>Was any person with her? - No, not at that time; when I came up with her, I said she had taken my purse; she said it was no such a thing; then I called out for the watch; the watch came, and some people came and asked what was the matter? I said the woman had taken my purse out of my pocket with so much money in it; the watchman came, and the other prisoner came too, and made herself very busy, and said they should let that woman alone; as she was so busy, the people said I should search both; they were both secured, and taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Before you met with Johnson, are you sure you had the money? - Yes, I felt it just when I was with her, walking in the street.</p>

Upon the 4th of August, another clerk belonging to the company and myself came to London. I went to Piccadilly, and there met the prisoner and another woman; I went with these two women to a tavern; from thence, after having sat and drank three or four hours or more, I do not know how long, I was drunk, and I suppose the rest were so too, I went with the prisoner to <placeName id="t17800913-38-crimeloc221">Hedge-lane</placeName>

I sat on the bed and dropped asleep; at six next morning I waked and found my pocket had been picked of a note and bill; my watch was gone, but I found it on the bed. The prisoner did not live in that house; I went back to Piccadilly and enquiring of the woman who was with my friend, I found out where the prisoner lodged; I went to her lodgings and took her up. I am sure I had the note and bill in my pocket when I went to Hedge lane; I felt it in my pocket a few minutes before I went there. Upon my telling the prisoner it would be better for her, she confessed taking the bills. I found the door open when I waked in the morning.</p>

               <p>I do not know whether I went upon my head or my heels, I was so intoxicated; as I was going along the room I stooped to buckle my shoe, and kicked something before me; I looked down, and under the corner of the table, where the negus was, I saw a piece of paper; I thought it was a piece of a letter I had pulled out with my pocket handkerchief; I put it in my pocket. I was much intoxicated; I had been with him from seven in the evening; I gave him a direction to my lodgings, expecting him to call again. I never removed from my lodgings. He gave me 2 s. before he went with me.</p>

               <p>How came you to go with her? - To oblige my neighbour.</p>

I cannot be positive whether it was locked; I found it open; I thought I had locked it. I likewise lost a shirt and a shift, and three or four pieces of silk. The constable has what money was left unspent. The other things were found in the prisoner's apartment. I had hired the prisoner on the Sunday to look after my children, because my wife was dead. The little children she took home every night. I came home on the 5th of August, then I heard she had had 200 l. left her; not hearing of that before I suspected it was mine. I looked and missed my money; I took her in the morning in bed. The constable charged her with taking the money out of my drawer. She owned she had taken the money out of the drawer, and laid out nineteen guineas of it. I was with the constable when he took her out of bed. She said her husband was innocent, that she alone was guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>Did you say it would be better for her to to confess? - No. She owned what she had bought, and gave us two guineas, two half crowns, and a Holland's doit back out of the money. The next day we went and searched her apartment, and found the shirt, shift, and silk.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I am an Irishman. I was a stranger in this place; I had just come from sea, and wanted a lodging. I was sick and sore; I belonged to the Minerva. I was paid off.

               <p>Was you sober? - Yes. I was very sick and lame. She came into the room again in about a quarter of an hour; I had not been asleep. She went to the tester of the bed, where I had laid my clothes. She took down the clothes and the breeches, and as she was laying the breeches on a chair eight guineas fell out of them on the floor; it was in a brown paper, and there were about ten or fourteen shillings dropped on the ground; she stooped down and took the gold up, and an half crown, and made off. I was not able<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130045"/> to follow her, as I was sick and in bed at the time. The people told me she was a lodger there; there was nobody else in the room at the time she took down my clothes. I had no money left to bear my expences home to my native country. I have never got any of the money again.</p>

               <p>He was leaning over a post; I was coming out with small beer in my hand; he said can't you afford more than small beer? I said no, if you will give me strong do. So I went up stairs; there were two young women there. He followed me. He was in the room three hours, and he got himself in that time much in liquor. I know nothing of his money.</p>

I said I was going with a gown and he could not go with me. Going by the New Church he picked up an old woman's pocket, he said what there was in the pocket I should have part of. The first street we came to he was to see what was in the pocket. He opened the pocket; there was a green purse, and in the purse a ring, it was valued at six guineas by Malone, who was called to read a note that was found in the pocket. I was to have part of it, because I saw him pick it up; he said he had not the cash about him to give me the part, but he would go to a person's house and borrow it; he left me and came back and said the people were out at supper and would not be home till twelve o'clock; he asked me if I had any money about me or any thing I could leave in his hands for him to trust me with the ring. I told him I had not any thing about me but a lady's gown I was going home with to Westminster, which I did not choose to part with. He said he did not want the gown he only wanted the ring.</p>
               <p>Had you the ring at that time? - No, he had it; he said he wanted it to send to a person in the country he lay under great obligations to, and had nothing to leave in my hands, while he took it. I said I did not want the ring. He told me he had not the money about him; that he would take the gown and be with me in half an hour. He said the gown was not the value of the ring, and he took the cloak off my back. I gave him the gown but not the cloak.</p>
               <p>Did he give you the ring? - Yes, on taking the cloak, and went away, and promised to be with me in half an hour.</p>
               <p>He never came? - No. I went home, and the people of the house looked at it and said it was worth nothing. This is the ring (producing it).</p>
               <p>Which of the prisoners took the cloak? - Malone. The other took the gown; Kirvin spoke to me first, and Malone came up to value the ring.</p>
               <p>Did both go away together? - No, Kirvin went first; he put the cloak up in the napkin with the gown, and took both away and left me with the other man. They were taken by Sir

He said it was a gown Kirvin had just taken out of pawn and made him a present of to give to his sister. I thought it was a gown not come honestly by; I took them to the office, and it was advertised, and this girl came and shewed a piece of the same pattern before she saw the gown. She told the same story then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130046"/> which she has now. Her mistress came with her. She is apprentice to a mantua-maker. About a week before this happened, I had Kirvin in custody; I searched him then, and he had a ring in his pocket wrapped up in a piece of cotton, and a receipt for six pounds or six guineas. I opened it before the justice and shewed it, but I cannot say whether this is the same ring, though it is very much like it.</p>

I went up to his lodgings on the 15th of July at about twelve or one o'clock in the day, he was sick in bed; his wife was not within, he entreated me to stay till she came in. His wife came in about five o'clock. I staid all that night. I never left his apartment till between eight and nine o'clock next morning. All that time he was not able to get up.</p>

On the 24th of August, I stopped nineteen pounds of white wax; it was brought to me by the prisoner; I had seen him once before, but I did not know where he lived; I put it into my scale, and weighed it; I said, My friend, here is nineteen pounds weight of it, look at the weights; he said, master, I will trust to you; I said, I suppose these goods are stolen, if you can prove they are your property, or you are sent to sell them, I will pay you for it; he was on the outside of the counter; he said, O master, that I can soon do! In the interval, a coach with some people stopped at the door, I thought they might belong to the prisoner; he went out; I went round the counter to the door, the prisoner was then gone, there were some women at the door; one said, Who is that dare stop my property? I went round to the trade, and likewise to Sir

I looked at my pockets, and missed my money; I told them I had lost my money; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130049"/> was locked in; the people of the house opened the door, and let me out; I found the prisoner in custody in a neighbour's house; they asked me if I should know the woman? I said I believed I should; they shewed me the prisoner, and asked me if that was her? I said yes; so they took us both to the watch-house; I did not get any of my money again.</p>

               <p>I keep a green-stall, and go about with greens with an horse and cart; I live in Gravel-lane; my cart-house is in Elbow-lane. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I was alarmed by a woman, who said somebody had broke into my back-yard; I ran there to see, the dog was barking much; the prisoner had run into the necessary, and locked herself in; when she heard me speaking to the dog to be quiet, she came out and begged to be let out. I asked her how she came there? She said she had got into a bawdy-house and was obliged to make her escape; she must have come over two pallisades. I took her to the watch-house; I found a purse in my back yard the next morning.</p>

At eleven o'clock I was alarmed by a watchman that the fore door was open. I went into the yard of the counting house; I could discover nobody there, I went out again; on Sunday in the morning I found the nail of the shutters forced out; they had drove it; at eleven the night before I found some blue split upon the floor; there was twelve or fifteen pounds gone from one place; in the whole there was blue taken away to the amount of forty or fifty pounds weight.</p>

He said no, he did not; he came on board again at five in the morning; after that he said he went on shore on Saturday and spent a guinea, He made confession before the justice, which I saw him sign. (The confession was read in court.)</p>

               <p>I came out of Scotland in a sloop. I came down to Wapping to seek a ship which was going farther on. I came to two or three wharfs to seek for a ship. A man came dressed in a blue coat, with a small ribbon about his hat; he asked me where I came from? I said from Scotland. I had come only that day. He said he would give me sixpence if I would carry this trunk about forty yards because he did not choose to carry it; as I was carrying it one of these gentlemen stopped me and said it did not belong to me. I said it belonged to that gentleman.</p>
               <p>To Newhall, When you stopped him what did he say to you? - I asked him who gave him the trunk; he said a man with a laced hat. I said you shall go back with this trunk and see if you can find the man.</p>

               <p>I am a wheel-wright. I work in Church-lane. The prosecutor's house faces my garden; I got up and went to the window to see what weather it was; I saw the prisoner and another woman coming down the walk; the other woman had this bag under her right-arm; it was empty. As they walked past my house they seemed to go a-tip-toe; when they got round the house I saw them again at the back window. They went to Mr. Brown's door, and I saw the other lift up the latch of the street door; they went to the next door and tried the latch of that. They went to Mr. Batty's; there they tried the latch; it was bolted. They came back to Mr. Brown's, and the other went in at the garden door; they got into the wash-house, where these things were. The prisoner stood on the outside while the other was packing up these things; the prisoner went into the wash-house to her; I saw them both come out. I came out of the door and called out Mr. Brown, you are robbed. He did not hear me for some time; I then came out to stop them, upon which they carried the things to the place they took them from, and came back empty-handed; I stopped them and asked them if they had got any thing? They said no. They went away. A person went after them and stopped them, and they were put into Whitechapel watch-house.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of March, I went with Mr. Clark and other officers, to Wilson's house, having received an information that they were coming halfpence there; there were officers fixed all round the house. I entered the street-door, and went through the parlour into the kitchen, I met Mrs. Wilson in the parlour; she asked for God's sake what is the matter? I told her I had an information that there was coining there. I looked in the kitchen, but could see nobody. I opened the cupboards under the dresser, and looked all round; there was nothing to be seen concerning coining. I returned from thence into the parlour again. One of the officers, Labar, came into the kitchen and said one had jumped out of the window, but he had catched him. I stood there about two minutes talking to him; I turned round and saw Mrs. Wilson smoothing down the cape of West's great coat. I had examined the kitchen thoroughly before. I said to West, Good God! where are you come from, out of the ground? He said he had been sitting upon a chair by the fire in the kitchen. I said, Good God! would you persuade me I am blind? I have examined every place in the kitchen. I then examined every place about to see where he could have come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130054"/> from, but I could find none for some time. We had searched for the space of two hours I believe, and could not find any implements for coining. I said to the rest of the officers we may as well give it up, they certainly cannot be at work here. I went up stairs into the one-pair-of-stairs room; there were some empty hampers and lumber. There I saw in the crevice between two of the boards a place that looked as if a board had been taken up with a knife; I drew my cutlass, ran it between the boards, and lifted the board up and there was a place made with steps and two ropes to go from thence to the side of the kitchen. I called Mr. Clarke and said I had found the nest at last; Mr. Clarke went down, and I followed him. When we came to the bottom there was a small press for cutting out blanks, &amp;c. and a large one for striking the impression upon the halfpence. I told them I would go up stairs, and desired them to knock hard that I might see if there was any other way of getting there. They knocked with an hammer, and by that I saw where West had come up; it was under the sink in the kitchen. There was I suppose half a bushel of coals and a pail of water stood, and there was a little door to open to come out of the hole under the sink. I then took down all the wainscoting on that side of the room. The hole they had made to go down was through a cupboard; they had made a partition. It was not a cellar, but an hole dug in the ground, I suppose longer than half as big as this table; there was room enough for the flies to work, but it was a very confined place.

               <p>Mr. Wilson was not there? - No.</p>
               <p>He was in the country at this time I believe? - It is impossible for me to tell that, they said he was just gone out.</p>
               <p>Was your back towards this sink at the time you was talking with the officer? - It was.</p>
               <p>Court. Could West have got into the kitchen by any other means than out of this hole at the sink without your seeing him? - No, it was impossible, unless he had been let out at the top of the house; there was an opening at the side; it was a great height, as high as the top of this court; I stood in the doorway, talking to Labar. When I turned round he was behind my back. I am very certain he came out of that hole.</p>
               <p>Court. What was his dress? - He had a sort of lightish great coat with a red cape. I believe he had no apron, he had corderoy breeches very dirty and a brown waistcoat.</p>
               <p>West. There was a door opened from the sink, which was between Prothero and me; I was behind it, he might look several times, if he did not come behind that door to see; there are several doors out of that kitchen which I know of; but I know of no such thing as a trap door.</p>
               <p>Court. Could he be by the sink and you not see him when you went into the room? - No, it was impossible, for I examined every place; there was a bell fixed just by the great press below in the hole, and a wire came up to the parlour from it.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Prothero and Mr. Clarke to this house; I went to the back part; they made a noise getting in forwards, upon which Nash opened the back window on the first floor which leads into the yard, and jumped out, I secured him, and went and told Mr. Prothero of it. While I was talking to Mr. Prothero, I saw the cupboard door move a little, I looked very steadily at it, and saw West come out of it, in a great coat, his hands and breeches were quite green. When we came to examine the door we saw it was to go down into the hole below.</p>
               <p>Where was Prothero at the time you saw West come out of the cupboard door? - Talking with me at the kitchen door, standing with his face to me. When Mr. Prothero found the place out, I went down and saw the dies and things there.</p>
               <p>West. Whether there was any other door he could see me come out of? - There was no other door to that room but that we were standing talking at.</p>

               <p>Court. You say Nash came out at the window, was there any communication from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130055"/> the place where that window was to this hole? - He might come up the hole and go through the kitchen, but if he had done that the people in the house must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Was Prothero in the house before you saw Nash? - I imagine so, because of his jumping out at window.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a working dress with a white jacket.</p>
               <p>Was any thing green about him? - I did not observe any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did his hands appear dirty as if he had been at bricklayer's work? - His hands appeared brown and coppery.</p>

               <p>I went with Prothero and Labar, to the house of Wilson.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body in this house? - Yes, I saw West; when I saw him he had on a pair of breeches which smelt very strong of copper, and his hands appeared as if he had been at work in this way; the next morning when he was brought before the justice I challenged him with having changed his breeches in the prison.</p>
               <p>Describe what you found in this hole? - I was the first who went into the hole; it was fifteen feet deep from the boards to the ground where the presses were fixed; when I got down I saw a large press fixed, with a pair of dies, and a large quantity of halfpence round it.</p>
               <p>What was the large press for? - For stamping the impression; and upon the left side of the large press there was a small one with a large quantity of cecils and blanks, and some sheet-copper; these dies were set in the press; these halfpence were struck off from this die, which was then in the press.</p>
               <p>The whole apparatus was complete for the making of halfpence? - As complete as it possibly could be.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose house this is? - I know it to be Wilson's house.</p>

               <p>I was at work, setting the kitchen-range in the back-kitchen; when they knocked at the door I went to open the door; there was a hole in the door, they ran the cutlass through the hole of the door; then I ran out backwards, for I did not know what they were about.</p>
               <p>Court to Prothero. Was there a back-kitchen? - Yes, and a private still at work in it without paying the duty; we sent for an officer to seise it.</p>
               <p>Was there any range? - I am not sure, I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Was there any mortar? - I did see mortar in the back-kitchen, but I did not see any tools.</p>
               <p>To Clarke. Did his hands appear as if he had been at work at the bricklayer's trade? - I did not observe his hands; there was mortar in the room, the window of which he jumped out at.</p>
               <p>To Labar. How did his hands appear? - As if he had been at work with copper.</p>
               <p>Was there any mortar upon his hands? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he any apron on? - He had no apron on.</p>
               <p>Would the tiling and bricks give his hands that colour? - No.</p>

               <p>I have known Nash twenty years; he used to do labouring work for my husband; he was out of business and wanted a job; Mr. Skynner asked my husband if he knew of a man? He told him yes; this young fellow went there and Skynner employed him to set up a grate, that was about a fortnight before Easter Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Where was he setting up a grate? - At Mr. Wilson's, at the back of the Fleece.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I saw the grate, and saw him setting it up there.</p>

               <p>You said just now he was a labourer? - Yes; but when he was out of employment he worked at that.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you know the grate was to be put up for Wilson? - My husband took an apartment backwards of Wilson, and this grate was to be put up for our use. Mr. Pratt was the man who employed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130056"/>I thought you said Skynner just now? - Skynner was the landlord.</p>
               <p>You said Skynner employed him to set up the grate? - No Pratt.</p>
               <p>How came you to say Skynner? - I made a blunder; Pratt is at the door now.</p>
               <p>How long was he about that? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding it was put up for your use? - I believe five or six days, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>What became of him afterwards? - Indeed I don't know no further than there was somebody coming in after the coiners, and he was getting out at the window, because he thought it was a press-gang, as he told me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any of the officers a drawn cutlass when he opened the door.</p>
               <p>Prothero. I had a cutlass under my coat, but I did not draw it, nor never do till I find there is occasion for it; as to Nash he was on a different side of the house to where I was.</p>

               <p>What time of day? - Eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>When was this? - I did not make any remark about the time, I think it was about April; I did not take any account.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after Easter? - I think it was after; it was the day he was taken up I think.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>How long were you there? - Not any time; I went through there to the shed to Mr. Pratt; there is a way through the house.</p>
               <p>Through the back-kitchen? - Through a part of the passage. He is an acquaintance of mine. I stopped, as I went through, to see him.</p>
               <p>Did you know he worked there before? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened you to find him out then? - He used to use the Fleece; I knew he worked about the neighbourhood; I did not know he was in that house till I saw him there; I met him in the passage; he came out for mortar or bricks, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Court to Prothero. What time was it when you went to the house? - It was after dinner; it might be three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination of Lovejoy.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No. 59, Wood's Close.</p>
               <p>So you was going through this passage, is it through the house? - There is a passage through the house.</p>
               <p>Then you must go through the window? - There is a door-way and passage leads into the yard.</p>
               <p>A common passage? - No; Mr. Pratt's gate was shut up, and so I went through there.</p>
               <p>What, is it a thoroughfare? - No; there is a bricklayer's shed in the farther part of the yard; you go through the hall of the house, and then through a long passage.</p>
               <p>How came you to go through Mr. Wilson's house? - Because Mr. Pratt had a shed there, and the gate was shut.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A carpenter.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with this man? - I have known him on and off some time.</p>
               <p>He is a bricklayer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You wanted to speak with the master bricklayer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>The master Bricklayer is the man who employed him? - I do not know; his name is Pratt.</p>

               <p>I worked for Mr. Wilson, cutting of fire wood; he had bought two load; I cut a good part of it up; he sold it in penny-bundles; when I went in I did not see any body in the kitchen, because the kitchen-door was shut, and Mrs. Wilson was gone with the key to let me in. I went into the kitchen; when I got in I did but just turn myself about and people came in at the door; I did not know what they wanted; I stood by the sink-door where there were coals lying; I went to see for an ax I had to cut wood with; I went into the kitchen for it.</p>

               <p>Is there any cupboard or door by that sink? - There is a door shuts in the sink that parts the kitchen and the sink; it is a sort of a closet.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been down in the hole below the kitchen? - I never saw any thing of the like kind; the boards were nailed down.</p>

               <p>When did you see it? - Three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>In May or June? - I cannot say; it was before last term.</p>

               <p>Last session you mean? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was there any communication from the sink to this hole? - I never saw any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Have you examined it enough to say there is no communication from this place to the kitchen? - I have.</p>
               <p>There is no communication? - No.</p>
               <p>You swear there was no communication in the month of March? - Yes; and I stand to it.</p>

               <p>Have you examined the house sufficiently to swear to the situation of it in the month of March? - I have, and there was no communication from the sink to the hole that you speak of; I can speak within these three years, there has been no communication.</p>
               <p>Was there any communication from any other part of the kitchen to this place? - I never saw any; I examined it thoroughly; I can say positively there was not.</p>
               <p>Have you been in the hole since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go in? - From the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you call the sink the closet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is a communication from this closet to the hole? - No, Mr. Wilson asked me to go down and examine the place, that was about a fortnight before last session; I have lain in the house several nights.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No. 7, Aldersgate-buildings.</p>

               <p>The wainscoting was not pulled down, nor the cupboards altered at all? - I did not see any difference.</p>
               <p>How came you to examine if there was any communication between the hole and the kitchen? - Mr. Wilson desired me, for he said there was a fellow would swear his life away, and he must be guarded against him, if possible; I know there was an affair happened in that house and I was surprised at it.</p>
               <p>How did you get down into the hole? - From the top of the house, the top story.</p>
               <p>Three pair of stairs? - I believe there is two-pair-of-stairs besides the garrets, because I plaistered the garrets I went through.</p>
               <p>This passage was from the garrets down to the hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How deep was it? - About twenty-seven, or between twenty and thirty foot.</p>
               <p>This hole did not exist then, nor upon your oath, never did exist? - I do not know that it ever did exist; there never was a hole made in the sink to appearance.</p>

               <p>How many floors are there in this house? - I do not know, I have never been over all the rooms; I lived in the one-pair-of-stairs; it goes to the next house to go up into the other rooms.</p>
               <p>You have heard talk of this hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which was the way to it? - I never saw it; I do not know; I live forwards.</p>
               <p>Who lodged in the house besides you, did not one Mrs. Dickins? - No; one Browne lodged there.</p>
               <p>Lovejoy did not live there? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw this way to the place? - I never did.</p>
               <p>When the man was taken in the house was you there? - No, I was not at home; I work out; there were some people there when I came home.</p>
               <p>They had pulled something down I believe? - Yes, the wainscot by the sink.</p>
               <p>Did not you look under the sink to see the way to the hole? - I was not in the room five minutes.</p>
               <p>Did your curiosity never lead you to examine it? - No.</p>
               <p>Where do you dress your victuals as you have the use of the kitchen? - I do not use it now; my sister was very much frightened.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath was there then any communication door to the hole? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you subpoenaed to come here? - No; I was desired to come here to speak the truth that there was no hole there.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell that gentleman that you never heard it said whether there was or not till you' came into the court? - I must hear of it being in the house.</p>
               <p>Prothero. I took all the presses out of that hole, one of which was seven hundred weight; there was a sink for washing of dishes; under the sink there was a hole with coals in it, and behind the hole there was a hatch which was loose, which opens to the hole. I took every bit of the wainscot down from the top to the bottom with a pick-axe. Mr. Vernon saw me do it; this man says he came in from the top of the house, the house is but one story high.</p>
               <p>To Labar. Did you look at this hole? - Yes; it was a place by the sink, a little touch would open it.</p>
               <p>Was it such as any person might come out of or go in at? - Yes, without any trouble at all.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 19th of May I went down to Battlebridge to take an account of nuisances. About six o'clock in the morning the prisoner and a man was at the Maidenhead at Battlebridge, drinking tea; I went in and they were talking about a fire in Great Russel-street, Bloomsbury. I saw them examine some things they took out of a bundle; there was a ring which is here.</p>
               <p>Did they do that in your company? - No, I sat, and had a pint of beer at another table; they were saying that they had been at the play over night, and as they were coming back in the morning they saw a terrible fire in Bloomsbury. The man pulled out a book with an ear-ring in it, and said my dear, is not this a diamond. She said I think it is. When they had had their tea, they had no money to pay for their breakfast. The man pulled out a medal and sold it to the landlord for their breakfast; the landlord allowed them eighteen pence for it. I staid till they had got their breakfast; and then stopped them on suspicion of a robbery. On searching the prisoner and the man I found some letters on each of them; they were directed to No. 5, Great Russel-street, Bloomsbury. I took them to New Prison, and by the direction I went to No. 5, Bloomsbury, I saw the house had been on fire, the next door was No. 5. I took the prisoner to Sir

               <p>Did she say who the man was? - She said she did not know him before that night; she said they had not examined the things till they came to the Maidenhead at Battlebridge, where they breakfasted; I did not hear them say anything about the things; when they pulled them out at Battlebridge they were looking at them. When he took the letters out they looked at one of them; she snatched it out of his hand and said, This letter came from my friends in the country.</p>
               <p>Who had the bundle? - It lay on the table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did he ever see me touch any property, or have any of it, or take it from me? - She took the pockets and this book.</p>

             is likewise clerk to them; he is a quaker by profession. On the 1st of August the prisoner Danford came to me in Smith, Wright, and Gray's compting-house; he said he had a bill which was nearly due, and he wished to pay it into our house, to the account of Hodges, Carr, and Company, at Leicester, that he himself was going out of town, and therefore could not receive it. I told him he might receive the money of Hodges, Carr, and Company, as soon as the bill was paid. He brought a bill for thirty-seven pounds five shillings, drawn upon Lancaster by Atkins; he was to pay it to us for their account, and he was to receive the money of them on his return from his journey, which he said would be in about a month. It is common to pay money in on account of country customers, and to take the money on their return. He said he would step to the inn and fetch it. He went away; he came back in a little time and paid it to another of the clerks, as I since understand, but I was not present; the clerk brought the bill to me in the compting house.</p>

               <p>Near the house Number 21? - Opposite.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular on the 5th of August? - On Saturday morning the 5th of August at about nine o'clock I saw the two prisoners go into the empty house No. 21.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether any body let them in or they let themselves in? - They let themselves in with a key; then they opened one of the parlour window shutters next the door; I was sitting at breakfast when they went into the house. In about three quarters of an hour after I saw a young man knock at the door; he was let in by somebody; when he had been in the house about a minute I heard a very dismal cry, and I heard the cry of murder! two or three times. I ran over and looked through the key-hole of the door and perceived three men struggling in the passage. I looked through some time. I asked some dustmen to break the door open; they would not. I went to the window and found the sash was fast; I gave it a sudden jerk, and some thing that it was fastened with on the inside broke, and it went up. Then they were opposite the parlour door, in the passage almost opposite the window.</p>


               <p>In what situation were the three men? - Danford had got. Watts by the collar with his right-hand, the other prisoner was behind him, and was pulling him into the house. I saw Newton have hold of the end of a letter-case, and pull it from under the banker's clerk's arm, from out of a pocket on the inside of his coat, he had got his left arm under Mr. Watts's left arm; I asked them what they were doing, if they were going to kill the man? I asked if nobody would get in at the window? I said, if no one would get in; I would. I got my knee upon the edge of the window, to get up; when Newton perceived that, he dropped the book out of his left hand into the passage, and made to the door; I heard the door unbolt; I got from the window. Newton rushed out, and as he rushed out I catched at him, but he ran under my arm. I called out stop thief! A carman was coming up with a load of coals; he stopped him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - I did, he never was out of my sight. Then Danford rushed out; I catched him by the collar; Watts had hold of a part of his coat. When I catched hold of him he begged of me to let him go. The carman brought Newton back and gave him to me, and I then had hold of them both. The prisoners are the two men.</p>
               <p>Where was the pocket-book found? - As soon as the pocket-book was dropped the young man (Watts) made a scuffle to get the book again. When he came out with Danford I asked him who he was? He could not tell me; he could not speak. Then I saw he was almost choaked.</p>
               <p>Where was the pocket-book found afterwards? - In the passage; I saw it lying there, and saw Watts take it up.</p>
               <p>When the pocket book was taken up from the ground had you it in your hand? - Watts could not tell me who he belonged to, but I read the name in gold letters on the pocket-book, it was

               <p>Does not this passage run the depth of the house? - It does; the street is very narrow and the houses are three stories high.</p>
               <p>What you have been speaking of is as to what you discerned through the key-hole? - I observed most when I had the w indow open.</p>
               <p>With respect to the time when you said Newton took the book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not know the reason of taking the book I take for granted? - I did not.</p>
               <p>At the time of taking the book where were the persons who were struggling? - Danford was next the street door, I suppose not half a yard from it, and he had Watts by the collar. The parlour door and the street door partly join together.</p>
               <p>Whether the passage was not very dark at the moment when you saw Newton take the book? - It was not very dark; there is a window over the back door that throws a light into the passage, and there was likewise a light over the street door, the passage was not so dark but I could perceive every thing in it.</p>
               <p>You are sure upon your oath you could distinguish what passed in the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you said the passage was very dark? - Not so dark but I could perceive every body there, and could perceive what they were doing. I had the best part of my body in at the window when I saw them take the book.</p>
               <p>Did you give no signal that you was at the door at the time you was there? - I knocked very loud several times.</p>
               <p>And was the book taken after the knocking? - It was.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Then you not only had the light of the windows over the back and the fore door, but the light of the window you was at? - The parlour door was wide open and the window was wide open which I was at.</p>
               <p>Danford. As she is upon her oath I beg to ask her whether she has not had a promise of being rewarded in case we were convicted? - No, I have never seen the gentlemen belonging to either of the bankers except Mr. Smith and another gentleman at the banking house; I have never seen them since.</p>
               <p>Danford. But any other person? - No, from no person.</p>

The first man who appeared was Newton running as hard as he could; I held up the but-end of my whip to him and told him if he did not stop I would knock him down. I seised him with my right hand by the left wrist. He said for God's sake don't stop me, it is only the bailiffs after me. I said bailiffs or devils I will have you back again. I put my left hand round his neck and took him back to Mrs. Boucher's; there the other prisoner was and there I left him; she said that was the same man who ran out of the house before Danford.</p>

               <p>You are rent gatherer, I believe, to Mrs. Brown whose house is No. 2 Water-lane, Black-Friars? - The house is her property.</p>
               <p>Did any body apply to you for the key of it? - A man applied to me on the 28th of July, he went by the name of Coats.</p>
               <p>Was it either of the prisoners? - I cannot take upon me to say that it was either of them; I am not positive to them. He asked what kind of an house we had to let? I told him. He asked to look at it? I said the key was at Mr. Lardner's, the next door; that he might have it to look at the premisses.</p>
               <p>You have seen the house since? - I have.</p>
               <p>Did you find it in the same situation as when he had the key? - He came on the 28th; he was to give me an answer; he did not come till the Monday following, which was the 31st of July; then he had the key; he was desired to leave the key at Mr. Lardner's again, where he had it from; what he had the key for was, as he said, to have a woman in the house to clean it down.</p>
               <p>Had he taken the house? - No, not positively, but he had left half-a-guinea as earnest for taking it; between that and Monday he was to give a positive answer whether he would absolutely take it or not. I told him the rent was twenty pounds a year and all taxes; he agreed to give the rent.</p>
               <p>Then what remained unsettled? - He said the house was for a friend in Sheffield, to make a hardware warehouse of, who did business for a person on Ludgate-hill, and he thought it would be convenient for him.</p>
               <p>If the agreement was not settled how came he to leave half-a-guinea? - He said, that the woman who cleaned the house was to leave the key at Mr. Lardner's again; this was the Monday; on the Thursday following I went down and found the key was not left with Mr. Lardner. I went to the door and found he had taken the bill off the window. I knocked at the door, not knowing but there might be somebody in the house; there was nobody there; I have been down the cellar stairs several times since.</p>
               <p>Was there a free passage to the cellar at the latter end of July? - Yes; when the person had the key, it was quite clear. I went there upon the 5th of August; then I found there was a door barricadoed on the cellar stairs, to prevent a person going down into the cellar, there had not been any such thing before. I went down to the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Could you go into the cellar on the 5th of August? - Yes, but that was after the prisoners were taken; the door was then broke open which had been put upon the cellar stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether there had been a fastening at the bottom of the cellar stairs different from any which were there when you let the house? - Yes; at the top of the cellar stairs the door was made much more secure than ever it had been before, and there was a large door on the stairs, it might be two or three steps down; there was a sort of a little landing place under another stairs which went up, and this was about two stairs below that.</p>
               <p>So that when you passed the first door you could not get down stairs? - No, because of the other door.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are speaking of alterations which have been made after you had taken the half-guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was made whilst they had the key? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the passage from the street door, was it dark when the door was shut? - It was a long passage, not very light; but there is a light over the street door, and from the back yard directly across, so that you might see from one window to the other.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. Then it is light enough to see into it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever had the key again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you get it? - I had the key from Mrs. Lardner on the Saturday after these men were taken.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter. I went to examine the cellar stair-case of this house, No. 21, in Water-lane.</p>
               <p>Describe it? - The door opens into a passage, which leads straight through into the yard; there is a light over the yard door and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130066"/> a light over the front door. The stair-case is about the middle of the building on the left hand, there was an open stair-case, and there is a door which opens to the cellar stairs which is under the stairs which lead up to the dining-room, and about half way down the cellar stairs, it was enclosed with a strong door fixed up about five steps or half way down, and the door opening to the cellar stairs was strengthened by a batten nailed up the inside of the door; a whole staple was driven into the left-hand post, and an half staple into the right-hand post, and a wooden bar of the parlour window shutters was cut in two in order to make a bar to fix into these staples; one end to go into the whole staple, and the other into the half staple, the top door was weak, and so they had strengthened it with a piece of wood.</p>
               <p>If any person was enclosed between these two doors could they be heard by any person? - It must be some time first, for it is just in the centre of the building. It is a dismal place if they had shut him in there, for there was no light at all when the door was shut.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Alderman Sawbridge. On the 11th of September, at past twelve o'clock at night, I went to Guildhall Coffee-house to fetch a suit of clothes for my master; I took a coach at Charing-cross, it carried me there, and I got the clothes, and ordered the coachman to drive to New Burlington-street. The man said his horses were very tired, he had been out all day, and begged I would discharge him. I said I would not discharge him without he got me another coach; in Cheapside I got another coach. I paid him his fair and ordered the <rs id="t17800913-58-deflabel346" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

I awoke with it, and was going to jump out of the coach; I saw him go from the coach door and get upon the box; then he drove on as fast as he could before I could get out; the door was open and the step was down. I put the step up and shut the door. I called to him to stop all the way; when he got into Oxford-road he stopped the coach and said, Master, did you call to me? I said, yes, certainly you have robbed me of my watch and my money. He said no, master, I have not robbed you, indeed I have not; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130067"/> I will drive you safe home. Upon recollection, I thought if he would drive me home to where I was known, it would be better to detect him than where I was; accordingly he drove me to New Burlington-street. I got out of the coach, laid hold of his collar, and called the watch; one watchman came up to me; I desired him to ring his rattle, to get some more watchmen. I got three or four watchmen about him. I desired them to keep him till I went up to Mr. Sawbridge, who was in bed, to know what to do with him. We took him to the watch-house, and the next morning I went with him before the justice. I never found any of my things again.</p>
               <p>What did you loose? - My watch, a pair of buckles, and three shillings in money.</p>

               <p>I took this gentleman out of another coach in Cheapside; he bid me stop in Newgate-street to take a girl up, and bid me set her down in St. Giles's. He said I need not put the step up he would put it up himself. I had not gone far before he said he was robbed. I said he could not be robbed without it was by the person in the coach with him, that I would drive him safe home.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you stop to take any person up into the coach? - No, upon my oath.</p>

My wife came down stairs and found the parlour and street door open. My wife called up to me; I came down. There were a number of things missing. The things mentioned in the indictment were stopped at a pawnbroker's. I was informed that a woman came out of the house; I went round to the pawnbrokers and gave them information of it, and about a fortnight after she was stopped and I was sent for by Mr. Leighton, a pawnbroker, in Wardour-street; there I found the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner was sent to Litchfield-street office; I saw her there; she was examined, and said she knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Thwaites. The prisoner came into my master's shop, on the first of August, under a pretence of buying a bit of cloth. She took hold of this and asked the price of it? I told her it was fourteen pence a yard. I suspected her. She took hold of another piece, and laid it over this, and then pulled this from under it, and let it fall on the floor; she desired me to cut her off two yards and an half of the other piece, which she paid me for, I put it in paper and delivered it to her; as soon as she received it, she let it drop on the floor where the other lay, and then took them both up together and put them into her apron and went out; I followed her outside of the door, brought her back, and took it out of her apron; it was loose in her apron.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to buy two yards and an half of cloth. I changed an half guinea and paid for it; when I came out the gentleman stopped me and said I had got more than I had paid for. I did not know of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were some people attended, who said she had a good character, and they believed it was the first offence. I believe she was in liquor at the time.</p>

On the 9th of this month, about ten minutes before twelve at night; I went from the Clifford's-Inn coffee-house, where I spent my evening, with an intent to go, to Newgate market, where I generally lie when I come to town. As I was going down Fleet-street, at the end of Fetter-lane I met the two prisoners; they were strangers to me. Whether they asked me to treat them with a glass of wine, or I asked them, I cannot charge my memory; it was soon agreed between us to drink something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130069"/> together; they said if I would step back just as far as Temple-bar, they knew of a very good house. I very imprudently went back with them to that house, it is up a passage by Temple-bar; the people were gone to bed. They said they knew of another very good house, the One Bell in the Strand. We went there; there were a great many people at the door, so I would not go in; they brought me at last to the <placeName id="t17800913-62-crimeloc370">London Hotel, in Bridges-street, Covent-Garden</placeName>

It was about three in the morning, and as the morning was short we all three lay together, which was imprudent in me.</p>
               <p>And unreasonable I think? - It was. I waked about seven o'clock, as near as I can guess, and then the prisoners were gone, and my purse and all my money was gone. When I took the purse out to pay the waiter I had six guineas left in it.</p>
               <p>How long before you went to bed did you take out the purse? - I do not think it was above a quarter of an hour at most. I heard some people talking below, and I went down; there were the two prisoners. Nairn said good morning to you, you was bravely drunk last night. I said it may be so, pray what have you done with the money you took out of my pocket? Money, says she, with some opprobrious oaths, I know nothing of your money; you do remember, I suppose giving this

               <p>I was desired to search Odeer. She said here is what money I have got, and pulled three guineas out of her right-hand pocket, and three shillings and sixpence. I said, you have more than that. I searched the other pocket, and found a purse with three guineas in it; the purse was not the prosecutor's.</p>

He said he had only a few guineas in his pocket, which were at my service, and he gave me three guineas, and gave the half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130070"/> guinea to the other girl.

             was in company with me. I was going from Little Queen-street, to her master's country lodging, which is near the turnpike, Tottenham-court Road. As I was going through the first field I heard some people coming behind me; I looked back, and saw two men coming up; the young woman was rather afraid. I walked a little faster till we got into the second field; then I heard the men walking faster. I thought we could not escape them, so I fell into our usual pace again. The prisoner Downing came up to me, put one hand to my back and the other to my breast and tripped up my heels, and I fell down upon my back; then he demanded my money. The other prisoner was with the young woman demanding her money; she was about two yards from me. Downing said, your money, d - n you. I told him I had got none. He said what was I doing here without money. I had a shilling in my breeches pocket; I took it out and put it into my waistcoat pocket as I lay on my back between his feet; then he pulled the watch out of my fob, and asked me if my buckles were money, silver he meant, at the same time he was turning my breeches pockets out, then the other prisoner left the young woman and came up to me. I felt one of their hands (I do not know which) at my waistcoat pocket and missed the shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing else? - Then Downing took the plated buckles out of my shoes; after I rose up he took my muslin neckcloth from my neck; I desired they would not injure the girl; they promised they would not; then they went back the same way they came, and I went on with the young woman to her master's lodgings; it was a wet darkish night, but not to dark but I could see. I am positive to Downing; as to Wood I am not positive, though I firmly believe it was him. I told what had happened to me to a man at the turnpike, who directed me to go to the first publick-house. I did, and told the landlord and two men what I had been robbed of, and described the men; there were several people went out to look after them, and I was informed they were taken at the Compasses, a publick-house, in Tottenham Court Road. I went thither and saw the prisoners there. I said those were the men, that I was positive as to Downing; they were searched but nothing material was found upon them; Downing offered no violence to me, but the tall man struck me on the eye. I did not see any weapons.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross examination he said he never saw the prisoners before; he was a little frightened but not greatly, as there were no weapons; that they were dressed in sailor's habits, and one of them had striped trowsers on, but as to Downing he knew him by his countenance.)</p>

               <p>I was going to my master, who has a lodging by this turnpike; at half past seven, in company with Mr. Anderson, in the first field, I saw two men coming on behind Anderson; we mended our pace; the men came running up; the short man ( Downing) put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130071"/> his hand upon Anderson's shoulder, asked for his money, and tripped him up; then the other came up to me, and asked for my money; but I could not observe what the other did to Anderson; Wood took my buckles and pockets, and then he went to Anderson. I stood still; I was about two yards off; Wood struck Anderson on the eye and pulled the neckcloth from his neck; then they went away from us, and Mr. Anderson and I went together to the turnpike; it was light enough to see the face of a man, and I am certain to the face of Wood, though I am not so certain as to the other; Wood was dressed as he is now, and they both appeared like sailors; when we came to the turnpike Anderson told what had happened. The next morning I saw the two prisoners at the round-house, and was sure then that Wood was one of the men.</p>
               <p>(Upon her cross examination she said that Wood had striped trowsers on; that she had never seen the prisoners before she believes; the time taken up by this robbery was about six or seven minutes; and that they seemed to be as much frightened as she was.)</p>
               <p>A Witness sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the turnpike leading from Tottenham-court to Islington. On Sunday the 10th, the two last witnesses came to the gate and said they had been robbed. I asked where, and whether they should know the people? They said, yes; one was a tall man in a waistcoat, long striped trowsers, a jacket, and round hat; the other had a jacket and trowsers and was rather taller and thicker than the little one, and had curled hair and a cocked hat. I directed Anderson to the first publick-house to get a pistol, and he came back in five minutes with two or three men. I called upon two men who lived just by; I had intelligence that two men answering such description lodged at the Three Compasses, in Tottenham-court Road; I went for Grubb, the constable. Anderson being come back I went to the Three Compasses, and the two prisoners and several other people were there, but no others dressed like sailors. Anderson said, he would swear Downing was the man who robbed him, and believed the other prisoner was the other. The next morning

Anderson said he had been robbed by two sailors, one a tall man, the other a short punchy man, dressed in jackets and trowsers. I went up Tottenham-court Road; then round the fields to the place where the robbery was committed, but found nobody there; then a person came with Anderson to me and gave information that two such men had been at his house and he knew they lodged at the Three Compasses; this led me to go thither, but they were not there then; after ten o'clock Dixon and I went to the Three Compasses again; we saw the prisoners there; we seised them. I sent for the prosecutor; he came and said, they were the two men who had robbed him; they were searched; three shillings were found upon one, and two shillings upon the other.</p>

On the 14th of August, between four and five in the afternoon I was alone in my bar; I had seen this money and the pocket-book two or three hours before in the desk in my parlour, into which you go through the tap-room; the prisoner Watson and another man came into my house, after four o'clock, and called for sixpenny worth of something to drink; they went into the parlour where the desk was. I saw them shut the door. I was angry at that, and asked why they shut the door, and sent to have it opened; the boy went and opened it; they shut it again. I sent the girl to open it, one of them was standing with his back against the door; they soon after paid for the liquor and went away. I had carried them some pens, ink, and paper, into the room. In two or three minutes after they went away I was told I had been robbed. I went directly to the desk and missed the pocket-book and five guineas; I always locked the desk; and it appeared to be locked when I missed my money; I suppose it must have been unlocked; they might stay in the room half an hour. I am sure no one else was in the room after the time I saw my pocket-book and the five guineas. I was in the house all the time myself, it is not usual for company to go into that room, but they got in, I hardly know how.</p>

               <p>I was sitting in the tap-room when the prisoner and another came in; they called for liquor and went into the parlour and shut the door; upon Anderson's saying he was robbed I pursued them. I saw them about five minutes afterwards in a court. I saw one of them holding up a piece of paper; after that I saw one of them with a pocket-book in his hand, which had it I cannot tell, but they were both looking at the pocket-book. One said to the other, while they were examining the pocket-book, there is nothing in this pocketbook of any consequence. I applied to several people to assist me; just as I seised them one threw down the pocket-book, but which of them I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>I was employed on this business. When we came to the house we knocked at the door, in a little time an old woman opened it, we rushed in. She attempted to shout out; one of our people clapped his hand before her mouth, and stopped her. Jealous and I went up stairs, and went on till we got to the garret. I saw a place made like a stove, I put my hand on it and said it was hot; it was in the front garret on the right-hand side; I spoke low, I thought he was near enough to hear me. I turned round and saw Jealous open the door at the left hand side of me; he went in and I followed him. Mr. Carter was then standing upon his feet; I looked over and saw the mother standing next the window. The daughter was getting up, and I heard some money fall down; I said Charles, the girl is throwing down money. He said never mind any thing, let us keep them where they are.</p>
               <p>The mother was next to Joseph? - No, the daughter was in the middle between the two; she was next the window on the farther side. I heard a noise; there were three different parcels of money on the bench, and three stools upon which I suppose they had been sitting. Clarke and Carpmeal came up immediately, and they were taken to Sir

               <p>I went to Carter's house in Water-lane, and when the door was opened we all went in together. I saw that young girl (Jane) in the kitchen, at a carpenter's chest. I thought it was a bench; she went from thence into the yard, and put her hand into the water; I was close to her; I asked her what she had thrown into the water tub? She said nothing. I looked into the water tub, but there was not any thing there; I brought her back into the kitchen. I looked on the chest where she came from, and there was a pan of aqua fortis and water, and a pan with water and white sand in it (producing them) in that pan; with the white sand in it there were these half crowns and shillings (producing a large parcel); in the aqua fortis and water there were some half crowns and sixpences (producing them. The witness likewise produced a bottle of aqua fortis and a pipkin.) This pipkin was on the corner close to the fire; there was some fire in a pan under it. I called Prothero to look at her hands; they were all over sand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130076"/> and aqua fortis; for she had but just touched the water with one hand when I catched hold of her.</p>

               <p>I went to this house in Water-lane with the rest of the officers; I took care of the back part of the house for fear of an escape. When all the prisoners were in custody Prothero came and called me; when I came into the house I saw the youngest daughter in the custody of Phillips and Prothero. I then went up stairs through a room where some body had been casting, and in a room adjoining to that were the father, mother, and the eldest daughter. To the best of my knowledge the father was on the left-hand side, in the centre the daughter, and on the farther side the mother. The father was without his coat, his shirt sleeves tucked up; and I think he had a white cap on and a pair of slippers; he had no stockings. The daughter and the mother were in bed-gowns. There were three pair of handvises, three stools, which three people had been sitting upon, and some money lay all over the bench where they had been at work. I took them before the magistrate in the same situation they were in; and I am sorry to say there was not a doubt that each of the persons had been doing some part of the work.</p>
               <p>That is your opinion? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Upon what do you found that opinion? - By examining their hands, which were discoloured with working silver. There was a thumb-stall with silver on it found on the thumb of the father. There was a quantity of filings and a pair of knippers they cut it off with. There were the filings which had been filed, and some pieces cut off the rough edges. They are all here. I then went to examine the work shop; they had been casting there that day, for the furnace was warm. There was a melting pot in the furnace. There was a get which they lay in the sand, for a gutter for the metal. There was casting sand, facing moulds, and every thing complete for casting. I went down stairs; I found the pickle and other things there, and a quantity of half crowns which had been taken out of the wet sand; she had certainly been at work; her hands were in a terrible situation by working with the aqua fortis. I asked her what her name was, which she refused to tell me. She begged me not to ask her any questions. I put her into another room, and then found by the grandmother, that she was a daughter to the man. (All the implements were produced in court). This is the melting-pot which was on the fire; this is part of the money which lay before them; here are some rough cast as they came from the sand, the others are filed round the edges to take the roughness off.</p>
               <p>Then the persons so employed were filing these? - No doubt of it; here are files, and here are parts of the get; here are three hand vises, scowering paper, and cork, which they make use of; and another finger stall, which was found in the shop; here are flasks; here are the patterns with which the impressions were made in the moulds in which this counterfeit money was cast.</p>
               <p>What is the use of the pickle? - By putting them in the pickle it forces the silver to the surface.</p>
               <p>These halfcrowns which were found in the pickle do they correspond with the pattern you have produced? - They do; there is one which has been cast and made use of as a pattern; and these two are counterfeits; here is another made from that pattern.</p>
               <p>Are the shillings and sixpences the same? - All the same; here is a shilling which is a rough cast, a filed one, and a complete<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130077"/> one, and a pattern; there is a hole in the woman side, and that corresponds with all of them.</p>

               <p>I am a joiner. On last Wednesday was three weeks, I think it was the 23d of August, I was in Mrs. Browne's house; the prisoner came and asked if her name was Browne? She said yes, He said, have you any thirtys? She said she had not, but she would get him some; she took out two or three halfpence of the sort she was to get at thirtys for a guineas to show him the pattern. He asked at what time he was to come? She said about one o'clock. I went away and told Prothero what had passed. He came with me about one o'clock to apprehend him. He came between two and three, and the two pieces were done up in an handkerchief for him. I did not see the halfpence, I heard them rattle, and he gave Mrs. Browne one guinea in gold, and some silver; I do no know how much, I did not see him tell the silver for the halfpence; he then went away.</p>
               <p>What did you understand by thirtys? - Thirty shillings' worth of halfpence for a guinea in gold.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the agreement? - Yes, there was to be thirty shillings for a guinea. I do not know how much there was given him.</p>
               <p>When you said he asked if she had any thirtys, did the parties explain what it was? - The woman when she shewed him the pattern, said, these are thirty shillings for a guinea.</p>

               <p>What do you mean by two pieces of half-pence? - Thirty shillings for a guinea; he agreed to give me two guineas for three pounds' worth of halfpence. He came between two and three o'clock. I gave him two parcels, but by mistake gave him seven and twentys; he gave me a guinea in gold and a guinea in silver. I never had any dealings with him before; he was recommended to me. When they are sent into the country they have but twenty-seven, but when they come for them in town they have thirtys. He took them and put them in his handkerchief. He only had two papers to see if they were the kind he wanted. I did not find the mistake till night. I expected him to come in the morning; instead of that I was taken to Sir

We went into a room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130079"/> we sat down together, she in one chair and I in another. As I sat in the chair I fell asleep. Nothing passed between us. When the waiter came in and waked me, and asked me if I had lost any thing, I had been there about half an hour; the prisoner was gone. I immediately found I had lost my watch and money. I have not got either watch or money again. The prisoner was taken up about three weeks after. I had looked at my watch just before I went in, so I am sure I had it. I had been drinking a little, but was not disguised so much as not to know what I did.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk with the prisoner about a present? - No, nothing at all.</p>

               <p>I was waiter at that time at the French Horn in Holbourn. I remember the prisoner coming in with Mr. Farris, it was very late in the evening, near the morning. They went into a room and ordered a negus. I saw seven or eight shillings; he gave me two shillings, and put the rest into his pocket and buttoned it up. I did not observe whether he had any watch; in about ten minutes after the prisoner went out; I went in to him and he was asleep. I then waked him and asked him if he had lost any thing, because his breeches were wide open, as well as his pockets; he searched his pockets, and said he had lost his watch and money. I took the prisoner up about six weeks after. I am sure she is the woman, I knew her before.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor was in liquor, and he took me into the French Horn. I was at the house every night, but they did not take me up for three weeks.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you give her any money? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was you with any other woman that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you treat any other? - No.</p>

A little boy who lives in the house ran out, and then the prisoner ran out; a gentleman seeing him run out, and me lying in the passage, stopped him, and brought him back. He had in his pocket a black cardinal of mine, my husband's silver shoe-buckes, and two silver tea-spoons.</p>

I was coming by her house, at Bluefields, she was sitting at the window. She asked me to come in. I staid there, I believe, about half an hour; then we went to the King's Arms in Sun Tavern-fields; we staid there about an hour; from thence we went to the halfway-house; we staid there about half an hour; from thence we went to the <placeName id="t17800913-76-crimeloc440">Three Cranes at Mile-end</placeName>

               <p>I suppose at all these places you drank pretty freely? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then I may fairly suppose that you was very drunk? - Yes, I was very much so.</p>
               <p>When had you the watch last? - At the Three Cranes; I am clear of that.</p>
               <p>You are clear, why you was so drunk you could not know any thing that passed? - I am certain I had it there, because I took it out to look at at that place.</p>
               <p>Drunk as you were can you positively swear that? - Yes, I will swear, that when I had looked at it I put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Was any body else in the room? - It was in a publick tap-room; there were several other people there but not in my company.</p>
               <p>Did you sit near any body? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you part with the prisoner? - Between ten and eleven o'clock; they took charge of her there; the watch was found upon her person.</p>
               <p>How came you to miss it? - I did not miss it, the people in the room saw her take it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you known this young woman? - By sight eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>You used often to drink tea with her? - No. I used to go and see her, but not very often.</p>
               <p>You knew where she lived and you and she where in habits of intimacy? - No.</p>
               <p>But you used to pay her a civil visit now and then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You used often to see her? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you been there a dozen times in your life? - Yes, I may have been.</p>
               <p>Finding you could not put the watch into your pocket yourself did not you desire her to take care of it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was you sober enough to recollect that circumstance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not she say immediately here is the watch which this man, who knows me well, has given me to take care of? - It is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Did she say so? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Whether she did not when the constable came say that? - She said she had a right to it.</p>
               <p>What did she say her right was? - They questioned her to know whether I was her husband? She said, no; but she had a right to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Did not she say that right was because you had given it her to take care of? - No; she did not say so.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear you did not give it her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was very drunk? - Yes, but I am clear in it I did not do it.</p>
               <p>You knew her, and had been above a dozen times at her house? - I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Perhaps only eleven times, but you have been there often? - Perhaps too often.</p>
               <p>You knew her husband too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>We should not have heard any thing of this prosecution, I believe, if the husband had not threatened you for taking his wife from him? - I did not take his wife from him.</p>
               <p>Did not the husband threaten to bring an action against you for seducing his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And is not that the reason for your bringing this prosecution? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury you will acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner slept with me; when I went to bed I left the gown upon the horse; the prisoner blew out the candle. which caused me to suspect all was not right. I asked her where the gown was? She said, upon the horse. I put out my hand and found it was not there. I jumped out of bed, upon which she ran off.</p>

On the 13th of August I lost eleven pigeons, some of them were taken out of the shop, others from out-houses on my premises; the goose came from the Cape of Good-Hope; they were lost on Sunday morning; I went round the next day to people who deal in those things; I found five or six pigeons in the possession of Mrs. Martin, in Holbourn, near St. Giles's; I could swear they were mine.</p>
               <p>Did you find the goose? - Nothing but the head of it. I took up the prisoner on the Tuesday following, by the information of Mr. Martin.</p>

               <p>I keep a poulterer's shop in High Holbourn. On Sunday the 13th of August, I purchased these six pigeons of the prisoner for four shillings; on the Monday morning Mr. Brooks came and claimed them as his property; the next day I saw the prisoner go by, and had him secured. At Wilmot's Office Mr. Brooks said he would shew him mercy, if he would impeach any others who were concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told him if he would discover any accomplices, that they might be brought to justice, he should have mercy shewn him; we went in quest of another person, but could not find him.</p>

On Monday the 11th of this instant, I went at dinner to fetch a bottle of wine out of a cellar even with my kitchen; I brought up a bottle; I found I had made a mistake, the cork was wrote on, red wine. Parsons perceiving I had made a mistake, asked if he should go and change it; I said no, I would go myself. I went and brought up another; then I went to Slough on the Thursday following; when I returned, I missed a considerable quantity of wine; I took Parsons into the cellar, and observed that I had not used above five bottles, and there was a decrease of above two dozen. We looked over the wine, and found five bottles of Sherry deficient, and fifteen bottles of Madeira; there was a deficiency<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130087"/> of claret, but I cannot tell the quantity; there was a large quantity of port deficient; I said, George, you cannot have drank this wine since Monday evening; I said I was sure he or Molly had taken it, and I would find it out. He said he knew nothing of it. I examined their boxes, but found none there; I then went down into a vault under the street, and found a bottle of port, with the mouth downwards, and another half full; I said I was clear he knew something of it. He said, no, indeed, he did not; I said I would go and search the hampers in the other vault. He then said if I would go up stairs, he would tell me something; he did not say what. I said, could not he tell me in the vault. He said no, he had rather go up stairs. Going up stairs, I said I supposed there was some in the cock-loft. He said, no, there was none there. I opened the door of my one-pair-of-stairs room, and went in. He then said, Sir, should not you be sorry to hang me? and I should be very sorry to hang Molly. I said, yes, I should be very sorry to hang him, or for him to hang Molly. Then he said that as he was rubbing the table he found a sort of a pick lock key; that he told Molly, and she said she had got a smith to pick the lock of the Pembroke table, where I keep all my keys, and had a key made to it; I went and fetched Mr. Bond, and he examined them both; he then told the same story. She then said, George, how can you be such a villain, did not you hide yourself in the area while the smith attempted to pick the cellar lock? He said, no, he knew nothing about it. Then she said, he told her that he could not pick it, nor all the people in the kingdom. She said, that then she got the smith to pick the lock of the Pembroke table, and to make a key to it, which they always used, and all my other keys. I had a dozen of keys lay there; I always carried the key of that drawer in my pocket; by means of this key they could get at the key of the cellar, and open it at their pleasure. She told me they had given two bottles of wine to the milk-woman; the milk-woman was sent to, and she brought the two bottles of wine to my house; she said she had given three bottles to a

He said he had done no such thing, that she had given it to his brother. She said, you know, George, two of your brothers were here on Monday, and a friend of mine, and we drank about six bottles of wine made into negus, that was while I was out of town. He said they had not drank so much wine as six bottles; she said one of his brothers had a bottle of white, and a bottle of red wine home with him, and she gave her own friend another bottle. He went with me to his brothers. I said, you have got a key of George's box, I insist on having the key; I got the key, and examined the box, and found a pint bottle and a phial full of brandy.</p>

               <p>I live at Stepney. On Thursday five weeks ago I set my box down on a bench by the London Infirmary, being tired. The prisoner sat drinking a pint of beer at the door. He asked me if I was going to a place? I said yes, to a publick-house in the Borough. He said he could help me to a place in a private house, which would be better than a publick-house, and if I would go over to the Red Lion he would tell me more about it. I went over with him; I put my box down on the table, and he called for a pint of beer, then he began talking about the place. We sat there about three quarters of an hour; he then went with the box to the woman at the bar, and desired her to take care of it while he went to enquire about the place. I asked if the box would be safe; the woman said yes. We then went to the Horse and Groom, in Church-row, Whitechapel; he called for a pint of beer; then he went out. He said he was going for an answer, and would be back in three minutes. I staid about a quarter of an hour. I began to be be uneasy. I went down to the Red Lion and asked for my box; the woman said the man had been and got the box. I was sitting at a house at Bethnal-green, on this day month, I saw the prisoner go by, and I had him secured. The box contained the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I have never found any of them.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these things? - They are put at the value of fifty-three shillings, they are worth that.</p>

They went out together, and in about a quarter of an hour he came back and said, Now, madam this box. I said there it is, and he took the box on his shoulder and went away.</p>

The prisoner and two men offered to come into the Poultry. The prisoner had an iron bar in his hand. The mob desired me and the other soldiers to unfix our bayonets; we refused to do so; upon which they throwed dirt and stones at us; this might be at about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning. Charles the prisoner lifted up the iron bar to strike at me; in order to save myself I knocked him down with the but end of my firelock, and took him to the Poultry Compter. They would not receive him there; he was brought back again; then he was brought back a second time. I was exceedingly hurt. They were all very riotous; most of them were drunk. He was a little in liquor; he was very much hurt by being knocked down; I saw him in the hospital eight or nine days after. I did not see him in any other act of outrage, but striking at me.</p>

Then they threw brickbats and dirt at the soldiers. I saw him strike at Williamson with the iron bar, but we struck him on the arm and disabled him, and Williamson knocked him down; he was immediately carried to the Poultry Compter. He was damaged so much in the head that he could not possibly get away. He was carried to the hospital for fear he should die, which we supposed he would.</p>

Upon his going abroad he requested that I would either deliver the lease to the landlord, or lett the house furnished; the house was surrendered to me on the 15th of June last. My son, and I, and another person took an inventory of every thing in and upon the premisses; I examined every thing very minutely; a person I intended to put in charge of the house had been at that time engaged, I shut up the house; there was no person left in it. A gentleman made application to me on the 27th to see the house; when I went to it I found that the lock of the street door had been forced, and the key hole was filled with horse dung. I sent a person down the area. I saw the door which leads to the kitchen below was open; he came up and let me in at the street door of the house. I found the principal part of the bolt of the lock was in the staple; the box of the lock was on the door; then I went up stairs and found that every thing specified in the indictment was carried off; we found a good many articles left packed up, ready for carrying away; we found the back part of the house open, and the detached stables were open; and through that part the goods were carried away.</p>
               <p>Did they appear to be forced? - They did not. I advertised five guineas reward for a discovery of the parties; and some time in the beginning of July I received a letter from the office in Litchfield-street, desiring that I would be there at twelve o'clock. I went accordingly and saw these goods.</p>

He was asked where he lived? He hesitated, at last he said he lived at Lambeth, and gave us a direction where. Mr. Bacchus and I went to his lodgings to see if we could find any locks or lead. When we came there I wondered to see the house so grandly furnished. I found there all the goods specified in the indictment; and we found this chissell (producing it.)

On finding the door open, I went up to the garret to call the prisoner; she was not there. The apprentice was in the bed, she lay in. I awoke the apprentice; all the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of the children's room except my own clothes. I traced her to Fetter-lane, there I took her up; she confessed taking the things as soon as we went into the room, and that she had sold my clothes to a Jew. There was nothing said to her to induce her to make that confession. The other things were found in her apartment and in the next room.</p>

I told him where I lived, and he came in the evening at nine o'cl ock with the carriage and the lady in it; I bought two hind glasses, and two fore glasses of him; he said the lady had made him a present of them, and the carriage too; I knew by his speech they were stolen.</p>

On the 5th of this month the prisoner came, and said Mr. Vincent wanted the chaise to go to Hammersmith; he took the chaise out in the afternoon; about nine or ten o'clock in the evening, he sent it back again, by a man who cries clothes; the blinds were up, I did not see whether the glasses were in it or not, it was locked up, and the door was never opened afterwards, till I broke it open.</p>

I saw three men running down the field, and heard Collins cry out Stop thief! Stop thief! Stop thief! The prisoner jumped over the hedge, five or six feet behind me; as soon as he jumped over the hedge, he cried out Stop thief! then he jumped over the hedge into the other field; I pursued him, and cried out Stop thief! he jumped over two hedges; I hallooed out to the patroles to stop him; the prisoner went to the hedge by the road, seeing them all in arms, he saw he could not go that way, but must be taken; he turned on his left hand in the field where I was; I turned immediately, and kept him to my right; I hallooed to the first sentry-box for them to stop him; he jumped over a paling about four feet high, which brought him into a field of plowed ground; he made a push towards the farther part of the field, then he made towards Mr. Shakespear's timber-yard; I was not ten yards behind him when he jumped over that paling; then I said, you are as safe as a bird in a cage; for I knew he could not get from thence. I stopped to see that he should not come out of that place again; I never lost fight of him till he got over that paling.

               <p>I am a shoe-maker. On the 5th of June, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went into <placeName id="t17800913-103-crimeloc570">White's-alley, Rope-maker's-alley, Moorfields</placeName>

Soon after I had got to the place, I saw the prisoner pass by me, at the head of a number of people, who appeared to me to be very riotous. He had a long flat iron bar in his hand; it appeared to me to be the bar to an inside window. Upon his going by me, I said to several people round me, That young man, who is going at the head of that mob, was my <rs id="t17800913-103-deflabel571" type="occupation">foreman</rs>

I should suppose there were more than thirty of them. I did not follow them up the alley. Soon after (I suppose between five and six o'clock) he returned, in the same situation that I saw him go up.</p>
               <p>Do you mean still as a leader? - Yes, in the same situation as before, he returned. I said to a gentleman, who will be called, If you will go with me down to the Romish priest's house, I will shew you a Roman Catholick AT WORK. I will call him by name, and challenge him with being one. The gentleman refused to go with me. Soon after the prisoner returned, upon his going by me, I said, Martin, have you turned your coat to pull down your own house? He said, No, he had not; or, No. He went away; I saw him no more till the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>In what condition was he then? - Very much burnt. I asked him how he came to be burnt? He said, He had been to Palace-Yard, and that from thence he went to Newgate, where he was burnt.</p>
               <p>In what situation were his cloths and person, when he came down the alley again? - I did not take particular notice what situation his cloths were in.</p>
               <p>You are certain as to his person, and that he was in the situation you have described? - I am sorry I cannot have a doubt. I think it my duty to mention to the Court, that the prisoner was a servant to me two years, and upwards; during that time, I can take upon me to say, that he was as faithful and honest a servant as any man ever had. I have trusted him with large sums. When I have been in the country, he has carried on an extensive business for me, and has always rendered me a fair and honest account. It is a great grief to me, that I have been obliged to give this account.</p>

               <p>Between five and six o'clock on Monday afternoon, the 5th of June, I was near the end of White's-alley, Little Moorfields, where I saw the prisoner. I should not have paid particular attention to him, but from a conversation with Mr. Russell. I request to be informed, whether it is necessary to state the circumstance of that conversation, or only such parts of the prisoner's behaviour as I observed.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not necessary to state the conversation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fernie. In consequence of the conversation between Mr. Russell and me, I observed the prisoner coming from White's-alley, as it were from the Popish chapel, which was then demolishing by the mob. Mr. Russell, alluding to him, said,</p>
               <p>"That is the person I spoke to you about; to satisfy you, I will call him by name." Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130096"/> Russell called him twice by name; the second time the prisoner turned round, and looked at Mr. Russell. Mr. Russell said,</p>
               <p>"Martin, have you turned your coat to pull your own house down?" He said,</p>
               <p>"No." He appeared confused, and went away at the head of the mob, who followed him. I observed at passing us, he had a weapon in his hand, but of what materials it was formed I cannot pretend to say; his hat and coat were covered with a whitish dust.</p>
               <p>What kind of dust do you mean? - If I must mention the idea that struck me at the time, I took it to be the dust of a demolished building.</p>
               <p>Were the mob making a great noise and a riot at that time? - They made a considerable noise; it was enough to make me conceive it a riotous one.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 5th of June, between the hours of five and six in the afternoon, I was in White's-alley, Moorfields; I saw the prisoner pass by at the head of a mob; he seemed full of spirits; he had an iron bar in his hand like the bar of a window. His hat and clothes were covered with dust like that of mortar. What made me take particular notice of him was, Mr. Russell called to him, Martin, what have you turned your coat, to pull your own house down.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the Monday I went out with a few friends; in the afternoon I was informed they had pulled down the chapel and house in Rope-maker's-alley, Moorfields. I got into Little Moorfields; when I had got there there was a young man who had something of a bar in his right-hand; he threw down the bar, and went into the house. I afterwards took the bar up and walked with it in my hand up to the ruins only to look on; I afterwards returned. Mr. Russel halloo'd out to me, Halloo, Martin, have you turned your coat, to pull your own house down? He delivered me up to the mercy of the mob; the mob took the bar away and were going to destroy me. I boarded at the same table with Mr. Russell; went to the same place of worship for three years during the time I served Mr. Russell. I have sufficient witnesses to my character.</p>
