                  </hi>. I am a licensed caiman and Custom House agent, of 4, Upper East Smithfield—I keep an account at the head office of the London and Westminster Bank—the prisoner has been in my employ as a clerk for some years—his duties were principally outdoor, collecting accounts, paying bills, etc.—he did not keep a petty cash book—he had to account for what cash he received—on 10th April I gave him notice to leave on that day fortnight—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my cheque-book—on 1st January last I commenced to draw a cheque, and put the date on the counterfoil, and then discovered that the cheque itself was missing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I made inquiry about it of the prisoner and my son, and looked everywhere for it without success—on Saturday, 24th April, the men were paid, and practically the work of the office was done about 8 o'clock that evening—I was only waiting to have the petty cash settled up—the prisoner said, "You need not wait for the petty cash sir, I will come in on Monday morning and settle it"—I said, "Very well," and left—I was there between 10 and 11 on Monday morning, and found the prisoner there—I said, "Alfred, will you settle up the cash)"—he said, "No, I can't now, sir, I left it in my coat at Bow (that was where he lived), but I am going home to dinner and I will bring it up in the after<lb/>noon"—he did not do so—I understood he did call on the 27th, but I did not see him—I first saw this cheque on Thursday the 29th—the signature "Thomas Stones and Co." is not mine—it was not drawn by my authority—to the best of my belief the whole of the cheque is in the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing, with the exception of the signature, I cannot speak to that—after I had received the cheque I sent for the prisoner's father and showed him the cheque, and also this order-book in the prisoner's handwritings which he compared, after which he made a communication to me—on the following Monday the prisoner came to the office—he said, "My father</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280004"/>
               <p>tells me that you say I have forged a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—I said, "I have not said you forged a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, some one has, because 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been drawn out of the bank, which I did not draw a cheque for"—he said "Well, I know I have never done it"—he said he was going to Kingsclere; and he could be found there if he was wanted—he has not accounted to me for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Harrison and Johnson on 24th April-no such sum was entered in the book as having been received—nor 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Austwick and Webb, or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from T. and D.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This case was heard at Guildhall three times, first before Mr. Alderman Fowler, and subsequently before Sir Thomas White, and Sir Benjamin Phillips came in afterwards and Sir Thomas White con<lb/>ferred with him—the charge was dismissed—the counterfoils and cheques bear the same numbers—this one is No. 166,173—I did not stop the cheque at the bank—I sometimes carry a blank cheque in my pocket, and so does my son—it is part of our business to do so—I have always thought that the whole of the cheque except the signature was in the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing—when I was first examined before the Magistrate I said the date was in the prisoner's writing—on the second occasion I said to the best of my belief the words "forty pounds" were his writing, and the figures also—I did not then include the word "self"—I wanted to get away on the Saturday evening—I said before the Magistrate that I only showed the prisoner father the date of the cheque, that was for him to compare with the writing in the book—I said to the father that I would let the matter rest for 48 hours—I did not say I would settle the matter for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Will you give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this cheque"—he declined to do so—my son kept the petty cash book—at times the petty cash was short—I have had to complain of it—the book is here—sometimes I filled up cheques, some<lb/>times my son, and the prisoner—I believe my son was in the habit of carrying the petty cash about in his purse—I have heard that he was sometimes in the habit of spending the petty cash for his pleasure—I did not know it then—I know it now; he has said so—the cheque-book was kept in an open drawer in the office—there were no other clerks—there was a little lad a messenger—there were persons to clean the offices—there was always some one there—the office was never left—Mr. Johnson was not in the office at this time—he was there some part of the time with the prisoner—the prisoner was between seven and eight years in my employ—I am not prosecuting any indictment against him—I am here as a witness—I have given no authority to prosecute him for embezzlement—there was no committal by the Magistrate on any charge whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have nothing to do with this prosecution—the bank are prosecuting—immediately I found this cheque was passed to my dehit I communicated with the bank authorities, and they at once took the matter in hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and assist him in his business—on the afternoon of 27th April the prisoner came to the office—I spoke to him about some accounts, those of Harrison and Johnson, T. and D. Henry, and Austwick and Webb—I asked him if he knew anything about them—he said yes, he had collected them and paid them in on the 24th—I asked why they were not through the bank—I then had the pass book before me—he then said he did not pay them in</p>

               <p>on the 24th, it was the 26th—I then asked if he could explain why they were not through the bank then—he said he could not—I took down the accounts at his dictation on this paying-in slip—he then paid me the balance of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of petty cash—in consequence of what was said to me the pass-book was taken to the bank and it was returned to us, and I found we were credited with the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the forged cheque was in the pocket and put to our debit—I believe the 27th April, 1880, on this cheque to be the prisoner's handwriting, also the word "self" also the word "pounds"—I cannot say as to the "forty" or the signature.</p>

I am an expert in handwriting—I have had this cheque and other documents placed before me by the bank authorities for the purpose of comparison—among other things this order-book—to the best of my belief the "27th April, 1880," on the cheque, is in the same writing as that in the book—I say that the whole cheque is in the hand<lb/>writing of one and the same person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say that of the whole cheque, signature and ail—my belief as to handwriting has not always been right—I don't know that. I was wrong in Sir Francis Truscott's case—Mr. Netherclift and I have differed perhaps in one case out of 50—I have looked at the "f" on the top of the cheque and that in the book—they are not the same, and for a very good reason—they are written by the same person but in a different hand—the in "hundreds and these in "pounds" are as different as can he—these in "hundreds" is such ans as the defendant frequently makes—the 8 in "pounds" is the habitual 8 of the prisoner, exactly as he forms it—the handwriting of the cheque is not like the prisoner's—some of the letters are like his—the prisoner makes some letters like the prosecutor and his son, and he makes certain letters alike—with a little distinction there is a family resemblance in some of the letters, not in all—I do not think these is a letter in which there is a likeness.</p>

               <p>handwriting of the prisoner; I have also had acknowledged hand writing of the prisoner placed before me—taking the order-book as the basis, and looking at the cheque, I still say it is in the handwriting of the prisoner—I it is a very careful imitation of the prosecutor's handwriting; it has first of all been drawn in pencil, and must have been copied from a cheque written by the prosecutor—whoever wrote the cheque must have had possession of it for some time; it is a servile copy; every letter, every figure, is formed precisely in the same way as the prosecutor forms his, with perhaps one exception, the 7 in 27th April; I don't find a 7 formed in that way either by the prosecutor or his son—I find in the order-book several instances of a 7 like that, by the prisoner—then the "I" in "April," and the "d" in "pounds" has all the characteristics of the prosecutor's I and d—those are the things which lead me to give my opinion to the best of my belief—I cannot in such a case as this cheque <hi rend="italic">give</hi> an absolute opinion that it is the prisoner's handwriting, but I give it from certain minute particulars, and from the general handwriting in this book.</p>

On Monday evening, 10th May, about 8.15, my attention was called by some boys to No. 20, Clarendon Street, Pimlico—it is a private house—the first floor window curtains were in a very great blaze—the street door was shut and the area gate wide open—I went down the area steps and into the house—the door below was open—I went up into the first floor front room; the door was open—I did not</p>

Fluke was the chief accountant—I did not seo him in a state of hopeless intoxication in June, 1875—he was able to stand upright; he was under the influence of drink to some extent—it is perfectly plain from this letter that money is demanded from mo—you demand 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. compensation—the letters of the 18th and 20th were sub<lb/>mitted to the Board—the Directors were there daily, and the Board met on Tuesdays—any one who reads the letter would conclude that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was demanded from the bank for the purpose of withdrawing the charge—there are no imputations against your character in the Directors' letter—the real cause of your being dismissed was that the bank did not appreciate you so highly as you appreciated yourself—I do not remember that on 5th March, the day before the Board meeting, Mr. Cross tried to induce the Board to dispense with your services the next day—I do not know that Mr. Cross and you were on very bad terms—it is evident from your letter that your object was to extort money under a charge of perjury.</p>

               <p>may be fragments of truth in some of the charges, but everything is greatly exaggerated in the circular—all the Directors well knew of his application to inspect private documents at the bank—he also required to inspect the list of shareholders because he had not taken up the copy—he never told me that he had been to the Mansion House on 4th May, and had been refused.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—he was a foreman tailor—I now live at Hollywood Road, Kensington—on 17th March last I left him, and have since then been living apart maintaining myself—we were then living at 41, Sidney Street, Brompton Road—I left him at that house and did not see him again till I saw him at the Infirmary on the afternoon of 1st June—on the Monday, the day before, I received this letter—it is my husband's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated from the Chelsea Infirmary, and contained an urgent request for his wife to come and see him and bring his son Edwin, and complaining that a previous letter sent to her, enclosed in one to his son Frank, had not been delivered to her.</hi>) This other letter is also my husband's writing, and is the one sent to my son. (<hi rend="italic">This also contained a request for his wife to come and see him.</hi>) In consequence of the letters I went to the Chelsea Infirmary and saw the prisoner—he said, "Have you brought Edwin?"—I said I had not—he then said, "Go"—I went half-way down the infirmary—he followed and caught hold of me and said, "Do come and talk matters over"—I went back with him and we had a conver<lb/>sation about different things—he asked me if I would live with him again—I said I could not think of doing so, as the life we had led the last few months, I could not live with him anymore—he asked me again and again. if I would live with him, as he knew that I had four rooms, and would I make him up a bed where I was living—I said they were not my apart<lb/>ments and I could not do so—ho importuned me so much, that I told him if he kept sober three months and came to me a different man, I might give him a different answer—with that he put his arm round me, and with the right made three stabs at me with this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said some<lb/>thing at the time—I don't know what—I was too excited—some one in the ward took hold of him—he stabbed me once under the heart and once here—that was only a scratch.</p>

               <p>good wages and kept a good home till three years ago, when he left Bond Street—I heard him make a long statement at the police-court—when he was in a situation he allowed me money for homo and the children—he was a good husband and father when he was a teetotaler, but when he was drunk he was anything but that—he was a teetotaler for six year—I have lived at 41, Sidney Street, two years—he said at the police-court that I was too familiar with one of my lodgers—he did not mention any name—there was no truth whatever in that supposition—the 17th of March was his birthday—he went out that day to the public-house, that was all—he was in and out all day from six in the morning, 10 minutes at a time—the last time he came in was about five in the evening—the furniture of the house was then in a van being moved—my lodger and my son and daughter were in the house—he was not locked up in an empty parlour while the furniture went away—he was never locked up at all—he went into an empty parlour and the things that were being moved blockaded the door—he could get out—I heard him say at the police-court, "They locked me in the empty parlour; except an old sofa, everything was stripped," but it was false—he was in the parlour, but it was not empty—I did not leave the house before he got out of the parlour—when I left the house at 10 at night he was in the kitchen—my son took me away from him because he was follow<lb/>ing me from room to room threatening me—he had the full scope of the house to go where he liked—it was my son Frank that he wrote the letter to—I left the prisoner on 17th March—when this happened he must have had the knife concealed on his person—I did not see where he took it from—he walked over to the window on the opposite side of the ward to look at the time—it was not in his locker, because I looked—I did not hear him say at the police-court that it was in his locker, nor did I hear him say, "I wanted to frighten her to get her private address; I had no intention of hurting her in the least; I thought by being locked up I would get her private address"—he asked for my private address when he was in charge at the police-station—I refused to let him have it—I had my reasons—I told him I could not think of living with him after his unmanly conduct and his threats to me—he had no cause to be jealous—I don't know whether he was jealous or not—I don't know that he was jealous of me and the young man lodger—he never complained of it—he was more intimate with him than I was—he was not jealous—there were no words between us about this young man—we had a frightful quarrel, which was the cause of my leaving him—he came home and abused me and struck me because I had not money to give him for drink; that was all—nothing was said about the lodger—it had nothing to do with that subject—am I compelled to give the young man's name?—It is Webber—I have two young men lodgers, Webber and Peel—I don't know which you allude to—Peel is outside—I mentioned Webber, because the prisoner has been going about to my friends and talking about that young man and me—he could not be jealous of him, he is a young man of 23, a friend of my son's—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Wilton Place—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1877—he was then a cab driver—he at first drove me casually and afterwards called for orders—he drove a horse and old-fashioned cab, which he represented as his—I lent him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1877 on the security of his cab, and later on 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—on 9th July,1877, I bought a Royal Forder cab at the Baker Street Bazaar for, I think, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was to keep that with the other cab, and it was to run in the street as a public cab—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month at that time to drive me, and he was to disburse the stable expenses out of the returns for the public cab, and put them down and account for them to me—in April, 1878, I bought two Forder cabs and harness at Wolverhampton for 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were bought to London and placed in the prisoners charge, and on 6th June I bought another Forder cab at Wolverhampton for 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 25th March, 1879, another for 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also bought a sufficient number of horses for all those cabs to be worked, and placed them in the prisoner's charge, first at the Man in the Moon stables and afterwards at the Rising Sun, which is sometimes called the Crown stable—when I increased my stock of cabs the prisoner was to have 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, for which he had to look after the cabs and act as a kind of foreman in the cab business—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

The endorsements to these cheques (produced) are in the prisoner's writing—I am not sure about the writing on pages 3 and 8 of this book (a memorandum or betting book), but I believe pages 37 and 38 are the prisoner's writing—I believe this is also his-writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was not suggested on the last trial that the prisoner said to me in Wilkinson's presence that he wanted some money to pay a bill of sale—it is not true that he has asked me for money and I have refused—the only thing I refused him was a loan to let him go into the horse business on his own account—that was last summer—he wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—I was frequently out of London, and I then used to pay his wages before I left or when I returned—this book is entirely In his writing—he never made any claim for wages in the book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a receipt for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I have paid for rent—it is down in his book as having been paid by him.</p>

               <p>money—I fetched it, and he drank it—about a quarter of an hour afterwards he sent me again for a half-quartern of gin, and live or ten minutes after that I again fetched another half-qunrtern, all of which he drank—on each occasion he gave me money for it, and I brought him change—at first he gave me sixpence—it came to twopence-halfpenny, I brought him the change—the second time he gave me a two-shilling piece, I brought him the change—the third time he gave me sixpence—when I returned the last time I saw a half-pint bottle on the table with more gin in it, and half of that I saw him drink also—I then went on with my work, and about five minutes after I looked into the parlour and saw the half-pint bottle lying on the table empty—the prisoner was there—he then ran upstairs and came down again and went across to Mr. Nice's shop—he shortly after came back into the shop and began throwing the bread about in a wild sort of manner—some customers came in, and he served them, some right and some wrong—this was about 6.45, and I went downstairs to my work—about 7.45 I was packing bread in the shop, and about eight, or five minutes past 8 I heard the report of a gun from the parlour door at the back part of the shop—I turned round and saw the prisoner with the gun to his shoulder—Mrs. Sweetland then ran through the shop into the street shouting "Murder!"—that was after the second shot had been fired—the first and second shots were instantaneous, one after the other, bang, bang—before I had time to get across the shop he fired two more shots in rapid succession, one after the other, bang, bang—he was then standing behind the counter—I did not notice in which direction the gun was pointed—he fired over the mistress's head—he then walked out through the shop on to the pavement and said "Where is there a policeman? where is there a policeman?"—then as I walked through the shop I saw the guns standing in the corner, near the parlour door, about as far as I could reach—two men came up who are witnesses, and took the prisoner away to Highgate—I went back into the shop, and then it was that I saw the deceased, Mr. Buckler, staggering in the road, and I saw him fall—I had not seen him that morning until then—he was a provision merchant, living at No. 2, opposite the prisoner—sometimes the prisoner would drink gin and some<lb/>times half a pint of beer in the morning between 6 and 7—on Friday, 21st, he went to Harpenden races—I did not see him that night.</p>

               <p>into a lunatic asylum—he would talk to his wife and others in a wild gay at times; that was when he was under the influence of drink—when sober I saw strangeness of manner—I remember in October last his meeting with another accident in Camden Town—doctors attended him and bandaged his head; ice was applied to it—since that accident I have heard him complan of pains in his head, and he would sometimes forget what he had been doing, and stand and think a minute or two—that was when he was sober.</p>

If you cause a disturbance like this you will get yourself into trouble, and get locked up"—he made no answer; he walked straight through his shop into the back parlour—his wife was in the shop behind the counter—there were several persons about the street standing at the corner of the lion—I did not notice any one in particular, only Mr. Buckler's son; he was standing close to his father at the time of the altercation—that was all I saw—I went on and did not see the prisoner again—later on in the same morning I heard that Mr. Buckler had been shot—the prisoner seemed very excited; I did not know whether he was sober; he stared at me vacantly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Samuel Warr Buckler, and was living at No 2, Junction Road, Holloway, there with my father and mother-my father was 45 years of age-about 12 o'clock on the Friday night, before this matter occurred, I heard a knocking at the door—I was in bed—I could not hear who it was—my father got up; I saw him go downstairs to the door—he did not open the door—I did not hear him say anything—he then returned upstairs—he did not tell me anything—about 4 o'clock in the morning I heard another knocking at the door—I did not get up nor did my father—I did not see him up—that was all I heard that night—I heard somebody in the street on the second knocking; I could not hear who it was—I got up about half-past 6 that morning—about 7 o'clock I was on the pavement outside our shop with my father—the shop was not open—the prisoner came across the road to my father—I did not notice how he was dressed—I did not notice anything particular about him—he spoke to my father but I could not hear what he said—my father made him some answer; I did not hear what it was—the prisoner said something I did not hear—my father said, "Please, Mr. Sweetland, don't knock at the door in the night, it frightens my wife"—the prisoner said, "I shall do as I like"—he got hold of my father's coat-collar by the left hand when he first came across, and he moved his right hand rapidly up and down—he kept waving it up and down all the time he was crossing the road—he seemed rather wild—I don't remember anything more that was said—there is a corn chandler's (Mr. Hazell's) near there—when my father asked him not to knock at the door, the prisoner said he should do as he liked, and pointed to Mr. Hazell's door and said, "Why don't you keep yourself quiet like this man?"—nothing more was said—the prisoner and my father were together about a quarter of an hour—I don't think other things were said that I do not remember—they were talking together quietly—I did not hear any more than I have stated—when the prisoner left my father he went across to the other side of the road and went into his own shop—about five minutes' afterwards I saw him leaning across his own counter reading the newspaper—that was between half-past 7 and 8—the prisoners shop was open at that time; the shutters were down then—I don't think they were down when he first came across to my father—my father was then standing outside his shop—it is not an open shop—it has windows to push up and down—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till he was being taken up to the station—on the Wednesday evening in that same week I saw my father put up the shutters to the prisoner's shop—there was a crowd there—I did not see the prisoner then—that was about half-past 9 at night—I did not see the prisoner's wife there—no one asked my father to put up the shutters; he did it of his own accord—there was a noise inside the house; I could not tell what sort of a noise it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living with my late husband for about four years in the Junction Road—the prisoner and my husband were on speaking terms as far as I knew—on the Wednesday evening before this matter occurred I remember my husband going over to the prisoner's shop about 9.30—there was a disturbance there—I was putting my children to bed—I did not actually see my husband go over; I saw him when he came back, about 10 o'clock, and he told me when we were having supper that there had been such a scene—on the Friday night about 12 or a little after, when I was in bed, I was disturbed by a very loud knocking at the door—my husband went down at my request—I don't know who it was that was at the door—my husband came back after a little time—he told me that ho did not open the door—I afterwards again heard a knocking at the door—I did not look at the clock, and don't of my own knowledge know the time; I should think it was about break of day—we did not get up; it was Saturday, and I did not think it worth while to disturb my husband again—on the Saturday morning ho got up about the usual time and left me asleep—he usually got up to open the shop—I heard nothing unusual until I heard the report of the firearms—I was then in my bedroom, dressing; that is a front room—I sup<lb/>pose it was just about 8 o'clock as near as possible—I heard a very loud report of firearms; it was like a double report, one after the other, very loud—I went to the window and looked across the road—I kept my eyes fixed there, wondering what I should see, and I saw Mr. Sweetland walk deliberately out of his shop—he had a gun—I saw him level it and take a very deliberate side aim across to our shop, where my husband was standing—the gun was to his shoulder for some time, pointing slanting across the road to our shop—he was outside his shop—there is a flagstone that just forms a step to his own door, and he was just outside that—he took a deliberate aim; I could not believe he was shooting—he fired just the same as before, a double report—I could not see my husband then, because there is a blind to our house—the prisoner then went indoors—I was so agitated that I could not say whether he took the gun with him—I then heard my son calling to say that his father was shot—I at once ran downstairs and saw him being carried into the shop—he was frightfully injured—a doctor was sent for, and my husband died at 2 o'clock on the following Monday afternoon—I saw nothing more of the prisoner—my husband had compounded with his creditors and paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound two years ago last April</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's stepson—Mrs. Sweetland is my mother—I shall be 14 years old on 19th July—I was living with the prisoner and my mother at the baker's shop in the Junction Road—I was at home on the Wednesday evening before this occurred—I should say the prisoner was drunk that night—he had been out during the day—he said he had been to Whetstone, shooting—he came home drunk about 8.30. or 8.45—after he came home he was noisy inside, and a crowd came, and Mr. Buckler came and put up the shutters—I helped him-—I handed the shutters to him and he put them up for me—I could not tell whether Gay was at home or whether he was gone to bed; he was not present—the place was shut up and the prisoner remained in the house, but he went out afterwards—I did not go out with him—on the Friday night I was at home when he came home, about 10.30—he was very excited—he had told me in the morning where he was going, and that was where he had been, to Harpenden races—when I went to bed that night I left him up and indoors—he was very excited when he came home; he seemed as if he did not know exactly what he was about; he was in such a state I could not say whether he had been drinking or whether there was anything the matter with his head; but he was very excited, running on about his horse and the races—he had been with his own horse to the races, driving—he had been driving very fast to all appearance, from the state the mare was in—I knew that he had two double-barrelled guns, breech-loaders—he usually kept them in a recess on the stairs, in a cupboard that was fitted up for harness specially; the guns were generally kept there—I could not say when I had last seen them there; the cupboard is upstairs on the first floor—they were not a ways kept there, sometimes he has left them in the parlour sometimes at the bottom of the stairs, sometimes in the kitchen—the last time I saw them they were in the parlour, standing in the corner of the room; that was on the Thursday to the best of my recollection—he had not been out shooting that day—I don't remember seeing them on the Friday—on Saturday morning, 22nd, I saw the prisoner in his shop, standing at the door, with his hands behind him; I had not been up long; that was when I first saw him—the shop was open then and he was dressed as usual—I was standing behind the counter; he went into the parlour and returned with a gun in his hand, put it up to his shoulder, and fired two shots in rapid succession, instantaneously, bang, bang—he fired out of the door in the direction across the road, as it looked to me—he had the gun to his shoulder in the ordinary way—my mother ran out when she saw the gun, she is frightened at firearms—I don't recollect her calling out—she ran out of the shop into the street—I followed her after he had fired—when I got outside I heard two more shots fired—I had then got very near two doors off I should think, but I was confused, I don't exactly remember—my mother was away from the shop in front of me, a little lower down the Junction Road, that would be to the left—I then turned round and saw the deceased stagger and fall; he was a little way off the pavement, near his shop, in front of it—I heard the prisoner say something about police or policemen; it sounded like that; I very in<lb/>distinctly heard it—I turned round to see where he was aid two men</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Lion—on Saturday morning, 22nd May, I was there at work in the back; I heard some shots fired; I heard one first, and I ran out—I heard the four shots fired—I saw Lack; he had got hold of Sweetland by the collar on the right aide—I went and assisted him, and took him by the left cuff; the first thing I heard him say as he went along was "I have kissed my dear babe before I left," or something to that effect, and in going a little farther up the hill I fancied he had got something in his breast-pocket, and I said "Hare you a revolver in your pocket, Sweetland?" because I had known him some time—he said "No, I have not, Charlie; I will give you all I have," and he gave me four small bags with a portion of flour in each; I should say about a pound and a half altogether, or it might be two pounds—he pulled them from the back part of hit pocket—he said he had got them to throw at him to aggravate him—I then said "What have you here?" that was in his right-hand waistcoat pocket—he said "Two cartridge?"—I said "Give them to me"—he took them from his right-hand waist<lb/>coat pocket, and placed them on my hand, and I passed them to Lack—the prisoner said "I have done what I meant to do, and I don't care if I swing for it"—that was after I had handed the cartridges to Lack—I said "Hold your tongue, hold your tongue"—after he had given me the bags, he said "Here is a letter I wish to be carried to home"—I said "You had better put it in your pocket, and give it up at the station-house"—he put it in his pocket, and he had it in his waistcoat pocket in the station-house—he also said "He has done me an injury, and I have not done the dirty action that he has done, to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound"—that remark about the swinging was mentioned three different times during the transit up to the station—he appeared to be rather excited—he appeared like a man that had been drinking the night before—he was able to walk steadily, as well as I could—I think he appeared to under<lb/>stand what he was doing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the first time I have given evidence—I did not give evidence before the Coroner, or before the Magistrate—Lack accompanied me and the prisoner to the station; he was with us all the time—I made a communication to the Solicitor to the Treasury—I only saw him once—I gave a little abstract of my evidence; I wrote it down in my own hand in pencil; I only wrote it once—I did not gave it to any one; I have it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I wrote this on Sunday after<lb/>noon, the day after, the 23rd—I have had it in my possession ever since—in this piece of paper I communicated all I recollected as near as I possibly could—I saw the Solicitor to the Treasury on the 7th June—that was the first and only time—I did not see the Solicitor, merely the Clerk—I road to him from my paper; I neither added to it or diminished from it—what I have said to-day is precisely what is on that paper—I do</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The memorandum was read as follows</hi>:—"Between 8 and 8.15, Saturday, 22nd May, I heard two reports, I ran from my work, before I got to the door I heard two more. I looked out, and saw Mr. Bnckler rolling in the road, about eight feet from the pavement. Mr. Lack called me to his assistance; he then had him on the right side collar. I took the prisoner by the cuff, and said, 'Come along.' In going up Highgate Hill I thought he looked bulky; I said, 'Have you a revolver in your pocket?' He said, 'No, you shall have all I have got.' He gave me four bags with flour in them. I said, What have you here?' He said, 'Two cartridges.' On three occasions he said, 'I have done what I meant to do, and I do not care if I swing for it.' He went quiet from his shop to the police-station at Highgate, and we gave him in charge to the police. 'He has done me harm; I never done dirty actions, and paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound. I meant to throw the flour at him to aggravate him.'" He made that remark just after he offered me the flour bags—I put that in afterwards when I recollected it, but on the same day, within a few seconds between 3 and 4 o'clock, after we had shut our house up; the whole of it was done that Sunday afternoon—I have not heard Lack's evidence—I did not hear the prisoner say "I saw him come out with a knife, and I thought I would have first chance"—I have heard that it was said, but I did not hear it—I and Lack were with him all the time—I was walking on the left side of him and Lack on the right—the prisoner was very much excited—I cannot say whether his eyes looked wild, like a man not in his senses—I took more particular notice in looking after his body, in case of an accident on the road—I think what he said about, his coming out with a knife, and his having first chance, was said previous to my taking hold of him—I took hold of him before he was being moved along to the station, perhaps some seconds after Lack—Lack had him by the collar when I came out—Lack called me—I have never given evidence before in a case. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What caused you to take this down; it is rather an unusual thing, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps it is a way I have, like all old gentlemen, taking notes of anything, any little occurrence that happens; if you were to die to-day I should take that down, I should make a little note of it. I keep a diary of all the events of my life, no doubt this will be a leaf out of my diary. I have not written it in my diary yet, but I shall do. I am the potman at the Lion, I have seen the prisoner there. I have been there eight years and a half.</p>

On the morning of 22nd May I went to the Highgate Police-station, about an hour after the prisoner had been brought there—I found him there—he then seemed calm and collected and sober—I said nothing to him, except to ask him two or three questions to enter on the charge sheet—I asked him his age and his name, and a question as to his education—those were the only three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280054"/>
               <p>questions I put to him—he gave his name correctly, James Sweetland, and his age as 33, and I entered it on the charge-sheet—when I searched him I asked what he had got about him—I found a small sum of money; there was no letter, and I could hear of no letter having been seen at the station—Lack gave me these two cartridges—this one is in the same stats as I received it; the other I opened—before opening it it was exactly similar in appearance to the other—out of the one I opened I took some shot and a wad—I returned them again to the cartridge—I weighed the shot in company with the gunsmith, and the charge weighed an ounce and a quarter—on that morning I went to Mr. Buckler's house and examined the shop—I made a careful examination—I found marks of shot on both doorposts, something like 100 altogether—there were some shot marks on the goods in the shop and on the wall of the parlour at the back of the shop—the greater number of those on the doorposts were between five and six feet from the ground, and those on the wall at the back of the shop were about a dozen in the space of half a yard square—the front window of the shop was broken, and an inner window separating the parlour from the shop was also broken, apparently by the shot—I picked out about 10 or a dozen of the shot—they appeared to be of the same size as those that were in the cartridge—I have shown them to Mr. Sturman, the gunsmith—I also examined the prisoner's premises—I found no marks of shot there—on the morning of the 28th I received from the prisoner's wife a paper bag containing about half a pound of shot, or a little over—she got it from a safe in the back parlour—that appears to be shot of the same size as those in the cartridge and those taken from the doorposts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 10 o'clock when I saw the prisoner—he had not been put in a cell, he had been put in a waiting-room till I came to the station in the company of constable Instance—I think two officers were with him—he did not bear the marks on his face of any great recent excitement; nothing at all that struck me—I looked at him for the sake of marking his condition and demeanour, and it struck me as being remark<lb/>ably calm, I was surprised at it—I searched him myself, as I thought, thoroughly—I found no letter on him—I have heard of no letter.</p>

S.—on Saturday morning, 22nd May, shortly after 8 o'clock, I went to Mr. Buckler—he was wounded on the left side of the head—they were shot marks—at that time I only noticed about forty—I after<lb/>wards found that he was wounded on the left shoulder and the back, on the left side—there were two or three shots in the front part of the body and the front lower limbs—I attended him until the Monday; he died</p>

               <p>about 2 o'clock on that afternoon—on the 26th I made a post-morter examination—I found altogether about sixty or seventy shot wounds, principally at the side of the back, the left shoulder, and the left side of the head; none in the front of the chest; some in the head and face, and I think one in the great toe of the right foot, one on the knee, and one in the left thigh—I took some of the shot out of the body and out of the head—I have some of them here—I have seen the No. 2 shot, they appear to be the same sort of shot—one shot had penetrated the brain, causing severe injury to the brain, and one had penetrated the lung; the skull was fractured in one part into several small pieces—the injury to the brain was the cause of death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the R.C.S., and am surgeon to Her Majesty's prison of Clerkenwell—I was at the prison on Saturday evening, 22nd May, about 6.30, when the prisoner was brought there—I saw him as soon as he was brought out of the van, and had a con<lb/>versation with him—he seemed perfectly calm and collected—I could not see anything in his appearance of having been drinking—I saw him daily for five days—he appeared to be quite sound in his mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw-him about 6.30, when he was remanded from the police-court, he was then quite calm—I conversed with him, but not with the object of testing his sanity or insanity—it is a well ascertained fact that a person may be perfectly rational in his demeanour when talking of ordinary topics, and yet be labouring under a delusion; therefore, unless I had examined him in reference to that particular delusion under which he was supposed to be labouring, in order to search out that delusion, I should not be able to ascertain the state of his mind—I did not on that occasion endeavour to find out the delusion—it is perfectly consistent with medical experience that a man may commit a murder in a state of delusion, and yet be within a very short time afterwards calm and collected; they act on sudden impulses—he did not present the appearance of a person who was suffering from drink, that was my object in seeing him—I discovered no traces of recent drink, or of the state of a man who had recently recovered from drink—he had then been in custody tea or twelve hours; still, if there lias been a good deal of drink they do recover themselves in six or eight hours—in some cases a man can drink a great deal without showing it, and then he would soon recover himself; it depends very much upon the condition of the patient; some drink slowly and never show the effects of intoxication—if a man drank to great excess, not being accustomed to it, I should expect to find traces remaining.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been medical officer of Newgate for 25 years—I have seen the prisoner daily from June 4 to the present time—he has always boon calm and rational—I was not able to discover any traces of iusanitv—I was present when Dr. Bucknell and Dr. Tidy examined him on behalf of his relatives—being charged with murder I examined him to discover whether there wore any traces of insanity, but I did not arrive at it—there are two scars on his head; the upper one is</p>

               <p>about an inch and a half long, and the lower one about an inch long, both taking a direction from behind forward, and about a quarter of an inch apart—they seemed superficial injuries; there was no apparent injury to the bone—I saw him last night and examined him on the subject of his being watched; I had no clue to that—I was in Court yesterday and heard the evidence—I asked him whether ho believed he had been watched—he said yes, he believed he had—I examined him again this morning, and he still seemed to have a very firm belief that he had been watched—I may observe that in our interviews he never said anything except in answer to questions; he answered questions, and perhaps would lead oft' a little, but he never proffered anything—he never before last night hinted anything to me about being watched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is frequently necessary to have a clue to a delusion before I can examine a man—it is sometimes necessary to take him over the general ground before it peeps out—in this oase I had no due to the alleged delusion—it is quite consistent with his having a delusion that I did not discover it—he was extremely reticent on all occasions, and he never suggested anything; he never originated any remark—he said that he felt that the deceased had injured him, but he did not say in what way—I cannot recollect what the expression was—I could not get any<lb/>thing very distinct from him—I cannot tell you what he said about injuring him; I collected that he thought the deceased had injured him in some way, but he could give me no account in what way—he exhibited no excitement when he said that he was watched; he spoke in his usual manner—that is not an uncommon form of donation, but I think it is a delusion of a dangerous nature, I think violence is very often committed under the influence of it—his present calmness and rationality is I think perfectly consistent with his having laboured under that delusion—the fact that by killing this man he had released himself from the watching might operate to calm him—the subject matter of the delusion having gone he would perhaps be more likely to have equanimity than he had before—I have heard all the evidence in this case, and that the prisoner has suffered money loss to what is not uncommonly a considerable amount a man in his position—a loss of that kind certainly does tend tonhinge a persons mind, and they very often give way to habits of ✗ temperance—a man who has trouble of mind will very often give way drinking; that is to say his character becomes changed—the wounds his head were of a somewhat serious character, but of a common enough ✗ ture—I have heard that they arose from being thrown out of a trap on 0th occasions—they might or might not be of a serious character; it would depend a good deal upon the condition of the body at the time of the injury—we are meeting with wounds of that nature in this town every day, some of which prove innocent and some not—serious brain disturbance may arise from a blow to the head, even though it may not appear so—it does not depend altogether upon the wound, it depends upon the concussion, and on the injury the brain has suffered internally—great injury to the brain may be occasioned by a trifling injury apparently—I have known persons half scalped without injury to the brain, and yet from a small injury severe mischief follows, both mentally and physically—in injuries of this kind I think the brain disturbance would be immediate rather than postponed—irritability would be a characteristic no doubt, but I do not that a tendency to drink would be a characteristic—I think drink</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280060"/>
               <p>would affect the brain more if it was damaged than if it was not damaged, it would be more susceptible of disturbance—I do not think a delusion that he was watched would be likely to be the outflow of injury to the head; that delusion frequently arises without any injury or cause of that sort—I have known such cases, but if there was a predisposition to illusions it would probably promote it—I have heard the testimony as to his loss of memory, and to his excitement when sober, and to his irritability of temper—strange conduct is more or less indicative of mental disturbance—a man who does not act with perfect consistency in all his actions is more or less disturbed—a man's memory is more or less perfect—I do not think I can form any opinion from his reading the newspaper for a quarter of an hour alter having been across the road to Buckler and gesticulated and shown general excitement—we have no proof that he was reading the paper at all; it was stated that he was leaning over it, or leaning on it; I think it was on the counter at the time—I do not think that conduct characteristic of a drunken man—I heard that he said when taken "I saw him come out with a knife in his hand, and I thought I would have first chance;" assuming that to be untrue, I should look upon that as an hallucination and delusion; he saw what really did not exist, and he believed that it existed—if the deceased came out with a knife and performed his duties, it would be a delusion to suppose that he came out with it for any other purpose, but the assumption is that he did not come out with a knife at all; it has not been proved that he came out with a knife—if he said "I saw somebody there with a knife going to attack me," and there was nobody there at all, and no knife, that would be a delusion—if you said that the Emperor of China was entering that door to make an attack with a sword, that would be a delusion pure and simple; but if a man came in with a sword, and you were under the impression that he intended to attack you, and he did not, that would be imagination on your part—supposing Buckler came out with a knife in his hand, and the prisoner supposed that he came out to kill him, that would clearly be a delusion if the man had no such intention—I think if one neighbour seeing another neighbour with a knife, they not being at any particular enmity, the assuming that he is going to attack him is a most unreasonable idea—there may be a number of concurrent predisposing causes of insanity, and they need not all proceed from the same source—there is mania which arises from drink, not <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, but some fixed delusion—another predisposing cause is losses in business, and there may be blows on the head, and if it is shown that in the man's family there is hereditary taint, it is very likely that all those predisposing causes together might lead to insanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In a case of a man in mature life, 33, who becomes insane, it is very often quite impossible to trace the cause; I should avoid express<lb/>ing an opinion on the sanity of a man who has an altercation in a passion and five minutes afterwards calms down and reads the newspaper—if a man is thrown out of a cart and has a cut on his head, and after three or four days he is able to attend to his business as usual, I should probably not consider that there was brain disturbance; hundreds of cases of that kind occur in the metropolis—it is not so much the thickness of the skull, but the consti<lb/>tution of the individual and his habits of life—one must take everything into consideration in the judgment of the case.</p>

I am a wholesale and retail wine merchant at 49, Junction Road, Upper Holloway, on the same side of the road as the prisoner, and about twenty doors off—I have known the prisoner since the first day he came in the Junction Road, and I was particularly struck by his businesslike, clean, smart, active manner, which continued for some time—his employer had been in the habit of supplying me with bread for some years—I am not able to fix the time of his loss of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in business—I noticed a change in him about a year and a half ago—I had frequent opportunities of seeing him; for some time past he has been, very dejected in his appearance—I have seen him walking past my door very dejected, looking down on the pavement—when I first knew him, when I spoke to him he always answered in a very bright, clear, respectful manner; latterly he has answered very snappishly, and I chose to avoid him; I thought it best to do so—I was not aware that he was a drinking man—I have seen him morning, noon, and night, and I have not seen him the worse for drink; I have heard that he drank—latterly there was something about him which I did not like; sometimes he looked very wild, at other times very dejected; he generally had his head down; he could not look you in the face; quite a different man to what he was when I first knew him, altogether altered—I have seen him walk up and down the street, evidently with no object, generally moving his hands, and he seemed very irritable and spoke very snappishly—I knew very little of Mr. Buckler; I have spoken to him—I should think they were on good terms from what Buckler has remarked to me—Buckler was a very good neighbour to him; I should have thought they were on the best of terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not heard that he had lost money in business until I heard it in this Court—when he was dejected and looking down I thought it very strange, more than low-spirited; there was a peculiarity about him, very different to what he was before, different to when he was a servant—the business was a moderate one—he married the widow, and he continued for a time after that to be a bright business like man—I did not know that latterly he was in the habit of drinking to excess; I never saw the appear<lb/>ance of it, I heard of it slightly—I did not know that he neglected his business and went to races and pigeon shooting; I had no means of know<lb/>ing; I avoided his company—I did not know much about him—I did not know anything about what he did, or about his domestic habits; there was something about him latterly different to any ordinary person.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Bull and Butcher at Whetstone, near Barnet—I have known the prisoner for a number of years—I have recently noticed a very great change in him; in pulling up and calling for a glass of something to drink, and not drinking it and going away—I think I pretty well know the difference between a drunken man and a sober one—I have at times seen the prisoner the worse for liquor—I have noticed peculiarities of manner when he was sober—he was perfectly sober on the occasion I have referred to, when he went away leaving his glass; he has done the same thing on several occasions within the last three or four months—I never saw him drunk lately, but very peculiar in his manner—about four or five months ago the prisoner drew up to my house about 8 or 9 one evening, in a horse and trap—I can't give the exact date—he was perfectly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280064"/>
               <p>sober—he went into the parlour and sat down, and asked for a bottle of soda and a drop of brandy; he sat there till very nearly 11 o'clock—he did not drink anything, he left it on the table and did not pay for it—just before 11 I told him I must close my house—he said, "I shan't go out to<lb/>night"—I said, "You must, I have not a bed"—he walked out of the parlour into my private bar parlour, threw himself on the sofa, and said, "I shan't go out here to night"—I said, "You must, I have no bed, I must close my house"—his horse and trap were still standing at the door—I told the ostler to take the horse out and put it in the stable, and I went back to the prisoner as he lay on the sofa, and said, "Mr. Sweetland, what do you mean by this? you can't stop here all night"—he said, "I won't go out," and he lay on the sofa till three in the morning—he was not asleep, he said he could not sleep; he was rubbing his hands and scratching his head as he lay back on the sofa, and kept saying, "Oh my head," and he would get up and pace up and down the bar parlour, and then he would go and throw himself down, and when I spoke to him he would not answer—he got up every ten minutes or quarter of an hour—I sat there with him till 3 o'clock, I did not like to leave him, in fact I was half frightened—he then jumped up and went through the back door into the yard, and threw himself down on some straw in the stable—he remained there till my ostler came at 6 o'clock; I sent him to look after him and he was still lying there on the straw; I was not there—he came out after that—he had a bottle of soda and milk in the morning; he would not have anything to eat—if I spoke to him about a certain question he would get to another one directly, he did not keep to one question at all; he did not carry on the conversation; if I said, "Mr. Sweetland, how is business?" he would not answer; he would talk about something else—he did not seem to know what he was about—I have often noticed when he has pulled up at my house he looked very pale, and he has had a cigar and perhaps a glass of beer or sherry, and if I stopped talking to him for about half an hour he seemed to be quite stupid like, and red in the face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have noticed this sometimes at 9 or 10 in the morning—he was frequently down my road—my place is about six miles from his—I don't know at what places he stopped on the road; I don't believe he stopped at many—I did not know that he was in the habit of taking gin at 8 in the morning—he did not tell me where he had been on this day or what he had been doing, I did not ask him—he had the soda and milk about 7 in the morning—he did not start till about 6 in the evening; he remained all day up till 6 in the evening—I was frightened to see him in this state throwing himself on the sofa and then on the ground—I asked him in the bar parlour about 2 in the morning where he had been, and he gave me no answer—I did not ask him when he first came—he had come from London, he was driving very sharp, he always drove up very sharp to the front door; he was known down our way as the "mad baker," because he drove so sharp—he had a fast trotting horse and a dog-cart; I believe they worked the cart in the business—I could not say what business he was on; he had no bread with him—I knew he was in the habit of attending races and pigeon matches—he sometimes had guns with him—I could not say what he had during the day after stopping the night at my house; he would not have any breakfast, he walked up and down the room; he went for a walk with me, and he had a glass of</p>

               <p>bitter when he came back—he mostly had a glass of sherry and a cigar, very seldom spirits; I never knew him to drink spirits, it was diluted with soda-water—he used always to drink spirits diluted with aerated water, potass, seltzer, and soda; that was what he was in the habit of drinking when he came to my place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the night at my house, he was in my company almost the whole of the next day, and all I saw him drink was a glass of bitter, besides the soda and milk—before he went away in the evening he had a cup of tea, had his horse put to, had a glass of sherry and a cigar, and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master baker, of 5, Seven Sisters Road, about 10 minutes' walk from the prisoner's house—I have known him intimately about 12 months, and I have seen him before off and on; his demeanour was very eccentric; sometimes when we were talking on a subject he would go wandering away upon something else in such a way as to excite attention—he was very excitable at the beginning of this year; I drove with him to South Minims; I cannot give the date—we started about 1 o'clock in the day; I went to his house to meet him, and we started from there—he was quite sober, and drove pretty steadily to Mr. Goodwin's house, where we each had a glass of sherry and some lemonade; it took us about an hour to get there, and after starting again he astonished me all of a sudden by pulling up the horse sharp, and saying "I thought that was the nearest way over there," and he pulled his horse's head right across the hedge, and whipped him to make him go over the hedge—the horse went over the hedge, and I took the prisoner by the shoulder, and asked him what he meant—he just turned, and looked at me, and said "I told you this was the shortest way"—I was a little bit frightened, as the horse was plunging after he got over, and we had a good deal of difficulty in getting him back—the prisoner sat still I should think three or four minutes, holding the reins while I got down, got over the hedge, and took the horse's head, and he tried to pull it back; after that we went on steadily enough, and nothing particular occurred, except that he said about half an hour after that "Don't tell them at home what a fool I have been"—I had been reproving him; I asked him what he meant by it, but he scarcely gave me any answer, no direct answer—he hung down his head, and I don't recollect whether he spoke or not—on another occasion I went with him to Barking to a public-house kept by the English quoit champion; we started about noon, and went to see him play at quoits, but there was no match—the prisoner returned with me in the evening by train; he was comparatively sober—I had not noticed any signs of drunkenness in him; he seemed always under a certain amount of restraint in my company; because I was always down on him for drinking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280066"/>
               <p>so—he was in my company the whole time—when we were in the railway carriage, without giving me any notice, he called out all at once, "Oh, Tom, would you believe it!" or something to that effect, and took a spring from one side of the carriage to the other, seemingly imitating the way in which the champion threw his quoits, and he would have been out at the window if I had not caught hold of his legs; the window was down, and he would have overbalanced himself—his conversation was not coherent when sober at times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is between three and five months ago since we went to the public-house which the champion keeps, it is in Barking Road, 10 or 12 miles from Holloway; we did not drive down, we went by train; we started between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day—I believe we had one glass of drink when we got to Poplar Station—I don't remember what it was; his usual drink when out with me was a glass of sherry, or sherry and lemonade, and we were there all the afternoon, and left the public-house, I think, about 9 o'clock that night—there was no match on; there were no particular people there, only the hangers on—Mr. Graham, the landlord, played, and myself; the prisoner and I had some drink there, but not much—I cannot say how much the prisoner had—I did not play with the champion for drink; he is a particular friend of mine—the prisoner also tried to play—the way the champion plays is very astonish<lb/>ing—we took a 'bus from Barking Road to Poplar Station, and then got into the train; the prisoner did not go to sleep in the train—there was nothing particular in the wav he imitated the champion in the train only the fashion in which it was done—it was a third-class carriage—he gave a very poor imitation of the champion; he held up his hand as if he was holding a quoit, and took a spring, and he would have gone out at the window if I had not held him—the champion threw the quoit with one hand, and just a single step, and the prisoner imitated him as far as I could see—that was done quite suddenly—he was at the window when I caught him; there were no other people in the carriage, and he had plenty of room to imitate the champion—we changed at Dalston Junction—when I caught him, I said "If I had not taken hold of you, Jim, you would have been out at the window"—he said nothing; he gave a sort of laugh, and sat down; that is all that occurred, and we came to our journey's end—he was not quite sober—I never saw him incapably drunk—he could always keep his legs—I was always down on him for drinking so much—I had heard about his being a hard drinker, but I did not know it—I was always down upon mm for drinking—I was always advising him to keep from drink—I did not know that he was in the habit of drinking gin as early as 6 o'clock in the morning—I had been to a pigeon match with him once—I had heard that he was in pecuniary difficulties—when we drove down to the Bull and Butcher we only drank at Goodwin's—we were going to his father's at South Minima; we got out at Whetstone at the Bull and Butcher, and then went on to his father's; it was about 2.30 when he pulled up sharp, and said "That is the nearest way over there"—he had his whip in his hand; there was no road that way; that was not the nearest way if there had been a road—we were not larking going along—I got out of the trap, and backed the horse out—he is rather a reckless driver; he used the whip freely at times—he seemed dejected after that, and drove pretty steadily to his father's.</p>

I am the prisoner's father, and am an innkeeper at South Mimms—my wife is living—the prisoner has been very steady and industrious from his boyhood—I recollect his having a loss, and from that time he has been wonderfully excitable—he has taken too much drink at times, but not at my place—he has never drunk excessively to my knowledge—I have noticed a very great change in his mental condition within the last 12 or 18 months—he has always thought me to be his enemy since this occurred—there is no foundation for that—he has shown signs of madness—he was always very excitable; sometimes he would come to my place when I was lying down, not well, perhaps, and he would come rushing out and fetch me out whether I was willing or not, and I had to obey him like a child—that was not observed before the last 18 months, not until he had these falls and hurt his head—he has constantly complained of pains in his head when he has come to our place, and has gone and laid down on the sofa for two or three hours—I never noticed that a small quantity of drink had a great effect upon him, but I have known him come there quite sober, and go with me into the garden or into the fields, and turn quite different all at once, without any drink at all—his aunt died in a. lunatic asylum, and this is the certificate of her death. (<hi rend="italic">This certified the death of Mary Ann Kempe, aged 48 years, from softening of the brain, on 21st July</hi>, 1871)—she was my wife's sister—she was at Colney Hatch and at the Fishton Asylum, at Salisbtly—she was in lunatic asylums over two years I believe—Mrs. Fuller, my wife's first cousin, is in Banstead Lunatic Asylum—she is between 60 and 70—I visited her there last month—her father and my wife's mother were brother and sister—she has been there some length of time, but I cannot say how long.</p>

I am the last witness's father, and carry on practice with him at Millbrook House, Hampstead Road—I attended the prisoner from 7th to 18th November last—the latter part of my attendance was chiefly upon the wife, but I saw the prisoner at the same time—he had become convalescent as far as his injuries were con<lb/>cerned,</p>

               <p>and did not require further attendance—I saw his head—a fall on the head would unquestionably produce concussion of the brain—I have no doubt the prisoner suffered from concussion of the brain—when a man has had a concussion of the brain he is liable to serious conse<lb/>quences, either directly or at a remote period, but it is impossible to tell what results may follow—it does not always depend on the blow; some<lb/>times a light blow will cause it—it does not follow that every concussion is serious, but a slight concussion might lead to very serious derange<lb/>ment afterwards—the concussion itself is not a mental derangement—a slight concussion often leads to serious brain mischief; I mean to serious impairment of the mental powers—a second blow would increase the mental impairment, but of course a man may escape impairment as a consequence of a blow—irritability is a most common result of concussion—these results do not always accompany concussion—I have been present daring this trial—the excitability spoken to by the witnesses may be reasonably supposed to have been caused by concussion—I should think it was so, and if the prisoner was naturally irritable that irritability would be augmented by a tap on the head—a man who had had concus<lb/>sion would be more easily made excitable and irritable by drink, and he would be more amenable to external injuries of any kind—I have heard of the hereditary taint in the prisoner's family, of the loss in business, of the two serious blows on his head, and that he used to drink to excess—those causes concurrently operating would tend to insanity—some of them would do so, and I do not think I could take exception to any one of them—one superadded to the other of course would increase the evil—the prisoner's delusion is a form of insanity, I cannot say a common form—delusion would be likely to follow such factors as hereditary insanity, loss in business, a blow on the head, and drinking—the delusion of a person thinking he is being watched with an evil intention, is common, I should mink, but I am not an expert; it is frequently met with in books, and in madhouses—from my experience and reading it is a common delusion for a person to suppose another is going to kill him—such delusion would be a sign of madness—sudden f orgetfulness, ram<lb/>bling conversation, great excitability, suspicion of injury without ground, belief that he was being watched without grounds for such belief, coming after the four causes of insanity mentioned, would be a sign that the man was of unsound mind—the delusion that a man was going to kill, would last longer than was necessary for the person deluded to pro<lb/>cure weapons of resistance, or it might vanish at once.</p>

I am the Lord Chancellor's Visitor of Lunatics, and author of several well-known books upon insanity—I was 18 years superintendent of the Devonshire County Asylum, also governor of Bethlehem Hospital—I have had large experience—on 22nd June I examined the prisoner in Newgate—I also saw him last night after the Court rose—I have heard the evidence given on this trial—I asked him whether he really thought the deceased man Buckler had watched him, and he said, certainly he had watched him; not that he thought so, but that he had watched him for the purpose of doing him harm—I asked him why he watched him, and he said he was a busy body and wanted to do him harm; and then he varied his words and said he watched him because he wanted to injure him—I pressed him to assign some reason why the deceased should have watched him with intent to injure him, and he could assign no reason whatever; but he repeated the statement with some vehemence that the deceased had watched him with intent to injure him—my interview was a short one—very little else occurred—it was all the way through an attempt on my part to get at his mind on that point—he said he did not at all know why he had done what he did—on both occasions the prisoner was reticent, only answering the questions, not meeting your eyes—I was obliged on the first occasion to make him stand up to the window to see his eyes, and yet he answered the questions sensibly—on the second occasion I came to the conclusion that his answers were those of a man deprived of sense—I have observed the same belief in those who were decidedly lunatics—I was with him in company with Mr. Gibson—I agree with Dr. Claremont that violence to the head producing concussion of brain is a great contributory cause of insanity, and that a second blow would aggravate it if the first blow had set up a diseased process—in my experience of traumatic insanity I have found cases where a slight blow has been followed by insanity, whereas we see in surgical practice the most severe injuries are not followed by insanity (<hi rend="italic">Passages were here read to the witness from Oriesuiger's work on insanity to the effect that the physician often learns from the relativet of a patient, of an accident to the head, which had been forgotten, and that very often the character and disposition changed, and "that in 20 cases great irascibility and anger in manner, even the most violent outbursts of temper were remarked"</hi>)—I entirely agree with that—I have met with many such cases—injuries to the head often are followed by serious results, and they often are not—the insanity may not disclose itself till some time afterwards—pain in the head would indicate injury to the head, but not mental disturb<lb/>ance—a man may become insane from a blow in the head and have no pain—it might be an equivalent of it—pain would be a probable consequence of concussion—in the cases I have known the pain has not been continuous—a person's circumstances is a frequent cause of insanity; a change for the worse being much more potent than a change for the better—those per<lb/>sons in whose families insanity exists will more readily become insane; hereditary influence is a great factor in producing insanity—the facts of giving way to drink, of hereditary taint, of suffering from loss and a blow on the head superadded one to another would most likely produce</p>

               <p>insanity—forgetfulness attends a degree of insanity—irritability, excitement, groundless suspicion, abnormal forgetfulness, in conjunction with the four causes enumerated, would indicate insanity if they existed in any degree; it is a question of degree, whether they exist in the old or young—the symptoms may increase according to the cause, the patient, the treatment, or the suspending circumstances—drink will not improve the state of a man's mind whether he is sane or insane; it would deteriorate his condition under any circumstances—the drink is often a symptom of insanity—it is a part of insane conduct very often—so is sensual extravagance—a very little drink will often make a man very wild who has suffered from traumatic insanity—it is consistent with the conduct of an insane person that he should give himself up to justice, not trying to escape, and express satisfaction at having done it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a bachelor of medicine, pro<lb/>fessor of chemistry and medicine at the London Hospital, and author of "Forensic Medicine and Toxicology"—I examined the prisoner on 23rd June with Mr. Gibson—I spent about an hour with him—I was unable to discover any signs or symptoms of insanity—he was exceedingly reserved, and answered any questions I put to him in the fewest possible words, and never suggested any question other than that I put—I had no knowledge of any special delusion that the man had; I was therefore unable to put any leading question to him—it is impossible to discover a delusion without data, and as a rule an examination under such circumstances is not of any great value—blows on the head would tend to insanity—I agree with Dr. Bucknill that loss in business, hereditary taint, and habitual drinking, and a blow on the head, would be likely to create insanity—there is another factor, and that is horse-racing; I believe that horse-racing is the most unnatural and intensely injurious brain<lb/>exciter in the world—the symptoms spoken to in conjunction with predis<lb/>posing causes would point in my mind to the fact that the man was' not right in his mind—it may not snow itself till the occasion occurs for it to burst out—the delusion which the prisoner is said to suffer from is a dangerous one—I asked him whether he remembered the events of the crime he is charged with—he said he had totally forgotten everything connected with it.</p>

His delusion was thinking he was watched by his neighbour, and that in some way or other he intended to do him bodily ham—I commenced my inquiries with the beginning of his life, asking him every particular, where he went to school, what he did at school, whether he gained any prizes there, at what age he left, and so on—he answered in very few words, and hesitatingly—I do not know about their accuracy—I did not mean that every person who attended horse-racing was out of his mind, but that it tends to insanity—it is different from gambling, in a race the man's mind 10 centred on the horse that is</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a wholesale confectioner, at 98, Houndsditch, with a partner, under the style of "Batger and Co."—the prisoner entered my employ as a traveller, at the end of July, 1877—he had been travelling for a small confectioner—his terms with me were a salary of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, and a commission of 2 1/2 per cent., but not on raw material such as sugar, and what he called chemicals—tartaric acid, essence of lemon, cream of tartar, and dried fruits; on such I was to give him only a small commission or nothing, according to what they sold at—as a rule these goods have a very small margin of profit—there was to be a settlement of the commission account annually, some time after Christmas—the last settle<lb/>ment was on the 22nd March, 1879—I told him when I engaged him that, being in a different position with me to what he was formerly, he would have no commission except on sums which really had been paid over during the time he might be in my service—I said, "If you leave me you have no claim on any outstanding accounts, because we shall have quite as much expense in collecting it as you collecting yours, and you will have your salary until you leave me"—he quite agreed to it—he continued in my employ until the 19th March—before the 18th I received certain informa<lb/>tion respecting certain accounts, in consequence of which, on the flight of the 18th March, I went to the prisoner's lodgings in Beresford Street, Camberwell, about 9 o'clock, and saw him after waiting half an hour—I said, "What money have you collected for us to-day?"—he said, "I will let you know, sir"—he went upstairs and was away nearly half an hour—he brought me down a bag of money, 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I think, and said, "That is all the money I have of yours"—I said, "From whom have you received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280083"/>
               <p>it"—he said, "I am confused as to some names, I will let you know to<lb/>morrow morning"—I took the money and appointed to meet him the following morning at my office—his duty when he received money was to pay it over the same day, or within two or three days—the following morn<lb/>ing I saw him in the presence of my two sons—he took out a little black book, which I then saw for the first time, and read me a list of names and dates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I wrote them on a small piece of paper and at once copied it into this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I left the paper at Mr. Besley's office last night—the sums made up 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and as he had given me 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I entered 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to his own name—I said, "Are these all Hutchings's?"—he said, "Yes, they are"—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "They are not all, and this is not true; the date is incorrect of this," referring to the name of Halifax, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said, "You received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Kursch in February," giving the date which was given me, the 19th February; and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Barrett of Boundary Road, paid him on the 7th March, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Negus, paid him on the 8th March, which he admitted, and said, "It is quite true, I am very sorry, I hope you will forgive me"—I then said, "Now are these all, are there any more?"—he said, "There are no more, that is all"—I said, "Now be careful, are you quite sure?"—he said, "Yes, I am quite sure, there is only one other account, viz., Smith's of Blackheath, which has been tampered with"—that is not the word he used, he said, "confused"—there is no money wrong there, it is only wrong as to dates—I again said, "Are you sure there are no more?"—he said, "Yes, I am quite sure, it was only about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all, I know; I was going to ask you for some money on account of what commission might be due to me, and I would have paid it"—he wanted about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of commission—I said, "You know our strict arrangement, that you are never to keep a penny back on account of commission, but that all was to be paid in, giving the accurate date, so that our books might agree with our customers' receipts"—he said, "I am very sorry, I hope you will forgive me; my brother will pay it all, I am sure"—I shook my head and said, "No, no, nothing of that kind; if I were to do my duty I should send for a constable and give you in charge now"—I again repeated, "Are you sure that these are all?"—he said, "Yes, they are all"—I believed his statement and said, "l am not stopping you going away," and be went away—I afterwards caused inquiries to be made among my customers and found his statement was not true, inasmuch as he had not accounted for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Fuellin, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received on the 18th March from Mr. illsley, and 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. May on the 24th February—on ascertaining those I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These were the largest amounts; altogether I have ascertained the total amount to be 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never saw the prisoner except a day or two before I had his reference—I was referred to Mr. Fry; a small house—he told me he received 5 per cent, on confectionary—he did not say he received one-third of the profit, but from 5 per cent. down to nothing, according to what the things were sold for—it was neces<lb/>sary to sell some things that produced no profit in order to sell other things that produced a profit—I have no written memorandum of the terms on which I engaged him—nothing was said about his having 5 per cent, on confectionary; I would only engage him as a salaried servant—I told him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280084"/>
               <p>why—he had a commission from another house, which I allowed him to retain—I was very careful indeed, and had a very clear understanding with him—I told him "you will have a salary paid you regularly, weekly, and a commission of 2 1/2 per cent, allowed you on all money paid over to us for confectionary; if you leave me you will have no claim for any out<lb/>standing accounts; you will have had your salary, which you did not have at Mr. Fry's"—I said "You told me you earned 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; you must earn more than that to be good for anything; if you do your duty to me, when the accounts are made up at the end of the year, if I find your salary and commission together will amount to a smaller sum than it would have been had you had 5 per cent, on confectionary, I will make you a present of whatever the difference is"—I did not hear Mr. Wontner tell the Magistrate that the arrangement between us was to be 5 per cent there was something taken down in the depositions which was amended—I did not say "After the prisoner was discharged he had no claim on us for commission; on confectionary his commission was to be 5 per cent."—you will find a memorandum at the end of my deposition; so many people were talking at once that wrong words were taken down—no business in our way could afford it with a salary; without a salary it would be a dif<lb/>ferent thing; it is a gross mistake of the clerk's—at the end of my exami<lb/>nation I say "I did not intend to say 5 per cent."—I have no recollection of having said so, and I do not think I did; I have a very clear memory—the business we got through him was only a very small proportion of the general business—the gross amount through the prisoner was between 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including merchandise and confectionary—nearly three-fourths of that was confectionary—the last commission account made out between us was up to the end of 1878, and that was in March, 1879—the commission on the confectionary from the end of 1878 to March this year would be about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last payment was the 10th January this year, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was nothing paid between January and March—I did not say the gross amount of the commission account calculated without any salary would be 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from January 1879; I said more—it is a matter of figures—weekly servants never give receipts for salary—my cashier paid his weekly salary—I have this year's commission account, but not last; I have never had it since the settlement—the wages book shows commission and salary—I took his receipt up to January 1, 1879—I said at the time of the examination of the prisoner there might be an account which I had lost—we had a burglary, and papers were turned out, or it might have been destroyed as waste paper—when I called on him on the 18th March he had several little memorandum-books; I did not read any of them, and he would not give them to me to read—I did not get a book of his which has been referred to to-day—the invariable rule was that he was to give an accurate account the same day, or within two or three days at the latest, of moneys received, and never to keep anything back on account of commission—I do not think a week ever elapsed without his accounting for the moneys—this book I have since heard is the prisoner's property—in the course of busi<lb/>ness, when he paid in money, he did not produce a book to my knowledge; my cashiers would know—there are two or three of them in Court—I have learnt since his committal that it was the practice of one house to put the stamps of the firm on the book he produced when paying in money—I have one house at Ratcliffe—I told him if he found any other accounts to let us</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280085"/>
               <p>know directly—he never tried to see me afterwards—I did not hear that he had called two or three times to see me—when we parted I shook my head and said I would not forgive him then—he said "I hope you will forgive me"—I had no idea of his being in other employment until he called on a customer and made an atrocious assertion that he had been turned away for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he was not allowed to repay, as he would have done if he had seen the principal, and he borrowed money of the customer—my son told me that—I said "This must be put an end to, your obtaining money from a customer on such a false pretence"—he was not travelling for two other firms to my knowledge—when the man was crying he said "I have just earned the first 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that was after he was in custody—I engaged him for the purpose of getting what customers he could with Mr. Fry's sanction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Fry was a wholesale confectioner—he failed in business some short time after—it was with his knowledge that I engaged the prisoner—there was nothing unusual in the mode in which he obtained orders for me—he accepted the settlement of the commission account and gave me a receipt—I got my figures from my ledger—I think the paper was given to him to return after he had satisfied himself—he gave me a receipt for the balance at that time—the amount of com<lb/>mission at 2 1/2 per cent, and salary brought up his remuneration to rather more than I told him he must make when I engaged him to be worth anything—he made no complaint at that time—he had received 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of commission from January, 1879, though the money had never been made up—he received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 22nd March, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on May 10th, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, on the 9th August, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 10th January at his request—there was to be no commission in respect of bad debts or unexecuted orders, only on sums actually paid over—I have ascertained what his commission on all sums received from 1st January to December, 1879, should be on three-fourths confectionary and one-fourth merchandise, and it amounts to 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been paid to him—if this question were being tried in a civil court there would be a commis<lb/>sion account from 1st January, 1880, to 19th March, 1880, which would represent 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that would be on the same basis—he never demanded payment of me after January, 1880, nor did he disclose to me that he had moneys in his pocket—that little black book is his; I never saw it till the 19th March to my knowledge—he then read to me from it the eight items amounting to 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the copy I made I left at your office last night—I find in the book "Bradley 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and after "Whalebone 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," with partial erasure, there is "May 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." without an erasure—then comes "Loderhonse 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." with an erasure—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's handwriting—I think I was under cross-examination at Guildhall Police-court by Mr. Chapman an hour and a half—it is very much reduced in the depositions—I did not know he was travelling for another firm, and therefore could not have said so—during the time that elapsed between the 19th March and my giving him into custody I found out several other cases.</p>

The next date I cannot say; I gave him no receipt nor made any note of it, as I should have done. This is a very sad affair to me, Mr. Stanley. The torture of my mind is such as any earthly being could never describe. My first error, I trust the firm will forgive me this, and give me one more chance in life. I have worked hard since being in their employ, a great deal of uphill work and very expensive, but this does not entirely remove the guilt off my mind.

                  </hi>. I am an accountant—I was appointed trustee of the defendants' estate—I produce a statement of affairs signed by them both at a meeting held at Mr. Woodall's on 20th January—since then I have had several interviews with them, and referred them to the section of the Act by which they were bound to give me every infor<lb/>mation—Bultitude stated that he had given up everything to the receiver, Mr. Waddell, and Rummell acquiesced in it—I asked them whether they had anything which ought to be in my possession, but I never could get any information from them; they declined to give me any—they said that all the particulars were contained in their statement—I asked Bultitude to go through all the books with me, but he put it off; a day was fixed at last, and they attended—I told Bultitude that the books had not been posted since April, 1879, and it was impossible to ascertain what were his cash receipts or the goods obtained, and invited him to come and assist me in making them up, but he refused to give me information; Rummell also refused, but said he had told me all—I asked them about the receipt of money three or four months previous to the failure, but they each said they did not know—I knew of the Alliance Bank; I asked them if there was another banking account, and they said no—I found out the account at the Central Bank quite by accident, through the crossing of a cheque of Mr. Aldridge's—the assets amount to 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the extreme limit, and the liabilities 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among the papers found on Bultitude are some particulars of goods sent to Sharp's Wharf, and the receipts of the wharfingers—I produce the ledger, order-book, stock-book, and letter-book—the last entry in the order-book is on October 28, but I do not know whether it is an order or not—the last account, except F. B. Wheeler's, is in April, 1879—Wheeler's entries go up to June, 1879—the policy of in<lb/>surance by Wheeler mentioned in the bankrupt's evidence is of no value whatever—Wheeler brought an action upon it, and the Counsel threw up their briefs, and the case has not been heard of since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the bankrupts at Mr. Waddell's office on 20th January, 1880—I did not learn whether they had been in communica<lb/>tion with Mr. Waddell, but I suppose so, because he was their receiver—I learned that day that they had placed their books in his hands—I found that a statement of affairs had been prepared; it was handed in at the meet<lb/>ing, and I read it through immediately I got it—I found an account of Smith and Collins, but not what I should call a full and particular account—I read "Holds as security the following dock warrants for goods lying at Sharp's Wharf, 17 barrels of varnish 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," also "Cartwright and Co., Great St. Helens, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Philbrick and Corpe, the day after I got the books, as they seemed very imperfect—I asked Mr. Waddell's clerk if I had everything, who said that all he had had been given over to me, and I got no information from Mr. Waddell—I asked the bankrupts whether they had any reversionary interest or policies, and whether they had given up their banking account, and all their books, papers, shares, stocks, and securities—I asked them at Guildhall whether they had any banking account, and they said "No"—I presume Mr. Ditton was acting as solicitor to the bankrupts at the time I came to know them—the bill of sale to Buck was not settled in bankruptcy; it was settled with me—a claim for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent was made by Rummell's mother, and a distraint was put in—the balance over the furniture was very small; it may have been 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had the furniture valued, and gave her credit for it, and she gave me the difference—I gave Mr. Ditton notice not to part with the dock warrants—I wrote to Mr. Collins and Dr. Smith—Dr. Smith was examined at Guildhall—Kichardson and Co. are the proprietors of Sharp's Wharf, and these are their receipts for the goods lodged there—I went there in February, or it may have been January, and found certain entries—my report is on the file—Mr. Ditton sent me notice of the marriage settlement almost as soon as I was appointed trustee, and also of the bill of sale—I took possession of both houses, and am in possession of the furniture now—nevertheless action had been commenced when I became trustee—Mr. Ditton had charge of it—Mr. Garford is a creditor for over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the account is ruled off in the ledger, as if they owed him nothing, but they return him as a creditor for 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has proved for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; I could not stop him from proving, but I have not admitted his claim; I have seen his books, and they show that the claim he sent to me is a true one, which is for 3,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a solicitor in the City, and have prac<lb/>tised there a great many years—from the time the defendants started in business I have been more or less acquainted with their affairs—I have known Rummell almost from his boyhood—his sister married my brother 15 years ago, and she afterwards became Mrs. Bultitude—Rummell was not articled to me, but he was in my office for some years—he had money coming to him when he came of age—he has a mother, his father has been dead some years—instead of coming to the law Rummell went to America for a time, then he came back and went into business in the City—I did not know Bultitude up to the time of Rummell's starting in business with him—Rummell had no practical experience of the business—Bultitude was for some years in a confidential position with Mr. Garford, not exactly a clerk, manager or something of that sort—at the time Rummell was enter<lb/>ing into business with Bultitude I saw Bultitude—as I understood, Mr. Garford gave them a part of his business, transferred a part of his business only, and gave them unlimited credit—Rummell had a reversion Which wilt be some day of some value—I don't think they had much capital to start with—I think they were chiefly depending on the credit Mr. Garford gave them—I don't know what expectations Bultitude had—Mr. Garford gave them credit up to the very last—at the time of their stoppage, Mr. Garford's solicitor was Mr. Philbrick, who is now the solicitor in this procedure—the claim of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Garford is, I think, part of the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. referred to in the statement of affairs, and in this indictment—in June or July, 1879, Mr. Garford was anxious to assist them by enabling them to acquire the whole of his business and business premises—I believe they are very extensive premises; I have never seen them—it is a very old established business—I found that from time to time they required assistance, and I have lent them small sums, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and so on, which I got back, and then helped them again—about 28th August, 1877, they applied to me for a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and I saw Dr. Smith, a client of mine, on the subject—Dr. Smith sent me his cheque, and I paid mine to Bultitude and Co., taking from them a promissory note for the amount, and I think there was a collateral security for the same amount by Mrs. Eummell, the mother; at any rate, there was a charge on his reversion to the same amount—I think the mother became security for the amount; I think her name was on the bill—she assisted them, more or less, during the business—the bill was at three months, and was renewed from time to tone—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the papers relating to it—I also lent them 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280098"/>
               <p>for Mr. Collins, of Tunbridge, one of my clients—that was paid to them by a cheque on my bank, the same as the other—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Collins's cheque to me, less the discount—it is for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the exact amount I gave them, deducting 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for interest—I think I took from them a bill of exchange for that—I do not know anything of Mr. Cartwright—I know he is a connection of the Rummells, but I never saw him till after this transaction arose—I helped them to enter into this contract with Mr. Garford in June, it was carried out by Messrs. Mark by and Stewart, solicitors—they had to pay an instalment of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I paid that for them, and they repaid me a few days afterwards—it was understood that they were to repay me immediately, as I advanced the money, because Mr. Garford wished to have the agreement settled—at that time the agreement was certainly regarded as a beneficial one; it was to take over the whole of an old-established business—I found that in March they were sued by Risley and Co., in respect of a parcel of goods which had been sent abroad—I received instructions to defend the action—that went forward till October, 1879; it was set down for trial—I was informed by Bultitude that there would be no difficulty whatever in getting the money to carry out Mr. Garford's agreement; I don't know in what way—Mr. Wilson himself subsequently told me he thought it would be worth a large sum—it was a seed-crushing business and oil mills, freehold waterside premises, called Garford's Wharf, with a river frontage of 115 feet—the defendants had large transactions with a Mr. Wheeler—there was a fire on Wheeler's premises; I don't know the date—I was con<lb/>sulted by the defendants with respect to a claim they had against Wheeler—it was settled at 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I took a charge by Wheeler dated 22nd October, 1879; he was unable to meet it; I don't know how it comes to be put at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the statement of affairs; Mr. Waddell will be able to explain that, I think—the non-payment of that money was the substantial ground of their embarrassment—I pressed on the action against the Company on the fire policy as far as I could—there was nothing to make me or Bultitude suspect that there was any impropriety in the nature of Wheeler's claim against the Company; if I had I should not have taken it up—the Company substantially raised the defence that the claim by Wheeler was fraudulent, in the sense that he claimed more than there were goods on the premises—the action was carried on afterwards by Mr. Leslie, so I suppose he had faith in it—I don't know the exact date of the fire which took place on the defendant's premises—I know about the account being opened at the Central Bank in Whitechapel—the defendants consulted me about some bills which they had not been able to meet promptly, and they asked me about the attachment in the Lord Mayor's Court, and I advised them to open a banking account out of the City—in the Mayor's Court the simple commencement of an action enables an account to be attached—there was a bill for 749<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated November 22nd, drawn by Mr. Garford on the defendants, and Mr. Garford called on me with Rummell about the time it matured—that was the only time I saw him—we had a long conversation about the matter, and Mr. Garford took a charge on the amount he expected to get claimed by Wheeler, to cover himself for the moneys due—of course he knew perfectly well how the defendants stood at the time—the banking account in Whitechapel was opened under my instructions—you will find two cheques of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280099"/>
               <p>bank given to me—the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on account of costs, and the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in exchange for one I had given them—there was an action of Risley against them, and there was a correspondence with Johnson and Upton as to a settlement of the expense of a commission to take evidence in India—they had a set off of 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and there was a dispute as to that—I saw the defendants as to the settlement of that action—I had not at that time learnt from them that they thought they were unable to carry on their business; on the contrary, they paid 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in settlement of that claim, and if I had had any doubt of their being able to go on I should certainly not have advised them to pay that money—I had heard the proposed marriage between Bultitude and Mrs. Rummell spoken of months before, but in June I was formally consulted about it—I am one of the trustees of the property, and Mrs. Rummell consulted me about a settlement—I advised that there should be a settlement, and it was carried out—there was a reversion of considerable value, and she had an income, not a very large one, settled on herself and child—Bultitude's furniture was to form part of the settlement—I found there was an execution put in on one of Risley's bills, which they were unable to meet, and I pressed them for payment of the principal due to Dr. Smith and Mr. Collins, and as they could not pay I pressed for security, and they gave me dock warrants on goods which they had at Sharp's Wharf—that was as security for my own costs as well, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not at all aware at the time I got that security that they would be unable to carry on their business; I believed they would pull through; there was no reason, so far as I was aware, why they should not—I was negotiating with Johnson and Upton up to 24th or 25th November to hold over the execution—I asked Mr. Waddell to call a private meeting of creditors—when I found they would not withhold I advised the defendants to place their books in the hands of Mr. Waddell, and knowing that Mr. Philbrick was the solicitor in many matters for Mr. Garth, a large printer, I said, "The best thing you can do is to place yourselves in the hands of Mr. Philbrick," and I took them to him and asked him to take it in hand—at this time I had consulted a gentleman of very high standing, and entrusted the agreement to him, that he might see one or two merchants of the City privately, to see whether arrangements could be made to find the necessary capital to carry on the business—that was from instructions from the defendants—I believe every one at that time thought the business was worth 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I know Mr. Wilson told me he thought so, and that was undoubtedly the impression of the defendants—I think the petition was presented on 30th December, and I must have taken them to Mr. Waddell at least a week before, because the first object was to call a private meeting and explain the position of the matter, particularly as to Mr. Garford's agreement—the meeting was not called—I asked Mr. Waddell to see Mr. Garford and ask him whether he would have any objection to his business being turned into a small limited company—Mr. Waddell proposed a statement of affairs for the first meeting at the end of December—Mr. Leslie was appointed receiver at the end of January—I did not know that any portion of the warrants was unpaid for at the time I got them; I asked the question, and Rummell told me they were paid for, and I am satisfied that he believed they were, and I believe they are now—I wrote this letter to Mr. Leslie, dated 14th February, 1880 (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I was present at the examination at the Bankruptcy Court—no cash account has been prepared.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think five or six charges were brought up at the police-court from time to time, and they all fell to pieces—I have been acting as solicitor for the defendants ever since they have been in business, about two years—the only action that I defended for them I think was Risley's—I don't think they were ever served with a writ till very shortly before this difficulty arose—with regard to Risley, I had notice of trial, I think, in June, 1879—I think the banking account in Whitechapel was opened before the execution was put in—I never saw their cash-book; I never went to the place till after it was in the hands of Mr. Waddell, in fact I did not know where it was—they told me they could not meet Garford's acceptance on 8th November—I was only consulted about one bill of Garford's—the opening of the account at Whitechapel was entirely to avoid the attachment in the Mayor's Court, that was the single object with which I advised it—there was no object of concealment, I think the account will show that, because there are cheques drawn for wages and all sorts of things—I never saw the account till after the meeting—Garford was in liquidation, after this liquidation commenced—it was long after Wheeler's fire that I spoke about trying to form Garford's into a limited company; it was a week or 10 days prior to the petition—I have, the entry here, December 29, that was the day before the petition—the arrangement was, that 2,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid to the vendor by 28th February in instalments of 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid for the good will, but that extends over—it was not intended to pay it down, and that included the lease—I think I heard of Garford going into liquidation after the meeting at Mr. Waddell's—I had nothing to do with Garford's liquidation—I cannot refer you to any entry in my diary that I had directions in June to prepare a settlement; I have looked for it; there is no such entry—I was not aware that Catlin's goods were put into the settlement—I should, not have per<lb/>mitted it had I known that the goods were Catlin's—I knew nothing about Powell's goods being put into the settlement—I had nothing to do with the settlement—I gave the instructions to a gentleman in my office to prepare it, and I recommended that the lady should be advised by Messrs. Wilde, Barber, and Brown—I think I attested one or two of the signatures, and that was all I had to do with it—I wrote the letter of 17th December, 1879 (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I have made out some of my bill of costs; my clerk's estimate was over 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am told that is under-estimated; there is Risley's action, I have never had anything for that—I have not got the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dishonoured cheque of Bultitude and Co. here, I can get it—as to the taking out the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, I knew nothing of that at the time—I have seen one of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and it bears the signature of Mrs. Bultitude before her marriage—I sent this notice of 18th December to the Alliance Bank request<lb/>ing them to hold the funds for my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was the next day that I took the warrants to protect myself—I have been told that they are not worth more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know how much Dr. Smith's were, not enough to pay his debt, I believe, which was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest; he would be very glad to hand them over against his debt—I know nothing of the other security for Cartwright—he is some connection of Mrs. Bultitude, and is one of the trustees—I don't know the value of Collins's warrants; I have not the—slightest idea; the trustee can have them at any time, both Dr. Smith and Mr. Collins offered to give them up—the bill of sale to Buck was prepared in my office—I read it over, because the Act requires it, that is all I know about it—I should not have put in Green and Co.'s goods if I had known of it.</p>

On the 10th June I was on duty in Westmoreland Street, Pimlico, about 5 a.m.—I saw Shea running down the street—he was shouting "Police"—he said to me "This gentleman has struck me with his umbrella"—the prosecutor came up, and said "I have struck you, but not without cause"—I said "I have not seen your occurrence; you will both go with me to the station"—I took them to the station; my inspector heard what they had to say—they appeared to be sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector.</hi>) I was present when Shea was brought to the station, also when Pinner was identified by the prosecutor—the prosecutor was brought in as a prisoner on the 10th of June—Shea had a wound on his head, about three inches long, and a bruise at the back of his head—his head was bleeding freely—I asked him to tell me the particulars—he said "I was going to Peabody Buildings to see a friend named Andrews when the prisoner came behind me and struck me with his umbrella. I ran away, and met a constable, and gave him into custody"—I said "That seems most extraordinary, that a man should come behind you without rhyme or reason and assault you in the manner you have described"—he said "He did do so"—I questioned him as to his movements the previous day—he said "I left home at 10 o'clock in the morning, and was at work all day long at Corbett's in Great Charlotte Street, New Cut, Lambeth, I parted with Mr. Corbett at 1 o'clock in the morning at the corner of Lower Marsh, Lambeth, and the Waterloo Road; I came across Hungerford Bridge, went up St. Martin's Lane to a coffee-stall at the corner of Long Acre; I then went to a coffee-stall farther up; I came back, went along Piccadilly to Grosvenor Place, all the time by myself, I went into Buckingham Palace</p>

               <p>Road to Victoria Station along the Wilton Road, and up Warwick Sheet to Peabody Buildings, when just as I got to the corner of Sutherland Street I received a blow on the head—the prosecutor then asked me if I would listen to what he had to say—I said "Certainly"—he told me he met Shea with another in the Haymarket, that he had several liquors with him, that he went into a public-house in Fleet Street that opens early for the convenience of printers; he began to see what company he was in, and said he wanted to go somewhere to sleep, Shea said he knew of a place at 41, Winchester Street; he went there in a cab, and when he got into the hall he wanted to go upstairs to bed, but Shea caught hold of his arm, and said "You cannot go up there yet; you must go downstairs first," they went downstairs, and one of them ordered two bottles of ale, Masters said he would not pay for any drink, but wanted to go to bed, and seeing he was in bad company he caught hold of the carving knife and fork, and intended to use it to any one who tried to prevent his leaving the house, he left the house, and the prisoners accompanied him, when he got into the main street (that would be Cumberland Street) one of them said "Now is your time," and he received a violent blow on the head, which knocked him down; Shea at first got on top of him, but he managed to get him under, and struck him with his first; feeling afraid of the second man, he looked round, when Shea managed to get on his feet—he also said he heard one of them, he could not say which, say "Now for his watch," and that Shea was trying to dig down for his watch with both hands, and that when Shea got up he got his umbrella, and hit Shea on the head with it, and that Shea ran away, and met a constable—Shea said "It is false; I never saw the gentleman before he struck me"—Masters said "Look at my umbrella, it is covered with mud; he knocked it out of my hand, and also my overcoat; if he had simply come behind it would not have so much mud on it, and if you send for the policeman he will tell you he saw a cab come up to 41, Winchester Street, and saw me go into the house"—I waited for the constable to come in, when I asked him if he knew anybody in the room that he had seen before—he said "Yes, I saw that gentleman and two others get out of a cab, and go into 41, Winchester Street," and turning round to Shea he said "That is another of them"—I then made them exchange places—I let Masters out of the dock, and put Shea in—Masters then charged Shea, and gave a description of Pinner—he was recovering from the effects of drink—he was sure Pinner had said "Now is your chance," but he was not sure it was Pinner who said "Go for his watch"—Shea said in the station, before the arrival of the doctor, "If you pay for the bandaging on my head we will cry quits"—Masters said he would not do anything of the sort.</p>

I am an officer employed by the Great Northern Railway Company—on 27th June I was on the Stevenage platform, in consequence of instructions, in company with Wilkinson and Curran, I saw the three prisoners (not Sisifant) and another man come on to the platform—they went back into the lobby where the booking-office is, and came out again without taking tickets—I saw them get into a third-class carriage; I got</p>

               <p>into another compartment—at Hatfield I received instructions from Wilkin<lb/>son and got into the compartment where they were—as the train was running between Hatfield and Wood Green Slocombe said to Palmer "Keep your lamps open"—at Colney Hatch Palmer said "All right;" he put his body out of the window and looked up and down each way, then turning to the prisoners and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the man who has escaped he said "He is not here"—when the train was running into Wood Green station he said "Look out and see if there is any one here belonging to <hi rend="italic">we</hi>"—Palmer looked out as the train ran into the station—William Palmer said "Shut your mouth"—when the train stopped Sisifant came into the same compartment—that was the first time I saw him—the carriage was full, but he forced his way in and said he would stand, as he was not going far—the prisoners all knew each other and spoke to one another—one of them said to him "Oh, you are here, then"—I saw Sisifant pass a ticket to Thomas Palmer, then he forced his way over to the other side and passed William Palmer a ticket, and the man who escaped—I then saw him pass a ticket to the others—it was broad daylight—they got out at Hornsey; I got out too—I made a communication to the collector—I saw the prisoners deliver up their tickets, and I saw the ticket collector keep the Wood Green tickets separate, as I had told hint to do—he put them in one hand.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am a registered medical practitoner—on Saturday morning, 6th June, I was fetched to 5, patriot Square, by a constable—I got there about 7; the inspector was there—I went to the first-floor front room, and saw a woman on a bed in the corner of the room on the left as you enter—the head of the bed was against the wall, and she was on the right-hand side of it towards the vial looking towards the bed; she was on the left side, on the side next the wall—there is a passage leading from the door of the front room to the door of the back room, and she was on the side next the passage; her head was resting on the pillow turned rather towards the wall; she had a chemise and stockings on, and to the best of my re<lb/>collection the lower two-thirds of the body was covered with the bed<lb/>clothes—I saw blood on the pillow and on the upper part of the bed<lb/>clothes, and there were some spots on the ceiling just above her head—she was quite dead—my opinion is that she had been dead the last three house; the arms and legs were cold, and the trunk had very little warmth in it; it is difficult to tell within halt an hour or an hour how long death has taken place—there was nothing in the room to lead one to think that there had been a struggle of any sort—it was not tidy, but nothing was upset—I was shown the flat-iron; there was dry blood on it—a poker was standing on the left-hand side of the fireplace—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the evening of the same day, and found six extensive cuts on the scalp, which in my opinion were inflicted by this iron—there must have been several blows, six at least; one cut was just on the middle of the scalp over the forehead, one over the left eye but in the hairy scalp, two behind the light ear, and two" towards the back of the head; the skull was fractured in two places; one was over the left eye and the other behind the right ear, and fissures ran from the fractures in all directions; the bone forming the right ear was literally smashed; there were other fractures in the base of the skull, and there was a large clot of blood corresponding with one of the blows—either of the blows causing the fracture would be quite sufficient to cause immediate insensibility—the pericardium, which surrounds the heart, was ruptured on the right side, and the heart was ruptured also—there was considerable bruising and abrasion over the breast-bone, such as might be done by blows with the iron, and the breast-bone was smashed into an indefinite number of pieces, quite indescribable; that must have been done by many blows—ten of the angles of the ribs on the right side were fractured and seven on the left, and there were external marks corresponding—a blow or a weight might have done that—the weight generally breaks the ribs, the cause of death, and rup<lb/>ture of the heart, either of which would cause death—I should say a</p>

               <p>blow on the head was given first, and not the blow on the breast, or she would have been disturbed more in position—the internal origin showed that she was addicted to excessive drinking—all the injuries, might have been inflicted by an instrument like this iron—I took pati<lb/>cular notice that there were no other marks on the hands or arms or about the body than those I have mentioned—the body was lying up and down the bed, from above downwards.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband, James Blackman, was a Salesman in Covent Garden Market, and lived at 32, Derwent Road, Glengal Grove, Old Kent Road; the prisoner lived next door, at No. 34; he is a carman—on Saturday afternoon, 8th May, about 5 o'clock, he knocked at the door, and asked if my husband was at home—I said he was not—he said he would wait for him if it was till 12 o'clock—he then walked to the front garden gate—while I was standing at the door I saw my husband coming towards my house in company with Watson—as he came up to the gate the prisoner ran at him, and thumped him in the nose, then he thumped him in the mouth, and made his nose and mouth bleed, and knocked off his hat—my husband stooped as if he was going to pick his hat up to go indoors, and the prisoner said n Come on, you b—, you have long wanted to fight me, and now you shall fight me; take off your coat," and he gave him another blow, I did not see where, and my husband fell in the road—I went up to the publican opposite, and asked him to stop it, but he did not interfere—my husband took off his coat, and then they fought again—my husband fell down about five or six times; the last time he was insensible—each time the prisoner struck him he knocked him down—he was picked up by two men and carried indoors; he was partly insensible; we partly brought him to—he was bleeding from the mouth and nose—he spoke to me once or twice afterwards, and then he went into a stupor, and remained 00 for three days—he had a fit about 12 o'clock that same night, and another fit at 6 o'clock in the morning, and he never came out of it for three days—he died on the Sunday morning in the following week—he was 35 years of age—he was very intoxicated when this happened—he was walking steady; he never staggered when he was tipsy—he had never had fits before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a hard drinker—he was nearly always drunk, nearly every day—he was only violent to me—he was a very powerful man, about 13 stone—he had a bit of a scuffle with a bricklayer the week before—I don't know anything of the prisoner; I heard that he once had a fight with another man and nearly killed him; his daughter told me so—I have spoken to him, my husband has never spoken to him—he has always con<lb/>ducted himself to me in a quiet, proper manner—I have asked him not to fight with my husband, because he was very stout, and I knew if any one fought with him it would kill him, and he said "If your husband speaks to me I will walk away"—there was a dispute about some of the prisoner's rabbits eating the cabbages in our garden—my husband was very angry; I mentioned it to the prisoner, and he said he would rather have given my husband a couple of rabbits than have had any dispute about it—I once took a table-top to the prisoner to take care of, to keep from my husband's violence—on this very Saturday the child took a lamp in to the prisoner's wife to take care of, and my husband asked her for it, and she abused him—when the prisoner called he said my husband had insulted his wife; lie did not say how—he was in an excited state—I did not hear what patted between him and my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 100, Trafalgar Road, Old Kent Road—on Sunday morning, 9th May, about 6.30, I was sent for to. 32, Derwent Road, where Blackman lived—I found him in bed; he looked like a man recovering from a state of concussion, dazey—also from the effects of drink—I spoke to him, but he never spoke—I noticed his eyes, he would not let me look at them; I tried to, he objected—his right eye was black and ecchy<lb/>mosed, and a contusion over the eyebrow, such as might be given by a man's fist; there was no blood, the skin was not broken—I attended him afterwards once or twice a day—the back of his head was in a bruised state, a little bit blue and yellow, from extravasation of blood under the scalp; it was a simple-looking bruise, it was a bad one, exactly such as might be occasioned if he was knocked down and fell on his head—he never spoke sensibly while I attended him—I was not present when he died—I saw him late the night before, he was then in epileptic fits, I might say he was dying—the injury to the head brought on the fits—concussion comes on at once upon the injury, but the effect gets worse after a little interval—by direction of the Coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and made these notes at the time—he was a well developed man, big and powerful, and stout—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances were well marked—the brain was ia a highly con<lb/>gested state; there was no fracture of the skull—there were several small clots about the brain, from rupture of the cerebral vessels—there was a larger clot in the right hemisphere; there was a great deal of effused serum on the brain, and this clot was under the dura mater—the other organs were healthy, with the exception of the liver, which showed that the man had been drinking—the state of the brain would be accounted for by a vary violent concussion at the back of the head—if he had been knocked down on the Saturday and fallen violently on the back of the head, that would account for the concussion, and for compression afterwards coming on;. it would account for the whole of the injuries to the brain from beginning to end—in my judgment he died from concussion of the brain—there must have been a very violent blow to produce the concussion—he could not have sustained an injury of that kind by merely falling out of bed on to a pail, impossible; I never heard of that—these were very serious injuries—there was large bruise on the right side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bruise on the back of the head was as big as a couple of inches—it was outside the scalp—if he had fallen out of bed on the edge of a zinc pail, it would have made a cut—I should say that could not have caused such a bruise; such a heavy man would have been sure to cut his head; it might cause a shock, it might be serious—he had a great many epileptic fits towards the end—heavy drinking may bring on epileptic fits—I don't think that would produce these fits, it would produce apoplexy—if he received a shock it might produce fits—epileptic fits very often result in death; 100 fits would of course be fatal; we must allow a little for exaggeration—if a man was not subject to fits I do not think the falling out of bed would bring them on; if he <hi rend="italic">was predisposed to them it might</hi>—they are hereditary—I should certainly say that the fall out of bed did not kill him—I don't think it had anything to do with the fatal result—I don't think he had concussion <hi rend="italic">from the fall on the</hi> pail, and I don't think that would produce the clot; that was produced by rupture of the vessels of the brain, brought on from excitement, drink, fighting, and concussion—excitement would help it on—no doubt when he was knocked down a little vessel <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> brain gave way and burst, and that brought on concussion, which gradually produced compression, and the excitement would help it on—I don't think the fall from the bed broke the little vessel—a vessel sometimes breaks from small causes; that would be apoplexy, the man might drop down dead suddenly—coughing might sometimes break a vessel; that would be from previous disease—this man was not emaciated, he was very stout and fat—long drinking might weaken the tissues and make the vessels liable to break.</p>

I said "Yes, sir"—he said "I am an exciseman; I wish to go down into your cellar"—I lifted up the flap immediately, and said "Come on, sir"—he went down and tasted all my liquors—he said the rum was a kind of Madeira or Demerara rum; it was filthy stuff; "I shall never get the taste out of my mouth"—when he had tasted the gin we came up into the bar parlour—he said he could let me have five gallons of the best Jamaica rum, and by his so doing I thought the man was behaving honestly toward me—he then tasted my ale and porter—he said they contained liquor—I said "I know nothing about it; I have it just so from the brewery"—he said he must summon me, but he should act as light as he possibly could towards me—I saw that the man wavered, and I decided sooner than have my house put in the paper to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, believing what he said, and that he was an excise officer—I did not see him again.</p>

On the night of the 25th May, at 7.30, I took the prisoner into custody in Dyson Street—I said "I shall take you into custody on suspicion for representing yourself to be an excise officer"—he said "I have never represented myself as such"—I told him he would have to tell the inspector that at the station—then he went with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not go to these public-houses with any intention to defraud. Several complaints had been made, and as I have been in the public line I was asked to go. It is well known to those who sent me that my experience in tasting ale will tell me whether it is adulterated. I complained that there was water in the ale. At first they denied it; then they admitted they had put a small portion in. I said "You are aware you have no businesss to do so, it is very wrong; in fact the brewers get blamed for sending you bad articles; you ought to sell it the same as you get it from the brewers; instead of that you adulterate it." They acknowledged it and gave me something to say nothing about it. I did not ask for it, they gave it me voluntarily. The witness who went with me does not know that I went into the cellars, In fact I did not, and he has been round since and found I did not go. He went drinking with me all the afternoon. I paid for what I had. I simply asked him to lend me half-a-crown and wait till I came back.</p>

I live at 15, Great Eastern Street, Shore<lb/>ditch, and am clerk to the National Penny Bank, at No. 12—I issued this bank book to a boy named Arthur Turner, not the prisoner, on 13th Nov., 1879—the account was opened with 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the page on which that was entered is now torn out, but it remains on the blotting paper—on the next page there are three entries: of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on July 13, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on August 13, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on September 3rd—those dates are before the book was in existence—I find from our books that no deposits were made after the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the name of Turner—the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has not been withdrawn.</p>
