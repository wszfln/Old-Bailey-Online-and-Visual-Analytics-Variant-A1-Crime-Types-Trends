                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Sheriff of Mid<lb/>dlesex. On the 12th of July I had a warrant from the Sheriff to arrest the prisoner—I went to execute it on the 2nd of September, at his house, at Irongate Wharf, Paddington—he is a slater—I had seen him before—I once had an execution in his house—I did not see him then, but he came down to our office—when I went on the 2nd of September, I found the house-door wide open—I knocked at the door, no body answered—I went up stairs to the front room, first-floor—the door was open—I saw the prisoner and his wife in the room—I told him I had an execution against him from the Sheriff, at the suit of William Marks—I took the warrant out of my pocket, and showed it to him—the. wife said, "You shall not take him"—I then said, "I shall take you"—the prisoner said, "You shall not, I will not go with you"—I told him I was determined to—his wife and him both rose from their seats—the pri<lb/>soner struck me, and struck my hat off—I then went to take him by the collar, his wife came up to me and took me by the hair, and he leaned back towards the fire-place, took a short poker, or round instrument, and struck me across the front part of my head—my hat was still off—I then had a scuffle with them both—we went into the next room on the same floor, in the scuffle, I trying to get him out, holding his collar—(I had collared him after my hat was knocked off—he got the poker while I held him)—he and his wife were trying to throw me down, and he said, "I will bite your b y ear off"—he threw me on the floor, then struck me</p>

               <p>in the eye with his fist—he had dropped the poker in the scuffle—I then called for assistance—I had left Caperton, who had accompanied me, in the yard—I called to him, "Jemand "Murder"—the prisoner then said to his wife, "Go down, shut the door, and keep him out"—she went down, and the door was shut—I cried out several times—the door was broke open, I believe—Chaperon came up, and we both dragged the prisoner down stairs—he would not walk—while we were dragging him down he called out for a knife, and to the bystanders for assistance—he said, "Bring me a knife, and I will rip him up"—he then called for a hammer—his daughter brought one, but it was not given into his hands—we had got him down into the yard—Matthews, a policeman, came, and we took him to the sta<lb/>tion—he struck me at the station—I rode outside a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> going to White<lb/>cross-street, and he kicked me once through the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> window, and struck me once with his fist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Sheriffs officer's man. On the 2nd of Sep<lb/>tember, I accompanied Gibbs to Irongate Wharf, to arrest the prisoner—when we arrived, Gibbs got in—the door was open, I believe—I was five or six yards off—I saw him enter the house—I remained outside—I afterwards heard him call for assistance, and "Murder"—he called <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I went and found the door bolted with two bolts—I broke it open, and Mrs. Hussey was on the stairs going up, which prevented my going up—I got up, and Gibbs was contending with the prisoner—they were strug<lb/>gling together, Gibbs with his back on the floor, and Hussey on him—the wife was aiding and assisting to rescue her husband from custody—Gibbs's head was bleeding profusely—the prisoner was kicking and beating him, in fact he would have murdered him if I had not prevented him—he kicked him repeatedly, and me to, on my * * * and bit me—he said he would not be taken—he would not go—I offered him fair means to go quietly—I tried to get him out of the room, but he would not walk—he did all he could to annoy us, kicking and beating, and his wife assisting him—we caught hold of his arms and dragged him down stairs into the yard—we were then endeavoring to get him away, but he would not—he was kick<lb/>ing, beating, and pulling the rails down—after I hallooed for five or ten minutes the policeman came up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been at his house before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I saw Gibbs go in—I do not know whether' he knocked at the door—I was not close enough to see—I think he found the door open—it was very unusual to be open, by what the officers say—I cannot tell whether it was open or shut—I was not close enough—I was not four minutes outside before I heard him call out—I did not see the door, because it was in a corner—I saw him go to the door, but did not see how he got in—I was within sight of the door—he had nothing in his hand when he left me—I saw no pitch-fork—when I got in I laid hold of the prisoner—we tried to secure him—he was down repeatedly—we pulled him down stairs, hold<lb/>ing his hands and feet—Gibbs held his feet—he might be on the ground at the bottom of the stairs—very likely we were all three on the floor there—we did not kick him there—I never kicked him, nor did Gibbs, to my knowledge, nor hit him—I did not knock him down in the street, nor did' Gibbs—he did not say at the station that he had asked Gibbs to show him his authority, and he would not—it was produced at the station, and read—I never heard Gibbs say he was a blackguard for not coming up with the fees.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn and coal merchant, and rent part of Iron gate Wharf. On the 2nd of September, between five and six o'clock, I saw Gibbs with a dreadful wound on his head, crying out for assistance in the name of the Queen, and "Murder"—he had a long cut on the back of the head, and the blood was flowing copiously down his shirt and neck—I saw the prisoner kick at him and Caperton—he was then on the ground holding the railings—I heard him call for a knife and hammer to do for him—he is a Slater, and uses a hammer—I went for a policeman, fearing murder would be committed.</p>

I was called by Mere<lb/>dith, went to the wharf and found the prisoner and Gibbs holding each other—Gibbs gave him into custody for an assault—I saw him strike Gibbs on the eye—on getting to the station, Gibbs refused to press the charge, saying he could procure bail before the Magistrate and escape from his custody—he struck Gibbs at the station, and said he would not go to White cross-street with him—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was called, and he was put into it with difficulty—Gibbs got on the box—he put his feet up and kicked him through the window on the back, and nearly threw him off the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. About seven o'clock on Friday evening, September 2nd, the prosecutor called on me—I found an incision on the top of his head two inches and a half long—the sur<lb/>rounding skin was very much bruised and swollen, consequently I infer that it was produced by a blunt instrument—it was a very severe blow, such as a poker might have inflicted—the skull was not fractured—it was a blow likely to be attended with serious consequences—the bone of the skull was exposed the whole extent of the incision—he complained of sickness, of violent pain in his head, and giddiness, which would be symp<lb/>toms naturally consequent on a severe blow on that part of the head—I attended him for about a week—I ordered him to keep to his room, to have low diet, and proper medicine—in my judgment it was necessary he should do so in order to avert serious consequences—there was a very extensive bruise on his left eye—if that had been from a blow with a fist it must have been a very violent blow, as there was extensive discoloration of the skin surrounding the eye—I applied leeches to the eye—he was very seriously injured, and until the present day he has occasionally com<lb/>plained of very violent pain in his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he come to you on every occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he did at first—I called on him the two following mornings, and the next morning he called on me and had his head dressed—the skin was cut—from the position of the cut I do not think it could have happened by falling on the edge of a piece of coal, because the incision was on a top of the head, and he could not well fall or be knocked down on the top</p>

On Friday, Sep<lb/>tember 2nd, I was at Irongate Wharf, and saw Gibbs and Caperton come down the yard—Gibbs went into a little stable adjoining the prisoner's house, took a stable fork and put it in the outer door of the prisoner's house, then put in his fingers and wrenched the door—he put the teeth of the fork into the crevice between the door and door-post—I was in the camp shed, by the side of the canal, from twenty-five to thirty yards from the door—I could see distinctly what he was doing—it was between four and five o'clock—he opened the door and went up stairs first—Caperton was standing about four yards from Gibbs when he opened the door—he could see what he was doing—he could not be off seeing—he went in about two minutes after Gibbs—the stairs are very steep—it is like going up a ladder, and not above two feet six inches wide—I did not hear anybody inside call out before Caperton went in—I afterward saw them all three come tumbling down stairs together—I saw them in the yard down on the flag-stones, and I said to Gibbs, if he had broken open my premises and apprehended me in that way I would have served him worse than Hussey had—he was making great complaints and sending for the police.</p>

On the morning of 5th of October, about twenty-five minutes to ten, I saw the prisoner in Lime-street, with this hat in his hand, and these coats on hit arm—I followed him into Bishopsgate-street, and there stopped him—I asked what he had—he said some things he had fetched from a gentleman in Rood-lane—I asked where he was taking them to—he said to his mas<lb/>ter's, Mr. Sayers, in Sun-street, Bishopsgate—I asked him to go with me to Rood-lane, or to tell me who the gentleman was he had fetched them from—he said, "No, come with me to Wilson-street, because my muter is waiting, to go off into the country"—I said he must accompany me to Rood-lane—as we were going along Fenchurch-street, he pointed to a court, and said, "That is where the gentleman gave me these coats, I was to meet him here at half-past nine, by order of my master"—I said as I suspected all along that he had taken the things dishonestly, I must take him to the station—on searching him, I found a skeleton key, a spoon, a pair of gloves, two silk handkerchiefs, a knife, the top of a ramrod, and a lucifer match-box—I went to a person in Fenchurch-street, whose name was in the hat, and in consequence of what I learnt there, I went to the prosecutor, who identified the hat—I then missed the other property—I afterwards tried the skeleton key to the door of the prosecutor's counting-house, and it opened it, and also the door of the room leading into his private apartments—it had been newly filed.</p>

               <p>No. 4 Grocers' Hall-court—I found the two prisoners there—I found a quantity of Bank-notes apparently, lying open on a deak, about two feet from both the prisoners—Banister was standing in front of the desk, and Campbell at the back part—I found an engraved plate in the hand of Camp<lb/>bell—I found four good 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold on Ban<lb/>ker—I gave them to Mr. Fresh field—the notes and plates produced are what I found on the desk—this note is one of them, and these are three of the good notes I found—I asked Banister if his name was Banister—he said, "Yes"—I turned, pointed to the notes, and said, "Halloo, what are you going to do with these?"—he paused a moment, and then said, "I was not going to do any thing wrong with them"—he did not then say what he was going to do with them—I searched the desk, and found a quantity of papers there, one of which was the agreement produced—after searching the desk, Banister said, "I intended to give them to the hawkers as a kind of attraction"—I then asked Campbell who he was—he said, "I am the servant of Mr. Banister"—Banister said nothing to that—I took them away.</p>
               <p>The papers produced were as follows: "19th Sept. 1842. Hartwig and Co. agree with J. Collins, to engrave an exact representation of a Bank of England note, word for word in every respect, as regards the quality and thickness of paper, for the sum of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and to print a cer<lb/>tain number by Friday evening, the 24th of September; and this is to certify, I have received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same agreement for Hartwig and Co.</p>

               <p>Campbell came to me—Hartwig was present—he asked if we could engrave an imitation of a Bank-note—I showed him one engraved as the "Bank of Engraving," and asked if it was something like that he wanted—he said "Yes, only on better paper"—I agreed to engrave a plate for about 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and pull them off at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1000—he told me he came from Mr. Banis<lb/>ter, Grocers' Hall-court, without my asking him—in the conversation he said he applied to me through buying one of our notes from a hawker in the street—he said he would call again, which he did, in about a week or ten days—my partner saw him first—I was called, and he asked me if in<lb/>stead of putting "Bank of Elegance or Engraving," I could put "Bank of England"—I said we could put any thing that was required, but as they were strangers, they must bring a deposit before I could take the order—he said the object was to sell them at New Zealand—he left, promising to consult Banister—he called again on Monday, the 19th of September, at Mr. Hartwig's house—I was there, and we all three went over to the office together—he said he had now come to give us the order, and produced a card of Thomas Banister, merchant, Grocers' Hall-court—he spoke again of the price—I said to engrave an imitation Bank-note well, I should want 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said Mr. Banister would not mind if it was done nicely, after it was executed he would not be particular—I wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, but agreed to take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Whatever you undertake to do must be done by Fri<lb/>day," as he was going to leave Mr. Banister to go to New Zealand, and wanted to take the notes with him—I saw him again in about half an hour—Mr. Hartwig was present—he brought a sovereign as a deposit, and wrote the draft of the agreement produced—the two copies are what I took from the draft at his request, and he destroyed the draft—I signed both copies, and he signed one, which he took away—I retained the other—he promised to call again in two or three hours with a genuine note for us to copy from—in this stage of the business, be<lb/>fore he brought it, I communicated with Mr. Bush, of St. Mildred's-court, the solicitor of the Bankers' Association, who I knew—Hartwig went with me—I fully communicated to Mr. Bush all that occurred, and acted under his and Roe's direction—about half-past two o'clock Camp<lb/>bell returned, with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—this is the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 17941 and this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 74555, is what he brought with the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am positive I have seen both these fives—I made a memorandum of the notes, which I have here—I called his attention to the difference between the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked which of the two we were to copy—he said he would go and consult Mr. Banister, and let us know on the following morning—he asked for his per-centage, and received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as five percent. we were to allow him for any order he brought—I then said to him "Are we not running a great risk?"—he said, "No, I know what I am about, I am no fool"—before he left, he said, if I paid attention, and got it done nicely, Banister, his master, would not be particular to a pound or two—on arriving at the office next morning, Tuesday the 20th, I found him there—he brought the same 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note as he had done the previous day, and asked how we were getting on—I said, "Very well," and said, "Now are you aware what you are about?"

                  </hi>. I am an assistant-inspector of letter-carriers, at the Gene<lb/>ral Post-office. The prisoner has, I think, been in the Post-office about nine years—his delivery is in Palace-yard, Westminster. On the 10th of October, I enclosed a sovereign and a half-sovereign in a letter—Mr. Rus<lb/>sell, another assistant-inspector, was by at the time—I had marked the sovereign and half-sovereign on the 27th of September, and Mr. Russell at the same time marked them on the other side—we handed them from one to the other to mark them—I left them with Mr. Russell on the 10th of October—I had had them in my possession part of the interval—I looked at the sovereign before I enclosed it, and saw that it then bad on it the marks I had made—about half-past ten o'clock next morning, the 11th of October, I went to the house of Mr. Tucker, an upholsterer, in Great Col<lb/>lege-street, near Westminster Abbey—the prisoner had an assistant named Dowries, and Mr. Tucker's house is in Downes' delivery—in the regular coarse, all the letters would come first into the prisoner's hand, and he should distribute to Downes those belonging to his delivery—Mr. Russell went with me to Mr. Tucker's—the letter should have been delivered there about ten o'clock—I saw Mrs. Tucker, and inquired of her for a letter—she did not produce any letter to me—after going to Mr. Tucker's, I went to the neighbouring post-office, No. 2, Mil bank-street—the prisoner had been there to sign his card, showing the time he had finished his delivery—the prisoner had taken the card away with him—this is the card—it states that he had finished his delivery at ten minutes before ten, and is signed by the prisoner—about two hours after I went to the prisoner's lodging in Gibraltar-row, St. George's-fields—I went alone—I brought him with me from his lodging to the inspector's room at the Post-office—he was then asked if be remembered seeing a letter directed to Mr. Tucker, upholsterer, No. 20, College-street, Westminster—he said he had no re<lb/>collection of having seen such a letter—be was then told that such a letter was known to have been in his possession that morning, and it had not been delivered, and that it contained money—Tyrrell, the officer, was pre<lb/>sent, and searched him—he made no objection to being searched—a sovereign, a half-crown, and other silver were found on him—I examined the sovereign, and immediately saw it to be the same which I had enclosed in the letter the previous day—he was asked how he became possessed of the sovereign—he said he had had it some time, and had brought it from home with him that morning—this it the sovereign—I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>coat off—I did not see the money produced—for aught I could discover to the contrary, the prisoner had discharged his duty in the ordinary course that morning—I made the same inquiries with reference to Downes—I found that he had signed his card at a different house from that at which it was his duty to sign it—it was about half-past twelve o'clock when I took the prisoner to the Post-office.</p>
               <p>

The prisoner lodged at my house for four weeks—he left me at the end of August—I recollect the 13th of Au<lb/>gust—his week was up that day, and of course the day following was the 14th—on the evening of the 14th, near ten o'clock, as near as I can recol<lb/>lect, two gentlemen called at my house—I was just going to bed—I am sure it was not near eleven, because I had just had my supper, and was making the beds for my two boys, and they have to get up and go to work at six—I have my supper at nine—the tall gentleman that called left the name of Butcher, and said would I tell Robert as soon as he came home to come to him the first thing in the morning—the other gentleman did</p>

                  </hi>. I am living on my private property, at Rose-cot<lb/>tage, Alpha-road, Regent's-park. I have known the prisoner about four years—I knew him in a chemist and druggist's shop, Mr. Lenton's, who at that time lived in Castle-street, Leicester-square—he has left him about two years—I believe he is employed by Mr. Lcnton occasionally, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184210240034"/>
               <p>in September, 1841, I took him into my service—I took some shooting in Essex, and took him as a general servant to clean shoes, and so on—he remained in my service till the end of November, or beginning of December, till the season was over—I came to town, and had no further occasion for him—I have employed him occasionally to fetch luggage or any thing—in August last he lodged at No. 4, Queen's-court, in Holborn with a woman named Pitts—on the day previous to the 14th of August I bad entered into fresh apartments, in the neighbourhood of Soho<lb/>square—it was Saturday the 13th—I had called at his place, but not finding him, the day following, which was Sunday the 14th, in the even<lb/>ing, accompanied by a friend, Mr. Lenton, I went down again to send him for some luggage I wanted, which had been left—having come to town it was left at the inn at Charing Cross—it came from Cambridge—I had come from there—I have connexions down there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had it crashed in falling into your fob? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some of it, and some fell at the door—I and my friend went out of the court—I accom<lb/>panied him as far as Turnstile, which is a very few yards from the gate, and the prisoner was crossing over by Day and Martin's blacking manu<lb/>factory—I saw him from his having a cap on, and his clothes—I knew him, having given him the clothes—I went up to him, told him I had called at his lodgings, and wanted him, and said I wanted him at home also, and he was with me from that time to about a quarter after eleven o'clock—he went home with me to Bateman's-buildings—Mr. Lenton had some professional visit to make, and went through Little Turnstile—I went on with Robert—I had left Mr. Lenton about a minute.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you lived at your present residence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two months—I took the apartments on the 13th—the landlord's name is Thompson—I took them till my place in Regent's-park was ready for my family—I am married—I had two or three large trunks</p>

               <p>and a gun-case at Charing Cross—I wanted the prisoner to fetch them to Bateman's-buildings—they were much too large to be fetched in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he had a truck to get them—I think they had arrived that day by the even<lb/>ing coach—I had myself been stopping with a member of my family, mid<lb/>way between Cambridge and London—the prisoner went with me to Bateman's-buildings, and was there about half an hour—in fact I wanted him to go down to Westminster for a gun—I took him to Bateman's-buildings to get a letter for the gun—I did not send him that night, it was too late—I had never called at Mrs. Pitts' before—I called at Mr. Lenton's the day before—I believe he was constantly in the habit of being employed by Mr. Lenton—not finding him there, I went on Sunday to inquire for him at Pitts'.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could not you give him instructions without taking him to Bate<lb/>man's-buildings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he could not get the gun without giving him an order—when I got home I found it was getting late, and it was not advisable to send him—he left about eleven o'clock—I had the parlour, kitchen, and bed-room—I had a female servant there, she saw him come, I dare say—I rather think the woman of the house let us in—I do not know whether she let him out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you recollect that Saturday, the 13th, was the day you moved into Bateman's-buildings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the previous day I had left Newport from my uncle's, and my agreement with the party at Bateman's-buildings was on Saturday, the 13th of August—I am positive it must have been the 14th—I came to town on the 13th by the Cambridge fly, about half-past two or three o'clock, to the George and Blue Boar—I went from thence with a friend—I got to Bateman's-buildings about five—it is a furnished house—my servant had come by an early coach—I found her at the place—I had directed her to remain with Mrs. Butcher, at her sis<lb/>ter's, in Circus-road, Regent's-park—after taking the lodging I took the servant, with what luggage was necessary, in a coach, and afterwards came with Mrs. Butcher, and took possession—I think I had seen the prisoner about a month previous, when I had been in town—he can write, but not a good hand—I do not know a person named Elvin or Hand—I never heard their names, nor the name of Stringer, until he was apprehended, and then, of course, almost every person heard of it—I never knew that the prisoner was acquainted with Stringer—I heard, through the medium of the public papers, that letters had been found on him, addressed to a Mr. Elvin, to the care of Mr. Stringer—I have no idea why I should re<lb/>collect the 14th of August particularly, only coupled with the fact that I went to Mrs. Pitts that day—I am sure of the day, from the day I entered into my apartments—I staid in the apartments about six weeks—I think I said two months just now, I beg to correct myself—I know it was the the 14th of August, simply from the fact of coming to town that day—I came by coach—I do not know whether my name was in the way-bill—most likely Mr. Mitchell, of the Red Lion, did put in my name—I have occasionally seen the prisoner between November, 1841, and the summer of 1842—I am on visiting terms with Mr. Lenton, and I have frequently seen the prisoner employed by him for various matters about the estab<lb/>lishment in the shop, and so forth—I do not think the prisoner was regu<lb/>larly apprenticed to Mr. Lenton—I think Mr. Lenton took him from kindly feelings towards his friends, that he knows better than I do—</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you follow shooting and sporting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only thing recommended to me by my medical man, to prevent incipient decline—the prisoner came next day, fetched the luggage, and remained with me up to three or four o'clock, I think—I asked him why he wore that cap, and told him it was a very objectionable thing to wear—he said he had no money—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to buy a hat, and paid him for his work, and gave him a pair of trowsers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to go to him at ten o'clock at night, about going for a gun to Westminster on Sunday, and on Monday for luggage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not have got the gun home without a messenger—I am not accus<lb/>tomed to go a long distance after dinner myself, and it was not a very re<lb/>putable part of Westminster—my object was, I would rather employ him than a strange porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pastrycook, and live in Monmouth-street—I have known the prisoner for the last six years. On the night before he was taken I was in his company at the Nag's Head, at the corner of James-street and Hart-street—he had been taking something to drink—there were a lot of young men there <hi rend="italic">larking,</hi> spirting beer over one another—after which the prisoner went to sleep with his head on the table—at the time the house was to be closed, the potman laid hold of his arm, and awoke him—as they had been spirting beer over him before, he took up a quart pot, and threw the contents over the potman—the potman took the pot away—the prisoner staggered towards him, and fell across the table—the potman thought he was going to strike him, lifted up his arm, swung round the pot, which caught the prisoner in the head, and wounded him—I cut off his hair, and put a plaster on, which he has on now—the wound was about an inch and a half long, and I could see the skull—no medical man was called—the surgeons' houses were all shut up—it was after twelve o'clock—I saw him again the next morning at the Nag's Head—he was going to take out a warrant against the potman—I persuaded him not to do so, but to settle it between themselves—they had some beer and three or four quarterns of gin together, and then half a pint of gin—the prisoner went away, and came back again after dinner, sat down, and had a share of a pint of beer—he laid his head on his hands, and I said, "<hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> don't lay your head down in that way, it will do you no good"—I aroused him up, and his eyes were staring—all of a minute he said, "Good bye, <hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> shake hands with me"—I said, "What for? I have never offended you that I know of"—this was about three o'clock—he went out, and must have committed this offence in less than five minutes afterwards—he was not sober when he went out his eyes were ready to start out of his head—I though he was going home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. After Mary was charged, Harriet of her own accord came to me, and said that she felt very uneasy about a box that her sister Mary wished her to take one evening when she went out to fetch beer, to Mrs. Ratnett, with Mary's love, and that she wished her to let it remain there till she (Harriet) left her place, which she was going to do after Michaelmas—I told her she had better have stated that to the inspector or to Mr. Walton—the inspector soon after called—I told him, rang the bell, Harriet came up, and stated the same to him—I cannot identify the gin or wine or the bottles—I can speak to these two towels by a mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Foster, a surgeon, of Mount<lb/>place, Whitechapel. On the 19th of September the prisoner came to me, and wished me to come and visit his wife, who was very ill—I accordingly went to No. 4, Buck's-row, Whitechapel—I found a woman lying on a mattress, apparently in a state of insensibility—the prisoner told me that she was a sober woman—I inquired if she had received any blow on her head—he said she had about a month ago, that he had struck her, and pointed to a mark on her left temple, which had healed—I do not think he described how he had struck the blow—he first said she had been in that insensible state from the morning—he afterwards said she had been in the hospital about a fortnight before—he said that the persons at the hospital told her she talked too fast, and he said that she did talk too fast—I inquired as to her health, and found it had been bad since the blow—I tried to arouse her—she threw her arms about, and tried to blow out the candle, and spit at me—she was exactly like a person out of her mind, or as if she had been drunk—that is sometimes a symptom of com<lb/>pression of the brain—I acquainted Hughes, the relieving officer, of the</p>

               <p>circumstance—the prisoner first said he had inflicted the blow a month ago, and afterwards he said five or six weeks—she was removed to the workhouse that evening—she lived till about eight o'clock the following evening—it is usual for more serious symptoms to be exhibited some time after a blow is received, than at the moment—there was nothing in the nature of the blow to make it impossible that it was inflicted with a fist—a blow which only causes partial external injury will often produce great concussion of the brain, on the opposite side to which the blow was struck—I think her death might be attributed to a blow with a fist—she had some internal complaint besides, but that was not in a state of progress to have affected life at that time—where there is any thing weak in the con<lb/>stitution, it is apt to fly to the part where the blow is inflicted—the blow must have been violent to have produced the consequences.</p>

On Wednesday afternoon, the 26th of October, I was spoken to by a female—I went out of my shop, and saw a person running away—I followed and caught him, and asked him for a pair of stays—he said he had none—this pair was afterwards delivered to me, and are mine—they had been banging outside the door shortly before.</p>

                  </hi>. At the time of this transaction, I resided in Southwick Terrace, Paddington—I came there about October or November last year—I have been for some time separated from Lady Frankfort—I first saw the prisoner on the 26th of May, when she came to my house in company with a Miss Mitchell, about ten o'clock at night—I had six or seven minutes conversation with Miss Mitchell, partly in the first-floor hall, and partly in the drawing-room and the hall—the lights in the drawing-room had been put out, and I was up stairs about retiring to bed—the prisoner and Miss Mitchell both went away together—I said nothing to the prisoner on that occasion, nor she to me—I did not expect Miss Mitchell or the prisoner that evening—I next saw the prisoner on the 28th—it might be about twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night—she came to the house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> alone—she ran up to the first-floor hall, just where I saw her before, and in about five minutes I came down—I was on the second-floor—I came down and found her just in the drawing-room, by the door—there was a light on the landing—I asked her what she had come for—she said she had come to see me and to stop—I at first said it was better for her not to stop—I said, "You may have friends at home who don't know where you may be"—she said she did not care, and she would stop—I kept the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> waiting till about one o'clock, and when she seemed resolved to stop, I went and sent the cab away, and she remained, and staid there till the night of the 22nd of July, passing the nights in the same room with me—I had not then the slightest reason to expect she was going—there was no quarrel or difference whatever between us—when she was with me I had in my possession two miniatures, one cost me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—three china snuff-boxes, which I have always been told were matchless, no value could be set on them—I believe my solicitor has ascertained they would fetch 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each at a pawnbroker's—they were bought with other things, also a toothpick case—I can set no value on it—I always bought these things in a large mass—I bought about 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth at a time—I sent over to France and collected them—the toothpick case was worth more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a gold snuff-box worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a gold enammelled watch-hook, worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think I gave 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—an opal-box worth more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a paper and penknife, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a gold smelling-bottle worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two etui cases, one worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also missed other property—I never gave either of the articles I have named to the prisoner, nor permission to pawn or dispose of them in any way—they were kept in a wardrobe, where I kept my clothes, in the room in which I slept—she had access to them, as the drawer was open while I was m the room—it was not locked till I went out of the room—then I always locked it—I gave her a great number of things while with me—she brought no stock of clothes when she came—I had her supplied with articles of dress—she did not leave my house while with me, till she left finally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Roman Catholic clergyman, and live in Upper Holland-street, Kensington. On the 22nd of September, about half past nine o'clock at night, I was on my way through the Park—I went in at the Hyde-park Corner gate, and went down the gravel-walk, by the side of the drive, by the first stone bridge across the river—I mean the bridge nearer Hyde-park Corner—when I arrived there, I heard a whistle, and three men rushed out suddenly upon me—I know not from where, but I should say they came from a plantation which was near—I had not seen them before—they came at my side, and the plantation was more at my side—one of them seized hold of the front of my coat violently, called me a dirty <hi rend="italic">s</hi>—, and said, "I have seen it, and there goes the soldier," pointing to a soldier who was on the other side of the ride, proceeding along the path leading to Cumberland-gate—(the other two did not lay hands on me at this moment, they stationed themselves one on each side of me as a guard)—he then lowered his voice, and said, "I must have some money"—he spoke quite loud enough for the other two to hear him—I said, "I shall not give yot any thing of that nature, you shall not have anything from me"—on this he thrust his hand into my left-hand trowsers' pocket, and took from it a brown net silk purse with steel slides and tassels, containing between 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—during the time he was doing this, the other two were standing on either side of me—the prisoners are certainly those two men—up to the time when the third man put his band into my pocket, I saw no one near me but the two prisoners and the soldier alluded to, who might have been 600 or 700 yards off—the two prisoners both made the accusation at the same time with the other man—I was so alarmed at the time that I do not know whether I cried out, but I have heard since that I did—after the first man took my purse he ran away—there is one incident which I do not think I mentioned at the police-court, which I wish to mention now, but I felt as if I had awoke from a dream after the occurrence, the man that took my purse, knocked my hat off, and endeavoured to strike me with some<lb/>thing which he had in his hand—it appeared to me to be a life-preserver—I bent down my head, and escaped the blow—I am confident the pnsoners must have seen the first man take my purse and run away—on his doing so Lewis took hold of me—I cannot swear that Passenger touched me—I cannot swear whether he did or did not—he said the same as the other did—he accused me in the same manner—when Lewis took hold of me, I said "Why don't you leave go? Leave go—I must give you in charge."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say for what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For stealing my purse, or for aiding the other man in stealing my purse—I charged them with aiding the other man in stealing my purse—in a short time two or three persons other man in stealing my purse—in a short time two or three persons came up—I desired them to fetch the police, and shortly after Beckerson came up, and I gave the two prisoners in charge—among other persons that came up I have since recognised Mr. Fargues of Hull.</p>

On the evening of the 29th of September, about half-past nine o'clock, I was near the Serpentine river, and heard the cries of "Murder," which induced me to leave the path—I was coming from Ox<lb/>ford-street, and the cry was on my left—I ran in the direction of the cry and met a man running across the greep towards Oxford-street, directly is the path way, who I asked what was the matter—he gave me no answer, but kept running on—it was a fine moonlight night—I came up to the prosecutor, and found the two prisoners having hold of him—Lewis had hold of him by the upper part of his coat, apparently trying to choke him and Passenger had hold of his arm, but he let go his hold the moment I appeared—the prosecutor told me he had been robbed of his purse—the prisoners said they had caught him committing an unnatural offence with a soldier—I think they both spoke—I know one of them did—I cannot positively say which one it was—they said, "Look here, this is a d—<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—, I found him committing s—with a soldier"—those were the words.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master painter, and live at 27, Great Harcourt-street, Bryanstone-square; I have a shop there, and also one in Boulogne. I was in Hyde Park on the night of the 22nd of September, coming from Knightsbridge across to Cumberland Gate—I had occasion to pass the bay of the Serpentine, which is in a direct line from Knightsbridge—as I was passing that part before you come across the side where the gentlemen ride on horseback, I heard a loud whistle, and when I got to the bay of the Serpentine, I saw the prisoner Passenger running very fast towards me—(I had never seen either of the prisoners before that night)—I did not stop him—after he had passed me, I heard Mr. Bugden hallooing for help. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look again at the prisoners, and see whether you are right or wrong about the person you say was running? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am pretty near sure I am not wrong—I knew it was the tallest of the two, because I saw them both together directly after—I saw the prosecutor at the end of the bay, a little more than half the distance from the Serpentine to the end of the enclo<lb/>sure, from the man I saw running—it was directly I crossed the ride that I saw Passenger running towards me—he turned the corner, and went round the enclosure in a direction away from where I afterwards found the prosecutor—he went round the plantation, which would bring him to the spot where the prosecutor was—that is where he returned to—it was immedi<lb/>ately after I heard the whistle that I saw Passenger running—the moment he passed me I heard Mr. Bugden cry out, and I then ran towards where I heard the cry—I there found Mr. Bugden, and Lewis holding him by the collar</p>

I said, "Sir, if what the man has said is true, you ought to be apprehended for it;" be said, "It is not true;" I said, "The man has gone for a police-man, which he would not do if you had not committed the crime;" we came on to a fence where the third man first spoke to me; I stood on the pathway with him; he still kept pulling towards the Serpentine; he said, "Let go;" I said, "Go which way you will, I intend to go with you till the other man brings the policeman to say what he has against you," but as to knowing the other man, or Passenger, I did not; I stood by Mr. Bugden, and ten or eleven people came up; a young man and an elderly gentleman came up, and inquired what was the matter; I stated the matter to them, and Mr. Bugden contradicted it, and said the man that ran away had stolen his purse; I did not believe that; the people said, "Why do you hold the gentleman, if I was him I would knock you down for it;" I said the man had given him in my charge, and it was my duty to hold him; I held him by the wrist; he staid there, it might be five minutes or more, and a policeman came up; I and Passenger were then standing in among the people; neither of us were in custody of any body; he told the policeman to take us into custody, and he took us up to Vine-street.</p>

In March last I was acting as secretary of the London District of the society of Recha<lb/>bites—the prisoner was secretary of the Rose of Temperance Tent—in April last he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of that tent—it is a fund in which Fowler is interested as a partner—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid on re<lb/>turns due from that tent to the district—I have here the return made up by him—it is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a mistake of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that reduces it to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is in the prisoner's own writing—I gave him a receipt when he paid me—this receipt is not it—it is not my handwriting—it is written on part of a letter which I addressed to the prisoner in the course of business—here is "Mr. Buchanan, 19, Durham-row, Church-yard, Hackney"—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I should say this receipt is his writing considerably disguised.</p>

I am an out-fitter, and live in the Minories—about Whitsuntide a person representing himself to be Edward Williams called on me, and said he lived at No. 185, Ratcliff-highway—I went to the house on the Monday, found it shut, and nobody in it—I think the person called on the Friday—three weeks or a month or more after, he came again, and after that second visit the prisoner and Williams came to me, I cannot say the date—he was introduced as the son or son-in-law of Williams——they selected goods, I can hardly say to what amount—the whole of the goods I sent in amounted to 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they left the selection partly to me—part were delivered on Friday—before the whole of the goods were delivered I went down on Saturday morning, and Williams said he sup<lb/>posed cash was acceptable at all times, and gave me four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—the prisoner was present—I applied to the prisoner for payment of the account as soon as all the goods were delivered—he told me that Williams had just gone out of town—I went almost day after day and saw the prisoner there—I saw them together—I do not recollect the day—the prisoner had told me that Mr. Williams had got some bills which he was going to get discounted—I cannot charge my memory whether Wil<lb/>liams or the prisoner told me if I came down at such a time he would settle my account—I believe they were both present—I went at the time appointed, Williams was not within—they were both present when the bill in question was given, I think it was |n the forenoon—Williams said I had been very untradesmanlike in pressing a respectable tradesman for cash so soon, and he should have no further dealings with me, he had not been able to get the bills discounted, but he had a bill more than the amount of my goods—he gave me that, and laid a particular stress on his words, saying, "Mind, I will not take the balance in goods, I will have it in money when the bill is paid"—it was for 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it—my account was 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Williams laid the bill on the table, the prisoner took it up, and they had some conversation respecting the merits of the bill—I cannot say what it was, but both said that Captain Cutting was a respectable man, a captain of a vessel then at sea, but would be home before the bill became due, and the bill was for goods they had sold him, and he had several other bills and a deal of money laying out at the present time which was very hard to get in—the prisoner took the bill, and said, he thought Mr. So-and-So, mentioning a person's name, would cash the bill for me, if I allowed him 10 per cent.—there was an altercation about what 10 per cent would be—I said it was about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner said it would be 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took the bill, put it into my pocket, and thought, as he said the acceptor was a respectable man, I had better keep it than lose the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 50, Peppercorn-street, Gravesend. I have known the prisoner about eighteen months. I came up from Graves<lb/>end on the 10th of October, and arrived at Black wall between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day—I met the prisoner by accident—he wished me to go and take some refreshment—I went with him to the first public-house on the left-hand side of the way—he called for a glass of gin and water, which I did not see him pay for—he then called for a pint of ale, and said, "You may as well pay for this"—I took out my purse with the in<lb/>tention of doing so, and must have let it <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> in my lap—I put my hand in<lb/>to my lap, with my purse in it—there were two sovereigns, two half-sove<lb/>reigns, two half-crowns, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—he paid some halfpence for what we had had—he called a Jew pedlar who was there, from the garden, and wished me to have a brooch—I said it was stupidness of him, for I wanted nothing of the kind, and the Jew went away—the prisoner wished me to go to his lodgings, which I did—there was an old woman there—he offered to take me to Drury-lane theatre—I was at his lodgings with him very nearly an hour, I then left, and went to the Blackwall Railway, with the in<lb/>tention of going to town, and in attempting to take my purse out to pay, I found it was gone—I said to the prisoner, "O my, I have lost my purse"—he said, "It must be at home"—I said, "It can't be there, for I had no occasion for it there; we will go to the public-house, and if we don't find it there we will go to your lodgings"—we went to the public-house, and he said to the waiter, "My good lady has lost her purse"—the waiter went to the seat where I had been sitting, and I saw him pick up my purse from the floor—there was only a key left in it—I proposed going for a policeman—the prisoner said, "Don't go, I will go, for the station-house is a mile and a half or two miles off, and you will not meet with a police-man before you get there"—I said, "Well, if you go, make haste back"—the Jew, who was still there, made an attempt to go out of the room—I wished to detain him—the prisoner said it was stupidness for me to detain</p>

               <p>the Jew, for he knew nothing of it—whilst talking to the prisoner about my purse I missed my veil, gloves, and pocket-handkerchief—I had put my gloves and handkerchief on the table—as I was going to the door, to detain the Jew, my veil became unfastened, and I put it on the table by the side of my handkerchief—I told the prisoner they were missing—he said it was all right—he then went away, as he said, to fetch a policeman, and never returned I have since seen the veil, gloves, and handkerchief—there is a mark on the handkerchief—the gold I lost was new gold.</p>

(which the prisoner had before told me he had done)—he said, "No"—I then said to the prisoner, "What has become of the sashes?"—he said they were in a room he was living in, next door—I afterwards went to the station, and saw the prisoner there—I said to him, "If you don't think proper to answer me, don't do so; I wish to know where you have taken the property, that the officer may follow it?"—he said, "I shall tell the Lord Mayor to-morrow morning"—the other man who was there said, "Three carts have been sold to Mr. Folgate, for 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner said, "It is correct"—I said, "What have you done with the lead?"—he said, "I have had no lead."</p>

C.

About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 7th of October, I was looking out of the window—I saw the prisoner take the boots off the window-ledge, and stand by the corner of the door, fumbling with her shawl—she came into the shop—I thought she was coming to try them on—she went out again with them—I went down to my father—I and my brother pursued, but she got quite away——I knew her—I have seen her about the street before—I am sure she is the person.</p>

About a quarter to nine o'clock on the evening of the 4th of October, I was at the Adelaide Gal<lb/>lery with Amelia Cox—I went up to the electrifying machine—the pri<lb/>soner was standing on my right-hand side—I was being electrified—my dress was pulled up from the bottom—I went to knock it down—the pri<lb/>soner was standing by my hip—I struck her—she had not got her hand quite out of my pocket—I dropped my hand and said, "My G—Mrs. Cox, I am robbed"—she said, "No, you are not"—I said to the pri<lb/>soner, "Yes, and it is you"—I took hold of her arm, then of her hand, and my purse was in her hand—she dropped my purse down at my feet—she said, "I have not got any thing, feel"—I said, "Yes, you have dropped it"—I never let go of her till I gave her in charge—my purse contained ten shillings and three sixpences—this is it—I picked it up at the time—I had made it myself—it is joined in the middle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pork-butcher, and live in Shore<lb/>ditch. The prisoner Iliff is my apprentice—I received information from Wolfe on the 27th of September—I went through my back place out into the other street, and round into the stable occupied by Mr. Jeffs—I found Iliff and Flower there—I said there was meat there belonging to me—they both denied it—Iliff then went away on the errand on which he was sent—Flower then said, "Here is some meat of yours here; here is a leg of pork; take it home, make no noise about it; I will pay you for the leg of pork;" and then afterwards, when the officer had got the leg of pork, as Iliff, and Flower, and I were Walking to the station, Flower said, if I would not go to Court with him, his father would give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure he first said there was no pork, and he afterwards produced the pork—it was mine—I had seen it safe about an hour and a half before.</p>

About three o'clock in the afternoon on the 27th of September, Iliff came and asked me to Iend him my apron—I was in the water-closet at the time—I watched him—he put a leg of pork into a pail, and took it to Mr. Jeff's stable—I told my master, and he went after him directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am road foreman to Mr. Blay the surveyor—I live in the City-road. On Saturday, the 1st of October, I was in company with Lone, about four o'clock in the afternoon—he came up the yard where we keep our tools, in the City-road, just over the bridge—he came after a job—he was there till seven o'clock—after that he went in the Macclesfield Arms, nearly adjoining the yard—he remained there till nine o'clock—he was with me from four till nine—he could not have been in the City at half-past six—I am certain he could not.</p>

About two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 6th of August, the prisoner and another came there—the other delivered me this order—I compared the marks on it with the marks on the dock notes, and the goods—finding it corresponded, I delivered the goods, consisting of a tierce of coffee, to the prisoner and the other man—they had a truck, and took away the coffee on the truck—on the following Monday a gentleman from Tunley and Hodson, the canal-carriers, applied for the same goods—the foreman presented him the order I had received on Saturday, the 6th of August, and it turned out to be a forged one—last Tuesday week Goodwin called—I accompanied him to the police-court, Worship-street—I was shown one of the cells, with five persons in it, and among them was the prisoner—I selected him from among the five—I have not the least doubt that he is one of the men that came for the goods.</p>

On the morning of the 4th of October, at ten minutes before six o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the door of No. 168, Regent-street—I asked what she was going to do with the coat which she had on her arm—it was wrapped up in a bundle, and in it was a bottle of wine, some bread and meat, and a silk handker<lb/>chief—I took her to the station, and these other things were found on her, also a latch-key, which I found would open the prosecutor's door, and en<lb/>abled me to go into the house—I went there, and found the butler drunk in the kitchen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of James Newton, who keeps a baby-linen warehouse in Upper-street, Islington. On the night of the 20th of October I was in the room behind the shop—I saw the prisoner leave the shop, and missed a child's frock, which had hung near the door—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—Mrs. Newton ran out—the prisoner was brought back in three or four minutes.</p>

On the 24th of October I saw a young man, about the pri<lb/>soner's size—I do not know whether the prisoner is like him or not—he came into Mr. Cove's shop and asked for a pennyworth of tape—there were six silk handkerchiefs on the counter, near to where he stood—I served him, and he left—he returned in two or three minutes, and asked for more tape, and wider than the other—he said some one had hurt his leg, and he wanted it for it—I served him, and he went out—I think I should know the two pieces of tape again which he had—I did not miss the handker<lb/>chiefs till the next morning, when I saw the prisoner in custody—these handkerchiefs produced are exactly like those I missed, and these are the pieces of tape I sold to the person—here are the pieces they came off.</p>

On the 20th of September I was on duty—the train arrived a little before six o'clock—a man came back, and I found that an umbrella had been left in the second-class carriage—the prisoner was lighting my lamp at the time to search the carriage, and must have heard the inquiry—I searched, and did not find it—Dock wood spoke to me—I then searched the first-class carriages, and found an umbrella—I took it to my inspector—I then took it back to the carriage, and went into another carriage—I had not been there two minutes before the prisoner came, and opened one of the carriages—he did not find the umbrella there—he then opened the next carriage, and took the umbrella from one body, and put it into the other body of the carriage—I then jumped out, and took him into custody—he directly said it was the first thing that ever he was guilty of, and he hoped I should say no more about it, on account of his wife and family—there is a general order, if any person finds any thing in a carriage, or on the platform, to take it to the office, and enter it in a book, in case the party calls for it—there are often things left.</p>

I am in the service of Robert Milbourn, a silk warehouseman, in Newgate-street—he has no partner—on the 16th of May, Shackleford came, and asked whether we served country dealers—I said we did—he said he was commencing business at Maidstone, and wished to open an account at our house, he would pay part in cash, and give respectable references for the balance—he asked to be shown some silks—I showed him some—he selected a parcel, amounting to 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he produced this card, and was about writing the names of the referes cm the back of it, when I took him into the counting-house, to the count<lb/>ing-house clerk—when he got into the counting-house he wrote these names of the referees—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—Bachelard, George-street, Mansion-house; Ingram, Addle-street; and Earp, Fleet-street—on the other side of the card is "Water<lb/>loo-house, William Beaumont, Week-street, Maidstone"—Mr. Wells was in the counting-house—I said, "Mr. Beaumont, of Maidstone"—I left the card in the counting-house—Mr. Milbourn was not in at the time—Shackleford left instructions that the goods should be sent at six o'clock, to the Swan<lb/>with-two-Necks, Lad-lane—that was all that passed that day—the goods consisted often yards of black satin, sixteen of white satin, and other things—the porter took them that evening—Mr. Wells accompanied him, and received some money—on the next day, the 17th, Shackleford came again, Mr. Milbourn was there then, and sold the goods—he selected number of goods, which came to 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he left instructions that they were to be left at the Swan-with-two-Necks, Lad-lane, at six o'clock—he left an order for a box of artificial flowers—on the 23rd be came again, and bought some more goods, amounting to 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the flowers were sent with them—I addressed him several times as Mr. Beanmont—Mr. Milbourn, in my hearing, addressed him as Mr. Beaumont—he came again on the 31st—he bought some more goods that day, consisting of hand<lb/>kerchiefs, shawls, scarfs, crapes, and satinet, in two parcels, which amount<lb/>ed to 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to be paid in the middle of the next month—they were to be sent as before, to the Swan-with-two-Necks—there was a direction written on them, "R.

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale hosier and warehouse<lb/>man, in Cheapside. On the 18th of May my young man brought a card into my counting-house, with "Beaumont, Maidstone," on it—Shackleford was not there at that time—I desired my young man to make inquiries, and on the following day, in consequence of those inquiries, I permitted the Mr. Beaumont, as I supposed, to have the goods—that was on the 19th, and on the Monday afterwards, which was the 23rd, I went to Mr. Bachelard's, at the Cork Stuffing Company's—Bachelard stated that he had known Mr. Beaumont ten or twelve years, that he was a very respectable young man; he knew he had 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital; he had seen that; and he had married a young lady who had a whole house in Sloane-street, and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and he had a friend who would help him with one or two thousand pounds, or more, if he required it—the communication from Bachelard to me was satisfactory—I believed it to be true, otherwise I should not let Shackleford have the goods—I at last began to have some misgivings—in consequence of that, I desired Shackleford to be shown in to me, and he was so, a few days after the 23rd of May—he then gave himself the name of Ford, and represented himself as buying for Mr. Beaumont—I did not inquire into the state of the account from my young man till early in June—I was not aware it was so heavy till I received a letter from Beaumont, and a further order—I then called on Bachelard again—he offered to be<lb/>come surety for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would let him have more goods—I considered, and declined it—I went to Maidstone myself about the 21st or 22nd of June—I found the shop, with "Beaumont" over the door—I went into the shop, and saw two persons—one was Mr. Beaumont's father, as I was told, and the other was the prisoner Gosbell—I addressed myself to Gos<lb/>bell, in consequence of his coming towards me—I asked him for Mr. Beaumont—he said he was in town, and would not return till Saturday—(this was Thursday)—I then asked for a Mr. Smith—Gosbell said he was gone to Chatham, and would return in the course of that afternoon—I waited in Maidstone the whole of that day, and went to the shop again after ten o'clock at night, when they were closing, in order to see Smith, but I could not, he had not returned—I then asked Gosbell if the buyer was down there—he said no, he never came to Maidstone—I asked him if he knew him—he said he did not, and did not know his name.</p>

On the afternoon of the 14th of October, on going into the parlour, I noticed the shadow of a figure on the side-board—I was alone in the house—I looked through the door, and saw the prisoner standing against the dining-room table, in the middle of the room, with the plate-basket in his hand—on seeing me, he turned round, looked at me, and jumped out of the window, taking the plate-basket with him—I followed, and seized hold of him as he was getting over the gate leading into the back garden—I got possession of the plate-basket—I do not recollect whether he relinquished his hold, or whether I took it from his hand, but all in a moment I found the basket in my possession—I laid hold of his coat after I got the basket, and called out "Murder" and "Police"—I felt him, as I thought, shifting to get his coat off—I then let go my hold of the skirts of his coat, took up the plate-basket, went into the back garden, and gave an alarm—he was brought back in about three-quarters of an hour or an hour—I am sure he is the same man—he left his hat behind him, and in it were several religious and other tracts, and a sheet almanack—a coat was also brought to me, which was such a one as he had when I caught hold of him—the plate-basket had been on the side-board before I saw the prisoner with it—the window was at that time shut down—I found it open when I saw him standing in the parlour—the door of the house was shut—there was no other way of getting in except through the window—I do not know how he would get to the parlour window without getting over the wall and the iron palisades—the plate-basket contained the articles stated, which are worth upwards of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my master's property—I gave information to a man named Miller, who went in pursuit—he is too unwell to be here.</p>

On the afternoon of the 14th of October, I was crossing the fields towards Upton, and saw the prisoner jump over the fence of Mr. Gurney's park, which is, I should say, about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutors premises—a great number of people were pursuing him—a conductor of the Parcel's Delivery Company stopped him in the park—I took hold of him, and asked why he ran—he said, because other people ran—he was the first man—a person named Miller came up when I got him to the station—in consequence of what he said, I took him to the prosecutor's house, and Reynolds said he was the man that took the plate-basket out of the parlour—he said, "Women must say something; I suppose I must hear it"—this hat was found in the garden, containing tracts and other things, such as people hawk about, and the coat was found in the next house—the prisoner denied that either were his—he put them on at Lambeth-street—he had no hat or coat on when I stopped him.</p>

At half-past six o'clock in the morning of the 14th of October I was in my field at Barking—I saw the two prisoners coming from Mr. Brown's place, carrying something heavy across the fields—I followed—they each had a bag—I went to Smith's house, and asked what they had in their bngs—they said only a few cinders which they had picked up on the railway—I found they had about 70lbs. Of coals, which exactly resembled Mr. Brown's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and lodge in Kent-street, in the same house as the prisoner. On Tuesday night, the 18th of October, after eleven o'clock, I heard the prisoner ask the deputy who takes care of the house if she would trust him for that night's lodging—she said "No," and he walked out—he said he had got no money—I went to bed about twelve o'clock—he came in between one and two, and slept in the same room as I did—next morning, about eleven o'clock, I saw him with a pad in his hand—he went out and brought in a young woman with him, and took a lodging for her—I saw them go out together and they came in with a new pair of shoes, a hat, a new pair of stockings, a pair of trowsers, and a coat—he had gone out in an old jacket and cap about nine o'clock—on the Friday night I saw him at the door in his shirt sleeves talking to the young woman—the prosecutor, his wife, and child passed by the door and the prisoner began to laugh at him, and said that was the man he had knocked down in the kennel off the footpath, and that he took the pad from under his knee, that he might not follow him—the woman pushed him into the house and told him to hold his tongue, as he did not know who might be listening to him—I was afterwards going up the same side of the way and met the prosecutor and his wife—I spoke to him, and he gave me into the custody of the police—I went to the house—the prisoner was having his supper with the young woman, and the policeman took him into custody—the pad has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the Navy, and reside in Melton<lb/>terrace, Southwark-bridge-road—I attended the deceased several times during his life—I did so about six years ago, and have attended the family many years—on Saturday, the 17th of September, about ten o'clock, I was called in—he was then dead—he had been dead, I think, about au hour—a spot on the floor was pointed out to me—there were <hi rend="italic">faces</hi> and a good deal of mucus on it, by the side of the bed—he was on the bed when I first saw him—(I had attended the prisoner in her confinement, between two and three months ago, I am not quite sure)—I opened the body of the deceased on the Monday—the cavity of the thorax was quite healthy, and all the viscera—the stomach was opened, and a portion of white powder was seen at the bottom of it, about two inches in length, and an inch in breadth, and a good deal of fluid—the intestines were all empty—the kidneys were larger than they should be—all the rest of the viscera were healthy—we took home the contents of the stomach, and examined it by analysis—I examined it by different tests—it turned out to be arsenic—I should suppose, there must have been about twenty grains of white oxide, commonly called arseni<lb/>ous acid—it is generally called white arsenic—if you purchase it in the shops it is called arsenic—I should say the deceased must have suffered very much indeed, they described him to be in a fit when they called me—I should think, from the appearances, the poison must have been taken into the stomach about six or seven hours—I consider twelve hours to be the extent of time within which it must have been administered—I think he would have died in less than that; but I have given the extent—I found some castor-oil in the stomach—I attribute the death of the deceased to the arsenic—I had said to the prisoner that I thought it would be proper to have him opened, they had better send for the beadle; and she express<lb/>ed a wish to have him opened—she said that he had eaten apple-pudding on the Wednesday previous to the Saturday, and that he went into the yard and immediately cast it up again—she gave me what she said was some of the crust of the pudding—it was analysed, but there was no arsenic in</p>

               <p>that—if there had been arsenic in the pudding taken on Wednesday I should have supposed it had been all cast up again—the people in the house told me he had been ill from the Wednesday till the Saturday—Mrs. Bowler said nothing to me about that—all that I believe she said to me was, that she wished to have him opened—I do not recollect anything more—I was in my shop on the Thursday morning before, at nine o'clock—I did not see her there then—I did not sell her any tincture of rhubarb that morning—I did not give her any advice—I had not seen her from the time I left her when she was confined.</p>

On the Sunday before the Saturday on which he died, the pri<lb/>soner was in my room, and our conversation began about the newspaper—I told her a lady and gentleman and their servant had been poisoned with arsenic, by their daughter—she asked me whether I knew how they sold it, I whether in liquid or powder—nothing was said about the name it was called by—I saw the deceased on the morning he died—I cannot tell what time, it was before dinner—he was sick when 1 first went into the room—he brought something up, but what I do not know—the prisoner was there at that time—she said he brought up every thing she gave him—I asked her why she did not have a doctor—she said, "We owe money"—I said, "Why, there are parish doctors and dispensary doctors; why not have a doctor?"—the deceased said, "Why not me have a doctor?"—she said, "You don't want to be physicked and tortured about"—he had his hand on his chest—I did not hear him complain of anything at that time—on the Monday after the Saturday on which he died I was conversing with Mrs. Parfitt, whom Mrs. Bowler calls her mother—Mrs. Bowler was present—I told her that he had said, "Why not have a docto?"—she said, "He did not say so; and if you say that, you will hang me, for you will be called on the Jury"—on the Sunday morning the day after his death, I was clean<lb/>ing the room, after laying him out, and brought a half-pint mug off the drawers' in the room, and took it into the kitchen—there was some tea in it—I emptied it in the yard, on the stones by the water-closet—I saw a sort of sediment in the bottom of the mug, of a dirty white, like magnesia—I then took the mug up stain to my husband, to show him—he told me to take it down and place it in the kitchen, and I did so—I did not wash it out—I never saw it afterwards—a man named Dunster lodged in the house—Mrs. Bowler told me at one time, just before Mr. Bowler's death, that if he (Dunster) got married to the young woman be was paying bis addresses to, she would destroy their happiness—on one occasion, previous to Mr. Bowler's death, she told me that Dunster would stop five years for her—I never saw her and Dunster go out together.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you take her to several chemists' shops in the neighbourhood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, among others to Mr. Jones—the cup, or mug, in which the rhubarb was said to have been fetched, was taken with her—Mr. Jones could not call her to mind at the time, but when I produced the cup he recollected that, and he then asked her what quantity she had—she said, "Three-penny worth"—he said, "How far would the three-penny worth come up to in the cup?"—she then pointed to a certain mark, and Mr. Jones immediately told the assistant to put so many grains of water in, and it corresponded exactly with what she said—this was on the 27th, I think, the Monday week after his death—I went to the house from time to time for the whole three weeks the Coroner's jury were sitting—I always found her at home, and most willing to accompany me wherever I suggested—on the same day that I took her to Jones I took ber to Hornblower's—I had been there before that day, and had seen the wit<lb/>ness Page—I asked him if he thought he should be able to recognize her again—be said he thought he should—I intimated to him that I would bring her—I cannot positively say that I told him I would bring hw—I did not say any thing about when I would come—from the conversa<lb/>tion he of course would expect me to bring her—she had a cotton gown on, and the bonnet that she said she was out with when she went to get the tincture of rhubarb on the Friday—she herself told me how she bad been dressed on the Friday—she took off her widow's cap and dress and put thw one on—a man named Lowring accompanied us to Mr. Page—she wai the only female—I remember Page saying, when he saw her, "I think I hive seen you before"—it was the first thing he said—I do not remember bw saying any thing about being taken rather at a <hi rend="italic">nonplus</hi>—I then asked him whether that was the party that had applied to him for arsenic, and be said he had no doubt that she was—when I first went in, he said, "I have seen you before"—I will not be positive whether he said, "I think," or not—</p>

I am twenty-eight years old, and am a traveller to a commercial house—I have lived in the house where Mr. and Mrs. Bowler lived, about eighteen months—I knew them very well for at least nine years before that—I have not been particularly intimate with them—I know the Trotts, and the other parts of the family—Mr. John Trolt has a niece named Charlotte—I have been paying attentions to her for six months and more, with the approbation of her own friends and mine-our intimacy continues down to the present time—the prisoner had not inti<lb/>mated to me at any time any displeasure on her part, to my attentions to Miss Trott—I remember the deceased attempting to destroy himself in Peckham-fields, twelve months ago last May—we had been to the Nun's Head, Peckham, and were coming home together—I was a little before him—his wife was there—we were coming over the bridge together, and he said he would throw himself into the b—canal—his wife entreated him not to do so, and to come away—he said he would not come away, he would not leave, he would drown himself—I assisted her in endeavouring to prevent it—I asked him why he did so—he said he was tired of his life—I thought at first it was a joke, but not afterwards—he seemed very determined—I succeeded with his wife in getting him away home—he was of a very sullen temper—he talked very little—on two or three occa<lb/>sions I had seen him in a room, in company with other person—I never observed any thing particular—he was generally very quit—I think he has remained in the room—I never particulary observed—he did not join in the conversation like other persons—I never thought that</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Sherwood, a wire-worker, of No.5, York-street, London-road. Thomas Wellings was my nephew, and was a wire-worker—on Monday night he was up in my room doing a little work for me—his wife called him down—I went down about ten minutes afterwards, and saw him and Heskett fighting in the middle of York-street—a great many people were standing about—I saw them strike each other—they were perfectly sober—they continued fighting twenty minutes or half an hour—Wellings fell down nearly every time—the pri<lb/>soner fell down sometimes—they kept on fighting till they fell—there was a number of falls, I cannot say how many—they fell from the blows—Wellings was the last that fell—he fell with the back of his head against the curb-stone—he then said, "I will have no more," and I never heard him speak afterwards—I was not with him when he went home—I went up stairs, and they took him home as well us they could—I was with him when he died—his nose and eye bled—he lived a very little way from me—I sat up with him all night—he never spoke, moved hand or foot, or opened his eyes—I and his wife went for a doctor about eight o'clock—we got Mr. Gale—he came with us—the deceased was about thirty years old—the prisoner had married Wellings' sister—they were on friendly terms before—the prisoner shook hands with him after he fell the last time, when he said he would have no more.</p>
