               <p>I am an officer belonging to the public office, in Worship-street. On the 29th of December, I was standing by our office door, a person came up and said -</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any intimation, what did you do? - I see a waggon standing very high opposite to the office, within a few yards; I see Watkins take out a sack of coals out of the waggon with the assistance of Russell, and I see him take them into the house of Brockwell, the prisoner that stands at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the prisoner's house? - It is situated in Worship-street, Moorfields. I followed him in, and just as you get into Brockwell's house, just in his room, there is a closet that is behind the door, and he takes and whips the coals out of the sack into this here closet. I was close to him almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room at that time? - Brockwell and his wife, and another woman. I laid hold of Watkins, I says to him, you are doing something that is not right; says he, I don't know nothing at all about that. I then asked Mr. Brockwell, the prisoner at the bar, what business them coals had being brought into his house? Brockwell said, there was a woman that lived in George-street that ordered them to be brought there; and at that time he had got half a crown between his thumb and finger, and said, here take the half crown, holding the half crown out to Watkins.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180005"/>Q. Who did he say that to? - To Watkins. Watkins says I have nothing to do with it, Russell ordered me to bring them here, I have nothing to do with the money. I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Russell at the time? - Watkins took the sack of coals out of the waggon, with the assistance of Russell; I took the ticket that I had from Watkins, and I see by the ticket that I had from Watkins, where the coals were going to; the officers took Watkins and the empty sack home to the office, and as the waggon had got the four and thirty sacks in it, I thought it not proper to take Russell into custody, and I thought it proper to go with him where the coals were going to; when we arrived at Mr. Price's house, which is situated in Gloucester-street, Hoxton; I related the circumstance to him, and the sacks were counted there, there were four and thirty, and the ticket expressed five and thirty; after the waggon was emptied, I see the team safe home to Mr. Bee's house, at Southwark, and brought Russell back to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of Brockwell all this time? - Brockwell remained at his own house, Brockwell was not taken into custody that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you are an officer of the police office, Worship-street? -  Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Brockwell lives in the same street? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Near the office? - Within about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You can see the house of Brockwell from the office? - Yes, every moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - In the evening, high six.</p>
               <p>Q. But however it was not so dusk or dark but what at thirty yards distance you could observe what was going on? - No, I did not see it, I went from an information that I had received.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a public thoroughfare? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course there were a great number of persons passing and repassing that time of the evening? - No, I don't know that there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bee is not here? - No, I don't know he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mr. Metcalse? - I have never seen Mr. Metcalse.</p>
               <p>Q. What coals were put into the waggon there you don't know of your own knowledge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that they belonged to Mr. Bee of your own knowledge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they were brought into Brockwell's house, there were other people in the house besides Brockwell? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any secret in conveying these coals into the house? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he see you there? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he knew you was an officer? - There is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Bee this morning? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Brockwell was not taken into custody then? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before Brockwell was taken into custody? - Not till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. He was admitted to bail? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He now surrenders to take histrial this morning? - Yes, there is no doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Q. And all this happened you seeing it take place in Mr. Brockwell's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was sitting in the room, and this man came rushing in, and he says, my boy, will you buy a sack of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180006"/>coals for half a crown and a pot of beer? I looked up at him, and told him no, I did not want any; he said that he brought them for a woman in Shoreditch, and she was not at home, and that if I would take them it would save him the trouble of carrying them back again; he said they were very good coals; he repeated that with a loud voice, two or three times in the passage, and the door standing open; he then went out into the street, and repeated with a loud voice, the same words again; I told him I was afraid I should get myself in a hobble by buying of them; he said, there was no fear of that, they were waste boys perquisites; as for George-street it was not mentioned to me, and as for saying take the half crown, I did not; I cannot deny that I had the silver and halfpence in my hand, but I had not separated them; had I known what they had been at the time, I should not have had any thing to do with them.</p>

               <p>I am a victualler, in St. John's street, Bethnal-green. I was in Worship-street one evening about six o'clock, I cannot say how long ago, some time before Christmas; I see a coal waggon stand about twenty yards before I came to the police office, Shoreditch,</p>
               <p>Q. At whose door was it? - I don't know; I see the carman belonging to the coal waggon; curiosity led me to mark what he was about; I see him go to a door, I crossed the way in order to hear what was going forward; I heard him say to the people within doors, you may as well take them, take them, have them; the reply that was made from within, I cannot tell; he came away and went back to the same door again a second time, and was urging them as I thought, more forcibly to have them than before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he succeed then? - No, I think he went four times before he prevailed on them to have them, and the third or fourth time, he said, you might as well have them before I go away, he even forced them on them, as I thought; when I see this I went to the police, and gave information myself, and one of the men came along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man, Ray? - I think he was; but before I went to acquaint Ray, I heard the carman say to the other man, go and undo the rope, and that made me go to the police office; when I came from the police with the officer, we walked by the waggon twice, before we see what they were doing, and there at last we see the man having the sack on his back, and going into the very same door he was speaking at before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him shoot them down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it in? - I don't know the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have seen him since, but I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Q.

He came in at the time the Norwich waggoner was cording my box the second time, he see me get change for the guinea, I delivered the box to him with six guineas of gold in it, he carried it to the corner of Bishopsgate-street where his cart stood. His horse met with a misfortune and fell down and he left the box at the corner of a street, and I stood by it till he came the second time and took the box, I said, Mr. Green, will you let me ride in the cart? - No, he said, you cannot, nor you shall not; accordingly I told him to leave the box at Mrs. Anderson's, the Royal Hospital, at Chelsea, and if I was not there she would pay him for the box; and I and Mrs. Barrett went home to Chelsea; about six o'clock in the evening I went to see if my box was at Mrs. Anderson's, and I see the cart turn from the corner as I got near to Mrs. Anderson's house, I went and asked if a box was left for me? says I, Mrs. Anderson, is there a box left here for me? she said, yes, here is a box left here for you, and you are to pay me eighteen-pence; I went in and saw the box, and it was open, I had locked it when I gave it him; I said, good God! my box is broke open; Mr. Anderson said, that is the way that the man left the box, accordingly I got two men to carry the box to Mrs. Barrett's (there is two handles to my box, one at each end) where I lodge, and instantly I got in I examined my box, the first thing of course I looked to was this box where my money was lodged, and I opened the box and there was but one guinea out of six, I said, Mrs. Barrett, I am robbed of five guineas; I unsolded every thing that I had, and shaked them out, and I examined every thing very carefully and very strictly, and not a single farthing but one guinea left out of the six guineas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180008"/>in this box where my husband's shirt buckles and knee buckles were.</p>

               <p>Q. When you get to Chelsea what part was broke open? - Did the cord remain on it? - The cord was loose on it, and an old mattress on it that I brought from the West Indies with me; I am an old traveller.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - In his own house, on Christmas morning; I went to him, and first of all the door was opened, and he was sitting on a chair by the fire side, I said, Mr. Green, how came my box to be broke open? says he, how do I know? says I, Mr. Green, you must know, for it was delivered safe locked and corded to you; says he, how do you know that it could not be broke open at Mrs. Anderson's; I then said to him, mind, I tell you that I come to acquaint you of what has happened with my box, I have lost five guineas out of it, and if you do not make me a restitution for my money, I certainly will go to Bow-street to-morrow morning; he said, you may go where you please, I will stand my trial for it. This happened to me on the 24th, and the 25th was Christmas Day; on the 25th I went to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was you to stay at Chelsea? - Till such time as I wrote a letter to my husband, and if my husband could not come from garrison I meant to go back to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life are you in? - I am nothing but a poor woman, and since this affair of the money being lost, I am living on the clothes I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you been doing with yourself since? - I landed from the West Indies July last; a gentleman heard of the ill situation of the Jerseys, and as such I was billetted at a very respectable house, the Magpie, at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you become possessed (in the situation in which you are in) of seven guineas when you set out from Norwich? - I was worth ten guineas when I set out from Norwich.</p>

               <p>Q. When you was in town and had only to go to Chelsea, why did not you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180009"/>put it in your pocket? - I did not think of any casualty.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon was it he left Bishopsgate-street? - I cannot tell that, because as soon as he took the box from me and put it in the cart, I left the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in town, before you set off yourself for Chelsea? - I set off immediately.</p>

The prisoner Quigley he was sitting in a hole close to the press, the other two prisoners, Bates and Tipson, about two yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180013"/>it, a picking up the blank halfpence, and there were a number that were stamped in a bag close by the press; and by the press I found the dies for stamping these halfpence, and likewise dies for farthings; but no farthings stamped, but a number of blanks, and a tool for smoothing the edge of these plain halfpence in the same place. In the two pair of stairs room I found a cutting tool for cutting the blanks one of the sheets of copper; here is some of the remains of the copper, and the seissle, this has been sheets of copper out of which the blanks have been cut of the size of halfpence; we then secured the three prisoners, and Mr. Aberloy went and searched for Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. What were their dress? - Quigley had a coat on, the other two were in jackets; Mr. Aberley went and brought the prisoner Cox down into the cellar, I asked Mr. Aberley, what have you got the landlord of the house with you? he said, yes; the prisoner was there at the time; Cox then asked if Mr. Aberley would let him go up into his room and let him shift his clothes? he was in a jacket himself, and was all black, and had a cap on; I think he had a jacket, I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his hands? - He was very black all over; he appeared the same as the others that were then working, Mr. Aberley went up stairs with him, I remained in the cellar with the others.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not see them at work, only sitting by the press? - I did not see them at the fly, because in coming down stairs they could very easily get from that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the halfpence that you have there, and the die, correspond? - They do.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. All this money produced, the halfpence and farthings, are they counterfeit? - They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bates. I would wish to ask Mr. Cook or Mr. Aberley, what I was particularly doing?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cox. I am a brass founder, and my shop lays at the back part of the house, and every body knows that brass founders are as dirty as chimney sweepers when they are at work. My wife dying last November, the last Christmas Tipson took the house, and was to pay me nine pounds a year out of fourteen pounds that I give for it, and I only kept the shop and was as a single man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bates. I went to this house. I am a cabinet maker by business; I was told that Mr. Tipson was below stairs in the kitchen, and I called in and Mr. Tipson desired me to come down stairs, I went down and I told him he owed me half a crown, and I was informed he could pay me; he said, he would pay me if I could take halfpence, and he gave me half a crown's worth of halfpence, and I told him they would be no use to me, such halfpence as them, and I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180014"/>packing them up as the officers came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Quigley. I have nothing further to say then that Mr. Tipson employed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Open them, see if they are your stockings? - Yes, they are my stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on them? - No, it is not the custom of our business to mark the stockings but the paper, and he left the paper on the counter and took the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there just ten pair of stockings in that parcel? - Yes.</p>

            How old are you? - Turned of fifteen. As I was going to ask my father to come to supper, I see this man at this butcher's door taking this piece of beef; he took it up and put it up in his black apron, and he crossed over the way to me, and said, what are you looking at? I asked him what did he think I was looking at? and he made an attempt to strike me, and then he goes down the street and went into this chandler's shop, and I ran back to this gentleman and told him that he was in a chandler's shop down the street, and he went with me and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you know the piece of beef by the sight of it? - Yes, I had just been cutting some steaks off it; I am very sure it was my beef.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along at six o'clock at night and I kicked over this piece of beef, I did not know what it was at first, it was so dark, and the first light I came to I took it in and I found it was a piece of beef, after I had been in about five minutes this man came in and said it was his beef.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. What is the value of that beef? - Six shillings it was valued at.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel public office. On the 22d of January, Thursday, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw this boy, Nash, with something in a kind of nail bag that the cooper's carry their tools in, and I see Jones following at a little distance, it was in King-street, Tower-hill; I suspected something, I went up to Nash -</p>
               <p>Q. In what direction were they going? - Towards East-smithfield. I asked him what he had got there? he said he did not know; he said, the cooper was behind who would tell me, I turned round and I observed Jones run up the corner of another street as sharp as possible; as soon as I said hold of the boy there happened to be a person just by, I gave Nash in charge of him and went after Jones, I went up to him and I said, now you have got the boy into a hobble you are going to leave him; he said, what boy? I don't know of any boy; on which I said to him, come with me down to him. I brought him back to the boy, and I asked the boy if that was the man? he said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing and presence of Jones? - It was as close as they stand now. I asked him what tho boy had got? he said, it was a little dirty grease that somebody had given to him, the scrapings of some casks; I examined it but I did not know it was oil myself, it was so froze and in such a congealed state.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy Nash say any thing more about it? - He persisted he did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180019"/>know what it was; I asked him where he had it from? he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that in the hearing of Jones? - No, he did not; I took Nash with me down into Thames-street, to shew me the warehouse where he had it from.</p>
               <p>Q. What warehouse did you go to? - On Chester Key, he said, that was the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you learned whose warehouse that is since? - I have seen Mr. Batley's clerk since that, and he says it is their warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see any of Mr. Batley's servants on that spot afterwards? Did you ever see Mr. Batley there? - No, I have not, I have seen his clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the magistrate was any thing said either by Jones or the boy? - Jones confessed it all before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it was taken in writing did any body tell him it would be better for him to confess? - No, there was nothing said of it in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of the property since? - It has been locked up in one of our places ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. It is now in a liquid state? - No, it is froze again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the care of it ever since? - The property has been in my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the property yourself from the prisoner? - Yes, from Nash.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Follitt? - I apprehended Wager, and he told of Follitt.</p>

               <p>Q. He says he see me and the boy go down with the oil; I went a different way. - He was behind the boy, when the boy got to the top of the gateway he was in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. He says, I said, I knew two people that would buy the oil, I never said such a word. - He said he knew two men in Petticoat-lane that he knew would buy the oil.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nash. That man says, that how I took oil into the cellar, and put it into a bag, it is a false thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Wager. Do you say it is true on your oath, what you said before? - It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nash. I am a hard working man, and being out of constant employ, I went down to the Key to see if I could earn a sixpence; and I walked down the Key, and was returning back again, finding no work to do, and as I was returning I see a fire; I went to the fire to warm my hands, and there Follitt asked me to carry a load, and directed me down into this cellar along with Jones, and one of them desired me to go to Petticoat-lane with it, with Jones, and when I came to Petticoat-lane, Jones sent me into a public house to call for a pint of beer; I went into the public house and called for a pint of beer, and Jones went to see if he could find this man that he was directed to with this oil, he could not, and he came back to me, and told me he would take the oil from whence it came; as I was coming back with it, one of the officers stopped me, and asked me what I had got there?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180023"/>I told him I did not know what it was, the man behind would tell him what it was; Jones as soon as he see I was stopped, turned round the corner, and went away from me; the officer followed him, and brought him up to me; he then denied he knew me; the officer asked me if that was the man, and I said. yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. On Thusday, the 22d of January, I was at work for Mr. Batley, on Brewer's Key; Mr. Batley sent for me three days before to do this job, out of charity, as I had no work to do. I have got a wife and three small children. So I finished this job about half past two o'clock, and I said to Wager, I am going; says Wager, you shall not go till we are done this job, and Wager d-ned his eyes, and said, I should not stir from the place till they had done; at last I consented, and lent them a hand to fill up the oil for about an hour; this bag was filled while I was filling the cask up, and I was ordered to go with it, by Wager's orders, and I went to the man that I was directed to, and the man was not at home, and the woman would not take it in, and so I agreed to take it back again, not knowing what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Follitt. I leave all it to my counsel.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the city. On Thursday night, the 6th of January, going round on my duty, between the hours of seven and eight, I was in Lad-lane, I observed the prisoner with a smock frock on in Lad-lane, I observed something to bulge out at the side under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking? - Walking; I stopped him and asked him what he had got? and he immediately took out this loaf of sugar from under his frock; I then asked him how he came by it; he said, he was a porter at Mr. Davis's and Newman's, in Fenchurch-street; I then searched him and perceived when I put my hands into his pocket; I said, my friend, I shall take you to the Castle, the corner of King-street, and search you; he said, I will go with you; he went with me very quietly, and then when we came to the Castle, I took one of these parcels of sugar from his pocket, and the other he gave me from his pocket; I then searched him farther and underneath his smock frock and waistcoat, in his breeches, I took this quantity of sugar, it contains moist sugar in two bags; I then searched him further, and in one of his jacket pockets I found fifteen nutmegs; I then went to Mr. Davis's and Newman's, in Fenchurch-street, and went to the counting house and did not hear that he belonged to that house, and there they went with me to Mr. Bennett's, where I found he was a servant.</p>

               <p>Q. You was present all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Jostling stopped him did you see the prisoner produce any thing from his smock frock? - He produced this loaf of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say where he came from or whom he lived with? - He said, he lived with Davis and Newman, in Fenchurch-street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180025"/>Q. Look first of all at the prisoner at the bar and tell me whether you know him? - I do. The prisoner at the bar, on the morning of the 18th of November, about eleven or twelve o'clock, came to the shop, saying he came by the desire of Mrs. Cunningham of Egham-green; he had two patterns in his hand to get for her a yard of muslin and three yards of callico, to pattern; I took down the muslin wrapper, telling him we had not any to match it, he pointed to one said that would do as she was not particular; I cut him off a yard of muslin, and afterwards three yards of callico to match his patterns, he then put them up, and he said he would call in Mrs. Cunningham's servant who was at the door, he brought in a person whom he gave Mrs. Cunningham's parcel to; he then asked me if Mr. Wattleworth was within? I told him no; he then said he wanted to look at some shirts, as he had just come from the Continent he said he would want a large quantity; I shewed him some shirts, in the mean time Mr. Wattleworth came in, I pointed to him and said, that is Mr. Wattleworth, on my saying so Mr. Wattleworth came and shewed him some shirts, and he and I afterwards had no more conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what past, or see what past between Mr. Wattleworth and him? - I was not present at the time; Mr. Wattleworth called to me to take down his address, I took a book which was kept for that purpose and afterwards shewed it to him; the name which he gave me was lieutenant colonel George Lyse, there was also put down Mrs. Cunningham, Egham-green, but whether that was made before or after I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him the book? - Yes, he said it was right.</p>
               <p>

            Had you made the entry of Mrs. Cunningham, and her address, from what you heard of the gentleman at the bar? - The yard of muslin and three yards of callico was down in the book, to Mrs. Cunningham, Egham-green.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take that down from what you heard at his mouth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You may as well produce the book where you took down the order, and the book where you have credited Mrs. Cunningham. (The order book produced.)(Witness reads from the order book.)</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant colonel Lyle, Mrs. Cunningham, Egham-green."</p>
               <p>(Reads from the credit book.) "Mrs. Cunningham, Egham-green, one yard of six-quarters sprigged muslin, twelve shillings; and three yards of nine-eighths white callico, five shillings." The shirt is put into the memorandum book till such time as we received his order.(Reads from the memorandum book.)</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant colonel Lyle, one half trimmed shirt." No mark, only our private mark for seventeen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did the prisoner come to you in the dress in which he is now in? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that he had lately come from the Continent? - I did not know the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it now that he has served in the army on the Continent? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, that he said that he had lately come from the Continent? - He said, he came from Mrs. Cunningham's, and she had been a ready money customer with Mr. Wattleworth, I supposed so; I had but lately come to Mr. Wattleworth's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where this ready money customer lived you did not know, whether at York or Barnet, or where, she might live at Egham-green, for what you know of your own knowledge? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. After having given credit for this muslin and callico, these articles were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180026"/>delivered to Mrs. Cunningham's servant? - So he said.</p>
               <p>Q. A servant in livery, was it? - I don't know that he was in livery.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a servant that was said to be Mrs. Cunningham's servant? - I don't know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after that time that he talked, or had said any thing to Mr. Wattleworth about the shirt? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that that bargain was completely struck as with Mrs. Cunningham, and delivered to Mrs. Cunningham's servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will get along to the shirt? - The shirt; Mr. Wattleworth came into the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>

            So this same person that had this bargain with you for the muslin and callico, he then applied to you for a shirt, stating that he had come from the Continent and wanted shirts? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was to take one home by the permission of Mr. Wattleworth? - That Mr. Wattleworth will best explain himself.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner was examined a great many times at Bow-street? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended on account of some gentlemen giving their opinion whether this was a felony or no? - I don't know, I was entirely under the direction of Mr. Wattleworth.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this shirt, who did you deliver it to? - To lieutenant colonel Lyle.</p>
               <p>

            Now before the magistrates at Bow-street, did not the major say that he was ready to pay for that shirt? - No, I did not hear him say so at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you at Bow-street? - I don't exactly recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't recollect the major offering to pay for the shirt? - I believe he sent up a person to our master, saying he would pay for what articles he had, and return the shirt; I think this was after the first night of his appearance at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after the first night of his appearance at Bow-street he sent up word to your master, offering to pay for all these articles and return the shirt? - Yes, I believe that is as near as I can state it; I heard it mentioned.</p>

               <p>Q.

He gave his address."Lieutenant colonel Lyle," which I desired my young man to put down, and either "Egham," or "Egham-green," I am not certain which, but it was put down in the order book, and shewn him, and he said it was right.</p>

            When did you see him next? - At the bar at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on Monday night, the 6th of January? - It may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before or after that make enquiry at Egham-green? - I did not before, it was afterwards; I made this enquiry myself, I went to Egham, I enquired in the first place of the overseer of the parish, and he went with me to several other persons, as he said, the oldest inhabitants of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you enquire for? - For Mrs. Cunningham; I found there was no such person at Egham, nor had lived at Egham for any time. The colonel was very well known there, but not Mrs. Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find such a place as Egham-green? - There is no such place as Egham-green, there is Inglefield-green; I did not go to Inglefield-green, but I made enquiry of those that kept house at Inglefield-green, and they said there was no such person lived there, there had been a person of that name who had lived there about eight or ten years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the value of the goods, is that a fair value that you put in the indictment? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of the colonel between that time and the time you saw him at Bow-street? - No, I did neither see nor hear of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mrs. Cunningham, we understand, had been a ready money customer of your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A Mrs. Cunningham had also lived at Egham? - At Inglefield-green there had been a Mrs. Cunningham, about eight or ten years, so I was informed.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of Mrs. Cunningham being a ready money customer, you was induced to give credit for these goods? - The credit was given before I came in, on his making use of the name of Mrs. Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Q. The making use of the name of Mrs. Cunningham, being a ready money customer of your's, you was induced to let him have the shirt to return the next morning? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to my learned friend, that Mrs. Cunningham was not known at Egham, but the colonel was known at Egham? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you that her address was at Egham or Egham-green? - Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not make any enquiry till after you had been at Bow-street, and I suppose you was induced to do so from the recommendation that you received there, to make enquiry about it? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the time that this shirt was lent in order to be returned the next day, that did not go the length to induce you to make any enquiry till after you see the prisoner at Bow-street? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at Bow-street there were three examinations? - There were.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180028"/>Q. I believe it was not until counsel's opinion had been had, that he was committed? - I know the counsel's opinion was had, and he was committed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how long was it before he offered to pay for the things? - I don't know that it was ever offered; the evening after my appearance at Bow-street, a person came to me and asked me whether I did not appear against lieutenant colonel Lyle? I told him I did; says he, sir, if he will pay you for the articles he has had of you, and return the shirt, will you give it up and not appear against him in the evening? I told him I knew nothing of him, who he was, or who he came from; and I believe he said he came from lieutenant colonel Lyle.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this whole long speech is, that this person said, he came from lieutentant colonel Lyle, and was ready to pay for the articles he had had. With respect to Mrs. Cunningham, the articles which he said were for Mrs. Cunningham, you had debited Mrs. Cunningham? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Not on his credit, but on her credit? - I placed it on her credit.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at Egham you went to the overseer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The overseer went about with you? - Yes, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. You probably looked at the parish books? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Egham is a large place we know? - It is.</p>

            Inglefield joins it? - It is a little distance from it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not enquire at every house? - Not at every house.</p>
               <p>Q. But you do not mean to swear that Mrs. Cunningham did not live at Egham? - I could not find her out, I conceive that every enquiry that was necessary, was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been sure about the name of the person that Mr. Lyle made use of? have you always said it was Cunningham? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you made some mistake about it; you first said it was Mrs. Graham? - I did, and I will tell you how that happened; in the Sunday pap I see the advertisement concerning lieutenant colonel Lyle being taken u and I went to Bow-street the next day to see if he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. This is going over the case again. - I am coming to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever say her name was Graham first? - I did; I said, to the best of my recollection, that I thought it was Graham; but I was at that time quite unprepared.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. In point of fact did you make enquiry at Inglefield-green? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you don't know of your own knowledge whether Mrs. Cunningham had lived there or not? - I had not been at Inglefield-green.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Though you did not go to Inglefield-green, did you enquire of the people at Inglefield-green? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever, from that time to this, heard or seen any thing of Mrs. Cunningham about these articles? - I never have.</p>
               <p>Q. And never any application from the colonel till after the affair at Bow-street? - Never till after the first appearance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told us that the prisoner had said that he came from the Continent. In point of fact, I believe he had been very ill? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that he had received some wounds? - I don't know that, he never told me that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner stated in his defence, that I was the malancholy truth that he had had the misfortune to stand at that bar; that since that time he had served<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180029"/>in the army on the Continent, that all was very well until at last some person found out that lieutenant colonel Lyle was major Semple, when he was obliged to return to England from ill usage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp addressed the court, that the case was not made out against the prisoner, inasmuch as the muslin and callico were got into the hands of a servant to Mrs. Cunningham, and credited by the prosecutor to Mrs. Cunningham, who was a customer before; and with respect to the shirt, it could not be felony, except he meant to convert it to his own use, and there was proof that he had offered to return it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller observed, that with respect to the first objection, Mr. Knapp was right, because taking it up in the name of a third person, would not make that a felony, but a fraud; but the shirt stood in a very different predicament, because that was taken up on his own ground, and not by the intervention of a third person; and Mr. Knapp's objection might go to a question of law, but he did not think the court was called to decide on the case on a dry question of law, but on the fact, which fact the jury must decide upon.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the Strand was it? - Near Exeter Change, The prisoner at the bar came up to me and asked me if I was a north countryman? I told him I was; we walked on about ten minutes, and he took something off the flags, on which he asked me to go into a house and see what it was; we went into a public house in the Strand, near Exeter Change, and he opened it out, and it was a red pocket book, he opened the brown paper, what he took up off the flags; within that pocket book there was this cross, in a box, and a piece of paper, saying it was value two hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You read the paper? - No, I did not; he read the paper to me. There was a stout man sitting in the room, and he said I had a right to fifty pounds, if it was of that value, as I had seen him take it off the flags; on which the prisoner said he had a friend that lived close by, and he would go and get the money; the other stout man and I walked out into the street, near Exeter Change, while he went to his friend.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened after he came back? - He returned, and said, his friend was not at home, but said, if I would leave what security I had, if I had any money, he would leave this property with me till to-morrow morning ten o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180030"/>when he would call on me again, and give me the money, and the fifty pounds, which he said I should have, and he never came back the next morning.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you say that is the same cross you had of him? - I made a mark on the back of the cross when I gave it to Mr. Fox.</p>

               <p>Q. What day were they taken away? - I think it was the preceding what is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180032"/>observed for the Queen's birth day, to the best of my remembrance between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen? - I was in the shop myself, there were two persons came into the shop, both unknown to me, as it should seem to buy some silver coat and waistcoat buttons; and I had not enough to make up the number that was wanted, and I was to make up the number the next day; on the day I lost them, one of these people, I should suppose it to be one of them, came, it should seem for the buttons, I produced them, and I expected the buttons were going to be paid for, and I was going to cast up what they came to, the price we agreed to the day before; at that instant there was but one, but just as the goods were made up, and ready to be taken away, another came in, and asked some frivolous questions about the lodger, or something.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the buttons? - On the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Coat and waistcoat buttons? - Yes, both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they silver? - Yes, silver buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - When the second person had opened the door and asked me a certain question about a lodger I knew nothing of, that took my eye for a short space of time from the person that was in the shop before, at that very instant I imagine it to be, it was, that the buttons were missing from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were missing? - Sixteen of each; sixteen coat, and sixteen waistcoat buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after that? - The parties went out of the shop, but in my confusion I am unable to say which went out first.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner either of those men? - I knew him when he was brought back to my shop, then I knew him; the knowledge I have of him now I got of him from what I see of him after he was brought back; the transaction happened at candle light, I minded my business more than I did his face.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm on missing these things? - Yes, I made an alarm very soon after; I hesitated a moment whether I should pursue or not; in short, in the situation I was in, I cannot say whether I jumped over the counter, or went round the counter, but I am told that I jumped over the counter; he was taken in consequence of my alarm, in about two hundred yards, and brought back very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the man that bargained about the buttons, or that talked about the lodger? - This must be the one, if I am not mistaken, that talked with me about the buttons; I looked on him so, he said it was another.</p>
               <p>Q. You must say whether you have a certainty as to that. Do you mean to be positive? - I would wish to stand clear so as to bring nothing bad upon myself; while I was looking at a second person, there was a possibility that my sense of sight might be deceived; I have the greater reason to believe that he is the man, but I may be mistaken, my eye being taken off for a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back was any thing found on him? - When he was taken I was in pursuit, and the things were produced to me that I missed out of St. Martin's church yard; I searched him myself; I felt him in this manner, and I found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were the things brought back to you after he was taken? - I had the things before he arrived in the shop again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your buttons again? - It would be very hard to say I knew every button again, they were plain silver buttons; the coat buttons were on a card, and the breast buttons were each<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180033"/>in a bit of paper to keep them from rubbing one against the other.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This took place by candlelight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of seeing him by daylight? - Not by daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was more intent on the business than in looking at the prisoner's face? - That is a fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you did not take much notice of his face at all? - I cannot say that I did. It was by the over persuasion of my neighbours that I entered into the prosecution; I had nothing to build upon but his being brought back to me.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by saying that you judge he was the same person by being brought back to you? - I should suppose by the parties taking of him, and bringing him back, that he was the man.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a butcher by business; I took the prisoner; I was going out of the shop with the tray of meat on my shoulder, hearing a cry of stop thief coming out of the shop, and seeing him come past, I tried to catch him if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else with the prisoner? - I see the mob coming after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were nearest to him, you or the other people? - I took him at the bottom of the court, I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the first that got up to him? - Yes; when I got up to him I asked for a light to see if I could find any thing that he had thrown away, he said it was no use to look there, there was nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any act like throwing away any thing? - No, but he said we should find the buttons up in the church yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ran through the church yard? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the church yard? - An hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him running through the church yard? - No, I see him coming down the court.</p>

            What did you do with these buttons? - Packed them up, and they were taken to Mr. King's shop, and the prisoner likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the prisoner to Mr. King's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. King seem to know any thing about the man? - He did not seem to mind much himself, his neighbours over persuaded him to do it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the buttons? were they delivered to Mr. King? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not seen him at all in St. Martin's Church-yard? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see another man that the mob were pursuing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you cannot recollect exactly what was said. Was it not said that a man had dropped them in St. Martin's Church-yard, and you should find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180034"/>them there? you cannot charge your memory that he did not say a man had dropped them there? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you brought the buttons here? - Yes. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all about the buttons; when I came to the bottom of the court another gentleman stopped me, and not that man, and this man came up immediately after and laid hold of me, and they said the buttons were in the mud; I said I knew nothing at all about them, they said, which way did I come? somebody said, across the church yard; I made answer and said, you must look into the church yard; they went back into the church yard and found them there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to his character, who gave him the character of a good boy, but said that his mother had unfortunately married, and his father-in-law had not used the boy so well as he ought, and had turned him out of doors.</p>

Did you see that? - No, I did not; I brought her back into the house again, and I see her thrown down the tea spoons on the ground, I picked them up immediately and knew them to be my own property; with that I see her hand in her pocket and I took it out, and took these silk stockings out of her pocket; I then see her wrapping up something in a rag in her hand, and I insisted on seeing what it was, and there were five keys in it, pick lock keys which did not belong to me; I see her after that take another key up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - Yes, the three sheets, the three gowns, and the worsted stockings I found in the next door entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the door that she past? - I took upon it that she went out of my house into that, in the situation I see her, she was coming out of that door.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you done with the things? have you kept them ever since? - No, they have been in the constable's possession, sealed up at the justice's.</p>

            What was the chaise in the street? - In the street. I was gone but a very little while, I said to my fellow servants, let us go and set the chaises to rights, draw them a little closer together; in the mean time, when I came down, I see the chaise door open, and I looked and see the whip and reins gone, and this gentleman came down and said he saw this lad take them out of the chaise, while I was talking about the loss.</p>

               <p>I was looking out of my own window in Holborn, on Monday, the 19th, there were five chaises assembled together for sake of taking some boys down to a school, I see the prisoner at the bar come down the yard, I live only four or five doors off, and he went to the fifth chaise and took the reins out, and the whip; I see him pass the sadler's, which is near there, and it gave me a suspicion; a little while after that I said to my wife, that boy has stole this property, because if they had sent to have them mended, he certainly would have taken them to the sadler's; my wife said, we may as well have our dinner, it is one o'clock; she looks out of window and says, I dare say what you say is right,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180036"/>for they are all assembled about the chaise. I went down and asked the men if they had lost such property or no? they told me they had; and I told them that I see such a person take them out of the chaise, and I went round and I see the prisoner at the bar paying very great attention to the hackney coachmen, about thirty yards from where he took the property; the hostler was with me, and I told him that was the boy that stole his property, and he went and took him up immediately to the public office, Hatton-garden, and he was committed; and that is all I know of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he had taken the property was it you see the prisoner? - To the best of my recollection it could not be more than three quarters of an hour. I am positive that is the lad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you see me take the property, why did not you stop me?</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did these reins belong to you as a hostler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find your own whip and reins? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them? - I could not replace them for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a working lad, I sell fruit about the streets, and I know nothing what they have alledged against me.</p>

I told him I had heard say it was; and then we crossed over together into the Park, and he met with an old gentleman, and he said he would go up to this old gentleman and ask him where the king's jeweller lived.</p>

               <p>Q. Did this lady or her husband hold any conversation with you on this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what and when it was? - I was sent for to attend the prisoner at Hatton-garden, at the police office, the latter end of January; I was there, I believe, an hour before the prisoner was bought up; I there see Smith, the husband, this woman, and Lucas, the officer; Lucas asked me whether the friends of Peters would advance any money to make it up, I told him that I did not know any thing at all about that, and I did not choose to interfere in the business; Mr. Smith and Mr. Lucas said to me, don't you think it better for the business to be postponed for a week to enable Peters to raise the money? and then they spoke to me concerning an estate which Peters considered himself as entitled to, and asked me whether I thought he was entitled to it? and whether he would give a bond as security for the money? I spoke to Peters about it, and he said, he would not; then they told me it was to be an hundred pounds, and Lucas and Mayne were to have fifty.</p>

               <p>Q. Who told you so? - Lucas and Smith; we had a long conversation, and I am certain there had been two applications to the prisoner at the bar to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that, now from conversation that you held with Smith and Lucas, or from what you recollect from others? - No, from Smith and Lucas they mentioned two names that they had applied to, George and Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wife present in hearing this conversation? - Yes, and by her consent it was postponed a week.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith. I know nothing further than this, that as we had been at the loss, we had better give it up than get into further trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear of his having been taken up on this indictment? - On the Sunday morning he was taken on this charge, he came with Lucas and Mayne, the two officers, to my house; Lucas made this observation to me, that he thought I was somewhat interested for Mr. Peters, an account of an estate which Peters was entitled to, that I had advanced money on it, that they had just then taken him, and wished to know if I would either give a note or promise any sum of money; that Mrs. Smith had never seen him, and that they would undertake to turn him up before the magistrate, and they took him from my house to Mayne's, in Ratcliffe-highway, and told me that he should remain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180042"/>there for two or three days, in hopes of my coming forward with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any body else about any business of this sort? - Lucas came to me after that, alone, I believe it might be six or seven days after; it was the day before he was going to have his examination, and he told me if I could procure him ten guineas he would endeavour to get him off for a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Peters; - Some years; I have a very honest good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lent him money? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. To Sugden. This man has lodged in your house? - I remember him ever since I was a little girl; I never knew any harm of him in my life, and I knew him twenty years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you constantly beds in that house there? - Generally. My business is such that there may, or there may not be any there, when I bought any I took and put them up there; I am a cabinet maker and upholsterer, I have one house at the corner of Cross-lane, and another in St Giles's parish, directly facing, and then I have another house just by; I have all these three houses, and I live the corner of Cross-lane, and the robbery was committed in the little house facing where I live, in St. Giles's parish.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the window? - A few minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see at that time any body running away, or any thing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here that see what past? - No, there is nobody here that see what past.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen whether the sash was down before? - Yes, it was down before, we fasten it down with a nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it down when you went backwards to this shed? - Yes. Lane and Cole, the constables, found the cannister.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know it is my cannister by the T. R. that I put on it when I bought it before I put my tea in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this taken out? - Between the hours of seven and nine, being in such confusion I did not take particular notice of the time, for I did not expect I should find the property again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sermon. When they came and searched my room as I was informed, they pulled and hauled, and if the cannister was in my room I know nothing of it. Lane keeps a chandler's shop himself.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. How long had you been out of the shop before you heard the alarm? - Not long, for I brought the wood backwards and forwards as I chopped it up.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a house. On the 11th of January, between the hours of seven and nine, in the evening, I was robbed; I came home about a quarter past eight, and found my house broke open and my drawers; my house is full of lodgers, the upper part, but not downwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you lock up when you went out? - My back parlour and the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the part of the house you live in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out? - Between two and three o'clock, but I had a brother that called at my house at seven and it was all safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not lock the outer door because the lodgers were in the house? - I did not. When I came home I found the door broke open and the lock bent, bursted off, the hold fast of the door bursted off in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You go through your shop to the parlour? - No, through a passage to the parlour. It was my parlour door that was broke. When I got in I found my drawers had been rifled, some were left half shut and some open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you locked them when you went out? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss out of your drawers? - Four silk handkerchiefs, a gown, a pair of breeches, a shirt, five muslin aprons; all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of your things again? - Mr. Richardson that lived in the same street where we do, had a search warrant to search this

               <p>Q. Of all the articles in the indictment you identify but the under waistcoat? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure all the things in the indictment were in the room when you went out? - Yes, every thing was safe when we went out, and they were missing when we came home.</p>

               <p>Q. What may be the value of them? - Twelve shillings. The 17th of February, the prisoner at the bar along with another woman, came into my shop and wanted to look at some cloth; I shewed two or three pieces, and sold them five yards and a half; after that they wanted to look at some shawls; I shewed them a great many different patterns, I had no pattern that would please them, I missed one pattern of shawls, and by the behaviour of the prisoner at the bar I supposed that she had them; I then called my young man out of the back shop, and sent him for a constable; the constable came, and I gave him the charge of this woman, the prisoner at the bar, and told him that I had a suspicion that she had some of my property, and the constable searched her and found the shawls on her; the constable has got them, his name is Moring.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My friends were with the prosecutor yesterday, and he promised faithfully he would not appear against me; therefore I have none of my friends ready. It is but five weeks since I buried my husband, and he has left me with two children. A young woman was out of place, and asked me to go with her to buy a shawl, and we drank a little two much, and when I drink a little spirits I have a very bad head, and how those shawls came into my pocket I really don't know.</p>

It is about a fortnight to-morrow, I went out and double locked the chamber door, the outer door is generally open; when I came home my child says, mother, you have been robbed; and I went up stairs to my room, and I found the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge her with stealing the blankets? was she an acquaintance of your's? - No, I never see her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her? - I did stop her; I sent for an officer to take her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at your blanket? - From the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. If you found nothing on her when you stopped her, how was it you had her committed? - I missed the blanket off the bed, and she followed me down stairs, and said, never mind the blanket, and wanted to send for a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A candlestick that has never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after she was taken up? were any duplicates found on her? - The officer found a great many duplicates on her, but nothing belonging to me; she had made away with the duplicate that she had pawned the blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your blanket, since? - Yes.</p>

It was the 16th of January, between five and six in the evening, near six, it was after dark; I see the prisoner and two in company with him; I see them standing about the shop window, indeed one of my servants told me they were about; I went out and watched them, and I see the prisoner open Mr. Waithman's shop door, put his hand in and draw a piece of linen from the window; he had it about half way from the window, when I caught hold of his hand, and had a scuffle with him, and dragged him into the shop, and there was a patrol coming by at the time, and he was given charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how this linen was, in a bundle or loose, or how? - It was in the window, as linen drapers generally have for a shew.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole dragged out? - No, it was not, it was a large piece about ten yards, and only part of it was dragged out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say from the situation in which you found him, and from the situation in which it was at the window, that every part was removed from the window? - No, I do not believe the whole was removed, the greatest part was.</p>

               <p>Q. There is a knife that you delivered to Armstrong, did you get that knife from them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that knife brought to you the same time the things were sold to your mother? - Yes, I came in just then to see my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your mother give for them, do you remember? - Four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to produce that knife? How came you by that knife? - Because I had it given to me, and I kept it for myself; the young man, James Good, gave it me at the time he sold these things to my mother, he gave it me when I went to light him down the stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it? - Saturday the 3d of January; I heard Good say to Van<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180057"/>dersall, it them two jewelles were stopped they were afraid they would tell the truth; Vandersall said, I have given her a pin to put in her handkerchief. I had seen the two prisoners talking to the two jewesses, the two witnesses, and I immediately communicated what I had heard to the magistrate, and the magistrate sent for the girls through that.</p>

            Did you miss articles of that description? - Yes, I knew of the articles that were in the window, I firmly believe the whole to be my property, but this wine funnel has got the private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that was in the window at the time? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pot sold such things with this mark on it? - Not lately.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the general value of all the things that are there that you believe to be your's? What may be the value of the things now produced? - About two guineas; but the woman has sold as many articles as fetched her five pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Good. When I was taken Mr. Armstrong asked me if I had got any money? I said, a guinea; and he said if I would give him two guineas he would let me go, and because I would not give two guineas he took me to prison and said he would try to get forty pounds by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Vanderfall. I bought a watch at this woman's house. and Mr. Armstrong came into a public house where I was having a pint of beer, and when he searched me he found the duplicates of a watch and ring, and I told him where they were in pawn, and he could find no owner to the watch, and he took me to the office; I don't know nothing of this affair what he took me for now.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. Did you ask them for two guineas? - No, never in my life to them nor any other man.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180060"/>Prisoner. My Lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am now brought on my trial a second time for the same offence; I am advised that it is not the same so far in law, as to entitle me to plead my former acquital; the charge before was for uttering a forged draft for five pounds, with intention to defraud Messrs, Ransom and Co. the charge to day, is for uttering a draught for ten pounds.</p>
               <p>The jury that then tried me, acquitted me, and I will beg leave to state shortly, as before, the manner in which I became possessed of these bills. As I was lately an officer in his majesty's navy, I was obliged to be often at Portsmouth, I became there acquainted with one Macdonald at the Blue Posts, where I lodged, he did not lodge there but in some private apartments in the town. Almost as soon as our acquaintance commenced he told me he was going to America; among other intercourses, we went together to play at billiards, where at other places as well as at Portsmouth, we played for small sums; I won a very large sum of him at Portsmouth, and he applied to me for fifty pounds, which he lost; and then applied to me for another fifty pounds, and as I had won the greatest part of his money that he had lost since the time of our acquaintance, I lent to him; and I lent him a third fifty pounds. As he was going out of the country I thought it would be proper to have some security, and he said he would give me some bills. In about a week or a fortnight after I went to Northampton, soon after my arrival there he made a remittance to me of three checks, one of five pounds, one of ten pounds, and one of fifteen pounds, all of them drawn by Mr.

             on Messrs. Hammersley; I soon after returned to town, and on Sunday the 31st of August, I paid one five pound check to Mr. Lewis's servant, and the other two I sent by a servant to Messrs. Ransom's, the bankers, and all of them were actually paid at the banker's, and no questions have ever arisen on them to my knowledge; from this treatment of Macdonald, I had reason to believe I was treating with a person of honour; on my return to town I met with him at the New Exchange coffee house, when I mentioned to him my desire of having the remainder of the debt being paid, and he gave me three other checks, purporting to be drawn as before, which I immediately sent for payment by a servant, but on their being presented Mr. Moreland stopped them, and desired to see me, and I went immediately to Mr. Moreland, he then informed me that my checks were forged; I then said, I would endeavour to find Macdonald; I informed Mr. Moreland by whom they were paid to me. I did not see Macdonald that night, but I see him some time the next morning at the coffee house, when I stated the circumstance to him, and he expressed a considerable passion, and with apparent resentment set off to go to Mr. Moreland's, and returned in great haste in about half an hour, telling me he had explained the matter to Mr. Moreland's satisfaction, I then thought that the alarm that Mr. Moreland had made on my mind was an unjust suspicion, and Mr. Macdonald then took from his pocket a letter, which he informed me he had received from Mr. Exton, by that day's post, containing two checks signed by Mr. Exton; and they were signed different than those he gave me. I looked at the two last checks, and from the circumstance of the two first checks being paid, I relied on Macdonald's veracity; of these two last checks. one was for twenty-one pounds, payable to Mr. Ryland, or bearer, and which has never been negociated; the other was for ten pounds, payable to Mr. Brooke, or bearer, and which I paid to Mr. Lewis,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180061"/>Saturday, the 13th of September, and I received of him in exchange, three pounds sixteen shillings, and which I understand was presented by him, or his servant, to Messrs. Ransom's, who stopped payment, and I was apprehended on the usual charge of uttering it, knowing it to be forged. I shall here beg leave to call to your consideration, the evidence on the trial for the first indictment, one of the witnesses proved that I paid it to him for money due to Mr. Lewis, for goods, which he then objected to taking, on a supposition that it was not a good one, on which I told him if it was not good I had two others of the same, and to take it home, and if his master did not like it I would take it back, on that I called on him on the Tuesday or Wednesday following for the change, which he gave me, the bill having been paid. It was also proved by Mr. Francis Heslop, that some considerable time after paying the five pounds, on being sent for to Mr. Ransom, I went there without any hesitation; I related the facts as I have to you to day, and so satisfied was Mr. Moreland of my innocence, that he did not detain me, and on the last trial so satisfied were the jury of these facts, that they acquitted me of the crime laid to my charge.</p>
               <p>I have communicated to you all the circumstances of my first meeting with Macdonald to the present time, and I must here request your particular attention to the times when the foregoing transactions took place. The first checks were paid the latter end of August 1794. On Sunday, the 31st of August, I paid one to a servant of Mr. Lewis's, who objected to take it; my answer was to him, that if it was not good I had two others of the same; in regard to the other three checks which I sent by a servant to Mr. Moreland, the banker's, and who desired to see me, I went to Mr. Moreland's without restraint; Was this the act of a guilty mind? had I a guilty conscience, should not I rather have sled? Mr. Moreland was so well convinced of my innocence that he suffered me to go at large; from Messrs. Ransom and Co. I never sled, but immediately sought after Macdonald, and never changed my lodgings to the time of my apprehension; taking all these circumstances together, is it at all surprising, that any suspicion that I had entertained against Mr. Macdonald should vanish? that I did not question Mr. Macdonald, is certain; that I am not guilty myself, is unquestionable; for if I had known they had been forged, I would not have paid two checks to Mr. Lewis, and after I had done so I would not have gone home to my lodgings, solely to give the prosecutor an opportunity of apprehending me; would any one of you have acted so? surely not. The great difficulty by witnesses to prove the negative, is a hard matter; add to this, I am not twenty years of age, and Mr. Macdonald is a great deal older, and no wonder that he easily prevailed on my credulity.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, under all these circumstances, I trust you will not reverse the verdict of the former jury; that you will not inser that to which the facts do not lead you, and consign me to an ignominious punishment, that is to an awful death; it is a maxim of justice, that it is better that many guilty persons should escape the punishment their crimes deserve, than one innocent person should perish.</p>

               <p>Q. On a bill being presented to your house, I believe you sent for Mr. Gillchrist? - It was on three bills being presented; they were three bills, purporting to be drawn by Mr. Exton; they were referred by the clerk to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180062"/>Q. On your sending for Mr. Gillchrist he came? - He did, he came to me on Friday, the 5th of September, in consequence of these bills being presented.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state to you when he came, of whom he had received these bills? - He stated he had received them from a certain Mr. Macdonald.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he made the same representation to you, as he has done to day in his defence? - I told him I believed the bills were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. From the conversation that took place, you was so far convinced as to let him depart? - The readiness in which he came, the peculiarity of his person, and many other things, there are certain things that impress one with an idea at the moment; on that general impression he went away, to come again on Monday morning, the 8th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. This bill was uttered by this gentleman on the 12th of September, and it was on the 5th of September that this conversation took place, and that was in consequence of three bills coming to your house? - They came in a suspicious manner to our house, by the waiter of a coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. He was to return to you on the 8th, did he return on the 8th? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever return to you? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mr. Macdonald never came to you? - I know nothing of such a person.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon was it after you missed these things, that you saw this tea board? How soon after the 20th of January? - I cannot say that I made any particular memorandum; I did not miss it at all till she was taken up, and her lodgings searched.</p>

               <p>Sometime ago the prisoner came and took a lodging at our house, and was there two or three days, and went away, being detected stealing a candlestick of my lodger, and she took away part of my furniture then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you missed the things, that she lodged with you? - After she left the place I naturally went into the room, to see if there was any thing missing, and I missed a great many things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of these things on her? - I found a rug on her bed, a sheet and a tea board.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find this rug on her bed? - I believe it was the 20th of last month, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - Nothing else belonging to me, but a ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean a duplicate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I see there is a woollen blanket, a feather pillow and feather bolster; do you know any thing about that? - They were lost a great while ago, my servant can tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180064"/>better about that; they were found at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you had oceasion to look into her room that you had let, then it was you missed these things? - No, I missed these things since she left my apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards? - Lately, last month.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed things before? - I missed a blanket and bolster before, but I did not think it worth while to seek after them.</p>
               <p>Q. All these things were let by you with the lodgings? - About a few nights before she was taken with the things in her apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to attend me? - Did you let your lodging to any body after the prisoner went from it? - Yes, I did to be sure, to a single man, the same man is there now.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether these things that you complain of being taken at the time you let the room to the man, were in the room or not you cannot tell? - They were in an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the prisoner going away? - Yes, about two months ago, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the single gentleman been your lodger? - I cannot recollect, he came a few days before the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they unlet to any body? - I cannot tell, there might be somebody have lain in them for a night.</p>

            Upon your oath did you receive any hire for your lodging, between the time that woman left it, and the young man took it? - Except I might let it for a night if a person wanted a bed, there might be a gentleman now and then come to sleep one evening or so.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a public house, is it not? You take in any body who say they want a bed? - No, not any body.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body comes and sups at your house, and has a pot or two of beer, and wants a bed, you let him have a bed? - Not without they are recommended.</p>
               <p>Q. If they are recommended don't you let it for one night? - Very seldom for one night.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to the jury, that during the time the young woman went away, down to the time the young man took the lodgings, you might have let the lodgings at different times to different persons? - No, not them lodgings, there was nobody that slept in them but the children, that I can remember.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know whether these things were lost during the time that she had your lodging, or was it afterwards? - It was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing your things afterwards? - I found them in her apartment; I missed them when the young man was going to bed, which was the 19th of last month.</p>

            Not missing them till then, will you swear the exact time when they were lost? - They were stole about five o'clock, while I was at tea; the young man went to bed sooner than ordinary, and I missed the things.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you missed them and found them, but I want to ask you this question, which I think is a very plain one; if you only missed them the 19th, the young woman was gone then three months, how can you say when they were gone? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180065"/>say some of them where gone when I made the bed that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that on this 20th of January, all the articles were there? - I see the sheet, the rug, the tea board, and the ticket of my husband's coat.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the city of London. On the 5th of the present month Mr. Pressy came, in order to obtain a search warrant; I went with him and searched the lodgings of the prisoner, at the house of Mr. Hayworth's the 5th of February; I found a pocket book containing of upwards of seventy duplicates; in searching over the duplicates Mr. Hayworth owned some of the goods to be his, and Mr. Pressy said that a great coat was his, and likewife a blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were two duplicates of Mr. Pressy's property? - Yes, and likewise on her bed was a sheet which Mr. Pressy said was his, and likewife the rug on the bed, and the tea board, and another duplicate we found afterwards, of a bolster and pillow together.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept the sheet, rug, and tea board ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe this woman is a married woman, is not she? - I have heard such.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the lodging of herself and her husband? - I don't know nothing about her taking the lodging, I don't know any thing more of the lodging, than I found her at the room.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This sheet I know, it is my own mending, the rug I brought from I slington; the tea board I broke two pieces out of it myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You tell us just now that one of the articles you mended? - The sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A great while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years? - I cannot say as to years.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be two or three years? - I don't think it was so long as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to every old thing that you have in your house? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to this old thing, mended and patched, whether you mended it six months ago, twelve months ago you cannot tell? - The value of the sheet is not worth swearing to.</p>
               <p>Q. But you mean to swear to it from having darned it? - It is mended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to every piece of work you do? This is an old thing? - Old things must not be thrown away.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the rug? - I cannot swear to the rug.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had the rug? - I cannot justly tell how long I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whar is that rug worth? - What you please.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't want a rug at present; but what do you charge for it? - A penny.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to this tea board? It is a very common thing to be sure at every public house; I dare say it never happened to you to see a tea board broke so. I dare say you never had the misfortune to break a tea board in this way? - That is my tea board, I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see a tea board notched in this way? - I have seen that many a time, and many a comfortable dish of tea I have had off from it; if I had not lost more things than these, I would not have been here.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notches do you mean to swear to here? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. So that there is no mark or name, only these notches on it? - And is not that enough?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180066"/>Court. Did you find the things the day they were missed? for the officer says he found them on the 5th of February. Did you find them the day they were missed? - No, I did not; they were found last Tuesday fortnight.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Fleming; I took in a blanket of the prisoner at the bar, on the 5th of August, and delivered it up to the person that claimed it before the Lord Mayor, Mrs. Pressy.</p>
               <p>Q. You art sure to the person of the prisoner? - Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are sure it was the 5th of August 1794? - I am certain it was.</p>
               <p>Court to Davenport. Have you got the duplicate? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Pressy. Have you the blanket here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you recollect whether the prisoner at the bar was in your house the 5th of August? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Pressy. Do you recollect whether the prisoner was in your lodging in August last? - I believe she was; I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Pressy. Was this blanket one that was let to her with her lodgings? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rug? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The sheet? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went on the last Tuesday in November, to take Mr. Pressy's lodgings, and I left it on the 2d of December last; I was but one week in it, and I never went to the house after that but once, and that was when I went to demand my things that were there, and to pay them my week's rent. As to that blanket I pledged it the 5th of last August for to pay earnest for lodging; and the bolster and pillow were in pledge a twelve month, and I fetched them out, and being short of money, I pledged them again the latter end of September, or beginning of October, I cannot tell which. There is never one of the articles that Mrs. Pressy ever saw with her eyes till she see them after I was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180067"/>Mr. Knapp. There is no doubt that if the jury are satisfied that the things were pledged during the time that she lodged in this house, they are not the subject of this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. But she must make that out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the rug, I have had it four years; the sheet I don't know how many years; and the duplicates I found in Clare-market; and I never went to see after any of the goods, my husband said they were nothing to us.</p>

            , to let Mr. Gant have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity to deliver? - Upwards of five hundred quatero; housed to send for twenty or thiety quarters a day.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was to be delivered on that day? - They were to deliver thirty-four quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only order for that day delivered to them? - It was, there was no other delivered to them that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Chandler any person employed by you at any time? - No, I never see Chandler before I see him the night he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any corn was missing from that place? - When the bulk of corn went away, the quantity that was in that warehouse was cleared away, there appeared to be a deficiency of fifty-two quarters and four bushels; it was cleared away in two or three days. The quantity was six hundred and one quarters when landed, and when it came to go away it was fifty-two quarters short of that.</p>
               <p>Q. After Pearce had delivered this quantity that was ordered for Mr. Gant, was it his business to stay in the warehouse, or quit? - I gave him orders to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180068"/>stay in the warehouse till six o'clock at night, left Mr. Gant might send for more.</p>
               <p>Q. But no more than the thirty-four quarters were sent for by Gant? - No, not that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You superintend this warehouse and employed a number of hands to deliver out the corn? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner do you give them the order? - I give them a written order and tell them who are the persons that are coming for the corn, and the persons that come for the corn bring a written order.</p>
               <p>Q. On this occasion, there was a bulk called Mr. Gant's bulk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had desired Pearce to deliver out a quantity to Mr. Gant? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gant sent different carts and waggons for that quantity? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when it was delivered? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know what carts or what waggons he sent, or what persons he sent? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that corn has not been given out without a written order? - Never without I give a verbal order.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in the case of Gant; Mr. Gant was a person that bought a great quantity of you; in such a case it was possible to have corn delivered without having a written order? - He gave an original order at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that for every small quantity there was a written order given? - It always was, except it was a person that had corn frequently, that was known perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in a case like that of Mr. Gant's it has happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That delivered to Mr. Gant, was it delivered by written order or not? - It was delivered by written order.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there could be no verbal order in the case of Mr. Gant? - There could not.</p>
               <p>Court. The quantity that was delivered to Gant that day was delivered by a written order? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The question I put to you is this, If such a man who had corn often, if he had applied to Pearce without your knowledge, whether Pearce would have been justified in letting him have it? - Mr. Gant would have sent down a note by him at night.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, if in that day Mr. Gant having received all according to the written order, had thought fit to have sent

               <p>Arthur Keating was called on his recognizance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These things that were pledged, were not pledged by me, though not without my knowledge; there was a week's rent due, and I told her I was only going away for a couple of days, and meant to go back, and take the things back again. On the Saturday following she took me in Rathbone-place; she knocked me about the street, telling every body I had robbed her; when she took me to Bow-street, she said, if I would pay her a fortnight's rent, she would do nothing with me. On the Thursday following Mr. Connolly said, if I would release the things and pay the rent for the time I was absent, he would not prosecute me; I could not do it, I sent to my sister to do it, and she was willing to release the things, but not to pay the rent.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any linen the 6th of last month? - Yes, these things were all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180074"/>away between the hours of seven and eight, a table cloth, three aprons, a gown, and a half handkerchief with my name on it, and a pocket handkerchief, and a cap with double borders.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where these things were on the 6th of January? - They were put in a clothes basket to be washed, by my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she put the articles in the clothes basket? - I know because she always, on Tuesday morning put the clothes in the clothes basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not she come here? Is she not well? - She is well, but has a large family. I see the things again at the police office, Westminster, after the prisoner was taken up at her lodgings. The prisoner was a servant to me, she lived in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Because you speak of her being taken up at her lodging? - She took a lodging after she left me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she leave you? - On the 6th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she with you in the forenoon? - She was, till between six and eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. She left your house that night? - She did, about twenty minutes before eight, I went out and I left her in the house, going backward to the wash-house with some dishes to wash up; I went out to go on my duty, as I belong to the patrol of St. Bride's parish; I went out to go to the watch-house, then my wife called her in.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell me what your wife said, I thought you knew better. - I know no further. My wife sent for me home about two or three minutes, before the clock struck eight, and I came home.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came home was the prisoner there? - No; mor I did not see the prisoner from that night till the Saturday following, this was Tuesday, and on the Saturday following I see her and apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when you did see here? - In the Broad way, very near the police office; I see her, and I stepped up to her, and said, Mary, what made you run away, and take away so much of my property? she made me no answer; I took her home to see if she would confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any information that you would forgive her if she would confess? - I am very sensible that I did not; I took her home, she would not speak to me, and she went into the back parlour to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what she told your wife? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. She said nothing to you? - No, but to my wife; then I took her from my apartment to the police office, and in taking her I see my half handkerchief tied about her head, with my name on it.</p>

            How long before this had you seen this handkerchief of your's? - I had seen it almost every day, but being cold weather I did not wear it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the Tuesday that she went away? - I suppose two days, I will not say exactly, I suppose it might be about Monday that I put it off my neck, and throwed it among the dirty linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else? - The constable was sent with me to the lodging, and found the rest of the things in her apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were her lodgings? - At the top of Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were her lodgings? - The woman that she lodged with was with her, and she says, what is the matter you have taken up this girl?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180075"/>I said, she was a thief, I have taken her up for thieving my property; says she, she has come to lodge with me, and I will not go home to my house till you get an officer to come and search the lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear her tell you that she had come to lodge with her? - Certainly she did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in her hearing that you said the woman should come and search her lodgings? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that woman here? - No, she is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to search the lodging? - An officer, he is not here, I went with him and the landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did she lodge in? - The one pair of stairs front room. The officer searched the room, and found the different articles that are mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You was present? - Yes; two aprons were found in the room, and the cap was sent out to be washed, and the gown cut into a bed gown, and the handkerchief and the table cloth; the prisoner was not by when the room was searched, she was confined in Tothillfields, directly after we went to Tothillfields, we went back to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things that were found? - Here they are.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom were they delivered? - They were in the hands of the officer, and as he is bad a bed, and cannot be moved, he begged of me to take them; I am able to swear that they are my things that we found, and that they are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable go before the grand jury? - Yes, he is bound over, that was the session before this, she was sick the last session, and could not be tried.(The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. You had no expectations that she would go away at that time? - No. This is the apron, I can swear that this is my wife's property; I know the check, I know her to wear them a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to them as well as your wife? - Yes, I can. Here is a gown I bought five years ago; she cut it up into a bed gown, but I can speak to its being the same gown, though it is cut up; I know it by the colour; I can swear to it that it is my wife's; there is no mark on it except the print. This is the double bordered cap, I know it is one of her caps, it is rather the worse for wear. This is an apron that I can swear to, it has got a slit in it, there is no mark on it. This is the half handkerchief with my own name on it; this is what the constable took from her head at the office, I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it the name at full length? - No, only two letters, S. C. I can safely swear to its being my property. Here is the table cloth; the constable found it between the bed and bed tick, this large table cloth; I see my wife go out to buy it about a fortnight before it was taken, it has no mark, but I know it, I put it on the large table in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you keep a eating house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen any of these things except the neck handkerchief? - I had seen the table cloth on the table that very afternoon that she absconded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mistress took me into the room and promised me if I would tell every thing she would forgive me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You saw the prisoner in the Broadway, in company with the woman that she lodged with; was it after that you took the prisoner to your own house? - I took the woman and prisoner both at once to my house, and the woman told then where she lodged.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. When was this? - The 22d of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all three in company? - I cannot possibly say they were all or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say they accosted you then? - They did accost me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it did accost you? - The tallest of the prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - Between nine and ten o'clock. They took me to No. 13, in Oxford-buildings, they took me up one pair of stairs back room, all the three.</p>
               <p>Q. What state were you in at this time? - As sober as I am now; I only drank part of some porter and some spirits, only three six penny worths of rum and water, and part of a tankard of porter, that was all I had that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all come into the room with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them all in the street together? - No, I cannot positively say I did; they all came into the room when I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only see one in the street at the time? - No, Harriott Merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the prisoners came into the room at the same time? - Yes; they prest on me to treat them with something to drink; I told them I had no objection to treating them, but I did not wish to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180078"/>have any further connection with them. I had no money except the money I had in my purse; I gave a shilling to the least of the prisoners at the bar, Byant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you pulled out your purse? - Yes, and she went and fetched some liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Who remained in the room while she was gone? - The woman that is admitted an evidence, and the tall prisoner, Campbell. When the liquor came back, I cannot positively say what liquor she brought; they asked me to partake of part of it, but I refused it; I told them I did not want it, they might take it themselves; I then told them I should make the best of my way home; they were very officious in lighting me down stairs; I told them I could go down very well without them; when I got down stairs, and got to the bottom of Oxford-buildings, before I crossed Oxford-street, I felt in my pocket to find whether I had my property or not.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that? - About twenty or thirty yards up. I felt in my pocket, I found my purse and money in it. I then crossed Oxford-street, and in about forty yards of Mary-le-bone-lane, the said three women came round me; the woman that is admitted an evidence she came in the front of me, and the other two came one on one side of me and the other behind me; they hustled me very close, and I looked round and saw they were the same girls, and I told them I did not want any concern with them; at the time when they pressed on me so very close, the two prisoners at the bar parted from me, and went away from me; I immediately felt in my pocket to see whether I had my money, and I found it was gone; I immediately seized the woman who is turned evidence, and took her to the watch-house; the watchman took charge of her that night, and she was searched and no property was found about her; she desired she might be admitted an evidence, and she would cause the others to be apprehended; and they were apprehended by her directions the next morning; they were taken down to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them again? - I see them the next morning in the same room; I went to the watch-house, and then I went to their room, which is at No. 130, Oxford-buildings, with the constable of the night, he searched the room, but he found no property in the room belonging to me; they were brought to the watch-house, and taken down to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you in your purse? - I had a ten pounds bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the women? - Yes, I am. They are the same women that surrounded me in Mary-le-bone-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them again at that time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that you found your purse safe then? - Yes; I put my hand in my pocket in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it out? - No.</p>
               <p>

            What pocket was it in? - It was in my coat pocket. I had a pair of breeches on that had no pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I suppose, it was out of your coat that you pulled your purse when you was in the room? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the women came to you in the street, that you felt your purse? - Not a minute hardly; I only went about forty yards before they came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible that any body else might have taken it? - I kept my hand in my coat pocket I am sure till the time the women met me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket was it? - My left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180079"/>Q. Did they all hustle you? - They all three hustled me, the one that is admitted an evidence came in front of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this done with a degree of violence? - They seemed to hustle very close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay with you? - Not above a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the two women at the bar were gone that you missed the purse? - As soon as they were gone I missed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Merchant. He says he had his money safe when he went out of my room, and I never see him any more till I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you and the woman go out together? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Who opened the door to let you out? - I opened it myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Merchant. He said he had his money in his breeches pocket before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I declared that I had a pair of breeches on that had no pockets in them.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was this in the evening? - About nine minutes past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any watch? - No.</p>

Remember the situation in which you stand, and say nothing but the truth, and relate what you know of this business? - On the 22d of January, last month, I was along with these two girls that are at the bar now, they asked me to have part of a pint of purl, in Woodstock-street, and in coming out of Woodstock-street, going to Bond-street, we met this gentleman, and they asked him how he did? he said he was very well; they asked him to go home with them; he said he did not care; he walked home with them to a one pair of stairs back room, we all went with him, and he gave a shilling out of a bag from his pocket for something to drink.</p>
               <p>

            Which pocket did he take the bag from? - It seemed to me to be as his coat pocket, to the best that I could see then, and while the least of the two was gone for something to drink, the tall one told me to go out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Bryant went with the shilling to get something to drink? - Yes, and I went away into the court, and in less that three minutes the two girls came down with the same gentleman; they came down together, all three of them, and the gentleman crossed over into Mary-le-bone parish, and the two girls called me and I followed them, and went up the street and came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the girls then? - I did, I met them all three talking together, and the biggest of the two had her arms round him, and I see her hands in his coat pocket; it was Harriott Merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at this time? - Standing by, I was before him.</p>
               <p>

            Assisting, I suppose? - No, I did not. They ran away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anything taken out of his pocket? - I see her hand in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do by standing before him? - I was waiting for them, I did not know what their intention was.</p>
               <p>Q. When they called to you what did they say to you? - They bid me to stop, and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side was it you saw her hand in? - The left side to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you when they ran away? - The gentleman took me into custody to Mary-le-bone watch house, and I was stripped naked and was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not tell the gentleman what you had seen? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before he took you into custody? - No, he said he had lost something, and he took me into custody immediately; I told him the number of the door where they lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no share of this money? - No, they sent to me while I was in the house of correction, that if the bills were thrown out I should have some.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear that while you was standing before this gentleman you did not know any intention of their taking his money? - No, far from it.</p>

            What did you tell this prosecutor when he took hold of you? - I told him they must be the persons that had robbed him, for I see her hand in his pocket; I asked him if he had lost any thing? and he immediately laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing said about his purse between the other women and you before you went after him? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bryant. I wish to ask whether she was not committed from Marlborough-street for stealing from a butcher two guiness and a half? - No, never. I was here and was discharged by proclamation with two other girls. That same prisoner at the bar I only took her in one night and she robbed me of two guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Merchant. Whether I did not ask her to shew me a light when she lighted this man down? - No, no such thing, I left her in the room while the man was there, and the other was gone for some drink.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Merchant. She did not go out of the room till the other came in; I never had any connection with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bryant. She brought this butcher up in our room, and she said it was a friend of her's, and he sent for something to drink, and when I came up stairs he went down, and I never see any thing more of him afterwards.</p>

I told him he had; he then endeavoured to get away, I took fast hold of his arm, and he drew back; I had a parcel under the left arm, and a letter in the left hand.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - Fifteen, next April. I was at the Post office when Mr. Bromfield was at the Post office, I see him throw down his parcel, I see a man draw his hand from Mr. Bromfield's sob.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the man was? - The man at the bar. Mr. Bromfield threw down his parcel and I picked it up. I went to the Post office and put my letters in, and then I came back and called a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the man draw his hand from the fob? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he drew his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180083"/>from his sob was he laid hold of? - Mr. Bromfield had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before he threw down his parcel, or at the time he laid hold of him? Which was first, or were they both together? Did the prisoner draw away his hand before Mr. Bromfield laid hold of him, or after? - He drew his hand away, and Mr. Bromfield caught hold of him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not a man that had been laid hold of by surprise do the same thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you more than that? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner draw away his arm first? - The prisoner drew away his arm first, and he caught hold of him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person near besides Mr. Bromfield? - No, I am sure there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bromfield could not answer that question? - I did not perceive any body.</p>
               <p>Q. It is one thing to say you did not perceive any, and another thing to say there were none? - I did not see any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he examined before he was carried to the compter? - No, he was not, he was searched at the compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How near was you to the prisoner? - Close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you front him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another man ran away? - There was, directly as Mr. Bromfield caught hold of him another man ran away towards Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did that man run away from? - From the Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this man from him? - I did not see, I see him run across Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The other man ran away the moment Mr. Bromfield talked about the watch? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was so near the prisoner that you should have seen if he had the watch, you say? - I should.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

            How old are you? - Fifteen. I am a shop lad to Mr. Levick. On the 17th of January, Saturday night, between the hours of five and six, as I was putting up the bars of the shutters, two boys came and enquired the way to Houndsditch; I perceived the prisoner at the bar going into the shop; I immediately left off conversing with these two boys, and was going into the shop to see what the prisoner wanted, and as I was going into the shop the prisoner was coming out with a piece of callimanco in his hand, which I believe to have laid on the counter; as I was going to collar him he enquired of me whether it was paper; I immediately seized him, and the moment I seized him he threw the piece of callimanco down into the shop, and he tried to get away very much, he dragged me into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the callimanco? - Yes, the constable kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get away? - No, he did not get away, I had him committed.</p>

            You see it after it was got up? - I did, it seemed to be part of a shoulder of house lamb, that is all I can say; I kept it till it was taken before the magistrate, and then it was delivered to Mr. Hayes; I shewed into him as soon as I came up Bear-alley; he said it was his property, because it was so remarkable white.</p>

               <p>Q. How late were you in the shop yourself? - About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had sold no part of that lamb yourself? - It was too late to sell lamb at that time of night, it was packed up not to be sold.</p>
               <p>Q. That leg of lamb that Mr. Jostling produced to you, are you able to say that it was the lamb you packed up? - I know that it was, I don't know that I ever saw such a white lamb in my life; the fat of the leg of the lamb was a little tore in the dressing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the cloths again? - No, never see the cloths again, nor the pig.</p>
               <p>Q. We have been told of some beef that was found in Eve-court. Did Jostling shew that to you? - Yes, he brought it to me in a red pan; one of these pieces of beef was a rib which I cut myself, which I positively swear to, and which had not been sold.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you see these things that were down the privy? - Yes, they corresponded with the hind quarter of the lamb, it was the fore quarter that was lost.</p>

            How long before you was taken up? - I was taken up on the Sunday following; I lodged up at Mr. Stanmore's, in George-alley, along with an old man, I had lodged there a few nights; I used to lodge at Mr. Clarke's, at the Wheatsheaf, the side of the Market. Bowling told me I was welcome to sit up at his lodgings; I met Bowling coming out of the door of the wine vaults.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before this time? - I knew him to work at the coal vessels, Mr. Clarke is his father-in-law, where I lodged before.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and him? - I sat up there because I was locked out.</p>
               <p>Q. But did he know you were locked out? - I told him so; James Druce came there between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his lodgings? - In George alley.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the same alley in which you lodge? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had been at the lodgings, was it that Druce came in? - About half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to bed there? - No, they had no place for me to lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bowling a bed? - Yes, Druce came in and sent for liquor to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send for liquor for you and he to drink? - Yes, and likewise Bowling's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bowling get up when he came there? - No, he was rather in liquor when he went to bed, and he was fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bed in the same room you were at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next after you sat down with Druce, and Bowling's wife? - Druce took a bolt that served for a poker, and went down the market with it; he insisted on my going with him, and took hold of me by the collar.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180091"/>Q. Had he told you of the scheme? - No, he went into Fleet-market about fifty yards from George-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said what was to he done with this poker? - He said some girl had affrented him, and he was going to lick this girl with the poker, he had been licking of her before; then I went down with him, he said she was over the arch way, instead of that he went quite the reverse way, he went to Mr. Hawkins's shop, him and me together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason for not going where he said the girl was? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask what was the reason? Did not you think it extraordinary? - He told me he was going only a little way up the market; he went and tried Mr. Hawkins's shop, a butcher's shop, the next but one to Mr. Hayes's; he said he could not break open that door, he tried to put the poker in between the staple to drive the staple out, and he said he could not wrench the staple out; he then went to Mr. Hayes's shop and broke it open, he made me stand by him, he licked me on the breast when he was at Mr. Hayes's door, because I did not stand close by him.</p>
               <p>Q. He behaved very ill to you, what occasioned him to strike you? - Because I said I would leave him, while he fetched the middle of the sirloin of beef.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you see him open that door? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were only you and him there? - Yes, Bowling was not there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. He fetched out the middle of the sirloin of beef, you say, and what else? - A pig, a leg of mutton, and a shoulder of mutton, and took it to Mr. Bowling's apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing else? - No, not at once, he came back again three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he took these to Bowling's did you go to Bowling's? - Directly. Bowling was then asleep, and his wife in bed with him, but she was not asleep. The second time we brought a rump and sirloin of beef; the dogs barked at him very much the first time, the dogs in the shop, one was tied up and the other was loose; he went into the place the second time with a pen knife in case the dogs barked; he brought all the meat he could find, I see him bring it all out; he brought out a side of lamb, lamb is called a side of lamb when it is cut down the middle; it was wrapped up in a white cloth, the cloth was damp.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing else? - A coarse cloth, a cleaver that they chop up meat with, it was all taken to Bowling's house, and I see him put it all into the cupboard, all the meat, and he sat up there all the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sat up all night? - James Druce, and

             said in the morning, he would have the meat took out of the place. Druce said he knew of a place to sell it, and he took it to Mrs. Flint's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to Mrs. Flint's? - Bowling, Lewis, (or Druce) and I, on the Sunday morning; Bowling took the rump and sirloin of beef, and an edge bone of beef, as much as he could carry; Lewis took a little of the meat, and I took a shoulder of mutton, and they took them up stairs in that house, the house I shewed to Mr. Jostling, and when they came down stairs, they told me that Mrs. Flint had given them a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - James Lewis; they had sent me home to Mr. Bowling's house, and they left at Bowling's house, an edge bone of beef, a shoulder of mutton, two legs, and some small tops<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180092"/>of ribs of beef, they were left at home, Bowling said he could get a customer for them; they came back soon after, they did not come back with me; they came back rather in liquor, and they heard an outcry in the market that Jostling was coming up to seek after the meat; when they came home they told me there was an outcry in the market, and they were coming up to search the place, with that they took the remainder of the meat out of the place, out into a little yard they had got, where they keep rabbits, and left it there to keep till they could sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said they put it into the cupboard? - So they did at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go a second time to the woman? - Yes.</p>

            Where did they take the remainder from? - Out of Bowling's house, out of the little yard where they kept it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it put in when there was this outcry? - In a sack, because it was dangerous to carry it; then they sent me away, I went back to Bowling's house and they came back in about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remain that time there? - Yes. When they came back they told me they got eight shillings for what they took up the last time, the course cloth, the cleaver went with this last meat.</p>
               <p>Q. What next? - They had a quarter of lamb cut up for breakfast, the other Mr. Jostling took from them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after their second return did Mr. Jostling come back? - In about an hour, or rather more; he came about one o'clock, Lewis and Bowling then were in a back place where they keep pigs, a room that was boarded.</p>
               <p>Q. What does it join to? - There was a bit of parting between their house and the back house. Just as Jostling came to the door they took the quarter of lamb out of the cupboard, and took it into the back place.</p>
               <p>Q. When Jostling came you heard them call ding it, what was done after that? - Jostling came and secured Bowling, took him into custody, and the servants of Mr. Hayes went back and looked for this meat, and they found it, and they brought it to a public house, the Brown Bear, at the top of the alley. Jostling did not take me into custody; I following Bowling to see where they were going to take him; then Mr. Hayes gave charge of Lewis, and me, Bowling was in the public house, and we were taken to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was it you gave any information yourself? - I was in the counter about half or three quarters of an hour; I took them to the place where they conveyed the meat to, to this woman's house; they found these bits of beef in the house just salted, and a scrag of mutton, and they brought it to Mr. Hayes.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say the meat was sold for one guinea, have you received any part of that money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had received any part of the money, should you have been here as evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Druce. I was sitting up in this man's room, and I know nothing at all about it, and he was in bed and asleep, and his wife too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bowling. I was in bed and asleep, and my wife and child.</p>
               <p>Bowling called five witnesses who gave him a good character, who said he was bred a waterman and lighterman.</p>

               <p>I am a fishing tackle-maker, in Fleet-street. On the 15th of January last, between one and two o'clock, I was sitting in my back parlour at dinner, and I observed this lady bargaining for some oranges with that man, and when she had bargained with him for the oranges, she gave him a piece of money, which I believe was a shilling; he took it into his hand, and then put it to his mouth and gave it a bite, and then returned, as I thought it was the same; she held out her hand to him and gave him another; he then tried that on the sleeve of his coat, and returned that; she then gave him a third and then a fourth; it then struck me he was playing some trick or other, and I went to the door and asked the lady if she was positive the shillings he returned into her hand were the shillings that she gave him? she said she did not know; and I immediately took the shillings out of her hand, and dragged him into the house, and the lady came in after him; I searched him in order to see if he had any more about him, and I found one bad sixpence, and three or four good shillings he dropped out of his mouth, and six and sixpence good about him, and these four I took out of the lady's hand were all bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So that six and sixpence, and the three shillings you describe to have been in his mouth, were all good, only one bad sixpence out of the number.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at the good shillings and see if you made any observations on them you gave to your wife? - I cannot say to one of them; I presume them I gave to my wife were all good.</p>

I says to him, why don't you shew me the light? and as soon as they got me inside they locked the door on me, and it was all dark, and there were three bars at the windows; I was used very cruel, I saw the bar at the window in the morning and four or five padlocks on the door; that was a pity!

            After you was put into the coach how long were you in the coach before you got to Whitcomb-street? - A good while, half an hour or an hour, I believe it was; in about half an hour I arrived at Whitcomb-street, and when I got into the house I began to fight in the house before I would go up stairs; they wanted me to go up stairs; why should I be kidnapped in that manner? and when I shoved one of them from me, there was a rope slung about my neck, threw down stairs, and I catched it, as God happened, in my left hand here, and they dragged me up stairs by it; then when they dragged me up stairs they got about and stripped me start naked, and them two men were holding me, and the rest were stripping me; one of them was an agent in my time, and the other was the landlord of the house; they were two wicked ones. Was it not a shame, gentlemen, to serve me so? They took away my property, they took my watch and my clothes, three silk handkerchiefs, two pair of silk and cotton stockings, two cotton shirts, and my pumps all that I had.</p>
               <p>"Q. How long did you stay in this house in Whitcomb street? - A fortnight, locked up and to with bread and cold water.</p>
               <p>"Q. Were you locked up in that room all the time? - I was, in the back part of the house up stairs.</p>

               <p>"Q. You said that you never was out of the kidnapping house from the time that you came in it, till the time they put you in the coach to carry you to Banbury? - Never.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is possible to make a mistake in the hurry of a trial such as this was? - It is possible to mistake a word, but at this time I was desired to be particular in taking the evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did this man stay at your house? - Near a fortnight, or some where thereabouts. He came quietly to the house, and sat down in the tap room and they had two or three pots of beer, he came there in a red jacket and white trowsers; a red regimental jacket. When the surgeon came he went up stairs and was examined, and then joined the rest of the recruits in a large room that is appropriated for their use, that they might be by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he go up to this room? - He followed the doctor very quietly up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a rope round his neck, or any violence used to make him go up stairs? - No, no such thing ever happened in my house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day? - It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180102"/>the beginning of July, the first or second, or somewhere thereabouts.</p>

            Where did you see him than? - In the tap room, I always see him there, except once I met him and another recruit at the street door, two or three days after he first came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he to any thing that you could see or judge, as much at liberty as any other person in the house? - Just the same as any other recruit.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might you see him in the fortnight? - I see him about four or five times that week; I do not recollect ever seeing him after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You tell us that you are Ruggles's father-in-law, and that you are a carpenter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you ever hear him the time you were there, make the least complaint of ill usage of any sort? - Never a word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Pray are you in the service at all? - Yes, I am in the recruiting line, but since then I have done with the came my business, I was lame.</p>

            Of course all the compalints made by the man, were false? - Yes, they were.</p>

               <p>Court. Were you in the service before? - Yes, I have been in the light horse, but I left that about eight and twenty years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had any watch at that time? - He asked me if I would sell him one, if I would take the trouble of going with him to the other end of the town, he would pay me for it?

               <p>Q. Was he a person as far as you could judge of his state of mind, intoxicated or not? - If a person is in liquor the magistrates in general send them back, and if I perceive it I always turn them back.(The attestation read.)</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect the person of the man at all? - I have not the least doubt that he is the man, but I cannot swear positively, as far as my belief can go, I believe he is the man.</p>

            Be so good as to look at this attestation? - This is my attestation, and it does appear that such a man did come before me, and if he had had the least appearance of inebriety I should not have attested him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form a judgment to a certainty, that you examined this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180104"/>person? - It is my constant practice, in order to prevent misrepresentation.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the person of the man? - Not the least on earth; but I have great reason to believe this to be the man, there was a man according to my recollection, that I conceived was concealing the truth, and that he belonged to his majesty's navy; and if he did I certainly should not have sworn him in; therefore I examined him very strictly; and I remember a man's telling a story of his coming to town, his landing at Deal, his going into the Hospital for three days or thereabouts; I asked him how he got money to come to London? he told all that story when he came here at the last session; and there are a great number of the other circumstances that I do remember being related by a recruit that I did attest, and I do remember this circumstance to have happened but to one man.</p>

               <p>It will be unnecessary for me to go through this case, as all the circumstances have been gone through in the trial of Peter's, this session, and the circumstances are all exactly the same, the only doubt that was made in that case was, whether this was a felony, or whether it was only a fraud. Now that case is different from in this one respect, because that was laid for stealing out of a dwelling house, this is only for a common larceny. On this case the court has determined he is guilty of felony, but not in the dwelling house, and therefore that he is well convicted. In the present case this is only to inform you what the opinion of the court has been; namely, that under all the circumstances of the case, you are well convicted, for as to the law on the subject, in regard to the felony, there can be no doubt at all about that; because here the party, who is the owner of the goods, had never parted with the property, but with the possession, for that particular purpose, which purpose was never fulfilled, and it is plain that they got possession of the property under a promise to return it, and making the woman so to believe, when it is evident that they meant to purloin it, and convert it to their own use; and persons who come by property in that kind of way, it is now universally allowed that in law, it amounts to a felony, and not to a fraud.</p>

            , I am commissioned by the rest of the judges to give their opinion on your several cases, which, though they are four in number, are the same in circumstances; and I must state first to you, James Runnings, that the indictment against you was for uttering nine counterfeit pieces of money and coin, each, and every of them counterfeited to the likeness of the milled money, and silver coin of a good shilling; and thirty-three pieces of false counterfeit milled money and coin, to the likeness of a good sixpence, the same not being cut in pieces, unlawfully and feloniously did put off to one Isaac Page, at a lower rate and value than the said counterfeit and milled money did import to be for, that is to say, for half a guinea The crime of knowingly putting off counterfeit shillings was fully proved, and Armstrong proved that the money was bad, but he could not discern that the money had any milling on, but that the appearance was of worn shillings and sixpences; Mr. Knowlys, the counsel for the prisoner, objected, that the avetment in the indictment was not sustained, and quoted the act of Parliament, which enacts, that if any person knowingly putteth off counterfeit milled money at a lower rate than it imports in the form and likeness of good and legal money of this realm, he shall be guilty of felony; and says Mr. Knowlys, the evidence has not proved it to have any milling on it, and on the contrary, Armstrong, a witness for the crown, has expressly sworn that there was no appearance of milling on the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton stated that this was the usual way of laying indictments in all similar cases; the judges were all of opinion that the parts of the indictment were all well connected, and that the appellation of milled money has no referrence to its having the edging on it or not, now this will fully appear if one has recourse to the definition of coining, in Chamber's Dictonary and the description of the several circumstances attending the process there laid down.</p>

               <p>Coining says he, it either performed by the hammer or the mill, the first method is not now used in Europe, especially in England and France, though the only one known till the year 1553, when a new machine or coining mill was invented by an engraver. One

               <p>From whence it is plain that the operation of milling is a different thing from the edging, it is milled money before it is edged money, therefore these marks on the edge are not property attributed to a description of this kind, in fact, it was milled money before these marks were put on it, therefore the description of milled money is perfectly right, because the milling must be performed before it is edged, therefore the judges are all of opinion that <rs id="o17950218-5-verdict241" type="verdictDescription">
