            . I am a watchman of Wellington-street, St. Luke's. On Monday morning, the 12th of December, about four o'clock, Cleaver gave me information; I went in search of some persons - I found the door of Mrs. Cale's stable open; I met a man at the door, and as I went in, another man came out - they both said they belonged to the place; the first man started off - I believe that was Dolphin. I collared the other man, and gave him to Yoxall; I believe that man was the prisoner; I found three more men in the stable; they escaped, leaving five sets of harness there.</p>

            . The stable in question belongs to me - I let it to the prisoner and Crook; he kept a pony there; they had it about four months; Crook continued to keep his horse there for four or five weeks after; I gave them the key on Sunday night, as they said they were going to market early. I went to bed at ten o'clock, and was awoke about four; I heard the cart come into the stable, and heard persons talking - I had heard the cart drive out at night, and in the morning, when the alarm was given, Shays came out of the gate with a lantern, and an old man(who has been tried) came out with him - Shays asked me what was the matter; I said that was best known to himself; he said, "Did not I take this shed of you?" the watchman came round, and Shays ran off, with the lantern in his hand. My son is in the country - he was at Watford when the other men were tried.</p>

I missed this property from the harness-room at five o'clock - the room was not locked, but the gates were.

I reside in Cecil-street, Strand.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260004"/>In September last year I was in possession of a pair of carriage geldings - I had bought them of the prisoner in the month of June, for 150l., but I had exchanged one, and paid him 25l. more - in the first instance I kept them about six months - he called on me subsequently, in consequence of my having commenced and action against him to recover the money I had paid for the horses, as they were unsound; he called and asked why I had commenced the suit - I told him to get the consideration back which I had paid for the horses; he asked what I was paying for their keep; I said 10l. a month - he offered to keep them for half that sum in his own stable; I agreed that they should be kept in his stable, and I was to pay him 5l. a month; he said it would take at least three weeks to get them in selling order; I told him to keep them in his stable, and not sell them at all, but if he found a purchaser to come and let me know. I went to his stable three days after, and they were entirely gone. I applied at the office, and did not wish to press the felony, but was advised to go before the Grand Jury, and they found a bill for the felony. The prisoner said he had sold one of them - I authorised him to look out for a purchaser, but not to sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. You named a price between the proposed purchaser and yourself? A. Yes - but it was to remain subject to my approbation.</p>
               <p>Q. He sold them without consulting you? A. That is what he said immediately he was asked about it - I believe it was some months before the officer found him. - When he had the horses I told him I was going abroad, and wished him to find a purchaser as soon as he could; he said their coats were very rough, and it would take three weeks to get them in selling order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How long did you keep the horses before one was exchanged? A. Probably two months - the two were 150l.; I paid 25l. more on making the exchange; I brought an action to recover all the money I had paid; I had not then sent back the horses - he called on me, about a week perhaps, after the action was brought; it might be about January, but I do not recollect dates - another person called with him, whose name I do not know; the prisoner asked why I brought the action - I replied that I had done it in a delicate way, by merely giving him a copy of a writ.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What has become of that action? A. I believe it is still pending.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. In January, when the prisoner and Mr. Shaw called, was there any agreement that he was to have back the horses and the action be dropped, and he was to pay a sum of money? A. No; there was an agreement that if he paid me 110l. I was to drop the action - he would keep the horses in that case.</p>
               <p>Q. You got a warrant, and the Magistrate said if he had heard the whole of the case before you should not have had the warrant? A. No - he said he did not think it a case of felony, but a gross fraud, and advised me to go before the Grand Jury; I went as soon as I heard that they sat - I went and told the same story as I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. From January to September did you not know a Grand Jury were sitting? A. I went the first time the officer told me they were sitting; he had promised to let me know - the officer was some months finding him; it might be about January that I got the warrant. I might have seen him at Bow-street, probably, about a week after the warrant was issued - I have no memorandum of the date; I think it was a fortnight after; I have not seen the prisoner since he was before Sir

             till to-day; I directed the officer to his stables in King's Head-yard, Russell-street - I cannot tell how long it was before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. In January, when the agreement was made about the 110l., the horse had got out of condition, from not being used? A. Yes; I said, "You are to pay me before I give you any title to them." I suppose I was to pay for their keep. If he had paid me 100l., I should have given him a bill of sale, and I suppose I should have had no. thing to pay for their keep - he had no authority to sell them. I never wished to charge him capitally.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was the 110l. to he paid? A. I told him I was going abroad, and if he brought 110l. he might have the horses - no agreement as to time was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a time fixed? A. A person called and said he would pay it in a week or two.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a subsequent application for further time? A. Not that I recollect; a person called once or twice, and had several conversations about them before I delivered the horses, but after I delivered them no person called.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. You are quite sure of it? A. I am, for two days after I delivered them I went to the stable, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear no person called between January and September, and requested an extension of time? A. They called several times between January and September. From the time the horses were delivered till this hour no person has called, but prior to the delivery they did call for an extension of time; they asked if I would trust Mr. Maltby, and take his bill for time - I refused. I told Mr. Shaw I brought the action to bring Maltby to terms.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had received the 110l. this indictment would never have been preferred? A. Yes, it would - I would never have received the 110l. after my horses were taken in the manner they were, for I never considered them sold.</p>
               <p>- LEADBETTER. I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner first in January, by a warrant which Mr. Halls delivered to me - I executed it four or five days after - I was present at his examination, and he was discharged; Major McCurdy desired me to let him know when the Grand Jury sat, but I was in France, and had no opportunity of letting him know. Some time before last Session I sent him word when they would sit, and after they had broken up I saw him; he said he had been before them, and from what they said, he had no doubt they would find the bill. I expected the indictment was for a fraud - I examined the books, and found no bill returned; I went and told the prosecutor - he said he was indicted for felony; I then got a warrant on a certificate of indictment, and apprehended him in about a fortnight; I had frequently met him prior to that time, but in that fortnight I had been looking for him, but could not find him; I went to an acquaintance of his, and told him to appoint him to meet me, and he came in consequence of that appointment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had seen him frequently be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260005"/>fore? A. Yes - I knew him and he knew me; I had met him in Piccadilly, and said, "You may depend on it the Major will indict you" - "Oh!" said he, "I don't mind that."</p>

            . I am a commercial agent, and live in Sloane-street. I was at Major McCurdy's when the prisoner came there on business; it was in the summer, about May I suppose; I had breakfasted with him; in fact I was present when 25l. was paid, respecting the exchange of horses, and on the time in question the prisoner entered the room, and wished to know the cause of proceedings relative to the horse; the prosecutor said, "Why, you have been out of the way, and I have taken steps to meet with you, as I am not satisfied with the horses;" Maltby said he did not know he had given them a character which they did not deserve - that he was unable at that time to refund the money; the Major said, "Money is not particularly an object to me - you must pay me 110l. and have them back;" he said he had called to solicit time for the payment; the Major said he could not give him time, as he was going to America - Maltby said he had been to the stables and seen the horses, and they were in bad condition; the Major said he could not help that, he had not used them for a long time, and said, "Pay me a hundred guineas for them, and I will give you possession" - he said he could not, but if he would let him take the hores he would pay him in a few days, as he should be able to get them in condition, and raise the money; I said"Major, you must not part with them to Mr. Maltby, as he has not acted correct with you - you should not part with possession;" Maltby replied, "Oh! Sir, I don't mean the Major to give me possession - I don't wish to exercise any right of ownership over them - I merely wish to get them in condition for sale, that I may dispose of them, and so be able to pay the Major, and I shall be able to keep them at less than the Major now pays;" the Major said, "If you can get a purchaser, recommend that person to me - I have no objection to your doing it, but I do not part with my horses till I have received 110l.;" Maltby said, certainly he meant nothing more than that, and he need not fear trusting him with them.</p>

My master kept the King's Head stables, near Covent-garden, and carried on business there till September last, and resided over the water; he was at the stables every day if anybody wanted him.</p>

            . I am an accountant, About October or November last I waited on Major McCurdy respecting an action between him and the prisoner; I asked his reason (by Maltby's direction) for bringing the action after keeping the horses so long; he said he only meant it as a notice, and if Maltby was willing to come forward, and give him 100l. or one hundred guineas for the horses, he would take it; I said from what Maltby had said I thought it would not be in his power, but I would mention it - he said Maltby had better wait on him, and he would settle it with him; I communicated this conversation to Maltby. I saw the prosecutor again three weeks or a month after; the horses had then been delivered back, and I requested the Major would wait one week longer, understanding the time had expired for payment for the horses, and after a great deal of hesitating he consented to do it - he said he understood the horses were sold.</p>
               <p>Q. And he consented to give a week from that time? A. He did - he said he would give him a week, but it was to be perfectly understood he did not forego the action till the money was paid. I always found the prisoner at his stables when I went.</p>

I remained with them till twelve o'clock, when I laid down for a few minutes, and got up, as my little boy was very ill; I went to bed again, and between that time and half-past four o'clock this robbery was committed. I kept my violin in the bed-room, which has not a good lock to it. I got up between four and five o'clock, being restless, and asked the male prisoner if he would get up and sit with me a little while, as my little boy was ill, but I could not discover that anybody was in their room; nobody answered me. I walked to the street door, which I had bolted, and found it unbolted; I then went to my bed-room cupboard, and felt that the violin was gone; I called up my two little boys, one of whom if fourteen years old, and sent him to Nash - I asked my boy to give me my hat - he gave me one which I knew was not my own; my own hat and violin were gone, with the case and bow; I have not had any of them delivered back to me. I had bolted my front door when I went to bed; the back room up stairs was rented by a window and her three children - she was gone to bed when I fastened the door. The prisoners were apprehended about two months afterwards. John Lewis was to have gone with me on the Monday to Chatham races.</p>

On the 26th of September, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was returning home from Holborn - I was alone; it was dark, and not very moon-light, and in the <placeName id="t18261026-5-crimeloc24">Back-road, by Camden-town</placeName>

I was examined at Hatton-garden. He merely said, "You have, and I will have it."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never say, "D-n you, I will have it?" A. After that he did - he then snatched a paper parcel out of my hand, containing eight yards of lace, and two yards of net; he took 3s. in money out of my left hand - he opened my hand by force, and took it - he then took hold of me with both his hands, then let go with his right-hand, and took a knife from his left-side pocket, held it in his hand, and said if I did not give up what money I had got, he would kill me - it was not a case-knife, nor a clasp one, but a long one, like a butcher's - he held me a few minutes, and then let me go, as I heard footsteps. I was a good deal frightened - my shawl came off one shoulder with his holding me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this last? A. About ten minutes; I could see him by the light which came from the lodgegate - he appeared to be dressed in dark clothes, with a rough light great coat; he appeared to be in a sailor's dress - he had a short jacket under his coat; he had trousers on. I saw him again on the 28th, two days after, at the office, in the lock-up-room, with seven others, and knew him - I fixed on him myself - he stood in the centre of them; I heard him speak in the lock-up-room, and knew his voice again also. Nobody passed while he was robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the robbery were you getting home? A. Nearly half an hour; I saw my fellow-servant, Thomas, on the road, about a quarter of an hour after I was robbed, and told him - I described the prisoner to him. - When I got to the lock-up-room he appeared to be in the same dress, only without his coat; he had very full hair, combed over his face - it is cut now. I believe him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Have you always given the same account of this transaction? A. Yes. I told the officer his hair was combed, and appeared like whiskers, not that he had large whiskers; I had never seen him before - it lasted about ten minutes. The lodge is not far from the bridge, about a hundred yards I should think; it was light, for the lodge door was open; I did not observe what light it was - I was over the bridge, exactly opposite the lodge gate, and the door was open. When I was in the lock-up-room, Pendergrass told me to look among the prisoners; I said, that was him who stood in the middle - I never said he was not there;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260007"/>nobody pointed him out to me. The prisoner used no violence to me. I know the charge affects his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be careful, considering the very short time you was with him, can you positively swear to him? A. I am sure it was him.</p>

Bunce informed me of this robbery on the 26th of September, about eleven o'clock at night - he described a person to me, and I heard of a person answering the description being in Somer's-town watch-house on the 28th, and sent for the party - it was the prisoner - he was in custody for something else; he answered the description Bunce gave me, which made me send for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not state before the Magistrate that you had seen a person of that description on the bridge? A. No - I said so to nobody.</p>

            . I belong to the Police. About half-past ten o'clock on the night of this robbery I saw the prosecutrix: she described a person to me, as having a white-rough coat, dark clothes, a shiny hat, and large whiskers. On Thursday morning, the 28th, I found the prisoner at the watch-house; he answered her description, except not having whiskers; I fetched her to Hatton-garden, where she saw the prisoner among six or seven others; I said, "Be very particular and cautious what you say, for it is a very serious case, but if you see the man, say so" - I told them all to stand up, and said to her, "Which is the man" - she looked round, and said, "That is the man - I will swear it;" he stood in the centre of the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then she described him as having whiskers? A. She did. He is materially altered since his apprehension; I cannot say whether he ever had whiskers; he has got his hair cut, and looks cleaner since he was taken; he had on the same jacket and trousers as he has now - it is a jacket used by sailors; she pointed him out in about two moments.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did she say to you he had whiskers, or like whiskers? A. When he was at Hatton-garden his hair was brought forward to the side of his face, which would appear like whiskers; she said, "Like whiskers."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the robbery. The two officers came to the watch-house in the morning, and said, "Teasdale, did you see that man with a white coat on?" he said, No, and then he said, "He has changed his dress" - I never had a dress besides what I have now since I came from sea. The officer brought in the prosecutrix, and asked if the man was there - she said, No; he said, "Are you sure of that?" she said, Yes; he pointed to me in the middle, and then she said, "That is the man - I will swear to him." I was called out and searched, to see if I had a knife, but I had not. Three prisoners in this gaol can prove it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was anybody in the house with you when the prisoner came in? A. Yes - my wife and Drummond, who keeps the house - they saw the prisoner when he came; my wife said he left at nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What is your brother? A. A cabinet-maker - he was then working for my father, who lived in Chapel-street, Somer's-town, and he lived with my father at that time; there was not business to keep him constantly at work.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was your brother dressed that day? - A. The same as he is; he had fustian trousers as he has now; I never saw him in a shag coat, or heard of his having one - I had seen him about a week before.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did Harding stay at home after his brother-in-law came, if he was at home? A. I cannot say - it might be a few minutes, or it might be longer; the prisoner drank tea there, and I left him there. I returned about half-past nine o'clock, and he was gone. Harding came home about ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sitting with them? A. No, not after the husband came home.</p>

               <p>CATHERINE DRUMMOND. Harding does not board with us, but we frequently had our meals together. I rather think now that Mr. Harding did drink tea with us.</p>

Mr. Jordan rents the house, and lives on the first floor. On the 21st of September, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came to my room together, and Godfrey said they came from Mr. Dubois, of King-street, who had given them my direction, and they had some musical watches to be repaired. I knew Mr. Dubois perfectly well, and should attend to his recommendation; they had not brought the watches, but gave me a direction where to go for them - I went to another part of the room to get pen and paper for them to write the direction - my glass-case, which hung on the wall, was at that time open, and I had several watches in it, and a gold one among them; the prisoners were within reach of it; I had wound up my watches in the morning, it was then there; I had been at home all day; nobody could have taken it before they came. When I got them the paper, Lock wrote this direction - (reads) "May, 31, Great Ormond-street" - he wrote it in Godfrey's presence - I was to go there for the watches. About an hour or an hour and a half after they were gone, I missed this watch - no other stranger had been to the room - I went to No. 31, Great Ormond-street, found they did not live there, and nobody had a watch to repair - I saw them in custody about six days after, and am certain of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PLATT. Q. At what time did you wind the watch up? A. About ten o'clock in the morning - it was not in my hands after. Two gentlemen and a lady had called that morning - she came to pay me 25s. - the gentlemen were in the room longer than she was; the first came to fetch his watch - he was not ten minutes there; the second came for a lady's watch - he was not five minutes there; I opened the case to get it, and it was open while the prisoners were there; I did not leave the room while they were there; they did not stay above two minutes - both the gentlemen and the lady were customers.</p>

On the 2nd of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, while I was in the parlour, the prisoner came into the shop very quietly; my wife went towards the door and alarmed me; I saw him leaning across the counter, robbing the till. I went out at the private door; he had then got out at the shop-door, and turned round into Finsbury Circus, where several bad characters were standing - he went and stood close to them, with his hands behind him - I laid hold of him, and gave him in charge, but no money was found on him - he had unlocked the till, and drawn it out; I had put 20s. into it in the morning, in different coins, besides what I had taken - I know there were five half-crowns, five shillings, and five sixpences in it. When I took him, he said he had been looking at the boys at play, and had been there a quarter of an hour - he had not been out of the shop two minutes. I particularly noticed his dress, as he lay across the counter, and am positive of him by that there was not another boy dressed like him - I did not see his face. The till was quite empty - the silver was all in a little box in it - there were 2l. or 3l. there a few minutes before.</p>

On Saturday, the 14th of October, Rush came into the shop and asked for a quarter lb. of sugar; a pound of tea stood on the counter, tied up, when he came in; he had a sack on his arm, which he rested on the counter close to the tea. I observed Clements pass the shop-door while he was there, but I did not observe him take any notice - I served Rush with the sugar, which came to 11/2d., and just as he got to the door I missed the tea - I immediately ran out and took him, walking with Clements, about thirty yards from the shop; I saw the tea in his right-hand, and saw him give it to Clements, who put it under his arm, under his coat, but not to conceal it. I asked him for the tea; he gave it to me without hesitation, saying, "That man told me to hold it." Rush immediately ran off - I took hold of Clements, and gave him to Mr. Young, while I followed Rush as far as the Cock public-house in Hosier Lane, and there lost him - I went with the officers, about half-past ten o'clock, to the Anchor public-house, Saffron-hill, and found him there, and was certain of his person.</p>

I was to go about thirty yards down the street; I gave him the bag to hold, and went a little way, then looked back, and saw he was gone; I returned without going to the house, but could not find him - I have never found the silver; I am certain of his person; I saw him again about a fortnight ago, in a court in Wood-street, as I was going to Goldsmith's-hall. He came up to me and said, "I think I know you." I said, "Yes, and I know you; it was you who stole my silver." He was then sneaking off, and said to two boys, "Hold him while I run away;" - they struck me, and almost knocked me down, but I pursued, calling Stop thief! and he was stopped.

I walked to the top of Fann-street, and putting my hand into my pocket, missed the purse - she was gone then.

On the 21st of September, about a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning, I was at breakfast with my wife, quite at the back of the house, on the ground floor - the two windows of the room look into an orchard; they were open, and are about three feet from the ground. I put my watch on the breakfast table, and left the room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260012"/>with my wife, just to walk round the grounds. I have a little boy five years old; he was in the nursery at breakfast time. I walked from my house into the stable, and in about ten minutes, on returning from the stable-yard, I came througg the shrubbery suddenly, in sight of the window, and saw the prisoner getting in or out of the window; both his hands were on the window, as if he was dropping down; I immediately seized him by the neck, close to the window, and said, "You scoundrel, you have robbed me;" he attempted to get away - he replied,"You see I have only come to sell lemons;" he had a small basket. I took him into the stable-yard, and called to the gardener - my little boy immediately said, in the prisoner's presence, "I saw you get into the window," and when I complained that he did not tell me of it, he said, "I thought he had come to clean the windows - I saw him when you and mamma left, as I was playing in the orchard, and I saw him get into the window." I left the prisoner three or four minutes, to send for an officer, and as he had made some resistance to the gardener, I came out with a sword; the prisoner then complained, and said,"You see I have only come to sell lemons, and I have lost two or three out of my basket;" my little boy replied,"Oh! I saw you lose your lemous - I know where they are" - he immediately ran into the shrubbery, and brought both the lemons and my watch - it was laying with the lemons;" all this shurubbery into the stable-yard; the lemons and watch were found four or five yards off, so that he might have thrown them there without my observing it. Two chairs had stood in the recess of the window, and one I found had been removed, to make room for somebody to get in. It is a gold watch, and worth 40l.</p>

On the 21st of September I was in the pantry, and heard him call out - I went out, and saw the prisoner in custody, between master and the gardener; I went into the breakfast-room - the watch was not on the table; I shut down the window, and observed footsteps leading from the window to the table, on the drugget and carpet - it was quite wet, from the mould under the window.</p>
               <p>MR. KERSHAW. I had only slippers on - the footsteps could not be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the house to see if they wanted lemons - I knocked at the door, and received no answere; the gentleman then came and collared me - he shook me violently, and said he suspected I had been to his parlour - I said not; he gave me to the gardener, then fetched a cutlass, and said if I offered to move he would cut me down - I said I had done nothing; he sent the servant to see if all was safe - she returned, and every thing was safe; a child came to him with the watch in his hand - the gentleman took it from the child. I declare I was never in the house, and never saw the watch till I saw it in the child's hand. Previous to that the child had been missing from the house fifteen weeks.</p>
               <p>MR. KERSHAW. The child had been playing under the window.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it possible your child could enter the parlour while he went for the lemons? A. It is impossible - he must have gone all round the house, but he darted into the shrubbery, and brought it directly. The prisoner must have opened the gate to get into the orchard.</p>

I know the prisoner - he brought me this horse for sale on the 29th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening; I took it over to the Red Lion public-house with him, intending to pay him; I was to give him 2l. for it; we called for a pint of beer: I wished to be correct, and asked his name - he gave me the name of Hyams; Barrett, who was there, knew Mr. Hyams better than I did, and thoug he had dealt with him he did not know the prisoner to be his servant - I would not pay him till he referred me to somebody who did know him; it was agreed that I should go to his master at Covent-garden, at six O'clock in the morning, to pay him; I kept it at the Red Lion - I sent my son to Covent-garden, and when he returned I brought the horse to the door, thinking it might be owned; a person said he knew the owner - I found out who it was, and sent my son to Mrs. Medley; the horse was afterwards fetched by her servant; I gave him the same horse the prisoner had bargained with me for.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) On Friday evening, the 29th of September, I left home at half-past seven o'clock, and went into the field, which is about a quarter of a mile from Hariesdon-green, to mind the cows, it being my turn to watch them; I found them all right - from the field I went to Harlesdon-green, on foot, which is about four miles and a half from Tyburn-turupike, and called at the Crown public-house, at Harlesdon-green, for refreshment, remained there about ten minutes, and from thence returned to the field, where I remained till the milking time, two o'clock in the morning. Mr. Hedges' son came to us in the morning, to see if any of the servants was the person who had been the evening before at his father's house - he did not at that time six on any one; he came again, with his father, on the next day(Sunday), to me, at the Green Man public-house, Harlesdon-green - he then told his father that he thought I was the man; we all went to my mistress's house - after staying there about two hours I was taken to the watch-house on this charge. Mr. Hedges' house is four miles from Harlesdon-green; I was not at his house on that evening, and am entirely innocent of the robbery in question.</p>

I pawned this silk handkerchief with Smith - I received it from the prisoner; I had not seen him till the day before - he came into a public-house where I was waiting for my husband, and offered the handkerchief for sale to all the company; I asked what he wanted - he said 2s.; I said I had no money, but would pay him when my husband returned - he said that would do; as my husband did not come I went and pawned it; I threw down 2s. - he took up one, and said the other should he spent, but I refused to spend it; I inquired at the house about him, and understood he was in a destitute state, and had come from Wales - that his mother had given him this watch and handkerchief.</p>

I returned a few minutes to eight o'clock. and found the street door as I had left it, but the front kitchen window, in the area, was open; I had fastened it myself before I went out - there is no fastening to the shutter, but there are two small sashes - a bar goes into one to keep the other from sliding back; a square of glass in the sash was rather starred before, but on coming home it was taken out, the bar moved, and the window open - there was no hole in the glass before. When we came in we kicked against some things on the floor - it was two pairs of breeches, a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, and a pelisse; these were on the parlour floor, and were not there when we went out; we got a light, and the first thing we saw was, a little cupboard door in the parlour standing open - I found six silver tea-spoons gone from there; I went up to the bed-room, and found the drawers pulled half out of the bureau - they were not locked; I missed two great coats, some cotton bed-furniture, two yards of black silk, and two table-cloths - there was a pair of gloves in my great coat pocket; I missed some powder-flasks from the parlour side-board, and five keys, belonging to the burial-ground office, were taken away. I informed a watchman of it that night, and found the prisoner at Worship-street next morning, with the property.

I heard that two men were taken to the watch-house, which is very near the spot - I went there, saw them both, and knew them - the rule and handkerchief have been found.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He called you Bill? A. Yes; I am not called Bill. I looked at him as I walked along, and did not like him at all as he kept pushing up against me - I observed his face several times; it was not a particularly dark night, I did not particularly observe; I went up Snow-hill straight into Peter's-lane. There were no other prisoners in the watch-house; I said directly they were the men; they were not pointed out to me; I knew them instantly. I am certain it was Mansfield who put his hand into my bosom - I was knocked down in rather a dark place, but a light came across from the lamp at the Queen's Head public-house, and I saw him give the handkerchief to Parker plainly.</p>

I took him a few yards, another patrol came up into the passage, a light was brought from the watch-house, and on the spot where I took him we found this handkerchief, which I have had ever since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of Parker? A. I am - I saw the rule fall from him. Directly I took him into the watch-house, the prosecutor said, "That is one of the men who robbed me." He was not out of my sight after he dropped the rule - the prosecutor was sober.</p>

            . I know Parker. I am a surveyor, and was originally a bricklayer; I live in Devonshire-street, in the same house as Parker's sister - I have known him four years, and took much pains to get him employ - I always understood him to be an honest boy: I have seen the proseuctor about this.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY to MR. LAYTON. Q. Have you ever said to any body that you were drunk when this robbery was committed? A. No, I never told Mrs. Doveton so - she came to my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did she come about? A. She came and said she hoped I would be merciful to her brother - she was talking to my wife some time before I came home; and Newby came to my house, and said, if I would not go on with the prosecution, but make a flaw in the indictment, the watch would be produced, if it was between heaven and earth - he said he was a relation, and that Parker had robbed him, and he was afraid to touch his life.</p>

            . I live at No. 40, Devonshire-street, and am Parker's sister. I have seen the prosecutor - I went to him and asked him, about this, as my brother would not tell me: I said, "Was not you tipsy?" he said, No; he owned he had been drinking, but knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say you hoped he would he merciful to your brother? A. No; the first time I went I said, if he was guilty, I hoped he would suffer, but if he was not, I hoped he would recommend him to mercy. Newby is a distant relation of mine; he married my mother's sister; he is my uncle.</p>
               <p>NEWBY. I do not know that I am any relation to her; I lived with her aunt, who died about six months ago, but we were not married.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed as their uncle, and that woman took your name? A. Yes, we lived together six years. I went to the prosecutor's house, and said I did not know whether I got the truth from the sister, but had come to him to get the truth; that I understood the watch had been overvalued at 3l.; he then said he would not take 4l. for it, and sooner than lose it he would do any thing, and if he had the watch he did not care. I said, all I looked for was the lives of the men, and if the property was his only object, I would endeavour to make a search - that money should not be an object, and I would go home and make every exertion for the purpose of recovering it.</p>

On the 11th of September I was at Smithfield, selling beast; I received some monies, and had 450l. about me in notes - as near as I can recollect, there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260017"/>one 40l., two 30l., five 20l., ten 10l., and smaller ones; I had them safe when I went into a room with the prisoners - I felt them in my inside breast-pocket at the time I entered the room, in a book containing memorandums. I was standing near Smithfield Bars when the two prisoners came up to me - I am sure of their persons - they came up in a fondling way, and asked me to take a walk with them; I consented, and we went towards Cow-cross: we passed a public-house, and they asked if we should go in and drink there - I refused, and we walked to the bottom of Cow-cross; they then said, "We will go to our own lodging - we are sisters:" they took me to <placeName id="t18261026-25-crimeloc139">Sharp's-alley</placeName>

I found a girl in the lower room; one of them asked her for a candle, and she lighted them upstairs, and when we got to the chamber-door, one of them said to her, "Light our fire," as if she was their servant, and then said, "Now, Sir, this girl will fetch a pot of ale" - I gave her a shilling, and she fetched a pot of ale - I took the shilling out of my purse. She brought the ale, and sat down in the room, then went out and fastened the door - the two prisoners and I then took a glass of ale each; I was then sitting on the bedstead, and the prisoner Wilkinson sat by the side of me; the other sat at a little distance off - she came closer soon after; I was very warm, and took my coat off; she came nearer to me, and made an attempt to get hold of the coat, which I had laid by the side of me - I perceived her attempt, and caught hold of the coat - Wilkinson immediately clasped her arms round my neck - Hartnett likewise fastened on me, and we were all down on the floor together. Wilkinson, in a great fury and heat of passion, pinched my hand and scratched the back of my neck, and called out, "Oh the b-r!" I was in great terror, and cried out Murder! They got my book out, opened it and got out this roll of notes, dropped the book, and the memorandums were scattered about the room - I stooped down to pick up the papers, and one got down stairs; I immediately ran after her; the other came down after me - I cannot say which of them went down first; they were both down in the lower room together, and I got hold of them both, crying out and begging for mercy. A man was in the room, who I supposed to be the master of the house; I said,"For God's sake, Sir, assist me - these women have got all my property - I am ruined for ever." He made no reply, but in a few minutes shut the door, and stood against it. I had hold of them for three or four minutes - the man then shut the outside door, and stood with his back to it - I heard him say in three or four minutes, "I have sent for a constable," or "I will send for an officer." The women cried out bitterly for me to let them go, and as he stood at the door, and from what he said, I let go my hold; the man immediately threw open the door, and said, "Go along with you altogether;" they started out, rushed through the crowd at the door, and I lost sight of them. I got my coat and book, but the money was gone - I recovered my memorandums, and every thing but the 450l. When I got out of the house, I went to an officer, who is not here, and informed him (I was obliged to go a hundred miles into the country next day) - I immediately went home to my lodgings, at Woodness's, in Bartholomew Close; stated the case to him, and he went with me to the house about eight o'clock the same evening. We found the man there who rescued them; he told me he knew nothing of them. I was sent for nearly a month afterwards to Lambeth-street, and was taken to the lockup place, where I saw the prisoners sitting together, and pointed them out. I am positively certain of them - I was certain of them the moment I saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there other females there? A. I think there were two; but the moment I saw the prisoners I took no further notice - I have recovered none of my money - I am positively satisfied they are the women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How old are you? A. About fifty; I do not exactly know my age. I live with my wife, and have a child grown up. I had done business that day, and dined at my lodging - I had a pint of half ale and half porter to drink, that lasted me for an hour after dinner  - I then went to Mr. Young's, in Smithfield, on business - I drank nothing more, and was perfectly sober: I did not go out to see a female - I thought nothing about it: they accosted me about seven o'clock in the evening, near Smithfield, going to St. John-street - my sight is middling; not so good as it has been; we had a candle in the room; I took my coat off because it was so very warm - that was my only reason - they ordered a fire to be lighted at some certain time; it was not lighted: the coat lay on the bed close to me; one of them came and sat close by me for three or four minutes - I was not ten minutes in the room altogether - I had not offered them any money - I did not intend to do any thing more than pay them a visit - I swear I had no object but sitting down with them. They took my book in the room, and instantly ran down before me; I followed, after picking up my book and papers, which did not take two minutes, and found them still in the house, down stairs; I laid hold of them both in the room - I went to no office, but to an officer's house, and then to Woodness, and went with him and the officer to the house - I saw nobody in custody before I saw the prisoners - I was in London two or three times before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer tell you the two women who had robbed you were in custody? A. He said two were in custody who he suspected might be the two - he said he had taken two, and wished me to go and look at them: when I went, I expected to see the women who robbed me - I think there was another woman there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was a woman named Castles taken up? A. I do not know - I did not see such a woman - she was not examined in my presence. This money belonged to the owners of the beast; I paid them their money, though I lost this; I did not inform them about it, as I could pay them; I did not know I could take the man who was in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were you perfectly sober that night? A. I was - the less excuse for me.</p>

I found a quantity of wearing apparel in the room, all new; there were three gown-pieces, some cotton and some silk, three or four shawls, some lace caps, and two Leghorn bonnets; I asked who they belonged to - Wilkinson said none of them belonged to her - Hartnett said, "You may as well say it is all mine." I took them to Lambeth-street - I showed the prosecutor into the lock-up room - he identified them almost immediately - he said he was satisfied they were the women, and said,"Poor creatures, I am sorry for you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you tell him you had got the women who robbed him? A. No, I said I had two women who I supposed to be them, from the description. There was another woman, and two or three men in the lock-up room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you suppose to be the value of the wearing apparel you found? A. I should think 15l. or 16l. I apprehended them from information relative to their being flush of money, not from the prosecutor's information.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You knew the prisoners, and are sure they are the women? A. Yes; I have been a patrol in that parish eleven years - I have known one of the prisoners from a child, and the other six or twelve months - my business calls me to Newgate market, and I frequently saw them walking there among the salesmen: I took particular notice of them that even ing; I followed them down to the end of Sharp's-alley, and said to them, "What, are you both out again? I hope this will be a warning to you." They had both only been liberated at three o'clock that afternoon - they were at the door of the wine-vaults - I am sure of them and the prosecutor.</p>

            . I keep the Coach-and-Horses public-house, Bartholomew-close. On the 11th of September Tingey left my house after tea, a little after six o'clock; he was perfectly sober - he had dined with me about two and had a pint of half-and-half - he went out, returned to tea, and went out quite sober - and soon after seven o'clock he came in and appeared as sober as before - he complained of his loss - I went with him to a house in Chick-lane with Godfrey, an officer, and saw a man in a lower room.</p>

The girl who sat at a distance came closer to me and attempted to take hold of the coat - I seeing that, caught hold of it likewise - one clasped me round the neck, the other seized me, and we were all on the ground, and in the struggle they got out my pocket-book.</p>

            . I am patrol of Cripplegate. On the 24th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me, with a bundle under his arm; I followed him into Philip-lane, and there stopped him; I asked what was under his arm; he said, wrappers - he had ten canvas wrappers; he said they belonged to his master. Mr. Charlsworth, of Milk-street; I took him to the Comp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260020"/>ter, and took them to Mr. Charlsworth next morning.

I had advanced his wages in November last, and stated I should have no wrappers taken - he lived two years with me, and I had a good character with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I have sorted up the wrappers, have you not allowed me a few odd ones? A. I have allowed him brown paper, but not wrappers. He had said the wrappers were the perquisites of some warehousemen - I said I would rather advance his wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the care of all his property, and could have robbed him if I had chosen; most porters think these things their perquisites; I sorted up some when I had been with him three weeks, and he gave me some small bits.</p>

This property was in a chest of drawers it was safe on the evening of the 22d of September; I got up between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and went out - I returned at eight, and all was safe then. The prisoner is a stranger to me; I went out, and was sent for about ten o'clock - I found my drawers open, and my clothes gone; the drawers had not been locked. I gave notice to the pawnbrokers, and that evening saw one of my coats exposed for sale, at Regins' stall, in Rosemary-lane; I found a waistcoat at his house. The prisoner was taken that evening, with the trousers on his legs. The house is let out in lodgings - the landlord lives next door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you told us all you know? A. Not exactly; I did not know Regin; he took me to the prisoner's house, where I found the trousers on his legs; I asked where he got the property; he said he bought them that morning. of a Jew, in Cheapside, at a quarter past ten o'clock - he said the Jew hung his head down, and he did not know whether he should know him, and could not swear to him - he said he could not recognise him; he afterwards saw Mr. Pitcher, who lodges in the house, and said he thought he was the person; I occupy the second floor front room, and an old lady lives on the same floor. I understand my wife had locked the room door; Pitcher lived on the third floor. He said at once he had bought them of a Jew, but did not say what he had done with them in my hearing; Regin was present. The prisoner was asked if he had bought anything besides the coat and waistcoat - he said he had not - I am quite certain of that. I never said the robbery must have been committed by a person who knew the premises, nor anything like it. The officer of the night liberated him on his own word, to appear at the Mansion House on Monday, and he did appear - Pitcher was examined before the officer of the night, and by the Lord Mayor. What the prisoner said at the Mansion House was written down, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember charging Mrs. Pitcher with having one Jack to visit her? A. Never - it was the prisoner charged her with it; I then inquired who Jack was, and found a person answering that description had been visiting her - I did not express dissatisfaction at it.</p>

            . I live with my husband, at this house. I went out after my husband, at half-past nine o'clock to the butcher's, and locked the room door - I returned in about ten minutes, found the door open, and the lock seemed very loose; I had left my husband's clothes in the drawers - I found the drawers shut, as I had left them, and missed these articles. The prisoner was brought to the room, by the officer, that night - I had never seen him before - I was confused, and hardly recollect what passed - I did not notice his dress; Mrs. Pitcher lodges up stairs with her husband, who is a cutler. I never saw them in my room till after the robbery; her husband went with her to the Mansion House on Monday - the clothes were brought there by the officer; I never heard my husband say Pitcher must be concerned - we suspected nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you heard your husband say he thought it must be done by a person acquainted with the premises? A. Never - he never thought of such a thing; I never saw the prisoner in our room - the drawers could be seen when the door was open; I saw the property safe the evening before. The prisoner told my husband on Saturday night he would go with him on Monday, to Holywell-lane, to see if he could find the rest of his clothes; he called on Sunday night, to say he should not be able to go - I asked him at what time he bought the clothes - he said about a quarter past ten o'clock, and that he had dealt in old clothes for three years. I was before the Lord Mayor at the third examination - Pitcher, his wife, and my husband were all there. When the prisoner called on Sunday, my husband called Pitcher down, to see if he would know him again - he said he would not swear to him, as the man he bought them of held his face down. Pitcher was discharged on the first or second day.</p>

            . I and my husband live at this house: he is a cutler, and works for Mr. Bear, of Chandos-street, and has worked there five years - we live on the next floor to Winn. I was never in their room till the night of the robbery; I had seen a man go out of the house about an hour before the robbery - I described him; he was a very respectably dressed man. My husband's brother, who has been at sea three years, came to see us on Tuesday - he stumbled on the stairs, and my husband said,"Hold up mate" - the people in the house mistook it for Jack; he is they mean by Jack. I described to Winn the man I had seen go out, as having a blue coat and trousers, and a moreen bag in his hand, full of something; I got up on Saturday a little after seven o'clock - my husband went out about a quarter past seven, to his work, and did not come home till eight at night; I was in bed when he went out - he is still in Mr. Bears' employ. When I went to the watch-house Winn said, "Will you see if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260021"/>can recognise the man?" as soon as I went in I said to the prisoner, "Will you turn your back to me?" as I had noticed the man's back - he did so, and I said, "I think you are the man" - he said, "Thank you ma'am;" and immediately said to my husband, "I bought them of you"- my husband has no bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to the watch-house? A. On Saturday evening, the 23d of September; the constable of the night was going to discharge him, and detain my husband; I said, "Harden, what, are you going to let the thief go, and detain an innocent man?" he went to his head officer, came back, and let them both go- I had seen the man go out of the house a few minutes before the clock struck ten; I was looking out of window, seeing half-a-bushel of coals measured from a waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you say a word about the man going out till he said he bought the clothes of your husband? A. Yes, the moment the robbery was mentioned to me, and I told an officer of it - my husband is not here. The Lord Mayor asked the prisoner if he could swear he bought them of him - he said he could not, and he was discharged - I believe Mr. Winn was present. My husband is hard at work, which there is a hurry for, for the last fortnight; he said if he had been slack of work he would have attended - he leaves off about eight; I do not expect him to call here for me.</p>

            . I deal in second-hand clothes, and live in Crown and Shears-place, Tower-hill. On the 23d of September, about eleven o'clock, I bought this waistcoat and coat of the prisoner, for 6s. - they were very much out of repair; I have dealt with him for three years- it might be a few minutes before eleven o'clock; my house is about half an hour's walk from Cheapside - he did not say where he got them; he brought them in a black linen bag; I did not ask him about them - he had nothing else, except a few children's things; I think it was a brown poplin frock - he had not other men's clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have dealt with him for three years? A. Yes, and always found him honest and upright; I do not keep a shop, but expose my goods in the open street, directly I buy them - I gave him the full value. The prosecutor was passing at seven o'clock, and asked where I got them; I accompanied him to the prisoner's house, and heard all that passed - he immediately said he had sold them to me, and had bought them in Cheapside that morning - I do not recollect what time he said. I know he goes about the street with a bag, to buy clothes - (looking at a bag), that is the one he brought them in; the prosecutor then asked if he bought any trousers - he said, "This pair upon me I bought with the coat and waistcoat, and seeing them about my own size I thought I would wear them, to save a better pair." The prosecutor said Pitcher who lived in his house, was rather a doubtful character, habituated to drink, and he had not the best opinion in the world of him. I was before the Lord Mayor on Monday; the prisoner said, "I believe Pitcher is the man, but cannot positively swear to him."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prosecutor's wife present when the prisoner said this about Pitcher? A. No - that was said at my place, and it was there the prosecutor said about Pitcher being addicted to drink; nobody but my wife was present - she is not here. On Saturday night, as we went along to the prisoner's house, he said Pitcher was an idle character, a drinker, and he had not the best opinion of him; the constable was with us.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Winn and Regin to the prisoner's house on Saturday evening: I did not hear him say anything about his suspicion of Pitcher - he said there was a man in his house who he had some suspicion of - that he did not know the man's name, but he lived up stairs. Cheapside is half an hour's walk from St. Mary-axe; if Winn had mentioned Pitcher's name I must have heard it; when we arrived at his house Pitcher had not come home - we went and waited at the watch-house, then went to see if Pitcher was come home, and met Mr. and Mrs. Pitcher, with the prosecutor - we walked behind them with the prisoner, who said, "I think that is the man;" I never heard Winn say he suspected Pitcher to be the man, for he went on the Sunday to Pitcher's employer, to inquire where he was on the Saturday- if he had mentioned Pitcher's name as we went to the watch-house I must have heard him; Mrs. Pitcher said the prisoner resembled the gentleman who went out that morning. I was not in the watch-house when she desired him to turn round.</p>
               <p>Q. After she said she believed he was the man, did you discharge him? A. By the advice of Plaistow, the wardbeadle - he is my superior; he seemed to be respectable, from the neighbourhood he lived in, and the house he kept; I did not know him before. I consulted my superior.</p>

            . I never said I suspected Pitcher, for I had never seen his face till Saturday. After the prisoner said he bought them in Cheapside, he said he bought them of another person, in Hartshorn-alley, near Aldgatepump - he said that at our house - the constable was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you not to state this in your evidence in chief? A. I was not asked about it; I never said I suspected anybody in my house - what the constable has said is false.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you never said before that he said he bought them in Harishorn-alley? A. I was going to tell the whole of it, but I was interrupted by that gentleman. Regin has told a positive lie. The clothes are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he had bought the trousers which he had on at the same time? A. Yes - I never said I suspected anybody who lived upstairs, whose name I did not know; I never said Pitcher drank, or that he was a loose idle fellow; I had never seen him or heard any character of him.</p>

            . I am a piano-forte-maker, and live in Southampton-place, Camden-town. On the 12th of September, about half-past five o'clock, I was near the New Southampton Arms public-house - my attention was attracted by a grain-cart, and on looking behind I saw a van coming up behind with four horses; the cart was on the left, its proper side, going at a slow pace - the driver was in front, but whether on the horse or shaft I cannot say; the van came at a more rapid pace, and in about half a minute came in contact with the cart - I saw the deceased fall from the near side of the horse to the further side - he fell towards the middle of the road, strait on the shaft by the side of the horse, and from there to the ground, with his face downward - I immediately ran to his assistance, and as I passed the front of the van, I lost sight of him - during that time I heard the cart fall from the van with a heavy jerk, and the wheel of the cart went on the man's body - I went to lift him up, the blood was flowing copiously from his mouth and nose, and right ear - a person desired me to raise him up - the rattles immediately came in his throat, and he was dead - the prisoner drove the van.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the van and cart going the same road? A. Yes; the cart went at the usual rate of a horse and a heavy cart - the van was not going faster than could be expected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Both were on the proper side? A. Yes - the van had turned more into the centre to pass the cart, and the wheels caught - it stopped us soon as it possibly could.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman. I was about twenty yards behind the van, which went at a proper pace - the prisoner was on the box - the van was about four feet from the cart, and getting out into the road to pass - there was room enough to pass, but it afterwards got nearer to the cart, and the near hind-wheel knocked against the cart-wheel - I saw the cart pass on, and the man laying down behind it - the wheel had passed over him lengthways - the man died instantly - there did not appear any thing wilful or careless on the prisoner's part.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he search for it? A. By rubbing his hand against my fob-pocket - another afterwards unbuttoned the flap of my trousers and felt for my watch; I had none - and the one who had felt said "The b-r has got no toy;" they then took off my cravat and then my hat; the man who took off my hat said, "Now give the b - r a rum one;" and the man on my right side said, "Don't hurt the poor b-r;" he then untied the rope and run away; the prisoner Downes is the one who held my left arm, or took my money from my left hand - he either held my left arm or took my money - he stands the second person from the Jury - I am certain he is the person who was in the position I have mentioned - Ore, who is third from the Jury, stood rather in front of me on my right side - I am certain of him - Bishop was standing rather more in front of me, on the right side - he kept pushing Ore and another (who stood rather more in front of me on the right) away to get closer to me - he stands nearest to the Jury - he pushed Ore with his right arm and another with his left, to get closer to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look attentively at him, and say are you sure of his person? A. I am - Hackman (who stands fourth from the Jury) stood on my left hand, rather in front - I am certain of him - I asked the person, who took my keys, to give me them back as they would be of no use to them - he returned one of them saying, "You b-r, there is your key;" I went into a chandler's-shop, about a yard and a half from where I was robbed; after I left there, I went towards Bethnal-green-road and gave information to West, an officer, and asked him to go with me - I gave him a description of, I believe, seven or eight of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these persons presented to you then for the first time, or had you seen them before? A. I had seen them frequently when I have been walking in that neighbourhood by day-light, visiting my patients - I gave information at Worship-street, and accompanied the officers on the following day about the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, and saw a great number of persons of their rank and appearance, but none that I could identify that day - on the following morning I identifield one, and a few days after two others, neither of the prisoners are any of those persons - In consequence of information I received afterwards, I went to a place where one Sarah Holt worked -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260024"/>it was on the Saturday after the robbery; I think Garton accompanied me - he found my two cases of lancets on her - and in consequence of the information we received from her, the prisoner Ore was apprehended - Downes was also apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the robbery did you first see Downes? A. I think it was on the 4th of October at Worship-street-office, he was with two or three others in the yard - I pointed him out myself without any suggestion from any one - Hackman was apprehended, I think, about a week after Downes - I first saw him at Worship-street-office amongst, I suppose, about thirty persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point him out, or was any suggestion made from any other person? A. I was sitting in the Magistrate's room, and in about a quarter of an hour Mr. Bennet desired me to walk into the office and point out any person I knew - Hackman was then standing in the body of the office, not among the prisoners, and I pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Q. You described seven or eight men to West, did you in particular describe any person at the bar? A. I described Downes and Bishop - Bishop at that time had his hair hanging down his face - I saw him some days after I saw Downes - I saw him at Worship-street, it was before Hackman was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Under what circumstances did you identify Bishop? A. I was taken into the lock-up-room by Gleed, there was about a dozen other prisoners there; I was ordered to pick out the person who robbed me, and I pointed him out without any intimation whatever from any body; I received an order from the Magistrate to go into the room and pick out the man, and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When, for the first time after the robbery, did you see Ore? A. I saw him at his father's house in Wilmot-street, Bethnal-green, after the robbery, I think about the 20th of September, and I then knew he was one of the persons who were present at the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately after the robbery, you went into a chandler's shop - did you borrow any thing? A. I borrowed a hat of Mr. Fernie, a butcher of Bethnal Green, about eight o'clock that evening - I went first to Mr. Marsden, but he had not got one to fit me. When I went to West and to Mr. Fernie, I had neither hat nor neckcloth- that was just before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look once more at the persons of the four prisoners- do you entertain any doubt whatever of their being part of the persons who robbed you that night? A. I have no doubt whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. How are you so particular of your memory as to time? A. The clock struck eight after I borrowed the hat - the transaction might last two or three minutes: I then went to the chandler's-shop kept by Dover - I staid there about five minutes - I saw neither the man nor the woman who kept the shop - I have seen the woman since; she is not the person whom I saw in the shop that night, for that was an elderly person. Fernie lives about half a mile from Dover's, but I had seen West before I went to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a bell rings in that neighbourhood at eight o'clock? A. There used to be, but I do not know whether it is continued. I felt alarmed at first, but when the man on my right said I should not be hurt, I certainly was not so much alarmed then. It was barely twilight - not daylight; it was not daylight nor dark; it was daylight, or nearly so - twilight had not began: they were lighting candles in the chandler's-shop when I was stopped against their door, while the prisoners were committing the assault - it is not uncommon to light candles before dark. I saw the colour of Bishop's clothes - he had a blue coat, and black or dark waistcoat, and dark or blue trousers - Ore had a long blue coat, and black or dark waistcoat; he stood about a foot or a foot and a half from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, on your examination, you could see the person who seized you on the right-hand, but could not observe the man who pinioned your left arm? A. I could not observe the person who pinioned my left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners all produced to you in custody? A. Ore was at his father's house - the others were all in some place of confinement. Hackman was in custody, I suppose; though he was in the office, and not among the prisoners, he did not tender himself as a witness for some persons under examination - not to my knowledge. I think it was on the 19th that I went to Ore's father's house; there had been an examination at the Police-office, and I went in consequence of something Holt said; I took my Solicitor with me - this was before the trial took place here last Session, one or two days before, but after a bill had been found by the Grand Jury; I asked him, in his father's presence, if he could give me any information respecting a case of lancets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then, upon your certain knowledge of him, taken into custody? A. No; I gave information that night of him, and I think he was taken in about a week afterwards - the conversation at his father's lasted three or four minutes. My lancets were left at Worship-street, in the hands of the officer. I appeared here against three persons last Session, and was positive of all three of them- one of them went away at large, in consequence of his not being active, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Ore, when you were going away, that it was very fortunate for him he was not acquainted with such characters? A. I believe I said something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. - Where had you been to last before the robbery? A. To Mrs. Oliver, a patient, near Fleet-street-hill: I merely spoke to her at her gate, but did not go in - the last house I was in was Mr. Richman's, a gun-maker, in Church-lane, Whitechapel; that is three quarters of a mile from the spot - I came direct from there, only stopped to speak to Mrs. Oliver, I raised a cry of Stop thief! immediately after the robbery; nobody else called Stop thief! I believe; two persons came up, I think; but I cannot speak to the number - I pursued the thieves for ten or twelve yards, up a street, which I think is Fleet-street, calling Stop thief! Some persons came up and begged me to hold my tongue, saying the gang was so desperate, they would murder me if I did not. I then went into the chandler's-shop; some persons came in; I think it was the same two men who came up when I called Stop thief! I think only two came into the shop; I do not recollect more - there was an old lady in the shop, and a woman stood at the door - I only saw two women when I went in, but before I got away there might be a dozen persons at the door - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260025"/>saw no more in the shop - I do not recollect seeing Mrs. Dover that night - I cannot say whether I saw her or not; I was considerably agitated in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Mrs. Dover, on being asked, that you did not know any of the robbers? A. No, I did not, nor that I could not identify them - on the contrary, I said I should know some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not repeatedly say, in the hearing of three or four persons in the shop, that you did not know any of them? A. I certainly did not: I do not know a woman named F. Burdet, nor

               <p>Q. As soon as you came out of the shop, did you see a clear starlight night? A. I do not say, directly I came out of the shop, for I stood in the road some time - I do not know whether the moon was shining.</p>

            . When I got to Bethnal Green, it was a clear starlight night - I might be five minutes going there- it was then a quarter of an hour, or rather more, after the robbery, I suppose a quarter of an hour; it was not dark when the robbery was committed; I heard the clock strike eight after I went for the hat; I was above a hundred yards from the church, and heard it strike distinctly; I went into Fernie's house; I did not count the clock, but I am satisfield it was eight; I know it was after seven, and could not be nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You conclude from those circumstances, and not from counting the clock? A. Yes; I was in the house, and not paying attention whether the bell rang.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn to seven people positively - can you swear to more? A. Yes, I should know the man who took my hut: I never said I could swear to sixteen or seventeen- the robbery might last more than two minutes - I am certain of eight persons; the officers took me next day to see some persons, they were not in custody; I suppose I saw a hundred at least - I had eight officers in all; they took me to suspicious persons: I had described the persons to the officers; they took me round the neighbourhood to persons they suspected to be bad characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state on the former trial, that you could not tell who was on your left side? A. No; I said I could not tell the person who pinioned my left arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY.* Q. Did you see Bishop except at the Police-office? A. I saw the back of some person one day in Dover's shop; it might be Bishop; he stood with his back to me, I do not know whether it was him.</p>
               <p>*Not Peter Alley, Esq.</p>
               <p>Q. You identified him at the office, and would know him at any time you saw him? A. Yes; I went into Dover's about five minutes after the robbery; it was, I suppose, twenty minutes before eight o'clock; I was robbed at half-past seven - I could not see the whole twenty persons who robbed me; I never said that Bishop stood on my left hand - he stood next to Ore, in front of me, on Ore's right-hand; I did not state at the office that the robbery was committed after eight o'clock; I did not perceive that any of the prisoners had sticks, but some of the gang had - Bishop did not speak to me, he spoke to Ore, and pushed him aside to get more forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a full view of Bishop in Dover's shop? A. I never saw his face after the robbery, till I saw him at the office - I might be two minutes in Dover's shop.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Ore was apprehended a week after you had been to his father's house - when you saw him there, had you any doubt of his being one of the persons who robbed you? A. Not the slightest - I have frequently seen all the prisoners about the neighbourhood before the robbery, and knew them all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many years have your engagements led you to pass about that neighbourhood? A. I have been in practice in the parish about ten years. I have met them about singly, and at other times in company together - I feel confident of them all - I have not the slightest doubt whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Ore at his father's house - as you did not doubt about his being concerned, how did it happen that a week elapsed before he was apprehended? A. I complained at the office that he was not taken, and the answer I received was, that the officers had been after him, but could not take him - I gave directions for his apprehension the very evening I had seen him - he had only his shirt and stockings on at his father's, but I knew him the moment I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were any of the persons engaged in the transaction without their hats? A. Hackman had no hat, and another whom I have not seen; the other three prisoners had hats - I had seen them about the neighbourhood occasionally, both with and without their hats.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you any particular reason for speaking to the time? A. As near as I can tell, that was the time. I had been at the public-house opposite; I went there about half-past seven o'clock, and had been there a quarter of an hour when I was fetched out to him - I did not particularly notice the time that I went to the house - there is a bell rings at eight o'clock; I did not hear it ring - I speak to the best of my belief of the time - when I went to the public-house, the gas-light in my shop was lighted; I do not know how long it had been lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night? A. Middling, I believe; there were lights in the public-house - I was not there long - it was too dark to see without candles - I do not know whether I could distinguish the features of a man out of doors by the light of the sky.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Had you been out on duty that night? A. No, I had been standing in the road, the corner of a turning, where I live - I had been at home, and had been out about ten minutes, when I saw him - I had lighted candles some time before I came out - I did not particularly notice how long - it was a bright starlight night; there was a moon afterwards, I believe; but I did not observe it at the time; there might have been one before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you particularly noticed the time? A. Yes; after I saw Mr. Fuller I went to a public-house, the Blade Bone, five doors off, to get my brother officer, and it wanted then about two minutes to a quarter to eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>MR. FULLER re-examined. Armstrong, Waters, and other officers were with me the day after the robbery.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of information I received I went to the house of Sarah Holt, on Saturday, the 16th of September; I went to where she was at work, at Duff and Brooke's, in Spital-square, and accompanied her to a house in Quaker-street; Mr. Fuller was with us - when we got there there was nobody in the house but some children; in the course of a minute she produced these two cases of lancets from her bosom - she told me where she got them. I was at the office on some occasions, when Mr. Fuller was there; I was there when Hackman was - he pointed him out as one of the persons at once, without any hesitation; he was in the office with, I believe, twenty other persons - they were all ordered to put on their hats, then Mr. Fuller was called in, to go into the body of the office, to see if he knew anybody - he went round into the body of the office, and picked Hackman out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any intimation given to him to direct his attention to one person more than another? A. No; the persons all stood just as they were, they were only ordered to put on their hats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Hackman was not brought there by any warrant or summons? A. No; I believe he had been apprehended the night before, and brought there on a charge - he was in custody: he stood among twenty persons; they were not all prisoners - he was not handcuffed; I do not know of his having been there twice before, offering to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go round with the prosecutor the day after the robbery? A. Yes - I did not point any persons out to him; I do not know whether anybody else did: nobody was taken that day in my presence - there were six officers besides me; it was the second day after the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was done two days after the robbery? A. We accompanied Mr. Fuller with a search-warrant, to a house on Fleet-street-hill - he pointed nobody out to me, nor I to him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Christchurch. I apprehended Hackman in Brick-lane, on the 17th of October, and accompanied him to Worship-street office; I saw Mr. Fuller identify him; he never saw him till be went into the office - there were ten or fifteen persons in the body of the office - we were all ordered to put on our hats, officers and everybody there; nobody could tell who were officers or prisoners; Mr. Fuller came round, went back to the Magistrate, and pointed out Hackman - he was not there as a witness, but in my custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he been there before, as a witness? A. Not to my knowledge; he had been all night in the watch-house, and sat there in his clothes; I and the prisoners stood in the body of the office; the Magistrate was in an elevated seat - the persons in the office stood indiscriminately mixed together; I stood perhaps two yards from Hackman, who stood about the middle of the room - there was one person between me and him.</p>

            . I had some lancets in my possession - the prisoner Downes gave them to me on Saturday morning - I think it was on the 16th; he told me to take them to George Houghton's father, to deliver them to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go with Downes to a person named Bailey, to get the lancets? A. I know he went to a place in Bethnal-green, but I do not know the person's name; I passed the door with him- he rang the bell - whether he got the lancets there I do not know; he gave them to me in Brick-lane, between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday morning - that is about five minutes walk from the house where he rang the bell, but it was the next morning that he gave them to me; Mr. Houghton, whose son had been taken up, told me to apply to him to get the lancets on the Friday, and after that he passed the door, and rang the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you none when you asked for them at first? A. No - a young woman named Kitty Watson lived up stairs in the house, where he rang the bell; she is married,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260027"/>and I do not know her husband's name; I do not know who else lodged there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you deliver the lancets to the officer? A. Yes, to Garton, or Mr. Fuller - (looking at them), these appear to be the same - he went into the house on Friday night, and on Saturday morning gave them to me.</p>

My Lord, I was with Henry Ore and Hackman in Hare-street and Brick-lane, from about four o'clock in the afternoon on the day the robbery was committed, till a little after seven, when we all three went to Wilmot-street, where Henry Ore's father lives - Hackman and me waited outside while Henry Ore went in. On his return we went to the Angel and Trumpet public-house, at Stepney, where we arrived about eight o'clock, or a few minutes after; on our way I bought some bread and meat, which we took into a box, where

             were sitting. Now, as I understand the offence was committed after eight o'clock in the evening, I hope you will be satisfied that I could not be one of the offenders, because I was at the time near two miles from the spot. - All, my Lord, that I know about the matter is this: - a woman named Sarah Holt came to me, and said that George Houghton was taken into custody for the robbery, and that, although he was innocent, he might lose his life if the prosecutor swore against him, and she understood the prosecutor only wanted to have his instruments returned to him; I knew Houghton was innocent, because he was at the Angel and Trumpet when we first went there, and being anxious to save an innocent man's life, I undertook what Sarah Holt requested. Having heard that some men named Bailey were concerned, I went with Sarah Holt to John Bailey, who said he knew nothing about the business, and I afterwards went to his brother, William Bailey, who gave the instruments to me - I gave them to Sarah Holt, and she, as I was told, handed them to Houghton's mother, from whom Mr. Fuller and Gooding received them. This, I most solemnly declare, was all I had to do in the affair. I have reason to believe the prosecutor has been misled, and that he was induced more from suspicion and misrepesentation, than from his own recollection, to accuse me and Downes, and afterwards Hackman, whom it was well known was coming as a witness on our behalf - that the prosecutor may believe he is right I do not dispute, because he can have no object in accusing innocent men, but that he cannot safely and prodently swear to so many individuals as he has done, must, I humbly submit, be apparent to every discriminating mind, when it is considered that the offence was committed in the dusk of the evening, that it only occupied, as the prosecutor says, about two minutes - that he must necessarily have been in great trepidation and alarm, and that all the robbers were strangers to him. The prosecutor, at the Police-office, deposed that I was the person who either held his left arm, or took his money from his left-hand pocket - but I am informed, that when giving evidence against Houghton and Boyce he said, that Boyce seized his right arm, and he could not observe who seized the other; these statements, I submit, are inconsistent with each other, and cannot be reconciled. I refrain from making further observation, being well assured that I may safely trust my case to the penetration, justice, and humanity, of your Lordship and the gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>ORE's Defence (written). My Lord, I most positively and solemnly assert that the prosecutor is entirely mistaken in accusing me of being a party to the wicked offence committed upon him. I am a weaver by trade, and work for my father at his house, where I also live, and where I have every thing provided for me in a comfortable way: I had, therefore, no motive whatever for joining in the crime which is falsely laid to my charge. On the day the robbery was committed, I was in company with Downes and Hackman, in Hare-street and Brick-lane, from about four o'clock in the afternoon, till a little after seven; we then went to my father's house, which is in Wilmot-street, and I went in to get some money, as I was going out to spend the evening, and was in the house more than a quarter of an hour. When I came out I rejoined Hackman and Downes, who were waiting in the street, and we all three went to the Angel and Trumpet public-house, near Stepney church, and there we remained till half-past ten o'clock, and then went home together and separated soon after eleven. I have witnesses to prove this, and to show what time I went to the Angel and Trumpet, and what time I came away. I heard of the robbery being committed, as others did who resided in the neighbourhood; but was neither accused nor suspected, as I believe, of having had any share in it, until I was taken into custody. On the 19th of September, Mr. Fuller, and another gentleman, who, I have since been told, was Mr. May, his attorney, came to my father's house and asked for me - I was at work at the time, and my father called me - I went down as I was, in my shirt-sleeves - they did not accuse me of the robbery, but asked me if I knew Sarah Holt - I said No - they then said she had told them that I had given her the instruments; this I denied, and said I knew nothing about them, nor of what they consisted. They then asked me if I knew George Houghton; I told them I did, and that I saw him last, about eight o'clock, on Monday the 11th of September - they asked me whether I knew Norton, Quay, and some other persons - I said, No; and they answered it was very well for me that I did not know such characters - they next asked me if I knew Downes, and I told them I did. My father said he did not believe that I had any business with the robbery, as there was a good table for me at home, and that when I went out he gave me what money he thought fitting for my years. They then said that they did not come to accuse me of the robbery, but merely to gain intelligence; this was before the trial of Houghton. If the prosecutor had identified me as one of the party, why did he not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260028"/>me taken up at that time as he ought to have done? Instead of this, he tells me he did not accuse me of the robbery, but that he came to gain intelligence. I heard no more of this business till Downes was taken up, and then my father, knowing I had been with Downes on the night of the robbery, questioned me very seriously about it, and advised me, if I had any hand in it, to get out of the way, and he said he would let me have what money I wanted - but knowing that I was innocent I refused to conceal myself, and remained in my ordinary business, going about as usual, till the 25th of September, when I was taken up, as I believe, for no other reason than to prevent my being a witness for Downes, as I could have proved that he was not at the place when the robbery is stated to have been committed. I had no sort of concern in the affair - my witnesses will shew that I could not have been there - and I leave it to your lordship to determine whether men, who were in my company all the time, are not more entitled to be believed than the prosecutor, alarmed as he must have been, and as he had good reason to be - and when it is considered that the robbery was committed, as the prosecutor says, in about two minutes, and when it was dusk or dark. I am informed that the prosecutor told several people that he could not swear to any of the robbers; yet he has already sworn to three persons, and now swears to four more. He has altered the time of the robbery to account for his taking up the persons who were at the Angel and Trumpet, but all the witnesses say the robbery was committed after eight o'clock, and they knew this from the circumstance of the bell ringing. Thus, it is plain, the robbery was committed at the time we were at the Angel and Trumpet, and could have had no hand in it. I shall not trouble the Court any further than again to declare, and call God to witness, that I am entirely innocent, as are also my fellow-prisoners, Downes and Hackman, who were with me all the evening.</p>
               <p>HACKMAN's Defence. I can say nothing further than what my fellow-prisoners have stated. I believe I was apprehended that I should not be a witness for Downes and Ore; I had several times attended at Mr. Harmer's office to give my deposition, as I could prove their innocence. On the 16th of September I saw Houghton's mother, she asked if I would attend this Court to prove his innocence - I went to several persons that day, whom I knew to be at the Angel and Trumpet, when Houghton was there - I took to her house their addresses and business - she neglected to let me know when the trial was coming on, or I should have been here - Sarah Holt told me she had the instruments from Downes - I went to him, and he said he had them from Bailey - I went and saw Bailey, he said he did give him the instruments, but did not know he was going to give them to the woman - I understand part of the name is erased on one of the instruments.</p>
               <p>MR. FULLER re-examined. These lancets are mine, one of them is marked F. Fuller, which is my brother's initials, but they are mine - the other is marked with the maker's name.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Bishop. I saw him on the 11th of September at eight o'clock at night, that is the nearest hour I can fix - I went with him to the Hospital public-house, Whitechapel-road, and continued there till ten o'clock - he was not out of my sight during that time - he had called for me at No. 1, Hare-marsh, where I live - we got to the public-house about a quarter past eight o'clock - Lewis Tideman and Elizabeth Preston were in company with us there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are they acquaintances of yours? A. No; I have seen them before, but not to be acquainted with them - I have seen them three or four times before - Preston lives in Wilmot-street - I do not know where Tideman lives - I know more of Preston than him; I have known her two years - she was not acquainted with Bishop that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you fix on eight o'clock? A. Spitalfields bell was ringing eight as Bishop came to my door- it was a darkish night, as far as I recollect - it did not rain, nor did the moon shine - I did not take notice whether the stars were out - Preston and Tideman were drinking by themselves in the public-house - Bishop had half a pint of gin and cloves, and we drank together - I had a full glass, there was not quite a glass each - Bishop had some - I do not know who was helped first - I was helped second - Preston was helped first, Bishop third, and Tideman last - I recollect now that Preston was helped first - we had no conversation together - we drank each other's health, that is all - I have said all I know, and that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent that you had no conversation with Bishop, Tideman, and Preston, from eight to ten o'clock? A. No, not a word, further than drinking health.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to represent that no conversation passed betwixt these three persons and yourself, except drinking health? A. No, nothing passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk about any thing that happened lately? A. No - I do not know the landlord - I have been there several times since - he is not here that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you must have had conversation; do you mean to represent to the Court that from eight to ten o'clock nothing passed in your hearing, except merely drinking each other's health? A. Nothing at all, I swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nothing, and nobody said any thing? A. Yes, nothing passed but drinking health - I have known Bishop a year and a half - he wore blue trousers, a round fustian jacket, a red silk handkerchief, a black silk hat, white stockings and shoes that night - it was not so dark but that I could see what he had on.</p>
               <p>Q. At eight o'clock it was light enough for you to see white stockings, fustian jacket, and so on? A. Yes; if I had met him in the street I should have known him directly by his dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This robbery made a great deal of conversation in the neighbourhood? A. It has; I have heard no paper read about it - nobody has read the Sessions' paper to me - I have heard it talked over once - I do not know whether that was before Bishop was in custody - he was taken one Sunday night - I heard people talk about reading the trial in the newspaper, but they had not then got the paper in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drinking between all four of you, or had you separate refreshments? A. Separate refreshments, except the gin and cloves - Bishop and I drank two pints of porter - the other two were drinking their porter, they were at the house before we got in, and we left them there - Bishop and I went away together.</p>

            . I live in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields. On the 11th of September, I went to the London Hospital public-house, Whitechapel-road - I got there by seven o'clock - Bishop came in in about an hour and a quarter with Lydia Bender - they continued there till very near a quarter to ten, as far as I can recollect; we drank separately; when they first came in they called for a pint of beer - I gave them my pot to drink - they drank - and when theirs came in I drank out of their pot - we paid separately for what we drank - I left a little after ten o'clock, they left very nearly half an hour before me - we had a quartern or half a pint of mixed liquor - Bishop fetched it from the bar - I cannot tell whether it was gin and cloves, or gin and raspherry.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What makes you certain you got there at seven o'clock? Q. It was seven by the tap-room clock - there is no seven o'clock bell rings - Bishop came in at a quarter past eight o'clock - I did not look at the clock then - it was a quarter past - I am sure it was not at eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not at eight o'clock? A. I cannot swear about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than half-past eight o'clock when they came in? A.

               <p>Q. What did you talk about? A. Why about George Houghton, William Adey, and Sidebottom, who had gone down to the Angel and Trumpet - Bender was sitting at the same table with us, she was not talking to me - the table was between us - we talked about nothing else - I was talking to Bishop - Bender might have talked, to Bishop I cannot my.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink Bishop's health? A. I said, "Here is luck," that is all - Bishop did not drink my health - I gave Bender a nod when I took the glass of porter - I did not say, "Here's your health" to her, nor to Preston, no further than nodding my head - the liquor made four full glasses - each had as much as the others, there was no difference.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them go out a quarter before ten o'clock, and had no conversation, except about Houghton and Sidebotton? A. That is all - I told Bishop they had gone to the Angel and Trumpet, at Stepney, that is all that passed between us; Preston and Bender were acquainted and they sat and talked together, but I could not hear what they said, as I did not listen - I cannot say whether they talked much or little - it was darkish when I went there at seven o'clock; I do not know whether it rained, the moon was not up, but it was starlight; it was darkish, but the stars were out - I did not see the moon - I had come from Wilmot-street, about a quarter of a mile from the house - it might have rained, but not to perceive it - I cannot say whether I was helped to the liquor first, second, third, or last - I think it was second or third - I had nothing, except porter - they had one pint before the liquor and one afterwards to my recollection - Bishop was dressed in blue trousers, a round fustian jacket, and, I believe, a red handkerchief; I did not observe his stockings or hat, it was either beaver or silk. I have seen him wear a silk hat.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOVER. I know Bishop and Mr. Fuller. I saw Mr. Fuller in my shop on the Wednesday after the robbery, the prisoner Bishop was there; Mr. Fuller remained there about three minutes - Bishop was brushing his clothes - Mr. Fuller came in, and Bishop appeared no ways dismayed; Mr. Fuller said nothing to him nor to me; Bishop was standing with his back to the back-room door, in his shirt-sleeves; Mr. Fuller entered the street-door and could see him, and they could see each other; Bishop had come into my shop about half-past seven o'clock, in the evening of the robbery, for a slice of bread and cheese, and went out directly.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Mr. Fuller's stick found in your house after the robbery? A. Yes; he brought it in his hand, and left it by the side of my counter - that I swear; he was humanely asked into my place as he was robbed; I know none of the prisoners but Bishop; he left my shop some time before the robbery; it was moonlight on one side of the way, and dark on the other, on account of the houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you at home after the robbery, when the prosecutor came into your shop for assistance? A. I heard a faint cry of Stop thief! I was at needle-work behind the counter; I went to the door as quick as possible, and saw a gentleman without a hat; I suppose Bishop had left my shop three quarters of an hour then; I did not notice the time Bishop came into the shop; it was as near half-past seven o'clock as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you hear of the robbery? A. About ten minutes after eight o'clock; I am convinced it was after eight; I was not out all that evening, and saw Mr. Fuller come in; Bishop had left three-quarters of an hour then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear Mr. Fuller did not come into your shop before eight o'clock? A. I am confident it was a quarter-past eight; I saw him come in without a hat, and offered him my husband's, but it would not fit him - he had no cravat; he bound a handkerchief round his head instead of a hat, and left my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Bishop doing at your place, on the Wednesday afterwards? A. I had bought a bedstead of a friend, Bishop brought it home, and asked me for a brush to brush his clothes; Mr. Fuller was in my shop about three minutes at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What time was it you heard the cry of Stop thief! - A. It was ten minutes or a quarter past eight o'clock, for I observed to my little girl some time before, "It is eight, and your father is not come home;" I am certain it was after eight - on hearing the cry Stop thief! I got to the door as fast as I could, and saw the gentleman without his hat, and Charles Cousins, who had been in my shop, but had got to the door before me, speaking to him - he had come for some table beer; he returned into the shop with Mr. Fuller and several neighbours - Mr. Fuller appeared extremely bad indeed; I never saw a person look worse - we offered to send for some drink for him, and every assistance was offered him; he said he did not know the persons who robbed him - I heard him say so once or more - I am confident he said it once; I believe I asked him myself once, "Should you know any of them Sir?" his answer was, "No, I should not" - I saw F. Burdet in my shop while he was there, and believe she saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260030"/>him part of the way home; he was at my shop about five minutes, to the best of my knowledge - two men, if not more, went out with him -

             was one; I forget the other's name; he lives in the neighbourhood, and I should know him - it was certainly a moonlight night; but on account of the houses, which are four stories high, it appeared very dark on the side where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in your shop when Mr. Fuller was there? A. About half a dozen at least, but I cannot say distinctly - an old woman was there who had taken tea with me - she is not here, but has been sent for- I am quite sure I was in the shop when Mr. Fuller came in.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What time did Cousins come into the shop? A. About three minutes before I heard the cry - what detained him was he had a newspaper; I took it out of his hand and said, "Lord, I wish I could look at it a bit;" he said, he had just got it from Parnel's, and when he had done with it. I could have it; he had been there for strong beer, and came in with the strong beer in a pewter pot, and asked me for table beer - I believe he had that in a mug; my little girl served him; the old woman was not here yesterday, nor was I - I dare say Cousins spoke to Mr. Fuller in my shop, but I did not attend - Burdet was talking to him, but I did not hear what he said - I stood on the sill of the door - when Mr. Fuller was asked in, I came in also - so many people came in that I was obliged to attend to my place, and did not hear all the conversation - I heard him say, "The villains have stripped me of every thing;" on saying that, I believe Burdet asked if he should know any of them, and I asked him myself - he went away about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, to the best of my knowledge; I never saw Houghton or Boyce; I have been subpoenaed here; I was not here on the former trial.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COUSINS. I am a weaver. On the night Mr. Fuller was robbed, I was in at Dover's, and heard a cry of Stop thief! it was between a quarter and twenty minutes past eight o'clock, for when I came out of my brother's door, the Spitalfields eight o'clock bell had been ringing about ten minutes; I went to Parnel's for a pint of strong beer for my brother, and then went to Dover's for a pint of table beer; the bell had done ringing when I heard the cry of Stop thief! it begins at eight and leaves off at a quarter past eight exactly; on hearing the cry, I came out with the two mugs in my hand, and saw Mr. Fuller at the step of the door; he had no hat or neck-handkerchief; he came to me and said, "The villains have robbed me of my hat, handkerchief, and two boxes of lancets out of my pocket;" Mrs. Dover and some one else said, "Will you come in Sir;" he did so; and I instantly came away; nothing more passed in my hearing - I left the door immediately and did not go in.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you seen any of the prisoner's before? A. I knew Downes by his living exactly opposite my mother's; I believe he is a weaver; I knew the others by seeing them come by my mother's door five or six weeks ago, but do not know them by name; I live in St. John-street, near Fleet-street-hill; I moved there on the Saturday before Mr. Fuller was robbed; I had got a newspaper for my brother to read; I cannot read; Mrs. Dover just looked at it while her daughter got the beer; I heard nobody ask the prosecutor if he should know the men; I went away directly, I did not ask him.</p>

            . On the night Mr. Fuller was robbed, I was in Dover's house - I heard a noise and ran out; it was between eight and nine o'clock, for I heard the clock strike eight, and stopped there a good while afterwards - I have just been fetched here.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. This is the first time you have heard of being wanted here? A. Yes; I have not seen Mrs. Dover since the 11th of September, and never had any conversation with her on the subject; I think it was nearer nine o'clock than eight; I was at Dover's when it struck eight, and heard the bell ring - I think it was better than half-past eight; Mr. Fuller came in without a hat, with a switch in his hand, and let it down by the side of the counter - I was there sewing; I go out charing and sewing; I drank tea between four and five o'clock - I went home directly after this, and got home at nine o'clock, or not much after (I live in Thomas-street, Brick-lane;) I will not swear it was not half-past nine o'clock, or a quarter to ten - I will swear it was not ten; I live about half an hour's walk from Dover's - it is about half a mile.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Fleet-street-hill. I was in doors when Mr. Fuller was robbed; my next door neighbour called out - I ran out, and found Mr. Fuller placed against the wall, by the door of the chandler's-shop; it was a moon-light night; I asked him to go into Dover's, which he did, and I went in with him - he seemed very much agitated; I asked what he had lost; he said he had lost his hat, his cravat, a sovereign, and 3s. or 3s. 6d.; he remained there about ten minutes; I asked if he knew any of the persons, but what answer he gave I do not know, the people being all talking - I can answer that it was from a quarter to twenty minutes after eight o'clock, for I had called in and had a pint of porter at the Red Lion public-house, at the corner of Hunt-street, Mile-end New-town - Spitalfields bell was ringing eight all the time I was going home- it strikes out at eight; I do not think it had ceased when I got home, but I sat some minutes before I heard the alarm.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is your house from Dover's? A. Twenty or thirty yards - I had left home about seven o'clock, to go for my work; it was dusk - it might be a quarter past seven; the moon was up when I came home - I cannot say whether it was up when I went out; I remained with Mr. Fuller at Dover's - I think he was there about ten minutes; I went part of the way home with him. I am a weaver. I do not know Downes, nor any of the prisoners; I have seen the one in the white handkerchief, but not to have any personal knowledge of him, and I do not know his name any further than that you call him Downes.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Fleet-street-hill, and am a weaver. On the night Mr. Fuller was robbed I heard a cry of Stop thief! it was from a quarter to twenty minutes after eight o'clock, for I had been at my own door, and heard the bell ring eight - it had ceased when I heard the alarm; I was in doors, and, to the best of my knowledge, I did not hear it when I came out - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260031"/>saw Fuller standing against Dover's door, without his hat or handkerchief; Morell was up before me: I asked him what Mr. Fuller had lost - he made some inquiry of him. I went into Mrs. Dover's with them - he seemed very much alarmed; we might have remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; Morell and I accompanied him from Fleet-street-hill to the bottom of Fuller-street, Bethnal-green-road, which is about a quarter of a mile; he seemed much frightened, and asked if somebody would be so kind as to see him out of the neighbourhood - I offered my services. When he was standing at Dover's door I remarked it was a pity it was so cloudy, as it was not likely for him to have any assistance from the moon - it was very cloudy, and bade for rain; the moon was covered with clouds at times: I said it was a pity it was so cloudy, as I was doubtful whether he would be able to get the right parties - he made no reply; my wife had followed me to Dover's - I had no hat on, went back for my hat, returned, and found her there - she was there during my absence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember advising the prosecutor not to call out? A. No, Sir - I never did, for I was not there at the time he was robbed; I only heard the call of Stop thief! when I was in-doors - I might have got to him in about three minutes. I did not say he had better not cry out, as the gang was so desperate they would murder him. I was once examined here as prosecutor of one Isaacs, a Jew - I was never here at any other time. I was not examined on behalf of persons named Bowyer and French.</p>

On the night in question I heard a cry, and went to Mrs. Dover's; Mr. Fuller had just got into the shop, and several people were there - he was much agitated; he was asked what he had been robbed of - he said he had lost a sovereign, 3s. 6d., and, I think, one or two cases of surgical-instruments, a beaver hat which cost 30s., and his neckcloth; he was asked, to the best of my recollection, whether he should know any of the robbers - I would not say but what I thought the truth; I think he answered No, he did not think he should, for he was taken at such a nonplus - he said it was rather dark, so dark he did not think he should know them if they were to come before him then. It was a lowering night - the moon shone now and then; the clouds went over it.

I did not know but what it was boys at play; I did not go down then. I had occasion to send one of my children on an errand in about a minute after - I looked at the clock in my room, and it was ten minutes or a quarter past eight; I cautioned my child not to be gone more than ten minutes - she went for something for my supper, which is generally ready about eight o'clock. She had not been gone a minute before I heard a talking in the street - I went out to Dover's door - there were sixteen or eighteen persons there; Mr. Fuller was there: people said, a man had been robbed. I was not there above a minute before Mr. Fuller came out, and the people standing by observed, that was the man who was robbed - he appeared very much alarmed.

I know all the four prisoners; I saw Downes there and Hackman, who had a woollen cap - I was reading a paper, and looked up and saw Downes come in; I think that was about a quarter or nearly twenty minutes past eight o'clock, at the latest - he remained there till about a quarter past ten at night; I think we went out nearly altogether, but I am not certain - he came in deliberately, not in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hackman almost as soon as you saw Downes, or afterwards? A. I think they were nearly together; I think another person was with them, but I did not take particular notice - my attention was directed to the paper. Hackman stopped there till nearly half-past ten o'clock - the landlord would draw no more porter, and we all went out nearly together.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Sidebottom apprehended that night? A. I heard he was - I have never said that we got to the Angel and Trumpet about half-past six o'clock- I have known Downes a long time, by working as a weaver; I have been in that line, but am now a shoemaker, and live at No. 15, Mead-street, which is a quarter of a mile from Fleet-street-hill, or rather more. They came into the public-house cool and deliberately - it was a very dark evening - the moon did not shine before I went to the house; I did not observe what sort of a night it was when they came in - I was either at home or on my way home when Sidebottom was apprehended - I had left him talking to a young woman at the door. I was never taken on any charge of robbery; I was once charged with bullock-hunting, but I did not hunt it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Sidebottom was apprehended after you and him had separated at the door of the Angel and Trumpet? A. He went out first, or we might have gone altogether; but I left him talking to a young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. After you heard the present prisoners had been apprehended on this charge, did you go to the Police-office? A. No; I went in Houghton's case - Mr. Houghton fetched me from my work, and I offered to give evidence; he was charged with robbing Mr. Fuller. Sarah Carnell waited on me at the Angel and Trumpet.</p>

            . In September last I was servant at the Angel and Trumpet. I heard of Mr. Fuller being robbed, on the Wednesday after it happened - on the Monday before that, I waited on three young men at the Angel and Trumpet; Adey and Sidebottom were there; I saw Downes and Hackman there that night; one more came in with them, but I do not know whether Ore is the man. I first saw them there twenty minutes or a quarter past eight o'clock, to the best of my knowledge - I had been out with my beer and returned; I generally take it out a little before eight; it generally takes a quarter of an hour to deliver it - when I came back, I saw Downes and Hackman coming in at the door; they stopped till half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they stop till the house was shut up? A. They went away before the house was shut up - the landlord had not left off drawing beer.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what sort of a pace were they coming into the house? A. Not very fast - a middling pace, like other customers.</p>

            . I have been subpoenaed here, and am a bricklayer - I should have been at work now, if I was not here. I went to the Angel and Trumpet at a quarter before eight o'clock on the night of the 11th of September, and staid till half-past ten - I saw those three prisoners there (pointing to Downes, Ore, and Hackman) - I saw Harry Ore, Charley Downes, and Hackman come in; it was a quarter past eight, as near as I can tell; they remained till half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven o'clock- three more persons came in first, at a quarter before eight - they were Sidebottom, Houghton, and Adey.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, on any former occasion, represent that Adey, Sidebottom, Houghton, and yourself, were the only four persons in the house that night? A. No; there were more.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sworn on any occasion, that the only four persons in your company, were yourself, Adey, Houghton, and Sidebottom? A. I cannot swear it; I have never been in trouble myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see enough of the persons who committed the robbery, to know most or all of them? A. Yes; I went to the office, and gave the names; I saw all the persons engaged in it; there were ten; not one of the prisoners, are either of them, on my oath - Bond was with me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then it was quite light enough for you to see the person who committed the robbery? A. I ran with them and knew them all; it was moonlight, and light enough to discern their persons.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you seen any of them before? A. I had seen them in the afternoon, and have known them for years; I had been hardly a minute on the spot when it was done - I saw them come up, and when they went away I ran with them; Norton was one of them.</p>

            . I am the prisoner Ore's father. I live at No. 8, Wilmot-street, Bethnal-green-road; it is 1070 yards from Fleet-street-hill; I have measured it. On the 11th of September, my son left home, as near as I can recollect, at half-past seven o'clock; it was so dark I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260033"/>not see the colour of the money which I gave him to pass the evening out; Pratt worked for me; some time after this, the prosecutor and his solicitor called; my son was up-stairs at work; he inquired for Ore - I went up-stairs and called him, he was stripped at work - the first question Mr. Fuller asked him was, did he know Sarah Holt; he said, No; the Solicitor or Mr. Fuller said, Henry Ore had given her the instruments; my son answered, "Sir, I never saw the instruments, nor do I know what they consist of;" many questions were asked him - to the best of my recollection they asked if he knew Charles Downes - he said, Yes; they asked where he was last Monday week; he said, at the Angel and Trumpet - they asked what time he was there, and he said about eight o'clock; they asked how he knew it was eight; he said, because he heard some clock strike eight, but did not know what clock it was - they asked who he saw at the Angel and Trumpet; he said, Charles Downes, Adey, Sidebottom, and Houghton; they asked what Houghton was doing, and he said, reading the newspaper - they asked how many persons there were in the tap-room, who they were, and if there were any girls or not; he said, there were no girls that he knew of any kind; there were bricklayers, carpenters, and other tradesmen, but they were strangers to him - they asked if he knew Norton and Quay, and several other names; he said, he did not know those names - the lawyer replied it was a good thing for him that he did not know such characters - the Angel and Trumpet is 2260 yards from my house; my son did not go from home when they left, but remained at his work all the week - and I think it was on the 19th of September the officer took him; he was constantly at work till then - I now know Hackman, he was at the office twice among the officers - he went there as a witness for Downes and my son.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know of his going there once as a free man? A. Yes; he went to clear my son and Downes; that must be about four weeks before he was apprehended; Mr. Fuller was there at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long was Mr. Fuller at your house? A. I suppose half an hour or twenty minutes; I only guess the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was there five minutes? A. Yes; there was no hurry about it, we took our time - and I have not stated all that did pass - we were very considerate, for I thought it important - I had heard of the robbery the day after it was done, but did not know Mr. Fuller to be the person who was robbed till afterwards - I consider they were twenty minutes or half an hour with me; I am certain it was not done in five minutes, it must have been longer - my son was regularly at work from that time till he was apprehended; no officer whatever came to my place to ask for him till Sunday the 24th; when Atfield came, he did not inquire for my son, and I did not know he was an officer - I took him to be a gentleman; but I understood afterwards his name was Atfield - he did not ask for my son, but for another name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then during the interval between the conversation, if an officer had come to ask for your son or apprehend him, they would have found him without difficulty? A. Yes; that I swear - I would have called him down if he had been asked for, the same as I did when the prosecutor came.</p>

            . I work for Ore's father and with the son. On the 11th of September, he went out about half-past seven o'clock - it was then rather dark; I went out to the King's Head public-house about a quarter past eight, at the corner of King-street; I was near Fleet-street-hill.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You had heard then of the robbery? A. All was quiet then; I was told of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you worked with the son? A. About three years.</p>
               <p>MR. HARMER. I was employed by the father of Ore to attend his examination before the Magistrate; the prisoner Hackman came to my office twice or thrice to state the evidence he could give on behalf of Ore and Downes. He afterwards, as I believe, attended at the Worship-street Police-office, for the purpose of being examined - I have no distinct recollection of seeing him at the office; but I informed the Magistrate, in the presence of Mr. Fuller, that I had several witnesses to prove the innocence of Ore and Downes, if he would hear them - Hackman was one of the witnesses to whom I alluded, and have no doubt he was there ready to answer, if the Magistrate had consented to his examination.</p>
               <p>One Witness gave Bishop a good character.</p>
               <p>JURY to S. BARLOW. Q. On what evening in the week is the prayer-meeting held in your chapel? A. Always on Mondays; it commences at eight o'clock; anybody who likes attend it - it is four or five minutes walk from my house, at the corner of Edward-street, Hare-street, at Mr. Stutevant's chapel - I went there after the confusion was over; there is no exhortation; it is merely an exercise of prayer; it closes a little after nine - they pray for the revival of trade - I dare say it was getting towards nine when I got there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know any of the persons who have been examined? A. I think I know some of them as neighbours, but I never associate with anybody - none of them were at the prayer-meeting to my knowledge - it is never on any other evening in the week but Monday - I generally go when I can; I am not a member - I have attended there off and on these twelve years - these prayer-meetings have began since trade has been bad - I felt a lively interest in it, and attended.</p>

Glyn and Co's. - I gave these notes in exchange (looking at them) - here is one of 300l., No. 693, dated the 22d of November, 1825, one of 200l., No. 3746, dated the 22d of November, 1825, and ten of 50l., dated the 12th of November, No. 633 to 644, inclusive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the entry of of this transaction in your own writing? A. Yes. I have not entered the number of the 1000l. note, nor made any mark on it - it has been in the library of the Bank ever since; I got it to day from the solicitor, and cannot say how it got out of the library.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you exchange any other 1000l. note that day for Messrs. Glyn? A. No; I am sure I delivered to their clerk the notes produced.</p>

            . I am now in the accountant's office of the Bank of England. In December last I was employed by Sir Richard Carr Glyn, Bart, who has other partners; they had an account then with Messrs. Sparrow and Co. bankers, at Newcastle-underline. On the 7th of December I took the 1000l. note produced, and received in exchange a 300l., a 200l., and ten 50l. notes (looking at them) - I recognize this one, No. 644 - it was the outer one, and I have written "Sparrow and Co., 1000l." on it; I know the 1000l. note, because I have written on the back of it the particulars of the notes I wanted for it; I put the notes on Mr. Drewett's desk - he is corresponding clerk at Messrs. Glyn's.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Glyns; Sparrow, and Co. corresponded with them in 1825, but have since failed. On the 7th of December I enclosed these notes in a letter - I have no doubt of this, No. 644, being one of them, as it has Sowell's writing on it, and Sparrow's name - I enclosed the notes in a letter with a bond and two bills of exchange in the ordinary course of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260035"/>business - I should lay that letter aside to be sealed with wax, as it contained property, and have no doubt I did seal it - it was Raine's duty to take the letter to the post.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who did you receive the notes from? A. I took them off the desk of the corresponding clerk - a remittance sent to Sparrow at any time would have their name on it; but we did not, before, or subsequent to the date of that note, remit them so large a sum - I finish all the letters before I seal them; it might be unsealed a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes - I do not write the letters, only put the enclosures in them - I am very seldom called away.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Can you recollect whether there was any thing different in the appearance of the letter when you sealed it? A. I recollect unfolding the bond, and making it the envelop of the notes; I heard of the loss on Saturday, the 10th of December.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You cannot speak to what letters you receive? A. No; I put them into the hole; I always shake the bag, and take great care that I put them all in; I have forty or fifty letters daily.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Post-office. On the 7th of December I was at the Liverpool division of the Inland-office, where the Newcastle-under-line bag is made up; it was my duty to examine the bags before they go out to see they are properly sealed - that bag was sealed and tied in the usual manner before it was put into the sack, and given to the guard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What time is the bag made up? A. Ten minutes, or a quarter to eight o'clock - the letters are sorted at their different divisions - from twelve to sixteen clerks are employed in sorting letters, which go to that division - they are put into the office in a body, and distributed among different sorters, who place them at their different divisions - they are then collected by six or eight messengers, who carry them to their respective divisions - they are then placed before the clerk of the division, who marks the postage, which we call taxing - a second person then puts them into the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there are twenty or thirty persons, through whose hands a letter may pass? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Can you say no letter arrived, addressed to them, that day? A.

            . I am president of the Inland-office; the prisoner was a foreign letter-carrier. On the 7th of December, he was employed in the Inland-office as a facer and a collector of mis-sorted letters; his duty was to face them from five to six o'clock, then to collect the mis-sorted ones, till the business of the evening was over; he would go to all the divisions to collect them and bring them to a sorter to be re-sorted - there are a great many mis-sorted letters; mistakes very frequently arise between Newcastle-on-Tyne, and under-line; and such letters would come into his hands - he was the only collector that night.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL, proposed to call Daniel Callaghan. The prisoner's Counsel produced a record of that person's conviction of uttering a counterfeit shilling, on the 31st of December, 1807, and his having received sentence of six months imprisonment, and to find sureties for six months then to come. Messrs. ADOLPHUS, BRODRICK, and LAW then contended that Callaghan was an incompetent witness, the offence being one of those termed "Crimen falsi;" to which MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL and MR. BOLLAND replied. The Court stated, they could see no weight in the objection; but if, upon further consideration, they deemed it necessary, the question should be submitted to the twelve Judges.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Fleet-market. I have known the prisoner thirteen or fourteen years - I have known a person, named Welch, about twenty years - I am told be married Goodman's daughter - I have been in company with Welch, Goodman, and the prisoner together - I have been at Goodman's house with Welch, but not with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, some time ago, meeting the prisoner, and having some conversation with him? A. Yes; it was twelve or fourteen months ago - he then had a situation in the Post-office, as he told me, and I have seen him in his red coat - I saw him and Welch together above twelve months ago - we went and had two pints of stout at a public-house in Fleet-market - Welch told the prisoner he could do some good if he liked to look out, and if he got any thing, I knew where he (Welch) lived - Garlick said he would look out - he did not say for what - we parted; Welch had before then seen the prisoner with me, when he had his red coat on; the prisoner came to my stall in Fleet-market, one night about three months afterwards, and asked me to take a walk with him; we walked as far as St. John-street - he told me he had got something; I asked what it was; he said he did not know, but he believed about 400l. or 500l. - he did not then say where he got it; he asked where Welch lived, and I showed him; he lived in the City-road - he showed me something in a white paper, as we were going along, there was no seal or direction on it - we both went to Welch's house, and saw him - we went up-stairs - Garlick gave him this parcel wrapped up in paper, and there were some notes in it; Welch opened it, counted them, and made 1000l. - there were some 50l. notes - I did not look particularly at them; there were two or three other papers; Welch got hold of one and said, "Here is a bond, I will burn this;" Garlick burned it with the other papers - we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260036"/>went from there to the Ivy public-house, Goswell-street, to call Goodman out of that house; we all three went close to the house, but I went in alone and asked for Goodman - I saw him, and told him Welch was waiting; he came out with me; I told Welch what had passed between me and Goodman; the prisoner was near - I cannot say whether he heard it - I took the notes from Welch to give to Goodman - Garlick was two or three yards off - Welch stood at the corner of the street, near the Ivy, close to me - Garlick was not many yards off - Welch came to me, and Garlick stood where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Garlick join in the conversation at all? A. After I had delivered the notes to Goodman, I did not speak to Garlick - I came back and told Welch what Goodman said he would give for the notes, and went back with a message, leaving the prisoner talking to Welch; I gave Goodman all that Welch gave me - Garlick said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he within hearing when you came back the second time? A. Yes, I think so; I spoke low - I do not know; he might hear me; he said nothing on the subject till the next night - he and I then went to Welch's house, to receive the money - I received 250 sovereigns from Welch, and Garlick 350 sovereigns; Welch kept the remainder for him and Goodman, as he said; 250 for himself and 150 for Goodman. Welch said nothing more - he did not say how the notes were changed - I did not see Goodman any more on this subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any subsequent time met Goodman and Garlick together? A. Never but once, which was by accident, at a public-house in the City-road - they have never been at my house together - I have frequently seen them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any thing to do with the prisoner since? A. Not in that line.</p>

            . I live at No. 49, Berwick-street, three doors from Mr. Gowland. One Friday evening before the 5th of October, my little boy was going to bed in the attic, and somebody asked him to let him in at the window, which was shut: I went up, and he asked me to let him in to go through the house; the prisoner is the person, to the best of my belief - he said his name was Mitchell, that he was a ladies' shoemaker, and lodged at Mr. Johnson's (who is a baker in our street) - that he had been sent on an errand, and staid a great while, and when he came home, his father was in a great passion, and he had got away on the top of the house. I was afraid to go back - I opened the window and let him through - I asked if he would let me see his mother, that I might be sure he was telling the truth; he said I should; he followed me down stairs; I walked with him as far as Johnson's, saw him go in, and I then returned towards my own house. He brought a woman, and said, "Mother, this is the person who has let me through the house:" she thanked me, and told me he had been sent on an errand, and stopped a long time; his father was in a great passion, and if he had caught him, would have beat him severely. I saw the prisoner in custody on the 5th of October; it was more than a week before that - I believe him to be the person. A parapet runs from Gowland's house to mine, and he could go no further than my house.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 30th of September I found the prisoner at the watch-house - I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Mr. Mitchell's. where Gowland lodges. He said he knew I did, but Jem the errand-boy was as bad as him, for he let him through his master's house, and pointed out where the things were, and he went through the house, and took the boots and coat, and Jem was to go with him next morning to Solomon's, a fence, in Seven Dials - all this was voluntary - I got the articles from Fergues. I apprehended Jem next day, and after two examinations he was admitted to bail.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of the man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you now know where the prosecutor lives? A. Yes; my chariot was drawn up about one hundred yards from his house. I am certain of them both.</p>
               <p>MR. AUSTIN re-examined. Q. The first circumstance which attracted your attention was, finding the linen in your drawers disordered? A. Yes; the drawers were locked - there is a pannel back to the whole chest, and then a back to each drawer; I found that had been taken out.</p>

            . I live at the end of Badger-yard, St. John-square. I know the prisoner Riley. On the 10th of September I recollect a chariot coming, which the last witness drove; I saw Riley opposite my window - he went down before the coach; I saw him cross over and get into it - he was there about a quarter of an hour, and then Mrs. Charles came with a basket of clothes, which she put into the coach, and went away; Riley then put his hand down to see what was in it - Roberts then came with a parcel in the shape of a writing-desk, in a cloth - she put it into the coach, and went away - then a long paper box was brought, and put into the coach; she went back, and fetched more things several times, and at last went away in the coach with Riley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where Mr. Austin lives? A. Yes - I did not see Riley go to the house - the things were covered up.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th of August I went to Mr. Austin's house, and found the back of his drawers had been taken out, and half broken off; it was taken quite away from the room, and then the back of the drawers themselves were taken out, and put under Mr. Austin's bed, and under the servant's bed was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260039"/>pannel back of the drawers - there was a quantity of nails in it, which stuck into the bed by the pressure. I found two panch-ladles and a cheese-taster under her bed; the drawers were about four feet and a half square - it was one entire pannel back and nailed in; it would require some time and some experience to take it out.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday, the 15th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I had just come off duty, and met Webley in Long-alley, Shoreditch, four or five hundred yards from Mr. Corys' - he was carrying a bag with two cheeses; I followed, stopped him in Angel-alley, and asked where he got them; he said he found them at the top of Cornhill - I took him to the watch-house, and found thirty eggs in his hat, and in his pocket two leaves, corresponding with a book which Mr. Cory had in his shop; Mr. Cory claimed the cheeses. I took Sawyer on the Monday, and at the second examination the Lord Mayor sent for Cornwell - an officer brought him, and he was committed.</p>

            . I am porter to a wine-merchant. On Sunday morning, the 15th of October, I saw Cornwell waiting with two persons, opposite Mr. Cory's door, from six o'clock to half-past six; when they saw me at the window Cornwell said something to the other two, and walked down the street a little way - he then returned to them, and walked away again; I saw the other two run across opposite to Corys' door - I was going out in about half an hour, and Cornwell passed me with a bundle under his arm, tied in a black handkerchief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CORY, JUN. I am in partnership with my father - we live in Bishopsgate-street. I know the prisoners, by seeing them all walk about the street, but I have not seen them in company. These cheeses are ours - we did not miss them till Fincham brought them; we have too many to miss them, but I know we never sold them.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Cory's service. On Sunday morning, the 15th of October, about a quarter past six o'clock I opened the door - Webley and Sawyer crossed over, and came into the shop; Webley followed me down stairs, and brought up a cheese, which he gave to Sawyer; I knew them before. It was agreed they should come - they had been there the Sunday before, and I had made an agreement on Saturday with Webley, that they should come - I knew Cornwell before, but not Sawyer so well as the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came on Sunday morning? A. Webley and Sawyer. When Webley gave Sawyer the cheese he took it out, wrapped in an apron; Cornwell then came in, and I gave him a piece of butter, and twenty or thirty eggs; he wrapped the butter in a black handkerchief; Cornwell went away with them - Webley had a bag - he took two cheeses and put into it, and had thirty eggs, some in his hat - that is all they had that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of robbing your master? A. Yes, for about three Sunday mornings - I am still in his employ. I was taken up, and then mentioned this circumstance; Sawyer had never been there before - the others had been twice. I have lived a year and a half with Mr. Cory.</p>
               <p>WEBLEY's Defence. He carried the game on long before I knew him; he knew three or four more lads, and never came out of the shop without his pocket full of copper.</p>
               <p>CORNWELL's Defence. I met him on Saturday - he asked me to come down, and said he would give us anything.</p>
               <p>SAWYER'S Defence. He told us to come at half-past six o'clock; we waited opposite the shop, and he called us; he called me out of bed one night, and gave me some ham; every morning he used to bring out halfpence, and give to us to change at the shop for silver.</p>

On the 25th of August, as I came from 'Change, my clerk informed me two officers wished to see me - they gave me information; I went to the warehouse, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and found the door of one of the floors broken open; some wool appeared to have been moved; I had not been there for some time - I went with the officers to Spitalfields-church, and found several bags of wool, which I knew to be ours - I have a partner - I inquired for the carman - they said they knew where to find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner has been in your employ? A. He was our warehouseman, but had left us two or three years - I never knew any thing directly against him.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Earl and Co., wine-merchants, Tower-street. On the 25th of August, at seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and two others loading a cart with wool from the prosecutor's warehouse - one of the men was the carman - the prisoner was getting the bags of wool out of the tier for the crane to let them down - I had never seen him before; I saw the cart go out of the gate - their warehouse is in our yard - the carman drove it away - the prisoner was active in loading the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe there has been some former trial on this business? A. The carman was tried and acquitted - the prisoner could not be found then - I never recollect seeing him before - it was quite light - I was not examined on the carman's trial - I could have sworn to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the bags appear to be wool? A. Yes; I have no doubt of it.</p>

            . I am a silk-weaver. On the 25th of August, about two o'clock, I was in Brick-lane, and saw a cart loaded with wool, standing at the corner of Booth-street; several persons said it had been about there a long time; I saw it standing there for an hour, and thought something was wrong - I saw the prisoner pass once or twice, and speak to the carman; and when the cart went away he stood on the opposite side - I went to fetch Almond, by Spitalfields-church - he went and questioned the carman where he got the wool from; and he told him; the prisoner was waiting at some distance from the cart, patroling to and fro on the opposite side of the way, and not within hearing - this was about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was there patroling, was he? A. He was walking backward and forward - I did not know him before, and did not listen to his conversation; I was not examined on the last trial, but I was here - I have been a witness here once, as I apprehended a man, and was paid for my attendance - I have been here, and heard trials, but do not recollect having been a witness, except when I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been here within six years? A. Yes; I recollect it was about robbing a ready-furnished lodging, and I recollect being examined against Taylor for a highway robbery - he was acquitted - I got 3s. 6d. a day for my expenses - that is not more than I can earn - I now sell fruit about, as I have no work.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever here, except as a witness? A. Yes; I was tried here, and honourably acquitted, and the prosecutor's expenses refused; it was for a highway-robbery - I merely went to assist a drunken man - that was in April, 1817.</p>

               <p>MR. COOPER. I saw the wool, it was taken from our warehouse in Tower-street, and have no doubt of its being ours - the prisoner left our service two years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it; if I had, I should not have stood in the street looking for work as I did.</p>

            . I am the wile of Thomas Holland; the prisoner lodged with us at Bromley's-buildings; we occupied the house about four months and a fortnight, as quarterly tenants; it was a new house; we bought the stoves, and left them behind, in part payment to the landlord; I left Roberts and her cousin in care of the house, till they got their goods out; they were two friends, but did not lodge there - I left the fixtures there on the 5th and did not return till the Tuesday evening following; the stoves were then gone; I have since seen two, which I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your husband is here? A. Yes, I valued the fixtures at fifty shillings; we owed one quarter and a half's rent - 10l.; it was 30l. a year - we left a water-but, blinds, stoves, and other things, valued altogether at 5l. - the landlord agreed we should pay the rest as we could afterwards; we took some of of our things away by daylight, and some at night; we did not tell the landlord we were going to move; the prisoner lodged in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any money since he was taken up? A. A young man named Chapman gave me five shillings for my trouble, for the two days which he took me about; he said, he did not wish me to go about with him, and lose my time - on a Monday morning I called to see his mother, whom I knew - she was there - he wanted me to see the prisoner's mother - I said I did not mind seeing her - he said, he wished me to satisfy her how the stoves went - I went with him, and he gave me five shillings, saying, he did not wish me to lose my time for nothing - on my oath, that is what he gave it me for; he wanted me to keep out of the way, but did not give me the five shillings for that - I never said, I would not prosecute the prisoner, as I thought my husband was more to blame than him - I did not promise him anything, it was too late - I wanted him to place the stoves back before I went to the officer; but then it was gone too far.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not move your goods, to keep the landlord out of the rent? A. I did it to prevent losing my goods, but not to cheat him - I was not able to pay him - the prisoner works at the shoe-business; he is married, and I believe he has two children.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your landlord's name? A. Mr. Keaton - I have spoken to him since, about paying the rent; he sent to say we must pay for the stoves, as they were gone; Chapman said he knew the prisoner and his friends wanted me to see his mother, to ease her mind - I had then been before the Magistrate, and it was too late to settle it; he gave me the 5s. for my trouble in walking about to find the mother - the prisoner furnished his room himself, and had not moved his goods. I left this woman in the house till he could move them.</p>

On the 5th of October he brought me four stoves; he said he had taken a house, and should put in better ones, for they were worn out, and were of no use to him; I paid him 17s. for them - I had bought things of him before, and knew him to be honest. The prosecutor saw them at my door, and owned them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You gave 17s.? A. Yes, and sold two of them for 6s. each - I gave the full value.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Fixtures, left as such, are of more value then when moved? A. Certainly - there is the bricklayer's work; some charge 4s. or 5s. for setting a stove. They were large old-fashioned stoves - I would not set them in my own room.</p>

            . I live in Radnor-street, St. Luke's. I have seen Mr. Holland outside the Court to-night. On Monday last I called at Mr. Adey's - a woman came in, whom I did not know before, and talked about the prisoner - that is the woman (pointing to the prosecutrix); she said she believed he was persuaded to it, and all she wanted was the stoves returned; I told her I did not know the case, for I was two hundred miles off at the time, but the family were respectable, and I made no doubt if he had taken them wrongfully they would be returned - she said that was all she wished, and that the witness had said a great deal more then was true; she then went with me to his mother, and wished to have a receipt on a stamp to show to her husband, or she should not feel satisfied; I said that was nothing but honour, and accordingly wrote it, but told her it was nought; she then said she could not walk about for nothing, and must have something for shoe-leather; I gave her 5s., and she went home satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her the receipt for? A. For the stoves, which she said he had moved - I drew the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say the stoves had been moved against her will, and unknown to her? A. Yes; I gave her the 5s. for her trouble, but I considered it on the stoves; I dictated the receipt myself - I did not then know he was in custody. This is the receipt - (read.)</p>
               <p>This is to prove and satisfy Mr. Holland, that six stoves now removed from the house of the said Mr. Holland, at No. 4, Bromley's-buildings, by Charles Huslett, on the 5th of October, are to be replaced on his receiving his liberty, to which John Chapman, of Radnor-street, and his sister has placed the sum of 3l. 10s. to be paid.</p>

On the 11th of October, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at my own door, and heard a woman had been knocked down - I have lived in that neighbourhood six or seven years - I knew the prisoner by sight; I have merely spoken to him; he is a cobbler - I saw him in the street with a knife in his hand - I went up to him, and told him he had better put it away; I then laid hold of his arm, and he stabbed me in the left thigh; and after that I had hold of his right shoulder, trying to take the knife from him - he shook himself out of my hands - I got my arm round his neck, and tried to throw him down - he then stabbed me in the right thigh. I was stunned, and fainted away immediately; I tried to take the knife from him, because I heard he had knocked a woman down and stahbed her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I had been robbed, and wounded in my breast? A. He did not say so to me - I saw no wound in his breast - I cannot say what happened before I saw him; he appeared sober.</p>

            . I am a pensioner of Chelsea-college. I was in Turk's-row, and met the prisoner about a hundred yards from White-lion-street, coming out of a little alley, with a shoemaker's knife in his hand - I saw no blood on him - I said, "Are you an Irishman?" he said, "No, d-n you, what do you do with me?" - he seized me, and attempted to stab me - he cut my coat and breeches, but I got from him; I saw nobody doing any thing to provoke him; he said nothing about being robbed - I went directly to the constable - he declined coming, but told me to get a warrant. I went back, and saw him going towards the market-place, with the knife in his hand, swearing velemently if anybody should interrupt him, he would run their g-ts out; I had not been absent a quarter of an hour. Knight stood at the corner, with two or three other men: I said that man would injure somebody, it was a pity he was not taken up - Knight went forward, laid his hand on his left shoulder, and told him to throw the knife out of his hand - he said he would not - Knight took hold of his right shoulder; he then stabbed him with great force - Knight still held him, and tried to get him down; he endeavoured to catch him inside the thigh - Knight then got from him: he was swearing in the most unbecoming manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you knock me down? A. Yes, after you had stabbed Knight twice - you had no wound in your breast, and said nothing about being robbed - he appeared perfectly sober, but in a passion.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I had been robbed? A. No; he said something before the magistrate about being left in charge of a house - I saw no wound in his breast before to-day.</p>
               <p>JOHN GORMAN re-examined. He complained to the magistrate of being wounded in the breast; he was not wounded when I met him - he must have done it in struggling - I saw it bleeding when before the magistrate.</p>

On the morning of the 5th of August, I heard a cry of Murder! as I was going my rounds at half-past one o'clock; a female in the street gave me an alarm, and showed me this house, No. 265, High Holborn - the prisoner lived there and Mr. Lazarus - when I got to the house, the street-door was fast-Lazarus opened it to me - I had rang the bell - I will not be certain whether Lazarus had a light, but the kitchen-stairs were on fire, which gave me a light - I went through the passage to the back part of the house down the kitchen-stairs, over the part that was on fire - the fire was under the stairs - it was then burning quite in a flame through the joists of the stairs - I could not then judge how long it had been burning - I got water and extinguished the flame, then broke up two of the kitchen-stairs with my stick - people up the stairs threw more water on it - those people did not belong to the house - I thought it was the watchman; I broke down the lath and plaster to see if there were any embers remaining - the engines came, and I left the en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260045"/>gine-keeper and men in the house, and I was ordered to my duty - it must have been burning some time, because two steps of the stairs were nearly burned through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing occur to you to observe what had produced the flame? A. I saw part of the flame coming down at the time - it seemed to be hanging down and dropping, as if it was from gas burning - about half an hour afterwards I went there, and Riley showed me two pieces of links - I have seen links burning, and my notion then was that the links had produced that flame, which was hanging down - it was similar to what I have seen with links burning - I believe that flame was produced by links - I looked at the place, but there was no gas-pipe there, which could have produced it - the shop was lighted with gas (the witness here examined the model of the house, and pointed out the spot where the fire had been found) - Furzeman, Riley, and a fireman, named Mills, had all come before I left the place - I found a kind of step-ladder placed against the cupboard-door; I was about the house all the morning till I left duty; I went in, but did not go down-stairs afterwards; I saw the prisoner and Lazarus when the fire was burning; the prisoner was coming down the stairs, not exactly dressed; I think he had a long grey frock morning-coat on; I went into the back-parlour every time I went into the house; I saw nothing amiss there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have talked a great deal about this since you were examined at the office? A. I have been answering questions that were asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at Marlborough-street, say one word about the flame, which was supposed to come from links, descending? A. I was not examined till the last hearing; I gave evidence, with regard to the flame burning down, to the best of my belief; but I was not sworn about the fire on the 5th of August; it was about the one on the 18th.</p>

            . I am round-house-keeper of St. Giles. On the morning of the 5th of August, I was called to a fire at Mr. White's house - I went with the parish-engine - my brother and Riley got there a little before me - I went through the passage and saw several gentlemen there, also Shine the watchman - they called me down saying, "Here is the fire;" I ran down - it was then pretty well out - I began to examine the place, and observed to Mr. White, "There is something wrong about this fire;" I looked about, and found the place under the stair-case was burned almost to a cinder - I went into the kitchen to Mr. White, and asked him whether he suspected any one in the house, for I was sure that it had been set on fire - he said that some time previous to that fire the table, which stood in the front-kitchen, had been set alight by some person - I examined the table; it was oak, I believe - it appeared to me that some liquied had been on the table and a candle - it was much burned in the middle; I asked him who occupied that kitchen; he said no one had access to that lower part but Mr. Lazarus' family and the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of the door having been shut, to exclude anybody? A. No; the doors were all open - he said, he suspected Lazarus's servant, that is

            ; she was called down-stairs, and there was some altercation between Lazarus and the prisoner, who should give her in charge - White insisted that Lazarus was the most proper person to charge her; Riley came and begged of me to come back, and search the place under the stairs - I did so, and on searching among the mortar that had fallen down, I saw Riley pick up two pieces of link, he has had them ever since - they were eight or nine inches long - one rather longer than the other; they appeared to have been burnt very much - I then examined under the stairs, and on one of the beams, on a sort of ledge, I found a quantity of pitch, which I supposed had come from the links - either Riley or I tried if one of the links would fit the place on the ledge, where it appeared to have stood, and it fitted the place - I do not think Mr. White went under the stairs with us - I went into the kitchen again, and asked White whether he ever had any links in the house; he said, he had never had any think of the sort in his house - the girl was then taken into custody - none of the gas conductors came near the place under the stairs, I observed nothing more that night - on Friday, the 11th of August, Lazarus and the prisoner called on me; I had sent for them in consequence of information I had received - White said, he had been dining with his mother the day before, and she had told him there were some links in the house, six or eight months ago - I said, "You told me the last time I saw you, that there were no links at all in the house, and that you had no occasion for any; it is very strange" - I said, I wanted them to go down to Mr. Bradford's, where I understood links had been bought, but I could not go then; it was appointed to go next day, which was Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing else pass when he mentioned about his mother saying there had been links in the house? A. Yes; I said, "What in the name of God could you want with links six or eight months ago;" he said, he had had a party of friends, and they were sitting in the yard - the candles had blown out, and they had the links to light them.</p>
               <p>Q. That would have been about Christmas, that they were sitting in the yard? A. It was in the winter; I I made some observations to him, which I do not recollect; we met next day (Saturday) at Bradford's; Lazarus, the prisoner, myself, and Davies, a broker, who lives in Holborn, within sixty yards of the prisoners house - Bradford is an oil-man, living opposite George-street, St. Giles, just by middle-row; on entering the shop, Lazarus said to Bradford, "Am I the person who bought the links?" Bradford said, "No, you are not" - the prisoner then directly said, "I can prove, by two witnesses, that I was in bed at twelve o'clock that day," meaning the 4th of August - Bradford had said, they were bought between ten and one on the 4th of August - Bradford then said, he could tell better if he saw White in his morning-gown; he had not at that time said anything about White being the person; Lazarus said, "I will go home and change my clothes, and put on every dress I have got, and you shall see me;" I said to the prisoner,"You will have no objection to go home, and put on your morning gown, and let Mr. Bradford see you;" he hesitated a minute, and said, "Indeed I shall not do any thing of the kind, for I shall not make a puppet-show of myself;" I had seen him in his morning-gown at the time of the fire, and when I saw him in it afterwards, it appeared to have been altered in the sleeves, and it had been cut shorter.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260046"/>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner is a married man? A. Yes; his wife slept in the house that night - I cannot say that he declined giving charge of the servant; Lazarus, I think, ultimately declined it; I said,"It don't matter which of you charge her, if you have any suspicion;" when she was in confinement, some things were brought her - I cannot say whether they came from White.</p>
               <p>Q. What breadth was the ledge, which you say the links appeared to fit? A. Under the stairs is lath and plaster, and in that lath and plaster was a hole, where it appeared the links had been put in - I believe the prisoner afterwards went to the Fire-office, and gave notice of the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he go voluntarily before the parish-officers? A. He would not about the first fire; a summons was sent to him on the 1st of September, and he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that summons to show some cause, why he did not pay some money for the engine? A. I think so, but the gentleman is here who wrote the letter - business prevented my going to Bradford's on Friday - we went on Saturday afternoon; I proposed to White, to go home for his morning-gown, and come back, and show himself - his house is about a quarter of a mile or rather less, from there - it is a crowded neighbourhood; and he said, he should not make a puppet-show of himself - Bradford and his boy were quite silent in his presence, as to whether he was the person who bought the links.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose on the night of the fire, there was great confusion in the house? A. I got to work directly down below - I saw three or four respectable inhabitants round about - I staid there about two hours examining the premises, and talking to persons.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Bradford declared distinctly Lazarus was not the person; the prisoner immediately said, he could prove he was in bed, and nothing further was said? A. No, nothing further was said.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Giles. I went into the house on the 5th of August, rather before Furzeman; the fire was partially burning - I found two pieces of links, which I produce - I have preserved them as well as I could; I found him under the kitchen stair-case, among the lath and plaster, which had been pulled down - (Here the witness pointed out in the model, the place where he had found them) - the next morning I went with Furzeman, to examine the front kitchen; I examined the floor and the range; one of the bars of the range appeared as if some greasy substance had been on it; it was dirtier than the other part; and in a direction from the fire-place, to the place where the fire was, I found several droppings of pitch or tar in a train; I cut them up from the floor with my knife, applied them to a candle, and they burnt; I think them the same stuff as links are composed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. They extended from the range to where? A. Under the stair-case, as far as the floor went, and to where there was no water; and where the water was I saw spots, but cannot say whether they were far; there was a line of spots from the range to the fire.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Bradford, an oilman, of St. Giles. On the 4th of August I recollect a person coming to purchase two links; I really believe the prisoner is that person - it was between eleven and one o'clock, or it might be half-past one - I cannot exactly say: he was dressed in a grey morning-gown, and took them away with him, rolled up in a blue bag; there was more pitch on them than links generally have; it is not very common to sell them in summer time - (looking at the pieces of links produced,) these appear very much like them, as far as I am able to judge. I saw the prisoner about two months afterwards, at St. Giles' watch-house, in a grey morning-gown - I thought it the same gown, but it was cut shorter at the tail, no where else that I observed. I recollect Furzeman, White, Lazarus, and another person coming to my master's house a few days after the 4th of August - I was not at home when they came, but the day before that the prisoner came without Furzeman, but with a short gentleman, whom I do not know; they came in, and asked if Mr. Bradford was at home; I said, No - he said, "My name is White - I called concerning some links;" I told him we did not want any at present - I thought he was come to sell some: he said, "I do not mean that - I understand you have been telling the beadle that I bought some links here;" I said, "How can you say that, when I did not know you?" I did not tell him what I said to the beadle, but told him we had sold some links, and described the person who purchased them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe him by his clothes? A. Yes; I said the person had a grey morning-gown on who bought the links; he replied, "That is just such a dress as I wear;" the short gentleman asked me what sort of a person it was, whether he was like a Christian or a Jew; I said I did not notice enough of the man. I have seen Lazarus, and am sure he is not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion at this time, although you might not have expressed it? A. My opinion at that time was, that the prisoner was the person; I did not like to say so then. I did not like to accuse him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not say as a reason for your knowing the less about him, that you had not dealt with him, but your master had served him? A. Yes; my master had served him - there were no other customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you not always said it was between eleven and one o'clock? A. I have - I told the Justice so; it is quite uncertain what time I dine - my attention was called to the circumstance about a week after they were bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not always said from then till to-day, that it was between eleven and one o'clock? A. Yes, but I cannot speak exactly to a minute; I have no reason for extending the time.</p>
               <p>Q. If the coat which you saw on the prisoner at the watch-house was the one he wore on the day he bought the links, you are sure it was cut shorter? A. It was shorter than when he bought the links, I am certain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you frequent demand for links since gas-lights have been established? A. Very seldom indeed - we mostly sell them about the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw him in the shop you thought he was the person who bought your links - why then did you say you had no orders to give him for links? A. Because I did not take much notice when he first came in.</p>

            . I am a colourman, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles - Dodwell is my shopman. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260047"/>the 4th of August some person came to buy some links - I at first said it was from eleven to one o'clock, but I think it might be a little after one; I had no knowledge of him before - he was dressed in a mixed morning drugget-coat; he bought two links, paid 4d. for them, and took them away, in a blue bag, something like an attorney's bag. I produce a link taken from the same bundle; they are more pitched than they generally are; I have compared the pieces produced before they got rubbed so much - they appeared to me to be of the parcel. On the 11th of August I heard, from my boy, that a gentleman named White had called. On the 12th Lazarus and Furzeman came with the prisoner - Lazarus said they came on the subject of the links, was he at all like the person who had bought the links on the 4th of August; I said, No, neither his person nor his voice would do (he is a Jew, I could tell that from his face); I said the person had on a morning-gown, and I should be able to say more about it when I saw him in that dress - Lazarus said he would go home and bring all the dresses he had, to convince me he was not the person who purchased them; Furzeman said it was evident some one in the house must have placed the links there; Lazarus said, perhaps Mr. White would not mind coming in his morning-dress, for me to see him - White said he did not see why he should make himself a puppet-show to please any one; they then went away. I have since seen the prisoner in a grey morning-coat, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen him now, and on other occasions, what is your opinion? A. He very much resembles the person who bought the links; when I saw him at the watch-house his coat appeared as if cut shorter in the skirts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It might be a few minutes before one o'clock as well as after when he bought the links? A. It might; I could have seen the time by locking out at the church, but I did not; I think it must be a little after one, from what I recollect since - I think I was not asked about the time at the office; the grey coat appeared something shorter when he was at the watch-house; when he was wrapping them up he took the cross way with his bag, and I noticed his dress more than his face, as I had not a full view of his face while he was wrapping them up, but I saw him come into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not venture to swear to him without seeing him in his coat? A. I wished it to be put on - I say now he is very much like him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There was nobody else in the shop at the time? A. No, except the servant; I generally dine about one o'clock; my wife was coming in with a few steaks, just after he was gone. In the summer time we sell very few links, except to a few drovers, and boys about the Theatres.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually sell many of them to persons of the prisoner's description? A. Very seldom, except persons go into the country, or it is a very foggy night.</p>

            . I am a jeweller and general-dealer, and live at No. 3. Rutland-street, Gloucester-terrace, Commercial-road. In August last, I lodged at the prisoner's house with my wife, one child, grandmother, sister, and servant - there were six of us altogether - I lived there since August 1825 - Mr. White occupied the house then, and lived there till after the fire - I occupied the first floor, two rooms on the garret-floor, and the front-kitchen - the gas-cocks were in the front-kitchen; the prisoner and his family had access to the front-kitchen for the purpose of turning the gas on and off - it is turned on about dark - the kitchen-door is always open, they may go in and out when they please - I and my wife slept in the garret, the servant in the middle-garret, my grandmother and sister in the first-floor, back-room; but at the time of the fire the servant slept on a sofa, in the first-floor, as she complained of being annoyed by bugs - the prisoner and his wife slept on the second-floor, I believe - on the 4th of August, I and my wife went to bed near twelve o'clock - I was awoke in an hour and a quarter, or an hour and a half, by a smoke and smother in the room - I called my wife, got up and opened the door, as the room was full of smoke - I called out, "There is a fire in the house;" I took my child in my arms, and went down stairs as fast as I could to the street-door, having only my trousers on; I unlocked the middle passage-door, and while I was unbolting the street-door, the bell rang - the watchman came in as I went out; the middle-door prevents people coming to the shop, communicating with the stairs - I made no observation, but went down with my family to Little Turnstile - and when I returned, the prisoner was in the parlour - suspicion fell on my servant-girl - Furzeman had her in the parlour, questioning her about the fire - she said she knew nothing about it; but White suspected her - and she was suspected on a former occasion - they asked me to give charge of her - I said I did not know what to do; they said I must give charge of her - and I went and left her at the watch-house; I called to see my family - then returned, and the prisoner stood in the passage laughing - he was talking to nobody - I said, "Mr. White, I really see nothing to laugh at;" he made no answer - I went into the parlour with him, and he said, "Lazarus, if I was you I would not prosecute her;" he did not say why - I said, "Mr. White, I don't know what you mean, you first make me take up the girl, thinking her intention was to burn nine or ten persons in their beds, and now you tell me you would not prosecute;" he made no answer - I afterwards attended the Police-office, and the charge was abandoned - there is a trap-door over the garret, communicating with the roof; on the night of the 1st of August, when I went up to bed, that trap-door was open, and a ladder placed against it - I called to Catherine Taylor, the prisoner's servant, to know what the ladder did there - I removed it down seven stairs - I could not shut the trap-door down - I had never seen it open before, to my knowledge - it was never open at night - the ladder was kept between the front-kitchen and cellar-door - I never saw it up-stairs before - it was not a heavy one - it remained down six or seven stairs, where I had removed it, till the fire - on the Friday after the fire, I met with the prisoner and Furzeman, and it was agreed we should go altogether the next day to the place where the links were bought - I did not go before the next day - when I went, White was asked to put on a morning-coat - he said he would not - I said, "Mr. Bradford, if you think I am like the man at all, I will go home and put on all the clothes I have;" I never bought any links, and never placed them under the stairs - I quitted the house on the 8th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. What do you mean by a general dealer? A. I buy jewellery, clothes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260048"/>and any thing; but do not work at any trade - I attend sales - I am of the Jewish persuasion - the place under the stairs where the fire broke out is where I kept some things which belonged to the feast of the Passover; they belonged to my grandmother - that place was in my occupation; it was not fastened at all. White attended at Marlborough-street on the Saturday and Wednesday when my servant was examined - I do not think he was examined; there were two or three examinations - the magisstrate said that nothing could be made of it, but the charge stood open against her.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you charged her with stealing some property of yours? A. Yes, she was detained on my charge, tried here last Session, and acquitted; I was not allowed my expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept in the garret, the furthermost place from where the fire was? A. Yes; I was the first person who gave the alarm; I did not knock at White's door as I came down; I think he was coming out of his door - I called out Fire! directly I opened my door; they were all down as soon as us. My first care was to put my wife and family in a place of safety, at Mr. Davies', in Little Turnstile - my grandmother and all went there - I was not gone five minutes, and on my return I heard that suspicion had fallen on my servant Drew; she was taken to the watch-house, and then I came back and saw him laughing - the fire was out then - I said nothing to him about the trap-door, as he was out of the house that night; I mentioned it to Catherine - it remained open from then till the fire, but I had taken the ladder away, and it remained where I left it - I had left his house myself before I went to Bradford's about the links, but all my property remained there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, he had levied a distress on it? A. No, not then, not till the Tuesday afterwards - I swear he did not levy the distress till then: we were not to leave his place till the 29th of September; I owed a quarter's rent, but no distress was put in till after I went to Bradford's. I received a letter about the rent on Tuesday, (it was sent to my mother's, at 33, Maiden-lane,) and on Wednesday a man came to let me know of the distress - no application was made to me about the rent till after the fire, but the agreement was that it should be paid half-yearly - my property was moved from the house six weeks before Michaelmas-day; we were to go to Bradford's on the Friday, but Furzeman being engaged, I went on Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had the girl lived with you? A. Since August 1825 - we had had no difference before the fire; nothing had passed so as for her to have any spite against us; I never heard of her having any dispute with the prisoner or his family.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Why did you cease to sleep in the house - did the prisoner remain at home after the fire? A. No, he went out on Saturday, and said he was going to Fulham - he was gone three nights: finding he did not come home, I thought it right to leave. I and all the family had sat up two nights, and I left the house on Monday. I paid 50l. a year, and paid the rent half-yearly; here is a receipt for 25l. up to Lady-day (read) - nothing was due till Michaelmas, but he distrained on me for a quarter's rent - I was not under difficulty about the payment, if the proper time had arrived. The trap-door leads to a loft, and there is a way out on the roof.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Tuesday night, the 1st of August, as I was going to bed, I observed a ladder placed against the trap-door, which was open - I had never seen it there before, nor the trap-door open of a night - I said I should not be easy unless the ladder was taken away before I retired to bed; Mr. Lazarus then moved it on the stairs - it remained there, and the trap-door open till the fire - it was usually kept by the kitchen-door. The fire happened on the 4th. We had been on the most amicable terms with Mr. and Mrs. White, and I had a great respect for him and his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you seen the ladder there during the day? A. No; I think I had not been up stairs that day - I had seen a ladder against the trap-door once, in the day time, during the time I lived there, but never at night; it is a flat trap-door in the passage, and leads to the loft, and then outside the house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. White - I am still in his service; he and Mrs. White slept in the middle-room, on the second floor; all the rooms not occupied by Lazarus, were in his possession; the ladder was generally kept down-stairs, but the boy had taken it to get some wood from the top of the house; he asked master if he should bring it down; he told him to please himself - this was on the 1st or 2d of August, I believe; I remember the night the fire broke out; Mr. and Mrs. White had gone to bed about twelve o'clock that night - I went to bed about ten minutes afterwards; he slept from home two nights after the fire - he had a previous engagement at his mother's, at Fulham - I sat up both these nights till four o'clock, as Mr. and Mrs. Lazarus wished me - Mrs. White slept out with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before the fire had you lived there? A. Nearly three months; I went to bed on the 4th of August, about twelve o'clock; I was not down in the lower kitchen that night; my own kitchen is level with the parlour; master was engaged in the parlour with a friend for half an hour, before he went up to bed - I was not in Lazarus's kitchen, and cannot say whether there was a fire in his range - I sleep in the back attic, on the same floor with Mr. Lazarus - I heard an alarm of fire about one o'clock, and we all went down.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night before the 4th of August, where had your master been - I mean the 3d of August? A. Master and mistress had been out, to go to the Coburg Theatre; it was nearly two o'clock when they returned - it was a very tempestuous evening indeed; master came down stairs next morning at twelve o'clock; I made no observation to him about it; he breakfasted in the parlour adjoining the shop, and even with the kitchen; he dined about half-past three; I moved the breakfast things after one; he was then still at the table where he had breakfasted; it was ten minutes or a quarter past one, when I moved the breakfast things away; he was reading when I left the room; I was in and out of the room frequently; when I went in, he was sometimes in the shop, and sometimes in the parlour; he could go out through the passage without going through the shop; I did not see him go out; I have every reason to believe he did not go out; I was about on my business all day; he had his morningcoat on that morning; I recollect it up to the time he was taken into custody; he had had new sleeves put to it, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260049"/>I never observed it shorter; I never took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it your master's habit to wear that coat in the course of the day? A. He always wore it, except when he went out; he generally breakfasted between nine and ten o'clock - I have two beds to make up-stairs after breakfast; I seldom go up-stairs till after the breakfast things are cleared away; my kitchen is on the same floor with the shop and parlour, but detached from the house.</p>

            . I am a mill and machine-maker - I live at No. 266, High Holborn, next door to the prisoner's house - he occupied the house at the time of the fire - Mr. Treacher, a tallow-chandler, lived on the other side - on the second day after the fire, I had some conversation with the prisoner; something was said about Lazarus's servant being detained; he told me Lazarus's servant had been remanded for a further examination at Marlborough-street, and that he had no doubt, but she was the person who sat fire to the house - he said, the marks of the links were found on her hands - I am certain of that expression, but do not know whether he said links or torches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was this after the examination at Marlborough-street? A. After the first examination; he said, it was a very shocking affair; that the girl had been remanded, and he had no doubt she set fire to the house, for marks of the links were found on her hands - I understood it as his opinion; not what any one else had said.</p>

            . I was in Lazarus's service when he lived at the prisoner's house - I did not set fire to the house, on my oath - I had no pitch in the house, nor had I ever used any - I never had any on my hands when before the Justice, or at any time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect on the night of the fire seeing Furzeman? A. Yes; he examined my hands; there was some black on them - I was putting my boots on, and they were all wet and dirty; I had left them in the kitchen before the fire - they were wet and dirty with the water which had been thrown on the fire; after putting them on, Furzeman looked at my hands, which were wet and damp; he said, it was pitch; but it was not; it had come off my boots; I said, it was not pitch; Furzeman asked Lazarus if he would give me in charge, and he said, Yes; I had been twelve months in his service - I never had any dispute with him, but when I had been out - Lazarus accused me of burning a table, and I was uncomfortable ever after - I had not burnt it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the fire, how soon before the alarm had you been in Lazarus's kitchen? A. I think about twelve o'clock - I was going up the kitchen stairs to bed, and met Mr. White coming down into the kitchen to turn his gas out - I bade him good night, and likewise his wife and servant, who were at the top of the kitchen stairs in the passage - I went up-stairs, and sat down for about half an hour, before Mr. and Mrs. Lazarus went to bed - it was customary for Mr. White to go down-stairs every night to turn his gas off.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any dispute with Mr. Lazarus about your wages? A. No; I have asked him several times for my wages; he said, he could not and would not pay me, he would see me at the devil first.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you been paid your wages now? A. I summoned him for a quarter's wages, which he paid me; he will not pay me more; when the fire happened, all my clothes and every thing I had were in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now, assuming your master and you had a quarrel, did you set fire to the house to be revenged of him? A. No, my Lord. The charge about burning the table, was not a dispute; I never had any dispute with Mr. White or his family.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN re-examined. I examined the girl's hands - the first moment I opened them there were two or three little bits of dirt; I thought it might be pitch - I wetted my finger and rubbed it, and it came off quite easy - I found it was only dirt; that was not my reason for taking her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you state that you thought it pitch? A. I did - I cannot say whether Lazarus was present; it was early in the morning, just after the fire was got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on your saying that there was pitch on her hands that he gave her in charge? A. Oh! no.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You immediatety rubbed her hands, and found it was not pitch; did you represent to Lazarus or White that it was pitch? A. Never - it was dirt, and if she had been in the kitchen it might easily have come from her boots.</p>

I attended the fire of the 5th of August, and had an opportunity of looking at the stock - I should say it was worth from 600l. to 700l.; I had had frequent opportunities of seeing it before August.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe an alteration in it to make a difference of from 700l. to 2800l.? A. Oh! no, but there was one or two valuable works, Pennant's London, and another, which increased the value - I include them in the 700l.; they are illustrated copies, and worth 10l. a volume; there are ten volumes of the two works together.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live at No. 245, High Holborn. On the morning of the last fire I went into the prisoner's shop, to look over it: I cast my eye round to observe the nature of the books - my opinion, giving them a fair full price, which they would fetch to a retail customer, is, that it is not worth 800l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, in commencing my defence against the accusation you have heard, I solicit your indulgence, for my natural defect of an imperfect utterance, the disadvantage of which I now most painfully feel. In the evidence, which has been brought forward, you cannot fail to remark the total absence of every thing like positive proof, and that my conviction is sought only upon one or two circumstances feeble in themselves and requiring the aid of strong inference to connect them. I will recall the facts briefly, and first draw your attention to those upon which my prosecutors rely. In the night, between Friday and Saturday, the 4th and 5th of August last, and when eight persons were in my house, it was set on fire clearly by design, and the instrument made use of was a link. It is in evidence that the day before two links had been purchased at an oil-shop, about half a mile distant, by a person habited in a dress similar to one I frequently used to wear, and resembling me in person; the prosecutors assert this person to have been me, and thence infer that I was the author of that fire. Their real evidence does not go beyond this, nothing else applies to me, but I am not the man who purchased those links, and I shall be able to prove this to you. On the night of the fire, a friend had been spending the evening with me, and did not leave me till past eleven o'clock, and I and my wife retired about twelve, leaving our servant to follow. My house was then occupied by myself, my wife, and servant, and my lodger's (who was a Jew) family of four persons, and their servant. On that night the Jew's servant, his sister, and grandmother, slept upon the first-floor, my wife and myself on the second-floor, and my own servant in the back attic. Between one and two o'clock in the morning, a fire broke out in the basement-story, in a closet under the kitchen-stairs, and belonging to the Jews; this fire was discovered, before it had made any progress, by Lazarus, who slept in that part of the house, the very furthest removed from the fire - he alarmed my servant, who awoke my wife and me; the whole house was presently alarmed, and we went down stairs - the fire was extinquished without any difficulty, and was discovered to be occasioned by a link placed in the closet and lighted; Furzeman, the officer, affirmed that he could trace droppings of the link along the passage, from the fire-place, in the Jew's kitchen, to the closet; the Jew's servant had come down-stairs nearly dressed, and had been, a few months ago, suspected of setting on fire a table in the kitchen; this drew suspicion on her; her master, not I, therefore gave her in charge on suspicion of having committed the fire; and she was taken to the watch-house. My wife and servant had sought refuge at the George and Blue Boar inn, and remained there; the rest of the night passed over quietly. - On Saturday morning, Lazarus and myself, and, I believe, most of the persons in the house, attended at Marlborough-street Police-office, on the examination of the Jew's servant. Her master stated his suspicion that she had set fire to the house, and she was remanded for further examination on the following Wednesday, when there did not appear sufficient evidence to warrant her committal on that charge, as the fire had been discovered in time to prevent any serious damage. I did not attach any great weight to it; and certainly thought, with reluctance, of taking the life of an ignorant girl for the crime. I call your attention to the fact that immediately afterwards I wrote to the British Fire-office, in which I am insured, acquainting them with the fire, and the day appointed for the re-examination of the servant of Lazarus, that their solicitor might attend and inquire into the matter. Between the committal of the servant, on the Saturday, and her re-examination, on the following Wednesday, not the least extraordinary circumstance of this mysterious affair was the receipt of two anonymous threatening letters, one by Lazarus and another by myself, apparently by some friend of the girl, accusing Lazarus of knowing all about the fire; the girl has since strongly denied all knowledge of these letters or the writer; they were placed in Furzeman's hand, I believe he still has them; the discovery of the place where the links were bought, by which the fire is said to be communicated, had been an object to all; and on the following Thursday, Lazarus and another Jew, his friend, one Davis, called at my house, and told me they had discovered where the links were bought, and that they were purchased by a man in a grey coat, and with a blue bag. I was glad to hear of the discovery, and they wished me to call with them on Furzeman to consult what was to be done - I was too busy then, but told them I would go on the following day; the next day I went with them to Furzeman's; we saw him, but he was going to Marlborough-street, and said he would go with us to the oilman, at four o'clock. I asked him who the oilman was, who had sold the links, for I did not then know. Furzeman and Davis said. Bradford. I then returned home; the same day a friend, who called upon me, advised me to go and see Bradford - I went with him - he happened to be out - when we got there, we saw his shop-boy, Thomas Dodwell; I told him, who I was, and inquired if he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260051"/>the sort of person to whom he sold the links, and the day; the boy said it was a tall young man, about my stature, as far as he could recollect, and dressed in a pepper-and-salt morning-coat, and had a blue bag with him, into which he put the links; but his master had cut down the links, and would know better about them - I and my friend then left. On the following day, Saturday, before four o'clock in the afternoon, the Jew, Davis, called upon me to go to Bradford's - I and my wife went with Davis, and presently we met Lazarus and another Jew - we proceeded towards Bradford's, and I, having my wife with me, objected to go to Furzeman's, but agreed to meet him at Bradford's, which I did in five minutes afterwards - Bradford was questioned, and said he sold two links to a man between eleven and twelve o'clock the preceding day, Friday, and being asked whether he could recollect the person to whom he sold the links, he said, he could not exactly tell, he was more like me than Lazarus, but that he had his face towards the door, and he (Bradford) had only a side view of him - I told them then, I was not out the whole of the day, and could prove it - I was asked by one of the Jews to go home and put on my grey coat, and bring my blue bag with me; I refused, and said, I would not make a puppet-show of myself - we then left - and by the advice of my solicitor, I offered first, two, and afterwards five guineas, to the person who purchased the links of Bradford to come forward, but no one ever appeared; and I afterwards, time after time, pressed at Marlborough-street-office for inquiry and examination; repeated my communication to the Fire-office, and also to that in which the house was insured, and gave to the parish board all the information they asked for. But even without this, mark how every thing tells against my having purchased the links, and how completely I refute the charge - Bradford's, although above half a mile from my house, is within a hundred yards of the house where I was born, and had passed the greater part of my life, and not three hundred yards from the house where I was apprenticed, where I was known to almost every one - and it is singular, that I was not known to Bradford himself - and where my being seen buying these links, would have called forth half a dozen questions at once; but leaving out these improbabilities, it happened I was not out of my own house on the day the links were bought - and particular circumstances make both my servant and shop-boy recollect this, and enable them to be quite positive of my not having been out long after the time the links were hought. - Besides all this, you are to add the absence of all motives on my part; the only one alleged by my prosecutors, is the amount of my insurance - but this motive has been very much misrepresented - the actual value of all my property on the premises, considerably exceeded 2,000l., although that is not equal to the amount of my insurance, and I could not have proved a greater loss, even if I had ventured to claim it - I wish also to draw your attention to this, that it is now three months ago since this fire took place - the purchase of the links was known within a week afterwards, and every fact now urged against me was then known - not the slightest charge, however, was made against me, and a Session at which I might have been tried, has passed. - I do not know the author of the fire - my suspicions I confine in my own breast - but I hope I have proved to you my innocence of the crime I am charged with, and the consciousness of this enables me to wait your verdict without fear - I have been brief in my defence - but I look forward with humble confidence to the result.</p>

            . I was in Mr. White's service in August last, as shop-boy. About a week before the fire I took a ladder up-stairs, to get a piece of petrified wood from the loft, and I left it up there; I asked master whether I should leave it or bring it down - he told me to do just as I liked, and I left it - it had been made no use of before, to my knowledge: we have steps and another ladder in the shop, to reach the books with; I left the trapdoor open, but not the one which leads from the loft to the roof; I did not sleep in the house when this fire happened. On the morning before the fire my master came down stairs, from bed, about twelve o'clock in the day - I asked if he knew what the time was - he said, "About ten, I believe;" I said, No, it was twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go then? A. I do not recollect; I do not think he was out all day, but am not positive. When I told him it was twelve o'clock he went into the parlour to breakfast; I saw him again about half-past one - he came from the parlour, and had been there all the time - I am sure of that; I had not been into the parlour to him, but can see from the shop into the parlour, and saw him there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into the shop did he go out of the door or stay in the shop? A. I think he staid in the shop - he did not go into the street that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out long enough to walk half-a-mile and back? A. I cannot say, but in my own mind he was not out at all.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. This is a long time ago - when were you first desired to remember the time when your master got up on the day before the fire? I cannot tell - he sometimes takes out a blue bag to carry books in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he take the bag out that morning? A. I am not positive - it is kept in a drawer by the side of the counter; it was not taken out of the drawer that morning. I told my mother that night how late master had got up.</p>

I intend to attend the examination on Wednesday, and give you this information, that you may send and inspect the premises in the meantime, and, if you think proper, attend the examination on the part of the office.</p>

The prosecution was declined - I know he circulated some bills about the links; this is one of them - (read)</p>

I was; she ran off directly she took the watch, up a court in Hosier-lane; I took her within eight yards of the spot - I did not say I did not know what sort of a watch it was, for I know where it was made: I was surprised to find my seals in my waistcoat-pocket, as my watch had been in my fob. I said it was a small silver watch.</p>

On the 18th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, as I sat in the shop, I heard a pane of glass break; I sprang to the door, and saw the prisoner go away from the spot; he was a yard or a yard and a half from the door, when I first went out; I pursued him up the street, as he ran away directly it was done; I never lost sight of him; I saw him secured, and am sure he is the same person. As I came back, I picked up a pair of shoes, which I knew to be ours - they had been taken from a window just by the broken pane of glass, and could not be got at without breaking it, and he must have put his hand or some instrument in to take them - his hand was bloody at the watch-house. It was quite dark, but by the reflection of the gas I could see him plainly - I am certain of his person, for I never lost sight of him - the glass was whole before - nothing was found on him - I dare say he was in distress.</p>

I did not tell the Magistrate that I said,"Come drop them now."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent, and was so astonished at being charged with the crime, that I could not speak. On the day stated I was passing through Long-lane - forty or fifty people were stopping in this court, looking at a man with a pig; the prosecutor seized and accused me of the robbery - it was easy for him to be mistaken as to the hand that robbed him, among so many people huddled together in a court. I neither robbed him, nor did I see the thief.</p>

On the 26th of October the prisoners came into the shop in company together - they bought a veil and six yards of ribbon, which was put up for them; after I sold them the veil I saw Wilson put something into her muff in a hurried manner, which excited my suspicion, and after they paid, Mr. Harvey,(whom I had acquainted with it,) requested them to walk into the back-shop; he called me soon afterwards, and showed me a veil in Wilson's muff - I took it out; it was not the one I had sold them: it was not in paper, but folded up rough; a constable was called in, and as they were leaving I saw two more veils on the warehouse floor, where Wilson had stood - they were then in the passage, and did not see me find them. I got into a coach with them, and saw Wilson drop a piece of ribbon, which I picked up - that was ours, and I had not sold it them. When we got to the Compter, after they got out of the coach, the constable brought me another piece of ribbon, which was ours - when we were in the coach Eady cried; Wilson said she need not fret, for it was not her who had done it. - When Eady found the constable was sent for, she felt particularly anxious that the veil should be paid for, that they might go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You cannot say that she saw Wilson take the property? A. No; they laid out 20s., and were dressed as fashionable as possible; they were a quarter of an hour in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. They bought a veil and a piece of ribbon? A. Yes; I showed them the veils in the shop - Wilson said she must have made a mistake in putting her handkerchief from the counter into her muff. The three veils were worth 4l. 15s., and the ribbon above 2l.; we have about twenty shopmen, but I only attended to them.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN HARVEY. Norton applied to me, and I asked the prisoners into the adjoining warehouse, and said, they were suspected of having taken more than they had paid for; I saw the corner of the veil projecting out of the muff, and called Norton, who took it out.</p>

               <p>WILSON'S Defence. The veils lay all about the counter, and in putting my handkerchief into my muff I accidentally put one in; Mr. Harvey said, there was something in my muff, which I gave him, and he pulled the veil out with the handkerchief - as we got into the coach he accused us of taking two more - the shopman had asked if there were not some veils in the warehouse.</p>

On the 27th of September, about a quarter to one o'clock, I found a door shut, which I had left open, and upon opening it I found the house door, which I had left shut, was open; I was certain somebody had been there. I saw a man running hastily out of the gate, with a basket on his back; I thought it looked suspicious; I went to the plate-cupboard, and missed this plate: I then went to the coach-gate - I saw nobody but a man in a cart, drawn by a grey horse; he was about thirty yards from the coach-gate; I think there were two men in the cart, but am satisfied the one I observed was the man I had seen running away; I gave an alarm to Cooke, the constable; the prisoner is one of the men I saw in the cart; and one of the men in the cart I believe to be the man I had seen running. I found the plate before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You believe the man in the cart is the same you saw running? A. Yes; I only saw his back, and cannot swear positively to him - my mistress and another servant were in the house; the other servant was up stairs, and could not have opened the door; I had not been out, but went from one kitchen to another - the door was shut a minute before, and must have been opened by the person who took the property.</p>

I saw my son find a tea-spoon under the cart, just at the horse's heels; I think the man must have dropped it as he jumped out: the prisoner said he would get out without our pulling him out.

On the 27th of October, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners singing together at the Duke's-head public-house, High-street; as they were going out, I observed that Pennycad had a bundle - I asked him to let me see what was in it; Murrell said, "Old shoes, show the gentleman" - Pennycad said, they were his fathers, and he was waiting there to meet him - I asked where his father lived, he said, he did not know - I took them to the watch-house; I put them in separate places - I said to Pennycad, "I don't believe your story, where did you get them;" he then said voluntarily, "Well, I will tell you the truth; we were in distress, and we got them from Shoreditch work-house - I and Flood got over the wall, and Murrell waited outside" - I took three pairs and two odd shoes from Pennycad's bundle, and one pair he had on, and Murrell had one pair on his feet - the next morning, I asked Flood who went over the work-house wall with him; he said, Pennycad, and that Murrell waited outside.</p>

On the 18th of August, at six o'clock in the morning, Purchase, my foreman, gave me information - I found my house had been broken open, and upwards of 40l. worth of shoes stolen - I lost one hundred and seventeen pairs. On the 16th of October, I went with Cooke and a search warrant to the house of John Steers; the prisoner William is his son, and lives with him; the house is two miles from mine - we found his daughter and a younger son there; but neither of the prisoners were at home - I found a pair of shoes on the mantel- shelf of the first room I entered - Cooke opened a cupboard in that room, and the young woman obstructed him in his duty - he produced his warrant, and, I think, he there found three pairs of men's shoes (I have no doubt of their being mine); in a box up-stairs, which the young woman claimed, I found a pair of women's shoes - we went downstairs, and under a form, by the fire-side, found another pair - I believe them all to be mine - we then went to Pearce's, which is two doors from Steers', we found nothing there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know the Steers were discharged by the Magistrate on their own recognizance? A. Yes; they have surrendered here - I found the shoes two months after the robbery.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Hanworth. I was in Mr. Maine's employ, but was turned away, in consequence of this robbery - about a fortnight after I was turned away, I met Pearce in the Swan-yard at Hanworth; I knew him before; he asked me to drink; I drank, and he said, "Stop a bit, I want to have a little talk with you presently," and soon after, he said, "I thought you had been in some prison before now, from what I heard;" I said, it was out of anybody's power to put me into prison; "But," said, "you have done it nicely, I knew it was you that took them, as soon as Mr. Maine told me about the robbery, the next morning;" I said, "For God's sake, what did you do with them?" meaning the shoes; but I did not say shoes; I said, "There must have been five or six of you to take them away;" he said, "No, there was only Will Steers, me, and another;" I said, "What did you do with them?" he said, "We have done with them right enough, we have buried them in the gravel pits;" I asked him to let me have a pair, as I was almost barefooted, and wanted a pair; he told me to come over to him at Witton next Sunday, and he would let me know; I went over next Sunday, and found Pearce alone; I asked him if he would let me have a pair of shoes; he then told me that one Orwell, or'some such name, over at Twickenham, had them to make away with; I understood that Orwell had got them all; he asked if Benny, Mr. Maine's foreman, had lost any clothes; I said, I did not know, but I thought he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as odd, that he should ask you about what you knew nothing of, and he knew all about? A. Yes; he said, he knew he had, for he saw the waistcoat hung out to dry at Steers', and the jacket was at Witton; he said, Will Steers would be at home in a fortnight if I wanted any shoes, and that he was gone to work at Case Orton - on the next Saturday night, I went to Twickenham, as I wanted to buy a pair of shoes, but I could not find Orwell out - I thought I should get a pair cheap - three weeks after this I went to Pearce, and said, Steers was not come; he said, when Steers came home, he would let me know about the shoes. The next Sunday afternoon, he had promised to meet me again, but I thought he would not come - as I was going down to Mr. Maine, to tell him what I had heard, I met him in the Swan-yard again - he asked me if I had seen Will that day; I said, "No; he has not been here, has he?" he said, "Yes, he has been here all the afternoon;" I said, I had not seen him, and asked him again, if he had got any shoes, he said, Yes, for he had been sorting them out that morning - I told him to ask for a pair for me, for I would buy them; he said, No, he wanted a pair for himself; he would not ask for them, but he would show me the man, if I would go with him, and I might ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260058"/>myself - I went with him to Witton, which is about two miles - as we went along, he said, very likely Will would give me a ticket, to go and get a pair of shoes - I supposed by that. that they had been pawned - we went to the yard where Steers lived - he said, "Steers is gone to bed, but I will soon call him up; you stand under the tree, out of the moonlight;" he then called Will - his mother came, but I did not see Steers till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you so anxious to get a pair of shoes? A. To show them to Mr. Maine. I think I informed him of this a fornight ago last Monday; after Pearce said the shoes were at Steers', I went and told Mr. Maine; I did not tell him before, because I did not know whether they were telling me the truth or a story, and I wanted a pair to show Mr. Maine, as a proof.</p>

On Thursday night, the 17th of August, between eight and nine o'clock, these shoes were safe in a room adjoining the kitchen; they were worth above 40l.; I missed them about six o'clock the next morning; it was then daylight - I lost a great coat, but no waistcoat - I know the shoes produced to be Mr. Maine's.</p>

I sounded the half-crown, said it was bad, and put it on the counter, and on turning round it was gone; I asked him where it was - he gave it me back; I weighed it, and returned it to him; he said he took it of his master, and could get it changed; he went away. On the 20th, at a quarter past eight o'clock, he came for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, which came to 1d. - he gave me a shilling, and I gave him a six pence and 5d. - he went away; I afterwards showed it to my son, and it turned out to be bad - I kept it separate from all others till I gave it to the constable; he came again in about two hours, for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco - he put down a shilling, but seeing me looking at him, he took the shilling up, gave me a penny, and went away. On the 22d he came again, and bought of my husband a quarter of an ounce of returns, which came to 1d., and gave him a shilling - my husband said it was bad, and secured him - 5d. was found upon him.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Magistrate of the Whitechapel-office - I produce a deposition made by the defendant, on the examination of Arthur Thompson, on a charge of forgery - I took it down - it was read over to him deliberately, before he signed it - he was asked if it was true - he said, Yes - he was perfectly collected, and appeared perfectly to understand it - he did not appear at all frightened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been a clerk at that office? A. Nearly twenty years- I remember his being first brought there; he appears to me to be a young man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mode of taking these examinations? A. The witnesses state their evidence to the Magistrate, and when he decides to commit, they are sent into the clerk's office to have their evidence written down; on this occasion I went into the office with the defendant; I asked him what he had said to the Magistrate, and what he had to state, and I wrote it down - I endeavoured to take the very words, and believe I did, on this occasion - I will not say I took down his very words, but the substance of what he said, that is our general practice - I took his own words as nearly as I could; he was examined twice; I read his deposition over to him in the presence of the Magistrate, and he signed it; we are sometimes much pressed with business at our office, but I have as much time as I think necessary to take down what a witness says. (The deposition was here read, in which the defendant swore positively that Arthur Thompson, the person then under examination, was the person who had delivered a note to him to take to Messrs. Taylor's brewery; on his return he saw him by the turnpike, that Thompson beckoned to the defendant, who then pointed him out to the officers; Thompson ran away, but was pursued and taken into custody.</p>

            . I am short-hand writer to the Court; the defendant was examined here last Sessions, on the trial of Arthur Thompson - I took his evidence in shorthand.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Will you read those parts of his evidence, which apply to this case? (Reads.) Q. How old are you? A. Seventeen years. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 2, James-street, Limehouse-fields. Q. On the first of July, did the prisoner accost you? A. Yes; I do not think that is the man (looking at him). Q. Are you sure about that? A. Yes; I am sure that is not the man. Q. Was there a man afterwards taken into custody? A. Yes. Q. Do you know whether that is the man who was taken into custody? A. Yes; he looks like the man. Q. When was he taken? A. On the first of July; Mr. Tuson, an officer, took him. Q. Did you point out the person who was to be taken into custody? A. I saw a person run across the road, and I said that looked like the man. Q. Was the man who ran across the road, and who you pointed out, the same person who had spoken to you before? A. He looked like the same person. Q. Was that person taken into custody? A. Yes. Q. Was the person taken into custody, the person you had seen before? A. I am not positive. Q. Were you positive then? A. No. Q. Do you mean to say you were not positive, and that you did not swear to him? A. No, I was not positive. Q. Have you never been positive about the man? A. Not altogether positive. Q. Now you say you are not positive that is the man? A. No, I am not. Q. Have you seen any friend of the prisoner's lately? A. No. Q. Had no communication with any one? A. No. Q. How long were you with any person whom you had any communication with? A. Do you mean the person who gave me the note? Mr. Brodrick. Yes. A. I suppose about ten minutes. Q. When that person was taken into custody by the constable, do you mean to say you did not speak to him positively? A. No. Q. Were you sworn before the Magistrate? A. Yes. Q. Was what you said taken down in writing? A. Yes. Q. When that man was taken into custody, did you not speak positively to him, to the officer? A. No, Sir. Q. You will swear that, will you? A. Yes. Q. Did you or not speak positively to the man, to the officer? A. No. Q. That you swear? A. Yes. Q. By the Court. Do you believe the man taken into custody, is the man who before had spoken to you? A. No, my Lord, I do not think it was the man. Q. You do not think he is the man who spoke to you? A. No. Q. Did you say so to the officer? A. No, I was so frightened at the time. Q. Did any person speak to you that day, and give you anything? A. The man spoke to me, and gave me a note. Q. What did you do with the note? A. I was to take it to Mr. Taylor's. Q. Did you point out any person then to the constable? A. No. Q. Did you point out that man then to Mr. Sewell, or to the constable? A. No, I did not point him out. Q. Did you say anything to them? A. No, I did not. Q. Did you say whether he was the man or not? A. No. Q. Now, young man, be particular, are you quite sure you did not point out that man, as the person who had spoken to you before? A. Yes. Q. Attend to the question, I am speaking of the time after this man was stopped; you say the person had him in custody - you came up first, then the constable, and afterwards Sewell; did you point out to the constable or to Sewell, that the man in custody was the person who spoke to you before?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260061"/>A. I did not point at all. Q. Did you say that he was the man, or that he was not? A. No, I do not recollect saying a word. Q. Will you swear you did not say anything? A. I did not speak a word. Q. Do you mean to say you did not intimate in any way, that he was the man? A. No. Q. Did you afterwards state that to be the man? A. No. I did not think him to be the man - I had my (or great) doubts whether he was the man. Mr. Brodrick. Q. Now look at that (handing him the deposition), is that your signature? A. This looks like my writing. Q. Have you any doubt of it? A. No - it is my writing. Q. Now do not read it aloud, but read it to yourself, beginning here, "I the said

Was what you said before the Magistrate written down? A. I do not know, my Lord - I said that to the officer, I believe, what is written down. Q. Was it afterwards read over to you? A. I do not recollect its being read over. Q. Did you sign it without its being read over? A. I believe I signed it without its being read over. Q. Now having read that, do you now know who was the person who came to you in the morning with the letter? A. Came to me in the morning with the letter? Q. You said a person came to you and gave you a note? A. Yes. Q. Where was it? A. At the top of Gill-street. Q. Who was that person? A. The man looked very much like the man at the bar; but that is not the man. Q. Now I advise you to be cautious - who was that man? A. I have seen a man since very much like that man. Q. You believe that not to be the man? A. Yes, my Lord. Q. After you had gone to Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sewell, and the constable came back with you, did you see the man who was taken up, before he began running? A. No, Sir. Q. Did the man who was running, or did he not, beckon to you? A. No, Sir, I do not think he beckoned to me - I do not recollect his beckoning. Q. Did he or not beckon to you? A. No, I do not think he did beckon. Q. Do you mean to say you do not think he did, or that he did not beckon? A. No, he did not beckon. Court. Q. Did you, or not, swear before the Magistrate that the prisoner did beckon to you? A. No, I do not recollect swearing that he beckoned to me. Q. Now look again, and tell me whether you have not sworn before the Magistrate that the prisoner did beckon to you - read the whole of it again - did you swear before the Magistrate that the prisoner beckoned to you? A. I do not recollect it. Q. Read and see (he reads) - Now did you before the Magistrate swear that the prisoner did beckon to you? A. It says so there, my Lord; but I do not recollect his beckoning. Q. The question is not whether you recollect it now, but whether you said so then? A. I do not recollect saying so. Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that the prisoner was the person who gave you the note? A. (after some hesitation) I had my doubts whether he was the man. Q. Did you state that it was the prisoner who came to you, talked to you, and gave you that letter? A. I believe I did; but I was so frightened, I did not know what I was swearing.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Taylor and Co. - the defendant brought this letter to our counting-house; it contained a forged cheque. Tuson and I appointed to meet him at Poplar turnpike, where he said the man was waiting; we went and saw him walking up and down, looking for the person, and after some time he called out, "Here he is, here he is" - I saw a man run across the road, and immediately we all three gave him chase as the defendant pointed him out - we ran in different directions - I saw no more of the man or the boy till I met them at the watch-house; it was Thompson, who was tried here; the defendant was asked by Tuson, at the watch-house, whether that was the man, and he said, in quite positive terms,"Yes, it is" - the person he pointed out was the same in figure and dress as the man who was taken, but I only saw his back - I heard the defendant examined at the office; he swore positively that he was the man; his deposition was read over to him; he said it was true, and signed it - he appeared quite calm and collected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. I suppose you were very eager to apprehend the man? A. My object was to find the right man; I have talked to the defendant since, and never observed any timidity about him.</p>

The prisoner came into his shop one Friday, in August 1825 - my aunt was serving in the shop - he said he wanted to purchase a few articles in jewellery - he looked out a pair of ear-rings and a coral necklace; I think my aunt knew him; he then said he had no cash about him, but if I would go with him to Exeter-street, he would give me the money - I think they came to 44s.; my aunt desired me to carry the articles - I was to receive the money before I parted with them - she said so before the prisoner; I went with him till he came to a very genteel looking house, where he took the property, and went up-stairs - he came down in a few minutes, and said he had no change in the house, but he would go to his uncle's and get change; he asked me, in the meantime, to walk up-stairs into the garret - I went up and staid an hour and a half, but he did not return; I should not have parted with them, if I had not believed that he would have brought down the money - he told me he would bring it down; I have made inquiries at the house, and there was no such a person as Joseph Wilmot lived there, but a woman in the garret knew him.</p>

            . My husband keeps this shop in the Strand. On a Friday, in August 1825, a person, who, I believe, was the prisoner, or very much like him, came to the shop, and asked for a cut coral necklace, and earrings, which came to 44s. - my nephew took the goods, and I gave him a charge in the presence of the prisoner, to bring the money back - I knew the prisoner before - he had lived with a pawnbroker three years before, but I had not seen him since that - he was a lad when I knew him - I have not much doubt that he is the man, he looks very much like him - the person who came and dealt for the articles was the person I had known so long before - I have been sworn on the Old Testament, and I have no doubt the prisoner is the person - though I knew him, I would not have parted with my goods, but for ready money - my husband described his person to Mr. Jonas.</p>

I am a tailor and draper, and live at No. 446, Strand - Mr. Cohen described the prisoner to me, and said, he had formerly lived at Mr. Newby's, the pawnbroker, in Drury-lane - I had known him for five years, and have no doubt whatever that he is the man - I met him on the 23d of September last, in the Strand - he called me by name - I said, he had been acting very wrong to my neighbour; he said, "About Cohen's ear-rings?" I said, Yes, and he should go with me there - he said it was of no use, he had no money, but if I would go with him to a place he described, he would give it me - I went with him nearly there, and then he said he would go to another place and get it - I went on till I met an officer, and then gave charge of him: Mrs. Cohen made no difficulty in saying he was the man.</p>

            . I live in Exeter-street. A young man came to my house about this time, and my servant opened the door to him - he asked if Mrs. Black was at home; she said, Yes: I came out of the kitchen and saw him going up-stairs - I said to the servant, "Who is that?" she said, "A person for Mrs. Black." I afterwards saw Godfrey up-stairs, and asked him in; he waited some time there - I believe the prisoner is the person who came, but I cannot swear to him - I had never seen him before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner about a month ago - as we were going to the watch-house, he said it was hard if he could not get over Mother Cohen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have known Jonas for seven years. The day I was taken, I accosted him; he asked if I was not afraid to walk about - I said, "What for?" and he said, if I would pay him for the ear-rings, it would be all right. I had heard of the robbery before that - I saw it was his view to get money, and I did not deny it, but kept him in conversation, and when we had been some distance, I said I would go to Mr. Cohen's, which I did - I believe Jonas's character is not very honourable.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent to bring the prisoner from Ireland; I found her there in Bridewell; there was a sovereign found on her, which I exchanged, to redeem a shawl and a ring, which she had pledged. I told her what I took her for, and she said she was quite innocent, and knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) Mrs. Landigan persuaded me to stay there, and have a Sunday's spree - Casey, his wife, and two or three more were there; we drank six pots of beer; Casey brought four of his lodgers in, and four more gallons were fetched; the men began to take liberties with me, and I left the house; my brother persuaded me to return to Ireland before the bad weather set in, and I went.</p>
               <p>COURT to JUDITH CASEY. Q. Is it true that you were all drunk? A. I was never drunk yet; my husband did not bring one man in - the witness' husband was there, with two more men; the prisoner asked me to drink the beer, to suckle my child; I tasted it twice while I was waiting for my husband. Mrs. Landigan was sober - there were three men, and they brought in two half-gallons of beer - when they had drank that, they had a pot a piece; the prisoner drank with us.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you ever discharged by Mr. Johnson? A. No; I only went there for an occasional job - there was no dispute about any claim. I gave the information on the Monday; the biscuit-dockers were there till the Tuesday morning - I am now out of a situation; I had worked for Johnson on the Saturday, and left his house about half-past four o'clock; I did not work there that night, nor did I see May.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Friday, May, the foreman, came to me, and said he wanted to take the clock, as Mr. Johnson would not pay his wages; we were then drinking together, and he wanted me to take it; I said I did not like to do so; he then said he would go and shove the door open, but I did not like to go in - May then said,"Go stand at the post," and I did; some person brought me the clock - May tried to sell it, but could not. I then took it to my own room.</p>

               <p>- SIMMONS. I am a fishmonger. I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years; he did live at East Barnet - I had been drinking with him on the night this happened; he was very much in liquor, and did not know where he was going, nor what he was about - he came home with me as far as he had to come; he did not go to his own house, but went to a neighbour named Ellis.</p>

I said there were no larger made; he then tried one on his neck, and said he liked it, but it was not large enough; I turned to my workman, who was there, and said, "Which is the man who stole the handkerchiefs?" the prisoner could not hear that - he then left the shop, and Jones went into the parlour to try on the trousers - the prisoner was taken the following afternoon - I missed seven or eight handkerchiefs, and have never seen them since.</p>

I came round to measure him, and as I stooped, I saw the prisoner put some handkerchiefs into his pocket, and he kept letting his own fall - Jones kept getting into my way, that I should not see what the prisoner did, but I got sight of him between Jones's legs - he took these handkerchiefs out of the bundle; there were seven or eight of them missing; when I looked up, the prisoner asked to see some stockings; I called Charles to mind the shop, while I went to call my master, and I told him they had taken some silk handkerchiefs - Charles told me to go and fetch the watchman, and when I came back, the prisoner was gone - I went to the side door - there is a glass door in the shop, which looks into the passage, and I saw Jones rolling up a pair of trousers in a silk handkerchief, and putting them into his hat - Jones was then taken into custody; I saw the prisoner again when he was taken, and know him to be the man I had seen in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What size is Charles? A.

I did not know he was the person who took them - I did not detain him, because Charles told me it was Jones who stole the things; the boy had not said who stole them - when he came back he said, "You have let the wrong man go."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was before Sir Richard Birnie, neither the prosecutor nor his lad could say who it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260068"/>was - the boy said he could not say, nor could he tell how many he had lost; I said I was sorry I had given him the trouble; he then called his master down, and whispered something to him; I sat down, and took a pinch of snuff; I wished Mr. Mather good night; he returned the compliment, and I went away; the next day the officer came, and said he wanted me; he said he believed it was for an assault, and I went.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Mather. On the 2d of October the prisoner came to the shop and asked for some trousers; I first showed him a blue pair, which I took from the door - he then asked for a black pair, which I showed him; he asked if there was a place where he could try them on; but then said, "No, you can measure me, can't you?" which I did, and saw Malby take the handkerchiefs; I called Charles, who sent me afterwards for a watchman; and when I came back, I looked through a window, and saw Jones take a pair of trousers, roll them up in a silk handkerchief, and put them in his hat; he saw me whisper to my master, and then threw them out of his hat under the table, and came from the parlour into the shop, and said they would not fit him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whose handkerchief was it he put them into? A. Into one, which he took from my master; he not had bought any of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went to your shop, I asked to look at a pair of trousers, and you asked me to go into the parlour. Witness. No; you asked me if I could measure you, and you kept trying to get in the way that I should not see the other take the handkerchiefs; I got sight of him between your legs; he then asked for some stockings, which I did not show him; I did not tell my master that I suspected you of stealing the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN MATHER. In consequence of my boy calling me, I came into my shop and found Jones and Malby - I let Malby go; and when my boy came back, he said,"You have let the wrong man go;" Jones then came into the shop from the parlour, and said they were too small: I said, "Here is another pair;" but I looked, and could not find them; the boy then came into the shop and said,"He has got a pair of trousers in his hat;" the prisoner said he would try another pair on; he went into the parlour, and took off his hat; I went and looked into it, but there was nothing there; I said, "Your friend has stolen some silk handkerchiefs, and I suspect you have got a pair of trousers;" he said he had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did not you detect me in taking them, and putting them into my hat? A. I had left them on the counter, in the shop, when I went up-stairs; and when I went into the parlour again, I found them in a red silk handkerchief under a table, at the further end of the parlour, a place where he could not have stood, on account of the chairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the handkerchief you found with the trousers, one of the same as those the other prisoner took? A. It was of the same description, but not of the same bundle.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a carman, and live at Chelsea. On the 4th of October, I was in the Fulham-road, about five o'clock - I saw the two prisoners going at a kind of jog-trot pace; I did not see any persons after them; Plummer had a lamp in his hand, but not wrapped up; when I got a little further, they passed me, and I stood and looked at them - I saw Plummer throw it down: I picked it up; they then ran on - I did not see them taken, but I saw them in custody in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - I took the lamp to the watch-house; I am certain the prisoners are the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the lamp was quite open? A. Yes, at first, but there was a handkerchief over it afterwards; they were five or six yards from me, on the other side of the road - I saw them about ten minutes in all; I did not know either of them; when I followed them, they were about twenty-one yards from me; they had got a good distance when they were taken; I did not see them stopped.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is become of the pork? A. It was fresh pork, and I told the officer if he liked to make use of it, he might; I had no brandmark upon it, but I knew it; they were cut out of the prime part of a spare-rib; I can swear they were my own cutting; I took particular notice of it; I saw them again soon after, and knew them to be the same; I cut different to ninteen butchers out of twenty; there is not one butcher in fifty, that knows how to cut a joint of meat - from the sight of any piece of meat, I could tell whether it was my own cutting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand that you cut this as you usually do, and yet in some particular manner? A. Yes; I cut six pieces particularly straight and fair, to see if I missed any of them.</p>

            . I live in Shoreditch. On Tuesday evening, the 10th of October, I received information from the prosecutor, and on the following Thursday morning, I went to his back-door, soon after six o'clock - I saw the prisoner about a yard from the door - his back was towards me, and he was talking to his wife - I had seen him before, and am positive of his person - he was in the act of delivering something from his apron to her - he then shook his apron, and went in doors - I followed her to Worship-street: an officer came and stopped her - her lap was opened, and I saw the pork.</p>

I went to the house at the request of Morgan - I saw James Smith on the roof - he slid down on the roof of the wash-house, and then got in at a window - I got a candle, and searched every room in the house - at last I saw his feet hang down a chimney - I got him down - I went and got a ladder, and saw the lead had been cut and rolled up - seven feet had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOSEPH SMITH. Q. Could I get from the top of the house, and go through it, and get behind the privy, while you got through the house? A. No.</p>

The prisoner came on the 27th of September, and asked for some shawls; I showed her several, but she said, they were not the right colour; she did not buy anything - she went out, and in consequence of suspicion, I followed her; when she saw me watching her she ran away, and I saw her take a parcel from under her cloak, and throw it down an area - I stopped her instantly, and went and got the parcel, which was this piece of Irish linen; it is Mr. Corder's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not an old woman in the shop? A. I did not observe one; there were four or five customers - I did not see this piece of linen on the prisoner before she got out; I have not said so to any person.</p>

In the meantime, she must have dropped it, for Matilda stooped down and picked up something - I asked what it was; she said 6d. - she faltered in her speech, and I said, "What have you in your mouth?" she said, "A bit of paper" - I said, "Let me look at it," and it proved to be the card on which the ring had been: I then charged her with having it, but they both strongly denied it; I sent for the officer, who found it in Matilda's mouth.</p>

He came with a boy about a quarter past five o'clock - the boy went up the chimney; Miles held up the cloth: there was a knock at the door - Miles asked me to let his young master in; I went up, leaving him alone, and let Robinson in; he came down. Soon after the boy came down the chimney. and they sent him to another house; after they had taken up the soot, Robinson asked me to let Miles out with the bag, which I did, and then he went. After they were gone, at eight o'clock, I missed five silver spoons from the kitchen cupboard, which had the key left in it; I had asked if they came from Mr. Bentley, our sweeper - they said, Yes; both the prisoners were present then - they never came to be paid.

On the 26th of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoners with another person, at the corner of Prospect-row - I passed them twice, and went home, which is two hundred yards off - I was working in the field, and saw them looking about - I saw Bishop go into the fore-court, and get over the iron-rails into the prosecutrix's fore-court, and get in at the window: he came out in two minutes with something wrapped in a bag or apron, and gave it to the man, who is not here - Dumon stood at the corner, while Bishop went in, and the other received the article from Bishop, and went down Brooksby-street - the prisoners went another way - I rang the bell, and told the lady - I followed, and took them in Park-street - a man, who works for the lady, seized Dumon, who knocked him down - the street-keeper came by, and took them.</p>

No; there were three examinations - I never said, that if I was paid my expenses by the prisoner's friends, it would be more pleasant to me. I have received no money from them or anybody - I do not know Sims or Fitzpatrick - I was not at home at the second examination, as I had slept at my aunt's, and did not receive the summons in time; I went in the evening, and gave bail for my appearance. I know the Black-horse in Lemon-street - I have been there, but not with any one; I spoke to no woman there; I saw Sims at the office, but not at the Black-horse; I never told Sims to pay my mother 7s. 6d. - she told me this morning that she hoped I would not hurt the prisoner.</p>

            . I am married, and live in Somerset-street. I saw Hall at the Black-horse, where I used to deal; he demanded 10s. of the prisoner's wife in my presence, for his day's expenses; he received 2s. 6d. from her, and I took 7s. 6d. to his mother's house, by his desire: we gave it into her hands. Fitzpatrick was at the Black-horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever told him that you hoped he would not hurt the prisoner? A. No; he said the prisoner was full fifteen yards from him, and several other persons being there, that he could not swear to him, and if his expenses were paid, he had rather not appear against him.</p>

I then went to the prisoner's house, and told her I had come to search, as some property had been found on Hales, who said she had it from her; she said she should turn the tables on her - I said I must search; she then opened a drawer, and gave me a petticoat, which she said had come from the wash; she produced a cap, a collar, and some ribbon, which she said was given to her by her servant Nancy - I went into the kitchen, and searched the girl's boxes in the prisoner's presence, and found the rest of the lace, the scissars, shuttle, and sheath; I asked how it got there - Ellen Brown said, "I must tell the truth; she wants me to say that I gave it to her, but I did not" - the prisoner then wanted to make it up, but I took her to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did she not say she took them for her rent? A. No; she said the girls took her clothes, and when she found any of theirs, she took them - it is a house of ill-fame.</p>

Soon after that, Constantine sent me to her for some tobacco - she said, she dare not be seen out, for she had robbed a gentleman of a gold and silver watch; but after dark, she would go out and send him tobacco and money also; that the gentleman was drunk, and did not know what he was doing - I saw Constantine sign his examination.</p>

            . I am a carter. On the 9th of October I was in the New-road, and saw Mr. Taylor - I saw the prisoner with three more boys, who appeared to be knocking up a kind of fight - I kept at some distance, and saw them come up to Mr. Taylor - I thought they meant to push him into the mud; I then saw the prisoner take a watch and chain from Taylor's waistcoat-pocket, and put it into his own - I left my horses and ran over; the prisoner crossed the road down a street; I followed - he turned back at last and gave himself up; I brought him back - the watch was found in the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Do you mean to say this is the boy who seized the watch? A. Yes, positively he is the hand who took it - I did not see him throw it down; he ran two or three hundred yards, and seeing persons before him he gave himself up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did the robbery happen? A. At the further end of Euston-square.</p>

            . I prosecuted Catherine Parmenter and Sarah Jarvis here, last Session. I was returning from a cricket-ground, with my brother, one Thursday, and was met by those two women and two men (the prisoner was neither of them), in Lisson-grove-road, about eight o'clock in the evening; the women said, "How do you do?" I made no answer - the two men then came up, and struck me; I felt one of the women draw my watch from me, and saw Parmenter running off - I was nearly knocked down; they all ran away; I followed Parmenter to Lisson-street, where she spoke to two men, who went into a public-house, and fetched out the prisoner; this was a quarter of a mile from where I was robbed; he came out, seized me round the waist, and prevented me following Parmenter; some persons got me from him, and I ran after her again; he came after me, and struck me - I got from him, and followed her into George-street, where I lost sight of her - he struck me again in George-street.

I stopped the prisoner with the watch in her hand, about two hundred yards down the street; she was running; I asked how she came by the watch; she said she had none - I said, "I see it in your hand;" she then said she got it from a friend, and pointed to the Commercial-road; and in going along she said she took it from her husband, who was drunk in Spitalfields. I took her to the watch-house - I saw the prosecutor in the Commercial-road - he claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of September, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I was sent for by Mr. Carr, of Banner-street, to remove the prosecutor and a friend of his, who were rather refractory; Howard was perfectly sober, but his friend had been drinking; I got them into the street, but Howard's friend did not like to go to the watch-house, and was rather troublesome; as we were going down to the watch-house, in Bunhill-row, the prisoner Russell came suddenly in front of us - he put his head against the prosecutor, and drew something from his fob; he put both his hands behind him, as if to give it to some one; the prosecutor called out, "I am robbed of my watch;" I collared Russell, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. What! do you mean to say he drew the watch? A. I mean to say he drew something; the prosecutor was perfectly sensible, and had assisted me in taking his friend to the watch-house, who was a little refractory; I had never seen either of the prisoners before; I did not see the watch in Russell's hands - I had seen the seals hanging out before, and suspected he had taken the watch; the prosecutor's friend was close by, and he took the other prisoner - I am positive it was not the friend who put his head against the prosecutor - it was Russell. The watch was found on the ground, between the two prisoners.</p>

When I got up to this party I saw Nelson making some little altercation, about not wishing to go to the watch-house. The prosecutor said,"I have lost my watch" - I saw the watch being passed from Russell to King - it dropped between them, but which had hold of it I cannot say; it was in the act of being passed; King was in the act of receiving it, when he was seized by the collar by the prosecutor - they then scuffled across the road, and some people said, "Let him go - a baker has got your watch;" King them got away, and ran down Chequr-alley; I ran after him, and some other persons - he went into the Salmon and Ball public-house, into the privy, and shut the door; the prosecutor's friend came up, forced open the door, and found him behind it; there was an old woman in the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say the prosecutor laid hold of King? A. Yes; Smee was then gone with Russell to the watch-house; I did not see the watch in Russell's hand, but I saw it passing - it was quite daylight.</p>

On the 22d of September I saw the prisoner running; I came up, and asked why she ran; she said she wanted to get into the highway; Gowland was with another watchman - he said he was robbed; I pursued, and took the prisoner in King David-lane, with the watch in her bosom. Gowland had been drinking, but was sober; the prisoner said he gave her the watch - he decied it.</p>

Bowden slept on board that night - I heard an alarm, and saw him find his watch and case - I also missed a watch, three sovereigns, and some silver, from the state-room; I went and found the prisoner in a boat alone in about five minutes, and charged him with it - he denied having been on board, but said, he was smuggling two bottles of gin, and was pursued by the police; that he belonged to a vessel in the tier above; he was without a hat - a person brought it to him, and he owned it - as I was going down into the boat where he was, somebody said, "Captain, he has hove your watch overboard;" he said the man was a liar.</p>

Harris was at the end of the counter; they came out across the way, and went a little distance - I crossed over, and pushed Edwards and Powell into a shop, at the corner of Henry-street - Mills brought in Harris, and I found this comb on him - also some stamps, and two wafer-stamps.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mr. George Hicks. Powell and Edwards came in, and asked for a comb for graining, and said it must be three inches and a half long; I showed them some, but none would do; in about seven minutes, while they were there, Harris came in, and said he wanted a brush for graining; I went to look for some, but not finding them readily, he said he would call in the morning, between nine and ten o'clock - he did not appear to know the others; they all went out; Powell had a rule, and measured the comb. In a quarter of an hour the officer came in - I then missed a comb. They had taken up several in the shop, and I missed one then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you counted them before? A. No; we sell a good many such. I believe this to be the one I missed.</p>

On the 7th of October, between-nine and ten o'clock, I was in Whitecross-street; I saw the two prisoners together - Gawthorne said to Smith, "To-morrow, mind; ten o'clock;" I said to Gawthorne, "What have you got there?" he said,"Some leather" - I asked him where he got it; he said, from Mr. Allen, of Green-arbour-court, Old Bailey, and that Mr. Armstrong had given him 30s. to fetch it and pay for it - I said, "You are not fetching it for yourself;" he said, No. I brought him to Giltspur-street.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. George Waite, a currier, of No. 16, Gray's-inn-lane. This is the same leather I saw at the examination, but I have seen so many pieces, I should not like to swear to them - I did swear to this piece, but there is no mark upon it; there was a piece of cordovan missing like this, but all shoulders are alike; I said this piece was my master's property, but I had no more reason for knowing it then than I have now - I have seen so many pieces like it since, that it makes me doubtful. Here is a mark on those other six pieces; I have no doubt but they were my master's; but the same person who marked these works for other shops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say in your deposition, "One of these seven pieces of leather, being a neck of cordovan, I saw on my master's premises, and I know it to be his property, and form the marks on the other pieces, I believe them to be his property" - what is your belief now? A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have stated that you swore to one piece of leather; is there your master's mark on it? A. No, my master never marks leather - here is the tanner's mark on it; there was a finger-mark on this piece which I swore to, but it is not here now - I only believe them to be his, and cannot say they have not been sold.</p>

When I returned from dinner, I asked how he was? he said, "Very sick" - he had then taken the medicine and hour and a half - he took it exactly at ten minutes to twelve o'clock, and it was twenty minutes past when he went into the yard - he still complained of being very sick, but brought very little up, except some green yellow stuff - I went to him several times, found him very sick, and advised him to walk about, as it would operate better - at four o'clock, I asked him down to tea; he said he had rather have it sent up - it was sent up; he took some, but eat nothing - a little before five o'clock, he came down into the kitchen, drew a chair to the fire, and leaned his head on the table, and at short intervals vomited - my wife advised him to take some warm water, which he declined; I said I thought he had better take the other half, but he did not. I came down about seven o'clock, and thought he was asleep; I said to my wife he had better not sleep there; he said,"I am not asleep, I had rather sit by the fire, as I feel so sick" - I then went out and found his parents at a chapel, told them of it, and said I thought he had not taken sufficient; they advised me to persuade him to take the rest; I went home and found my wife had just put him to bed; she went up to him a little before ten o'clock, he appeared asleep, and she brought the light down - a man named Harris went up about a quarter to eleven, and he thought him asleep; he slept in the next bed - I went up about ten minutes to seven o'clock in the morning, and he said he was very sick every now and then, but in no pain except in his head, putting his hand to his forehead - I sent for Mr. Whitmore, and about half-past ten o'clock the boy died. He was opened next morning, in my presence - there were four surgeons. The prisoner had never said how much the two or three pennyworth of fox-glove would produce - the bottle was about three-parts full; he did not give him quite half; here is the bottle, with the remainder of the stuff in it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Coldbath-square - I have been practising for seventeen or eighteen years. I was called in about half-past seven o'clock last Thursday morning, and found the boy la<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260102"/>bouring under symptoms common to vegetable nancatle poison, and under some symptoms peculiar to a preparation of fox-glove - his pulse was slow, weak, and very irregular; his extremities cold, and the pupil of the eye ceased to obey the rays of light - I had the room darkened, called for a candle, and found the pupil would not contract and dilate. I was told he had taken fox-glove, and the symptoms agreed with that; they could not have deceived me if they had tried, as he had taken such an immense quantity - I ordered him braudy every ten minutes, gave him medicine, and ordered him blisters; but he died while they were preparing. I afterwards opened his body, and there was an absence of all disease that might have produced death. Death is produced by vegetable poison, not by occasioning disease, but by lessening the energy of the nervous system, so that the heart and all the energies cease to act. I have no doubt the decoction of fox-glove caused his death; it is a medicine which is admiaistered in similar cases. The boy had been under my care for two months, and I had repeatedly administered it to him, properly guarded; it was a case in which I judged it right - I administered it to him successfully, I think, as his health was restored, and he returned to work. I cannot say how much would be sold for 2d. or 3d.; the prisoner told me, in the Coroner's Jury-room, that he had boiled down 4 ozs., which was a greater quantity than I thought - from measuring the cup, the boy must have taken about 51/2 ozs. of the stuff, as 61/2 ozs. are left in the bottle, which makes 12 ozs., which 4 ozs. would produce. It is impossible such a quantity could be given without danger; from calculation, I find the quantity of decoction twenty-four times the strength our College orders us to make, and then he had given him six times the quantity beyond our extreme dose, and twelve or fifteen times the quantity beyond the common dose. Nothing but complete ignorance could have led to such a dose being given - in my opinion, it must have produced death - I should have thought five or seven drops of this mixture a proper dose. I have seen the book the prisoner has published, and am sorry to say, it will produce much mischief, if acted upon. I remember a case where an undue and uncertain quantity of fox-glove was given, and was unexpectedly beneficial, but I do not know how much.</p>

I called out to know if the lady wanted a porter to carry the things on shore; Daniel Baker also plied her; she nodded, and on the boat reaching the shore the waterman called to me, to pull her in, which I did. I then took hold of the hammock, which the deceased perceiving, attempted to take from me; and in so doing, he pushed me into the water. I got out of the water, and, in the irritation of the moment, struck him, which was returned, and we fought four or five rounds. He being older than myself, I rather endeavoured to keep him off, than to strike him; but in the last round he unfortunately fell on the nose of the boat, which hurt the spine and caused his death. I had no animosity whatever towards the deceased: indeed I hardly knew him.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Bowie. On Friday the 29th of September we removed from Burr-street to Crombie-row, Mile-end Old-town; I had a trunk containing the articles stated in the indictment; I saw it put into the van a little before seven o'clock at night - here is a table-cloth and towel, which I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any mark upon them? A. My husband is a table-linen manufacturer - it is our own manufacture, and was the only one that was in the trunk of this pattern; I washed it the day before I put it into the trunk - it was marked E. B., but the the mark is picked out; I have sold a great many of that pattern; I know the napkin by the loop - that is not a general thing; I have seen some so, but few people take the trouble of doing it - here is a hole in one corner, by which I know it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I assisted in removing the goods - Morris had asked me if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260105"/>wanted a van; I said, No, I had engaged one; I went again to get it, and when I came back, Morris was there; I had not hired him - we told them to put the trunks first into the van, but this trunk was left to the last - Morris then wanted to put it at the back on the top, but we moved a heavy basket of crockery, and put it under it - they were then in a hurry to get loaded, and I said, I would give them a pot of beer - we passed by a public-house opposite the London-docks - I gave Morris 1s. to get a pot of beer there; I saw several people come out of that house, and pass on - the van then went on to Crombie's-row, which may be a mile or a mile and a half; I took a basket, containing some glasses and light things, and went into the house; I had told Morris not to take anything out till I had seen it was all clear - when I went in, this trunk was in the van, and not a rope was touched, but I cannot say whether the rope was attached to the trunk or not - when I came out, I could not see the trunk - the basket was on the ground - Morris was about the place; I jumped on the van, and, when I had been up about a second, a man said that a man had gone down a turning on the other side of the way with a trunk of ours; I called to some one to run after him - Morris heard me, but he stopped about two minutes, pulling off his jacket; he then ran a little way, but returned in about a minute, and said, "Where is the man that said the trunk was gone?" there was an alarm, and a number of people round the van, so that I was afraid to go away myself; this is the trunk which I missed; I found it the next day at Mr. Dunbar's, a broker; I had observed it on the van, when I left it to go into the house; I know that my father had this pattern of tablecloths about fourteen years ago, and they were sold to Lady Cooke, of Norfolk, and a table-cloth of this pattern has been in use in our family ever since.</p>

            . I am a carman. I went to Burr-street to remove some goods, as I was going by the toll-gate near the London-docks; I saw Morris talking to the toll-man - he asked if I was going to Burr-street to load some furniture; I said, Yes - he asked if they would want any body to help - I said, I did not know; he said he had nothing to do, and had a great mind to go and see if he could get a job; he went in the van, and assisted to load the goods - this trunk came out last, and I was surprised at it, because I had given orders for the trunks to be placed in the bottom of the van - when we went to Crombie's-row Morris went with us, and he took this trunk out, and placed it on the ground; I asked him why he did not take it into the house; he said, the house was not ready; he then moved it to the side of the cart next the road; I asked him what he wanted with it; he said, To stand on it to reach a rope;" there was a rope that he might have wanted it for; and in a minute or two it was gone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am compelled to state that Pearce never was my wife, nor was I in London till about five years ago; I never acknowledged to Finlayson that Pearce was my wife - all our conversation was about my running away. She was married to a man named Jarvis, but that was not me; I had a cousin named Jarvis - he came to town, and he was Pearce's husband; he went to America - she was visiting in Kent - we became acquainted, and we cohabited - I have a son and daughter, but I am not her husband. Whitehurst was my first wife, and I am proud to own it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever see him write, except when he put his name in the book? A.

            . I am a drawer in the Assayer's-office, on the 23d of June I received from Mr. Fuller two double bottoms, one single case, and two dials; I drew them for the Assayer, and stamped them, and put several private marks on the wires and on the bottoms; I then gave them to Mr. Fuller, they had the initials of Mathey and Humbert on them. On the 26th I received one double-bottom case, and on examining it I found the wires of it had come on the 23d, but they had had other bottoms attached to them, they had got my private marks on them, and they were detained. I went with two officers to the prisoner's house, in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury, on the 27th of June; I found the prisoner there, dressed like the other men; I did not know him at that time; there was only one man there who had not his working dress on; I first asked for them to deliver up all the cases in the shop whatever state they were in. Some person in the shop showed me a tin box with several parts of watches in it, the prisoner was present, and conversed with me; I found in the tin box these three wires and these two loose bottoms, they have all my private mark on them, which I had put on them on the 23d - I then asked the prisoner to deliver up his books, and they were produced. I found in the book an entry of a watch-case sold to Mr. Vulliamy, in Pall-mall, and I said to the prisoner, "This is booked on the 28th, and this day is only the 27th," the prisoner said, "I know it, I have made that mistake;" he said he had sent it that morning to them, and had made that mistake. I then went to Mr. Vulliamy's, who was out of town - Mr. Thompson there produced to me a double-bottomed case, marked by the Company; the bottoms have got my private mark on them, but the wires have not. When those bottoms had come to me at the Hall, they had come in other wires, and I have not the smallest doubt that they had been transposed from them. I have compared the bottoms found at Vulliamy's with the wires found at the prisoner's, they have all got my private mark on them, and correspond exactly in all respects; here is a bill of parcels which Mr. Vulliamy delivered at the office - I have not said any thing to the prisoner about this bill; the outer bottom has the crown and F. No. 18 in the centre of it, on the left the leopard's head, and on the right the veriable letter denoting the year, which in this case is an I, and over in the maker's private mark; the middle bottoms have a crown and 18, and over it the stamp of the maker; it is what is called a double-bottomed hunter; the bottoms have my private mark, but not the wires; the three wires which I did mark were all found at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When the cases are sent to you, are they in a complete state? A. They have only to be polished; the cases always fit the watches before they come there to be marked; I know that is invariably the case from being brought up to the business. The prisoner is a foreigner; he speaks broken English; I saw him at the office the next day - I do not know that he has a brother there; I am sure it was the prisoner who spoke to me; I had some difficulty to understand him, but I am quite sure I did understand him; when I stated, "This is a mistake, this is entered the 28th, and this is but the 27th," his answer was, "I made a mistake." I will not swear positively whether he said, "The case has been sent to Mr. Vulliamy's," or "I have sent it." The rims are not in all cases marked with the hall-mark, but they are sometimes, they have my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260109"/>private mark on, which I cannot describe, because it would defent my purpose, but it is such a mark as would not be removed by polishing, nor without destroying the case. When I went to the shop, the prisoner and three others were in their working dress, and one not in a working dress.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Vulliamy, of Pall-mall; I have been there twelve years; during the life of Mr. Humbert my master dealt with him, then with the prisoner and him, and since his death with the prisoner only; I once saw the prisoner at work at Hyde-street, Bloomsbury; I have seen him there several times; I cannot tell when Mr. Humbert died; he left England several months ago, and I think has been dead about two months; I am certain he left England before June; I recollect Mr. City calling on me on the 27th of June; he asked for a case, I showed him one which I had received a bill of parcels with - this is the bill, I marked it at the time; I believe it is the prisoner's hand-writing, but I have never seen him write - I have received this hand-writing with things that came from his house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In the course of business you have dealt upon this hand-writing? A. We have no occasion for any writing but bills of parcels - they were in this writing; I have no doubt whatever it came from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. I believe you made some hesitation is delivering them, and you gave them up at the office? A. Yes; I received the bill and the case from an crrand-man, who is employed by us and by others; he has been employed in bringing work from the prisoner to us for about a month - I cannot identify the prisoner's work individually, but the case is made in the same way that we order work to be made by that house; though the errand-man had only brought work from the prisoner about a month, I had known him eighteen months, his name is Nicholas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say this is similar work to what you have received from Humbert's house for ten years past? A. No, the fashions vary, but it has been nearly similar to this for the last four or five years - it is such work as was made by Mr. Humbert's workmen before the prisoner came to this country; I cannot tell whose hand-writing this is; it might be made out by a clerk, but it is the same writing as comes from that house; the porter was employed by four other persons to my knowledge, and he might be by other persons; I took the case in myself from him, and partly opened it, and put it into a drawer; I can undertake to say that I showed the same case afterwards; three or four other persons might have access to the drawer, but I do not think they had; I put a watch into the case, and I could identify that botter than the case. I did not particularly examine this case; I examined one that came with it; no person has any right to go to that drawer but Mr. Vulliamy and myself; I believe the case I took to the office was the one I showed to Mr. City, I believe so from finding it in the drawer where I put it after he looked at it; ever since the illness of Mr. Humbert, we have uniformly received bills in this hand-writing.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Mr. Humbert, but since his death I have been employed by the prisoner - there was a workman in his shop of the name of Fotex - he worked there three weeks, and left a day or two after the apprehension of the prisoner; the prisoner's brother, who is here, told me of an order for a watch-case coming from Mr. Vulliamy's; I do not know whether it was executed; accidents often happen in finishing cases: the workmen often correct them without the master's knowledge; the prisoner was out collecting bills just before his apprehension; it was near quarter-day, and he had been out for several days, very often from nine o'clock in the morning; if not then, he went at three o'clock, after dinner; he was not particular to the hour of returning - generally when he went out, he left orders with his brother, whose business was to melt the gold - he had a brother, named Justine Mathey - he was an apprentice - in consequence of his doing work imperfectly, it was often necessary to re-melt the gold.</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, Bridgewater-square, and am a watch-maker. I gave orders to the prisoner, about the 20th of June, for a gold watch-case to be enamelled - it was for what we call a red enamel, and the gold ought to be of a high colour to take that enamel; I do not know that it was necessary to detach the rings from the case to make it of that colour; I saw a case at the prisoner's on the Saturday before he was apprehended; I understood it was the one made for me, but the rim was too pale; it was not of the colour for that enamel, and it was detached from the bottom; I saw it, but I never got my order from them; I never saw a case of that description before.</p>

On Monday morning, when the prisoner came to work, I was in the yard, and heard the box opened - I went up-stairs, and missed some brass; and as the prisoner was going to breakfast, mistress told him, to leave what he had got behind him; he said he had nothing, but bread and butter - he went into the room, and after some time, pulled this metal from his hind coat-pocket - he was taken in charge, and owned that he had taken it.</p>
               <p>MRS. MEARS. Clitherow's statement is correct - the prisoner said, if I would go with him, he would take to me where I should find what was gone; he took me to Bevill, where we found 21/2lbs., and to Bassett, where there was 53/4lbs.</p>

            . I am agent to Messrs. Chippendall and Co., of Manchester, calico printers - I was directed by them to make a sale of some shawls in August - I consigned some of the same shawls and other handkerchiefs to Messrs, Gregson and Co. - I received them from Messrs. Chippendall; they were all to be shipped to Calcutta - Wilkinson, Fisher, and Co., are our packers; I sent these goods to them to be packed, and forwarded to Phillips, as the lighterman - the goods I received from Chippendall, answered to the invoice - they were unpacked in my warehouse, and I sent some at different periods to the packers' but not all; those I sold to Messrs. Gregson, also went to the packers' - I have got all the stock in my possession, except what I sent to the packers' - (looking at some shawls) - I cannot say these are part of what I sold to Messrs. Gregson, but they are the same pattern, size, and texture of cloth, and are Chippendall's make - such shawls as these would go into Phillips' hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the manufacturer? A. Yes - he is here; I have not sold a piece of this description since October or November last; I sold some of these patterns about that time - but here is one pattern which never was sold; I believe it was only printed eight or nine months ago. Previous to November last I may have sold three or four hundred pieces of some patterns - I will not positively swear none of this particular pattern have been sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Were any of the shawls at all sold for home consumption? A. None; the former ones all went to Phillips, except eight pieces, which were sent to Messrs. Goldsmidt, about two years ago; the barder of this one is a new pattern - I believe I never sold one of that pattern; the others have not been made more than two years and a half.</p>

We manufactured these shawls - this one is of a particular pattern, which we have altered this year - we first sent some of them to town about six months ago; I had sent none to town in October last; the calico is made expressly for us, and is of a thicker texture than usual; we have sold two other parcels of this new pattern, for shipping, besides what we sent McVicar, and we have made presents of five or six single shawls, but those were all 8-4ths, and these are 6-4ths. McVicar is the only agent I employed for the sale of the 6-4ths.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many of this new pattern have you sent to town within the last six months? A. Proba<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260112"/>bly fifty or one hundred; we sold them for exportation - I cannot say that they left the country.</p>

            . I am manager to Messrs. Wilkinson and Co., packers. I have delivery notes of Mr. McVicar; I packed all the shawls received from him, and received the delivery notes from him; I delivered the goods, packed, to our carmen, Burn and Wood, to take to Phillips; they were packed in tin cases, and soldered; I believe these shawls were folded in our house, and formed part of that package - there was a ticket put into the outside fold, and part of it still remains; I cannot speak to the ticket, but it is on precisely the same spot as we place them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that you packed that very shawl up? A. I believe I did, and that they were folded in our house; an Excise-officer was in attendance. The tin-case might be taken out, opened, and put in again, with a little trouble - it would take much trouble to repack them properly, but we have nothing to do with the shipping.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. If the property is out, you conclude the case has been opened? A. Yes; I know the folding done in our house; this shawl bears every appearance of having been folded in our house, and I believe was packed by me. I have a peculiar method of packing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many examinations have there been at the office? A. Four or five; the shawls were then opened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look again at the ticket - do you believe it to be part of your ticket? A. It is the place where we put the ticket - it has been torn off evidently; there are fifteen shawls in a piece - we always put a ticket on the outer one.</p>

            . I am one of the City Marshals. I took the prisoner at the prosecutor's counting-house, on the 15th of September; I asked where he had those shawls from, which he had to ship for Mr. Phillips; he said he had not a shawl in his possession, and did not know anything about them; he said he never had a shawl in his possession in his life. On being taken to the Mansion House he said he lived at No. 6, Norwich-court; I went there, and saw his wife - I inquired for Hall - she said he was at home, but she was his wife; I found one of these shawls on her neck at the time - I then searched the house, and found up-stairs four whole shawls and five half shawls.</p>

             re-examined. There is not much difficulty in opening these packages. I have examined some of a similar description, and I find, by very common means, it might be done, and closed, to all appearance, as it was before; the tin-cases are to preserve them from sea water. I know the prisoner's wife - the place where she was found is where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you have opened the case yourself? A. Yes, with a pair of pinchers, a hammer, and a chisel; and if they closed the wooden case, the tin lining would not be seen - it was a deal case with iron hoops - they could break open the tin without its being discovered in this country. I asked one Smith to turn evidence; he said he knew nothing about it - the cases are sealed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. If it was opened, would it be discovered before they arrived at Calcutta? A. No; the prisoner might perhaps have access to the goods only a a few hours, or perhaps a day or two - they were all night and part of the next day in our lighter; the prisoner was generally there as our confidential servant; it was his duty to see them delivered on board the ship.</p>

I had been paid on Monday, and told the prisoner I was paid - he took me to his wife, and I paid her 14s. which I owed - I went to several public-houses, and got home to the prisoner's house in the evening; neither he or his wife were at home - I went to bed and counted my money - I laid down across the bed, and in two hours one Valentine awoke me, and I undressed, but did not look for my money; I went to bed, and in the morning missed the notes. The prisoner and his wife were in the opposite room; I said,"Brockford, do you know any thing of my money?" he said, I was drunk last night; I said I was not - he came into the room in his shirt, and said I had better look about, which I did, but could not find it - there were other lodgers, and the door was open all night.</p>

            . On this night I was playing at cards when the prosecutor came in - he sent for half a gallon of beer, and then went to bed. The prisoner came in afterwards, then went out, and came in with his wife, and said we had better go to bed, which we did; as I went up-stairs, the prisoner touched me on the shoulder and said, "I am going to put you into another bed;" I said,"I have no objection," and I went with Valentine - soon afterwards I got up to go down-stairs, and as I passed Cooper's room-door, I saw the prisoner putting his hand into his jacket pocket, and saw him take out three pieces of paper, which he separated - I did not go down-stairs, but returned to my room, and the prisoner came in directly and said to Valentine, "There are some men on the bed in their clothes, will you help me to get them to bed?" he did so, and came back. I am sure he took the paper from Cooper's jacket, which was on his back at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you accuse him of this till ten days after? A. I went to the officer next day - I was turned out of the house by the prisoner's wife before this happened - I met the prisoner on Thursday, and fought with him; he got two men to beat me - I did not say I would be revenged - the prisoner has surrendered. <rs id="t18261026-246-verdict1358" type="verdictDescription">

The prisoner was in my employ, and entrusted to receive money, which he had to bring to account every night when he balanced the day-book; on the 5th of May he accounted for no money received from Mrs. Cole; he should have put it into the till with the duplicate - the duplicate she brought is not to be found, nor is it entered off - the prisoner should have taken it out of the till at night, and give it to the person who keeps the books to enter it off; he keeps a daily settling-book, and casts up the amounts of principal and interest, and hands them to the boy; I had him searched last Friday week, and we found on him this duplicate of Cole's, among several others; I accused him of having stolen the principal and interest, which he acknowledged and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was your accusation respecting any particular duplicate, or the whole? A. I said, "I shall be able to bring this case home to you"- I did not say he might as well tell at once; he has authority to take one guinea a week from the till, debiting himself with it; there is nothing due to him; the person receiving money for duplicates writes on them, and this is his writing on it - it is 1d. - that proves he received interest and principal - I have two other shopmen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had access to this book at the warehouse as well as at Warner-street? A. Yes - and to all the books, and, if I had suspected him, I might soon have discovered this; our accounts are sometimes 4000l. or 5000l. a day - it is not very possible that a small sum should be omitted - the prisoner was seldom sent out to collect - he generally went out on Mondays.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not this cheque been brought to account at some subsequent time? A. No - I swear that; he received this cheque eleven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he carry a larger sum to your account that day? A. Yes - 30l., but not as an equivalent to this - we generally settled accounts with him daily; the accounts of this day and the next, are signed by me; my younger brother had paid this cheque at Warner-street.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. From and examination of the books can you swear this cheque has never been brought to your account? A. I can.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing he kept the cheque instead of sending it to the bankers', where would he keep it? A. In his cash-drawer in his desk; but it had no business to be kept, it should go to the bankers'.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How are you enabled to say it was the 24th of January? A. I made a memorandum in a small book, which I have here - (reads) - "24th of January, 1825, a cheque for 22l. 1ls. - E. Cooke;" which means, that I received it that day, and I always paid it the same day.</p>

               <p>MR. COOKE. The prisoner generally took the cash to the bankers, but not always - In the general cash-book, there is an interlineation of this amount - I first saw that the day the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he on the 24th of December, pay more into the bankers' than the account amounted to? A. Yes; more than that particular day, but not more than the whole account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was placed in the counting-house. I found the books much confused - there was no making out the accounts - I told Mr. Cooke it was necessary to have more clerks; he said, I must get through them as well as I could; I have stated to him the possibility of errors - he said, the customers, would point them out; our accounts were about 400,000l. a year - I was alone, except a boy to examine invoices; we at times found money due to persons; and Mr. Cook has directed me to make the account balanced, as it was more likely they were correct than us - as to this cheque, it appears to have been mislaid, and when found, was applied to their own account.</p>
               <p>MR. COOKE. I do not recollect his ever stating this to me - I never said the customers would point out the errors.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. I have heard the prisoner complain of the difficulty of carrying on the business, but not in Mr. Cooke's presence - he said to me, that the books were behind-hand; there are three clerks - I know the books were in a confused state when one clerk left - three of us now keep the books - I first went there in 1824.</p>
               <p>MR. COOKE. When the prisoner first came, we had two clerks, and afterwards another, as our business much increased, and his salary also - he at first had 40l. a-year. and at last 130l. - I knew he was at his father's in the country in February, and when we wanted him we found him.</p>
               <p>Four Witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>October 17th, 1826.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding your behaviour towards me, during the time I have been here, I have got better treatment than I met with from you of these late years: which you may depend upon being returned by that behaviour of mine when I come home, which will be on the 11th of November. Now, as I have this to say, that as me and you for these late years past not been agreeable to each other, I will have that explanation, how I am to act, before I leave this place, either from you, as being my mother; but of your actions to me like - my actions, being very bad; but not so, that which you have thought fit to lay them out to - . I have wrote to Mr. Noke, but I have not sent it until I hear from you about this business altogether. I do not want you to settle any thing for me, as I now have got nothing more to settle; the weight of which, with your treatment, having been on my mind for ever since, and of which, as I was told by Dr. Babington here, is sure of bringing on that affliction; and, as I believe, that from your treatment and T. N. has been the whole cause, both of that and my present situation, in this life, and of which being unjustly, I shall hold to the last. I have only to say that I, during the short time I have been here, have had several advices, and all to a right purpoe, which way to go on when I come out, either to your advantage or disadvantage. I will not do any thing rashly, while here, towards you, although in my power so to do; I shall take consideration before acting -. There is a person here who has got two bills of Evans', in Spital-square, which Norman lent to a friend of his, money to the amount, one bill 37l. and 49l., which are put in his schedule as doubtful; but you never knew any thing of them; but you will (if not already) be applied to about the payment of them, therefore you may know which way to answer him. As I am glad I come here, for one point, you may depend I have not come here for nothing, but to learn the most I could while here, which you will see hereafter. I shall expect some money from you, and I am comfortable enough here, if for a year hence. Keep this book clean of mine, and Razors, and Prayer-book, and them things up-stairs from thieves that sleep there, George W. and Geo. Lish, &amp;c. I am, H. CLEAVELAND.</p>

On the 17th of September, Singleton came to Rood-lane, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, which was Friday; he said his name was Singleton, and brought this letter in his hand and gave it to my brother, but not in my presence; my brother handed it to me; I do not know the hand-writing - Singleton was present when my brother handed it to me, as having received it from him.(Letter Read.)</p>
               <p>The following is all that I know concerning the unpleasant business which has just taken place: - Mr. Latham called on me at the Tower, I think last Tuesday, and in the course of conversation, and in the presence of another young man, said he had thoughts of taking a trip over to France for a short time walking towards his home, he made a proposal to me, saying, that if I would come over with him for a few days, he would bear the expenses. I saw him again the next day, when he renewed the subject, and I agreed to go with him as far as Boulogne. Not having had leave from the Office, and as he said he had also not got leave, he said that it would be necessary, for fear of being found out, and thereby be disappointed in going, to do it as privately as possible. He requested me to leave a feigned name for him at the French Ambassador's - I gave my own name and address. I took no things with me, except a change of linen; for, as I intended to be such a short time away, I did not think it worth while to take more. I met him at eleven o'clock in the City, when he said, that as he had not taken any clothes with him, he would buy some things, which he did, and even made me take the loan of some. We got the passports about two o'clock, and left London for Dover in a postchaise, at seven: we got there about five o'clock; and when we got up in the morning at seven, he took out his pocket-book. Up to that time I had not the least suspicion, nor had not the least idea, that he had so much money with -. He then took from his pockets a quantity of sovereigns, and gave me between seventy and eighty to put into mine, saying they were too heavy to carry altogether. I then asked him how much he had altogether; when he told me nearly 600l. (I think it was he said) I was very much surprised. From what he said afterwards, I had no doubt remaining but that it was all his own. Previous to this, he had written a letter to his uncle, and, to my astonishment, he said that he had told him in it, that he did not intend coming back to England. I begged of him to come back to London directly, and give up the money he had taken, which he refused to do. He then pressed me to accompany him; and on my talking to him of the madness of doing so, he only flew into a rage. Directly after that, and seeing plainly that nothing I could say would induce him to give up his mad scheme, I kept him under pretence of going to see about the packet, and took the first conveyance to London. Not being able to get a place in the coach at that time, I came nearly all the way in a post-chaise, and have only just arrived. From any blame attached to me in this unfortunate business, I trust I shall be able to clear myself. I have got 71l. in sovereigns, ready to give up directly. I fear, as it is so late, that I shall not be able to see any of your Gentlemen this evening, nor do I know in what name to address this.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SINGLETON:</p>
               <p>To the Senior Clerk, 23, Rood Lane.</p>
               <p>Upon this I sent for an officer, who took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Latham is your apprentice, is he not? A. Yes, he has been with us nearly seven years - our general way of business was for him to make entries in the general cash-book of what he drew, and he kept a petty cash-book himself - it was the course of our business for him to make up his accounts every evening - he made entries in the book of what money he took, and settled every night; he enters the amount of cash he takes out, and the parties he pays it to - he has no business to take out more than he wants, his duty is to say what he wants before he takes it; it never happened to my knowledge that he had to return any cash - he has entered the 416l. 5s. 6d. only. Latham was my apprentice individually, and was clerk to the firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. When Singleton brought you the letter did he give up 71l.? A. Yes.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Warner and others; on the 15th of September, Latham applied to me for a cheque to make up a particular sum of money which it was his duty to pay as Customs for East-India sugart - his is the cheque I gave him, it is for 173l. 17s. 4d. which was the sum he applied for; it was necessary for him to get that cashed before the duties could be paid; here is his own name written on the back of the cheque, which indicates that he received it at the Bank; it is drawn on the cashiers of the Bank of England, drawn by Jacob Warner, Sons, and Co. on the 15th of September 1826, and indorsed F. J. Latham.</p>

I asked if that was all? he said, all, except what Singleton had got. I asked him who Singleton was? he said, a young man who came down with him, and he believed he was gone on board. I inquired for an officer, who took Latham in charge; we then went to the packet, but it was gone; I then went with Latham on board a vessel to go to Calais, but we could not make Calais, and we got to Boulogne, and travelled from there to Calais; we found these two portmanteaus at the Custom-house at Calais; Latham pointed them out; I brought them up to London with Latham; the money I received from him was 564l., and he said he thought 705l. was the whole he had taken, but he could not account for the rest.

On the 15th of September the two prisoners came there in a hackney-coach, about a quarter before three o'clock - they had two portmanteaus and a few paper parcels - they asked for dinner, and a room to wash and dress in; the porter took the articles out of the coach; I took hold of their portmanteaus, and found they were empty; I told my master of it; our coffee-room is not a public room, we have only some gentlemen who dine in it, and the lodgers; they washed and dressed, and then dined in the coffee-room about four o'clock; immediately after dinner Singleton went away in a hackney-coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to Charing-cross - he returned in about an hour and ordered the bill, which I took him, and he paid it with a 10l. note, which he took from a roll of notes which he had in his pocket - I think there were from fifteen to twenty-five notes - I took the same note to my master, and he gave me change; I gave the change to Singleton; I think the amount of their bill was 1l. 15s., and they told me to deduct the amount of postage to Dartford, which was 1l. 7s.; they left in a post-chaise, at a quarter before seven o'clock, to go to Dartford.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did they sit in the coffee-room the whole time? A. No; they went to a room to dress before I saw Singleton take out the roll of notes - Latham asked if I could speak French - I said I could not - I did not see Latham hand any notes to Singleton, nor did I see Singleton hand any to him - he put them into his left-hand trousers pocket - I did not count the notes he had in his hand, but I think there were from fifteen to twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Can you undertake to say that there were several notes in the roll? A. Yes; my attention was so directed to them that I can speak to the circumstance positively.</p>

            . I am the keeper of the Hydepark hotel. I received, from the last witness, a 10l. note on the 15th of September; to the best of my belief it was the prisoners who were there at that time - I gave the waiter change out of it - their bill was 1l. 19s. 6d. - I put the note into my cash-box in my bureau - I did not mark the note - I took a great deal that day - I gave a Mr. Hughes change for 100l. note the same evening, and the next day I paid my cook a 10l. note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What notes did you give to Mr. Hughes? A. A 50l. note, three 10l. notes, and one 20l. note; one of these 10l. notes might have been the one I received from the waiter.</p>

            . I am in the Ordinance-office in the Tower. Singleton lodged with me, and left my house on a Wednesday, in September - I did not see him again till I saw him in confinement, which was four or five days afterwards - I had no knowledge of his going away - I do not know whether he took his clothes, as they were in his room. I know Latham by sight, but I do not know that I ever saw him with Singleton; my son was unfortunately acquainted with Latham - I have seen him in the Tower, parading about, and he has come to my house to see my son, but mostly staid at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time you saw Latham lately, has he been in deep mourning? A. Yes. I believe Singleton left his property at my house; I never looked at his wardrobe; but I believe he was well equipped as a gentleman - he was as respectable and correct a young man as I ever knew - he lived with me six or seven months, and I loved him next to my own child - he is in the Ordinance-office, in the same situation which I first held, and now I am second clerk there - he had no temptation from poverty to have committed a bad action - his salary is 90l. per annum.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN HOE re-examined. When I brought the portmanteaus to town there were clothes in them; I have seen them frequently - I locked one of them up; I have had the key in my possession ever since; it has been unlocked two or three times since in my presence, and very possibly something may have been put into it, which was not there at first, without my seeing it; this black coat was in one portmanteau; Latham had a claret coloured coat on when I took him, it appeared new; I put it in the portmanteau - the one that was not locked had shirts and trousers in it.</p>

These are the two I sold the prisoner's; I know them, because I put two white sticks in them, which I never put before, or since - the sticks are generally made of oak, but that day I had no oak.</p>
               <p>SINGLETON'S Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen. I will not attempt to assert that I have not acted very indiscreetly and incautiously, but of the crime I am accused of I am perfectly innocent, and, when you hear the evidence my counsel will bring, I feel confident you will be of the same opinion - this young man had asked several other persons to go with him before he asked me, and, when he asked me, I unfortunately agreed to go with him, but I had particular motives for going, as that part of my family, to which I am most naturally attached, live at Boulogne - the prisoner had given out that he was to receive a legacy at the death of a relation, and, a short time after, he appeared in black, and I supposed his relation was dead, and yielding to his solicitations, I accepted his invitation to go to France, free of expense - he stated that he was going away without the leave of his uncle, and he would not wish me to go back to the Tower - so he was to purchase some clothes for me, as he said, I could give him the money when I returned from France; I got a passport for him in a fictious name, as he wished me; but for myself, in my own name, which I should not have done, if I had known how he got the money; I did not hear a word of that till I got to Dover, and when I did, I resolved on returning immediately - for this purpose I came by the van to Canterbury, leaving every thing behind me - from thence I took a post-chaise, and arrived in London on Saturday evening, too late to go to Latham's employers; but I forgot to mention that on my arrival at Dover, I wrote a letter to my uncle, excusing myself for leaving my office without leave, and saying, I was going to Boulogne, and should return in three days: the moment I got to London I wrote to a young friend, requesting to know the name and address of Latham's employers; he came to me on the Sunday morning, at the coffee-house, where I was, gave me their names, and walked with me to their residence; I wrote to them the letter which has been produced, but I wrote in great agitation, and very hastily - I fear there may be some errors and omissions, and it may not be so explicit as I could have wished; I returned and wished Mr. Warner to hear what I had to say, intending to give a full explanation, but he would not hear what I had to offer; I met his brother, and a friend, who behaved in the most gentlemanly manner, but Mr. Warner ordered his warehouseman and another person to stand between me and the door to prevent my going, and sent for an officer, had me taken into custody, and ordered the officer not to allow me to have communication with any person, and that injunction was so strictly carried into effect, that a letter which I wrote to my father, was returned to me unopened - how far Mr. Warner can reconcile this unfeeling and unjust treatment to a person like myself placed in this situation, and denied the means of defence, I do not know, but I am innocent of the charge, and have been anxious from the first, to stand forward and clear myself.</p>
