On the afternoon of the 7th of October I went, with three other officers, to No. 3, James-place, St. Ann-street, Westminster—we found the street door open, and went up stairs—there is only one room up stairs—the door was shut—I put my shoulder against it, to endeavour to open it; and on doing so, a rush was made towards the door by persons inside, pushing it back, and trying to keep it closed—we ulti<lb/>mately succeeded in forcing it open, and found all the four prisoners in the room—the moment I entered I saw Burrows go towards the window, which was open, and throw something white out of his hand across the court, and into the open window of a house opposite, and I then heard the jinking of coin falling on the floor of the room opposite—he then jumped out of the window, right across the court, a distance of between five and six feet, into the window, of the other house—I saw him stoop repeatedly in that room, go towards the fire-place, and throw something into the fire—he then came to the window, dropped down into the court, and made off—Brook followed him—I assisted in securing the other three—I left them in the care of Lupton and Goff, and went into the opposite house to the room I had seen Burrows in—I there found these three counterfeit shillings on the floor, two others on the hob, and two in a piece of paper under an ornament on the mantel-piece—I saw melted metal running from the grate into the ashes beneath—I picked some of it up—here is part of a shilling which I picked up—I came down into the court again, and between the two windows in the court I found this shilling—I then went into the room into which I originally went, and found in the cupboard some plaster-of-Paris in this bag, also this iron spoon, which appears to have contained metal, and three or four Britannia metal teaspoons.</p>

I went with the other policemen to this house, and assisted in opening the door, which was resisted by the two female prisoners—when I got into the room I saw the four prisoners there—I saw Burrows throw something from him, and then jump out of the window into the window opposite—I saw that Townsend was about to take the same step, and I caught him under his arm, just as he was going out of the win<lb/>dow—he called to Burrows, who was in the room opposite, and said, "Here," and threw something, which looked to me like shillings—I drew him back into the room and secured him—I then saw Burrows stooping or kneeling down in the room opposite, picking something up, and throwing it on the fire—he then jumped out of the window into the court—he fell on his back, got up, and was followed by Brook—I assisted to secure the other prisoners—I then searched the room, and on the fire I found this spoon full of metal, both red hot, and a saucer on the table, close to the fire, containing nine shillings, which I should say were bad—I also found a spoon partly melted, and a small file—Temple was crying, and Townsend said to her, "Don't fret,"or,</p>

I am an Italian, and live in Church-street, Hatton-garden—I am a thermometer maker—the prisoner resides in my house, in the first-floor front room—he is something in my business—on the 20th of Sept., when I came home in the evening, I went up stairs to my bed-room, and saw his door wide open—after I got opposite the stairs, I heard John Hare coming up stairs—I stopped on the staircase, hearing some words between him and the prisoner—my wife came up, and called me back to shut the prisoner's door—he was in the room, and lately has been in the habit of leaving his door open—I shut it because I was told, and he had been threatening to take my life—after shut ing the door, he opened it three or four different times—Mander was also in the room—I then went into the room, and said, "There has been a great deal of disturbance in this house for the last four or five weeks, through you, I am determined to put an end to it, I will suffer it no longer"—I can<lb/>not say what answer he made—we had a few words, and very soon afterwards the prisoner used a few words, and I gave him a push, and pushed him away—that was not with violence—he immediately struck me a violent blow with the poker on the hinder part of my head—I cannot say whether he had the poker in his hand when I pushed him—it knocked me down, and I was senseless for several minutes—he hit me again with the poker, while I was down, on the back part of my head—I got up, and he struck me again across</p>

Ford—it bears the Fulham post-mark, and the Inland post-mark of 5th Oct.—the secoud one, addressed to Mr. Cane, bears the post-mark of the Great Surrey-street receiving-office, and the Inland office paid stamp of the evening of the 5th Oct.—the third bears the St. Alban's post-mark of the 5th Oct., and the Inland office paid stamp of the same day—the letters might pass through the prisoner's hands in the course of his duly.</p>

My husband destroyed himself—previous to his doing so, he very often exhi<lb/>bited symptoms which led me to conclude he was not of sound mind, for two or three years previous at least—he exhibited such symptoms the whole of the time I was pregnant with tke prisoner—(he is twenty-two years old)—he was very violent indeed—he attempted to throw me violently out of window—I was then some months advanced in preguancy—he also carried me up stairs by one arm, without allowing ray feet to touch the staires—that very much affected my mind, and I was exceedingly ill the whole time—Dr. Clutterbuck attended me—previous to this he was, generally speak<lb/>ing, a kind husband—I had no reason to complain of him tiil he deve<lb/>loped these symptoms—at tke time he committed suicide he was very comfortably off—nothing of that kind was preying on hit mind—I have heard that father's brother also committed suicide, but I do not know that—I have heard so in the family—my own brother also committed suicide in 1809—the prisoner was married about three months ago—we thought he had married properly and respectably—it was with my knowledge—he has very often committed very strange acts—when he was about eight yean of age, on returning from school, he went away somewhere, and, after advertising him, we found he had been sitting in a boat by the Tower the whole night—he had no object in running away—I had not treated him harshly or unkindly—on another occasion, about the same time, we had locked him in a room, and on opening the door, about an hour afterwards, he said, "It is very lucky, for I should have been dead in few minutes"—he had cut a cord from the window,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230022"/>
               <p>and was going to destroy himself—he was tying it in a knot, giving the appearance of being about to hang himself—when he was about ten or eleven years old he had saved some money—he took a coach, and went off down to the Isle of Wight, and roved about there—we found him there—he had no reason for leaving me at that time—he had not made any complaint before he left—his general conduct was very peculiar—he was very fond of me and very affectionate, yet at times he would do such acts as would almost kill me, and then would not believe that he had committed them—that occurred at times during the whole period of his life, from eight years old to the present time—he did not associate much with other boys, but was rather lonely at home—he went into the employ of the Post-office three years ago last September—he has not been pressed in money affairs—I was always able and willing to assist him, and he knew that—about two years ago I had some pictures in my parlour—he broke every one of them, and put them into the fire—one of them was a portrait of his brother—I valued them, because the parties were dead, and they were my mother's—he knew I valued them on that account—he himself valued his brother's picture very much—I told him of it afterwards—he was extremely sorry then, and said he would not have burnt it on any account—he was not able to give any rational cause for having done so—he would lay in bed, and if we did not hear him he would throw the water<lb/>jug full of water at the door to make us bear him—he is my only son—I have four children—he has very often broken articles, which he appeared at other times to prize, when he has had a paroxysm of that kind, and has forgotten it immediately after, and denied that he has done it—that has constantly occur<lb/>red from the period of eight years of age to the present time—about a fort<lb/>night before this occurrence, be came into the room, when his wife was present, shook his arms violently about, and said, "I feel I want to fight, I could fight anything, I feel so strong"—we said, "Don't fight us"—he said, "What shall I? I cannot resist"—I said, "Oh, hit the door, or anything"—he then hit the door with his knuckles, and burst the panel—he then sat down for a few minutes, and looked quite bewildered, then got up, tried to replace the panel, and said he did not think he was so strong, he did not think he should have done it—he lived at home with me at that time—he always kept pistols in his room—I think they were kept loaded—his wife was alarmed, and said she had unloaded them—he has let them off at the top of the house—some time ago, as he and his wife, a young lady named Howe, and myself, were at supper, he suddenly jumped up, and threw a glass of ale that was on the table into the young lady's face—he afterwards said he was sorry for it—she kept looking at him, and said, "I am expecting a second"—she thought, from his manner, he was likely to repeat it—within the last few months he has been unusually unwell, so much so that I proposed to him to go to the office and get him leave of absence, telling him he was very unfit for business—he said, "If you do, you will get me dismiaied"—he was attended by a medical friend, who has known him from his infancy—he was constantly taking medicine, and was particularly abstemious—I never saw him tipsy but once—he appeared to be suffering from his head—on the morning of the 5th, the day on which he is said to have stolen these letters, myself and daughter were out, and on our return, about one o'clock, he was in the passage—appeared very wild and excited, so that my daughter said she thought he was mad—I do not think I have detailed all the circumstances that have occurred, but my mind has been all anxiety and trouble, and my memory is not good—on one occasion he began talking very violently to me, and he took up the poker; I turned my back, to leave the room, and he struck me on the back with the poker—this did not arise from general unkindness towards me—he</p>

I am married, and live with my mother—I am the prison<lb/>er's sister, and am some years older than him—I was in the house at the time of his birth, and observed the treatment my mother received from her husband at that time—my father was subject to fits of insanity for some years before he died, and when in those fits he used to ill-treat my mother and all his family—I have had a great many opportunities of observing the prisoner's conduct and disposition from his boyhood—at times he was extremely vio<lb/>lent, and at times you could not understand what it was for—without any apparent cause he would do the most inconsistent things—there were con<lb/>stantly complaints of him from his school-masters, and that kind of thing, of a different kind from those ordinarily made of boys—about twelve months back he cut the eye out of his own likeness, and said, "That is my eye"—I said, "What have you been doing? you have destroyed your picture"—he laughed, and said he liked it much better so—I said, "You must be devoid of sense"—he said, as it was so good a likeness we must fancy the rest—I was very angry, and told bim it was the act of a simpleton—on another occa<lb/>sion I was playing at cards with my sister and two ladies, when the prisoner came in, took the cards up off the table, and threw them into the fire, also the cribbage-box, and after that he upset the table—nothing had been said to pro<lb/>voke him—he also broke all the tea-things that were set ready for him to take tea—he has been very much worse lately—he has continually complained of his head, and want of rest—he requested every one of the family that were present to rub his head, and comfort him—his marriage was his own act—it was got up so vciy quick from first to last, that we hardly understood it at</p>

               <p>all—my mother was extremely kind to him, and I believe I was so myself—on the morning of his marriage he was in the most dreadful state of excite<lb/>ment—he said he would not be married, we need not dress; we need not at<lb/>tempt to think he should, he had altered his mind—he knocked the clock off the shelf, and broke it, then collected the pieces, put them on the bed, and knocked them into smaller pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Eldridge, a carman. I was in the service of the prisoner's mother, from Jan. 1841, till the following Dec.—during that period I had opportunities of seeing the prisoner's con<lb/>duct—about a month or six weeks after I entered the service, he came house, and insisted on having some money—he was very violent to have it—his mother refused to let him have the money at first—he would insist on hav<lb/>ing it—he used very bad language, and knocked her down with his fists—his conduct was like a madman—when she was on the floor he threatened he would murder her if she did not give it him—she got up and put gold and silver out of her purse on the table—there was about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—the prisoner took it up, threw it right into the fire, and held her on the sofs till he thought it was very nearly burnt—he dared his mother to touch it, and was like a madman—he then left the room, and went into his bed-room—I and his mother succeeded in getting all the money, but two or three sovereigns out of the fire—some was very black—on another occasion, about a fortnight or three weeks after, I remember his coming home from the Post-office—his mother asked him what made him so late—he said that was his business—he up with his fiste, smashed all the things on the tray, and threw the tea-pot under the ashes—he threatened to knock his mother down, and she walked into her bed-room—in the same week, after he returned from the office at ten or eleven o'clock at night, I was in the kitchen—I saw him go up stairs, and heard a terrible smash—he rang the bell—I went up stairs, and saw the looking-glass all broken to pieces—on another occasion he re<lb/>turned from the Post-office with a terrible knock ready to split the door—I let him in—he sat himself down in a chair just within the parlour, and said, "Mary, I am going mad, but I will see them all at hell before I go into any mad-house"—he then put on his hat nnd went out immediately—I remember</p>

               <p>once his going out to walk with his mother—she was in the habit of wearing a cloak—he snatched it out of her hand, twisted her wrist round, nearly put out her thumb, and twisted ft from her—he tore it off, and threw it on the sofa—he only tore the pin-hole—he then broke the handle of the parlour<lb/>door right in two, and threw it on the floor—he used dreadful language to<lb/>wards his mother, then left the room, and went into his bed-room—I remem<lb/>ber when a gentleman was coming to dine with him, I think it was about May—among other things, there was a ham for dinner—the gentleman did not come—my mistress was getting the ham ready—the prisoner came down stairs into the kitchen, snatched the ham from her, and flung it at her—she escaped out of the kitchen—I told him about the looking-glass, and said what a thing it was for him to break to many things—he said I must have been dreaming, it was not him, it must have been me—from what I saw of him, and from the transactions I have detailed, in my judgment he did not appear in his proper senses—I knew Mrs. Green, a lodger—I do not know where she is now—I remember her giving warning to leave in consequence of his conduct, and she desired his mother to put him under restraint.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and lire at No. 10, Howland-street, Fitzroy-square—I know the prisoner's family—I knew his father, but very slightly—I have been in his company, and seen him—I re<lb/>member his death—I did not see him after his death—I have attended the prisoner professionally for some years—he was always a very eccentric, ex<lb/>traordinary behaved young man—I think there were periods, when from the state of his mind he could not distinguish between right and wrong—I have been in Court, and heard the evidence which has been given of his general conduct—from what I have heard and known I should have thought him capable of committing any violent act—I have not witnessed acts of his similar to that with which he is charged—I have been consulted by his mother—she once consulted me as to the state of his mind, not as to putting him under restraint—I should think that is nearly twelve months ago—I have drank tea at his mother's house several times—I remember, on one occa<lb/>sion, when the prisoner kept playing on a barrel organ which was in the room, very much to the annoyance of the persons in the room—his actions were not particular at the time, except that of grinding this organ—he Was stand<lb/>ing—I do not think he was moving, more than moving the organ—I remon<lb/>strated with him—the effect of the playing was, I thought, to disturb all the persons present—he continued playing for a considerable time—he has com<lb/>mitted most extravagant acts, which I could not conceive to result from any other cause than derangement of mind—I am not aware of any other motive to which it could be attributed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But may not that state have been produced by the violent indulgence of intemperate passion, and not the result of alienation of mind, that rendered him incapable of proper conduct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I have seen him I have been called to him in consequence of his being in ill-health, and at that time his mind was in a most unsettled, disturbed state, and unconscious of what was passing during the time I was with him—he had a fever—the last time I saw him delirious in a fever was probably about twelve months ago—he was then in bed for a week or ten days—I never saw him in a similar state after that—when he was not in this state of delirium I should say he was generally capable of knowing right from wrong, and conducting ordinary affairs—I was present at his marriage—I knew it was intended before it took place—I knew nothing of the young lady, and gave no caution to her or her family—I thought it unnecessary to interfere.</p>

I have known the prisoner about two years—I have seen him sometimes very much excited—about six months since I went to the house, and saw his mother fainting—she said, "My son will be the death of me; he is up in his bed-room"—the first thing I saw was a chair broken to pieces, which she said her son had done in bis excitement—I afterwards went up stairs—his door was locked—I went in to him—he was excited then—I calmed him a bit, and came down again—I saw that the painted window on the landing was broken—his mother said he had thrown his slipper through it in going up stairs—he was then walking backwards and forwards in the room—I have seen him quite mad with excitement, throwing his arms about, not like a rational being at times—I have never been able to learn from him any cause or motive for being in such a state—it was evident that his mind was affected, because he had not been drinking at the time—I did not know his father, or uncle, or family—about seven or eight weeks since, in the middle of the day, he came into my surgery, which he generally does as he passes to and from the Post-office, drew a pistol from his pocket, and placed it within nine inches or a foot of my breast—he was throwing his arms about rather excitedly—I told him to be still, and put it away; that he ought not to carry such things—he did me no injury with it—I did not examine it to see whether it was loaded—I have seen him from time to time in states when I believe he was out of the pale of self-control—I really cannot say whether that arose from an obstinate, perverse, or wicked disposition, or from his mind being disor<lb/>dered—he</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Millbrook, eighty-five miles from London. On the 17th of Sept, after eight o'clock at night, I saw my mare in a field close to my house—there was only one gate to the field, and that was locked—I missed her about five o'clock in the morning—the gate was still locked—she could not have strayed, from the state of the fence—I saw her again last Monday fortnight in Mr. Day's stable, at Kensington, and was certain of her, although her tail was cut off and her back discoloured—she was worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

The prisoner was admitted into the workhouse on the night of the 3rd of Oct., and slept in the casual-ward—I have charge of the keys—the workhouse was locked at ten o'clock at night, and the keys were delivered to me—I got up at six next morning, and, in consequence of information, between six and seven, I went into the yard and missed the articles stated from the tailor's workshop—there is a window to the shop, which works on a swivel, and is kept in its place by its own weight—I found it open—that shop is in the same enclosure as I reside in as servant to the board of guardians—I called over the muster-roll in the morn<lb/>ing, and the prisoner was the only person missing.</p>

On the morning of the 4th of Oct., about a quarter past five o'clock, I was awoke by the smashing of glass in the fan-light over the shutter—I saw a man's arm at the fan-light, taking out the flutes through the glass—there is a range of panes going along the top of the shutters, about four inches wide, to throw light into the shop—I should think it was about three feet from the door—the flutes were hanging inside, underneath that pane, about an inch from where it was broken—I went up to the window, and shook the framework of the glass inside—the man withdrew his arm, and dropped, taking with him the flute—I heard something fall heavily out<lb/>side, as if some one had fallen down—I awoke the inmates of the house, and in about five minutes opened the door—I did not see any one outside—this flute produced is Ann Aldridge's property, and one of the flutes that was missing—here is a silver key, which I have every reason to believe to belong to this part of the flute—this was dropped inside the window—it is marked "W. M.," and the flutes are marked, "William Millhouse"—we clean them with rouge, and the rouge is on them—flutes are mostly cleaned with whiten<lb/>ing—the three flutes are worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece—the glass was quite sound when I went to bed the night before—I was the last person is the shop.</p>

On the 13th of Sept., about four o'clock, the prisoners came into my shop—one of them had been the day before, and I missed a bundle of cigars—I watched them in the passage, and saw Smith get under the table two or three times, and presently he drew up my umbrella between his legs, and put it behind Jones—I looked out, and saw a policeman, called him, and gave them both in charge—we could not find the umbrella—they were taken into the street, and the umbrella was found in Smith's breeches—Jones was talking to him at the time, and must have seen him take it—he held a paper in front of Smith, to keep my daughter from seeing what was going on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher in Hungerford-market—the prisoner has been in my service about fifteen months. On the evening of the 26th of Oct., about half-past six o'clock, I left my counting-house, which is at the end of the shop, for about a minute or a minute and a half, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I locked the cupboard, and left the key in it—when I returned I found the prisoner still in the shop—about an hour afterwards I went to the cupboard, and missed a sovereign, which I am certain had been there when I left the cupboard—there were four in one place, and one in another—it was one of the four that I missed—I had left no one there besides the prisoner—I asked him if he had been into the counting-house—he said "No"—I said he must have been, for I had lost a sovereign, and I had suspected him for the last fortnight—he denied it—I sent for a constable, and, just before he ar<lb/>rived, the prisoner pulled the sovereign out of his pocket, gave it to me, and begged pardon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Thursday morning, the 28th of Sept., I was called to the prisoner's house, and found his wife dead when I got there—the prisoner was present, and several persons—I tried to bleed her but no blood flowed—I asked the prisoner what she had been taking—he answered, he had given her two ounces of sulphate of potash—I asked what he gave it in—he said, a glass of water—I asked him to produce the glass—he did so—it was perfectly clean, and no ingredients in it—I asked him what caused him to give such a thing—he said it was to make her miscarry—I asked him if she had taken any thing of the kind before—he said, "Yes, she had taken four ounces within a fortnight in small quantities, that she took two ounces on Tuesday, and two ounces on Wednesday night at ten o'clock—I asked him to show me what had been thrown off her stomach—he said it was all washed away, there was nothing remaining—I asked him if any one re<lb/>commended him to give her that article—he said he took it from a book which he bought in the Strand—I asked for the book—he produced it—I handed it to the officer—I asked if he was embarrassed, or what was the cause of his doing such a rash act—he said he had such a dislike to children—I have examined the deceased in company with another surgeon—I have been forty years in the profession—on looking at the body I found she was not pregnant—I</p>

               <p>examined the brain, and the dura-mater which covers the brain was per<lb/>fectly healthy—on removing that membrane I found about two ounces of blood flowed from a ruptured blood vessel on the brain, which was the cause of her death—I opened the abdomen—the stomach was found empty, and very much inflamed—the uterus was healthy and unimpregnated—all the stomach and intestines were highly inflamed, which must have arisen from some irritable substance—it was a state of high inflammation from irrita<lb/>bility, from the preparation that was introduced into the stomach—a person taking two ounces of sulphate of potash on Tuesday night, followed by sickness and vomiting, and the same quantity on Wednesday night, which produced sickness, would cause the appearance I found the stomach in—the vessels of the brain were very much distended and full of blood—supposing the sulphate of potash to have been taken, and producing sick<lb/>ness and vomiting, I consider that the exciting cause the stomach and intes<lb/>tines being in such a high state of recent inflammation—I think the ap<lb/>pearance of the brain was produced by the irritation of the stomach, causing sickness, which produced a rupture of the blood vessel, the vio<lb/>lent exertion in retching—I could trace all the symptoms to have been occasioned by the administration of sulphate of potash—he stated that she laboured under great sickness, and vomited to a great degree in the course of the night—that on Tuesday she vomited excessively, and was very sick—sulphate of potash is sometimes administered in small quantities, and is then a mild cathartic—a dose is about a drachm—there are eight drachms to an ounce—two ounces would be attended with great danger—so large a quantity administered two following days would be attended with very great danger.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner—Mr. Pickering gave him into my custody—he said he gave him into custody for causing the death of his wife—I asked how he knew he had caused her death—he said, "Principally from his own words"—I asked how he had caused it—he said, "By administering sulphate of potash to cause abortion, and that had caused her death"—the prisoner said it was all true—I told him to hold his tongue, and answer no questions, for anything he might say would be given in evi<lb/>dence—he said he did not care; he would speak the truth, if he was hung for it—he then told me, about a fortnight previous, he got a quarter of a pound of sulphate of potash, and gave her that in small quantities; that on Tues<lb/>day he got two ounces more, and gave her all at once, which caused violent retching, and a great deal of sickness, but she got better again in the morning—on the Wednesday he got two ounces more, and gave it her a little after ten o'clock, when she went to bed, which caused violent retching, and a good deal of sickness again, till between two and three o'clock on Thursday morning, when, thinking she was dying, he called in a next door neigh<lb/>bour; that he gave it to her to cause a miscarriage, but never thought it would have a fatal effect on her.</p>

On Saturday night, the 30th of May, about half-past ten o'clock, I was called in to see the deceased, he was lying on a sofa—I examined his person, and on the left side of the lower part of the belly, I found a wound, evidently inflicted by a sharp, cutting instrument—such a knife as this would inflict such a wound—I inserted a probe, and it indicated a depth of about an inch, but on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, it was found to be deeper—I probed it as far as was considered necessary—I did what is usually considered necessary in the case—in my judgment there was no hope from the first, from the nature of the wound—he lived till four o'clock on Monday—after death I examined the wound more minutely, it was nearly two inches in "depth, and had pene<lb/>trated the bowels in two places—the instrument had transfixed a portion of the bowel, passing from one side of the intestine to the other, making two wounds, two openings in the bowels—the bowels were highly inflamed, in consequence of this wound, and a portion of the contents of the bowel had escaped into the cavity of the belly—I observed approaching symptoms of mortification, a dark colour from the inflammation—the cause of death was inflammation produced by this wound, the contents of the bowel escaping—the liver, stomach, and every thing else was healthy.</p>

I have known the prisoner four or five years—he has worked for me lately—I always found him of very weak mind—every person in my place, the girls particularly, joked him and laughed at him, but I never noticed him much till very lately—I have remarked him worse than before, more weak, more a fool, more insane—the last time he came into my place for work there was a little difference between us—I gave him three pairs of boots, but only found two pairs on his book—I asked him in what way the others went, and he said he would bring them—I said I should inquire about it—he asked if I fancied he had stolen them—I said, "I don't know, but I must know it"—then he began to be angry, end very fidgetty and impudent with me—we then had a little quarrel, and I told him to go and leave my place, we were about level in expense, and I should not see him for some time, as he had borrowed of me too much—he went, but not very quickly—I said, "You had better go, or I shall make you"—he was very impudent, and said, "I shall <hi rend="italic">pay you out</hi> for that, and kill you very likely"—I did not consider then that he was out of his mind—only what I found since—I could not un<lb/>derstand what was the matter with him—I do not know of any jokes his fellow-journeymen used to play upon him, only about a girl—I heard about his fancying himself a fine gentleman, calling for a bottle of wine, and paying a sovereign for it—I never saw him pay it, but I heard several jokes of that kind—I never saw him dress himself up, and say he was Napoleon—I spoke to him lately about a hospital, because he told me he was ill, and I said, "If you are really ill, you must find some place or hospital"—he had a very singular discourse with me about Prince Albert and different things, and the son of a prince—that was three weeks, perhaps, before this—he did not tell me he was Napoleon—this is a shoemaker's knife, such as a man in his situation would naturally have about him.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps the Blue Posts in Berwick-street. About a week before Keim's death, the prisoner came to our house, brought a gallon bottle, and ordered a quartern of gin in it—I served him—he took it away—he did not appear anything extraordinary—I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>—Smith. About half-past two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 24th of Sept., the prisoner called at my place, with a stone bottle in his hand, I should say about a gallon bottle—he asked me to drink—I said, "You have been at Broad-street; I don't like that sort of drink"—(there is a pump in Broad-street)—he said, "No, it is very good,"—he took a wine-glass out of his pocket, and poured but half a glass—I tasted it with him, it was gin—there was not above a glass more in the bottle—he poured the contents out, and drank it himself—I had known him about twelve months—I consider him a person not of sound senses—I thought he looked very strange—he never spoke to me before, to my knowledge, although I knew him some time—I thought he was not in his sound mind.</p>

               <p>some broken granite stones laying in the road—the blow made me giddv at first—it knocked me down on the ground—I lost my hold of the man, and pointed the prisoner out to Marsh, who collared him—he was very violent indeed—he struck Marsh—I afterwards took hold of the other side of him—he struck and kicked me several times—Kelly afterwards came up—his com<lb/>panions rushed on me—I succeeded in getting him to the station at last—I was taken to Mr. Semple, the surgeon, and have been under his care ever since—the stone was thrown straight at me, purposely to hit me—it was a sharp stone, nearly as big as my fist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Sebbon's-build<lb/>ings, Islington. On this Sunday morning, about half-past twelve o'clock, I examined Lawrence's head—I found a wound on the right-hand side of the forehead, about three quarters of an inch long, and half an inch deep—I probed the wound, and found it penetrated to the skull, which was denuded of the pericranium, and I detected a fracture or fissure of the skull—it may bare been occasioned by a sharp stone—it must have been thrown with con-liderable violence to break the skull—it was a dangerous wound—he has been off duty until this time, and under my treatment—his health is not quite established.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of any other trade or commerce carried on there except the slave-trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—I was at the whole of the slave establish<lb/>ments I have mentioned, went over them all before they were destroyed, and saw nothing but the slave-trade—if there had been any commerce carried on I must have known it—a merchant named Ignatio Rolo was on board the <hi rend="italic">Sara-cen</hi> for near two days—Captain Denman had taken a slave-ship, and he was taken—I never saw him buy or sell a slave; but as far as I know a grocer's trade, I should certainly say, he was wholly and solely a slave dealer—he re<lb/>sided at Jacria, a slave establishment—I went all over his stores, and every thing; there was po sign of anything there but the slave-trade—I never saw him there—I did not see him in any occupation—it must have been in No<lb/>vember that I saw him, a day or two previous to our going into the Gal<lb/>linas to make some arrangements with the chiefs—there is no establish<lb/>ment there called by his name—Jacria is the establishment there—he came on board the slave vessel, and was detained by the prize-officer—he is a Spaniard, to the best of my belief—I was not personally acquainted with a merchant named Alvarez—I knew Don Ximinez there, and have seen him at Sierra Leone as well—we fell in with a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>, several times, and chased her, we finally succeeded in taking her, in April, 1839—she was sailing under Russian colours—a man named Thomas Bernardos was commander of the vessel at that time—the crew were chiefly Spaniards—there might have been one or two Portuguese—she was equipped for the slave-trade, there was no doubt of it in my eyes—she had more water-casks than were ne<lb/>cessary for an ordinary or fair trader—they are large vessels called leagers—any vessel may have leagers on board, but she had a larger quantity than was necessary for a merchant vessel, considerably larger, and that is one of the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you say, that although you were for some two or three years cruising on the coast of Africa, it was not till Nov. 1840, that you landed at the Gallinas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I landed on an island in the river, for about half an hour previous to that—with that exception, I had not landed at the Gallinas—there are several villages up the river Gallinas inhabited by natives—the river Gallinas extends some distance into the inte<lb/>rior, at least 1 believe so—I have been up it perhaps ten or a dozen miles, and there is a native village called Mina, another called Tardia, and another called Tiendo—I have been up it at least twelve miles—I cannot say whether the river is navigable farther up than I went, I should think not from the appearance of it, except for canoes—I cannot say that the people could pass considerably higher up—I did not see canoes higher up than where I went, nor could I see far up, as rivers are always very winding—as high as I went it was navigable for canoes, but I never saw canoes there—I was on this coast for the protec<lb/>tion of British commerce, and for the prevention of the slave-trade—that commerce consisted, among other things, in the exportation of the merchandise of Britain to various places on the coast of Africa—I know that British merchan<lb/>dize, in British and other vessels, is exported to a very considerable extant to various parts of the coast of Africa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that British merchandize, to a very considerable extent, is from time to time exported to the Gallinas in a lawful manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known English vessels arrive at the Gallinas, and part with a little of their cargo—I have never known an instance, before the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, of an English</p>

               <p>vessel arriving at Gallinas consigned to deliver her cargo—I have known one English vessels dispose of part of their cargo at the Galiinas, but I do not know of its being for a lawful purpose; because I am fully satisfied that from the Gallinas there is no export but slaves, therefore I cannot think it was lawful—I have known British vessels sell part of their cargo, but I doubt whether it was for lawful purposes, because there was no produce in exchange for it—I never knew of ivory or palm oil being exported from the Gallinas—I am only speaking of the period of my knowing the Gallinas—I hare never known British produce or mechandize landed there, without doubting the legality of its purpose, because there was no produce to give in exchange, no produce to be met with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment was there anything illegal in the landing of British produce, for the use either of the native chiefs or inhabitants of the towns or villages you speak of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a question which I cannot presume to answer—I seized this vessel because I considered her trade to be illegal—I have seen a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi>—I think she landed goods at the Gallinas—if that is the vessel I mean, she was commanded by a man named Sargeant; at least I think he landed some goods there—I did not see him—he gave me to understand that he did, and received something in exchange—I think the <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> was there while my vessel was there—I did not think it necessary to seise the <hi rend="italic">Gil Bias</hi>—I heard from the man who commanded her, that goods were landed there—I was not present when he sold them, nor do I know to whom he delivered them; but he gave me to understand he had sold those goods to Pedro Blanco—Sergeant brought off to me from Pedro Blanco a dozen fowls and a sheep, which I was very glad of—I had never seen Pedro Blanco in my life—I had had no fresh provisions for some little time, and he gave me to understand the dozen capons had come from Marseilles, in a vessel Wnieh had that morning tailed with slaves—I cannot remember how long the <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> was off the Gallinas—it might have been a day or two—I do not know of any other vessels that landed goods there, which I never thought of seising—I do not remember ever seeing the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> there—I do not remember the name—I do not remember a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">L'Inferna</hi>—I think I remember the name of the <hi rend="italic">Milford</hi>—uhe did not, to my knowledge, land goods to a very large amount at Gallinas—I do not remember the <hi rend="italic">Sublime</hi>—I was on a cruising visit—my station was extensive—I was a good deal at the Gallinas, because it was a noted slave place—I sometimes remained at anchor there two or three days together, and sometimes my doty would call me away for two or three months together—it is impossible for me to say what goods were landed there—I can only guess at the population of the villages—I should say that Tiendo there might, perhaps have been 800 or 900, at Tardia 200, and Mina 700 or 800, but it is only guess, from casually visiting there—there is another native town further down the river, the name of which I do not know—I only saw it—it was not thickly populated, by any means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as you could judge, is not British commerce to the coast of Africa exceedingly serviceable to the natives? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends on which way it is to be taken—if British commerce is to be employed in the slave-trade, I doubt its being serviceable to the natives—my station extended from Portan<lb/>dicque down to Madagascar—undoubtedly British commerce must be of great benefit to Africa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Within your own experience on the coast of Africa, is not a lawful trade carried on to a considerable extent by the same persons who likewise carry on the slave-trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen those persons trading, and therefore I cannot say—I do not hesitate in saying that I believe, in many Places on the coast of Africa, the same trade is carried on by the same per<lb/>sons,</p>

               <p>both the slave-trade and exchange of the produce of the coontry, but I do not believe that to be the caw at the Gallinas—I do not think at the Gallinas there is any trade but the slave-trade—speaking from heartsay, I should say that, at many places on the coast, a lawful trade and the slave-trade is carried on by the same persons; but, at the Gallinas, I am as confident there was not, as it is possible to be from my experience of the place for a long time, from being on the spot—I have been a great deal off Gallinas, and during that period I saw no other trade, nor the sign of any other trade, than the slave-trade—I state that from my knowledge derived from my personal presence at Gallinas—officers in my situation are entitled to a share in the value of the vessel seized, if condemned—supposing a vessel and carge to be of the value of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., condemned in the Vice-Admiralty Court, half the proceeds would go to the Crown, and the other half would be divided among the captors, after all the expenses were paid, of which the admiral gets one-tenth, and the captain gets one-eighth of the remainder—I think that is it, to the best of my knowledge—if the vessel be condemned in the mixed commission, I believe it is nearly the same, but half goes to the nation under whose flag she is sailing—a mixed commission court is a commission com<lb/>posed of commissioners of two or various nations, to determine cases of foreign vessels—the Act of Parliament authorises us to seize Portuguese vessels, and prosecute them in the Vice-Admiralty Court—I do not know exactly how the proceeds were to be divided—the mixed commission decides on Spanish or Portuguese vessels, and the British Vice-Admiralty Court decides on vessels sailing under British colours—I do not remember having ever seen a Spunk vessel with a British captain—when I first seized the vessel under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>, she was not in every respect fitted up for the slave-trade—I do not think she had a slave deck—she was in many respects fitted up for the slave-trade, and that led me to seise her—I sent her to England, and know nothing more of her—I heard nothing from the Admiralty about her—when she bore the name of the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, and I seized her from Jennings, she was certainly not, in my opinion, fitted up for the slave-trade—I did not seize her for that the second time—I seized her for her trade—I saw nothing I do not know what might have been under her cargo—I was on the coast of Africa from Oct. 1837 till June 1841, and from Dec. 1838 until April or May 1841 Gallinas was within my station in the first instance—I had charge of a station, during that period, from Admiral Camphell, extending from Cape Palmas up to Cape de Verde Islands, and then there was another senior officer, Captain Denman, appointed—the extent of coast over which my duty extended varied according to the orders I received—from Oct. 1837 till Dec. 1838 I was on the coast, at different parts, from Sierra Leone as far as Madagascar, but from Dec. 1838 till I left the coast of Africa in May or June 1841 it was confined to the coast between Cape Palmas, Portan<lb/>dique, and the De Verde Islands—I was up at Portandique for a month—my duty extended over about 1000 miles, I suppose—the sort of British com<lb/>merce exported to Africa during that period was gunpowder, muskets, brandy, tobacco, and cotton goods—I do not think it is possible to distinguish articles for the slave-trade and articles for British commerce, at least I do not know how to distinguish them.</p>

                  </hi>, sen. I am a cooper, and live at Portsmouth. I remem<lb/>ber the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi> being there in 1840, and while there, I went on board her—I was employed to do something to the water casks—they were double leagers—they were different sizes, but these would contain about 1,000 gal<lb/>lons each—there were about a dozen—they were entire when I first went on board—they were found on either side of it, full of water—Mottley, appa<lb/>rently, assumed the command of the vessel at that time—I saw Jennings there—I did not know Bernardos—I received directions from a person calling him<lb/>self Jennings—he gave me directions to do something with the casks—he took me on board the vessel in the shipwright's boat—I found the casks full of water in the hold of the vessel—I think of the larger kind there was about twelve, and I should say fifty of the smaller—I numbered each stave of the large casks; I rased them with a proper rase-iron which coopers use, their took the hoops from them, took the casks down, put the hoops inside, and made close bundles of them, so that they could be put together again—I re<lb/>ballasted the vessel, and stowed them on the top of the ballast in packs, each cask in a separate pack—I did the same with the smaller ones, and left others for water for the voyage—it took me from the 8th to the 19th of Sept. 1840 to do this—while, on the vessel, after putting the large casks into the hold, my attention Was attracted by a noise in one of the smaller casks, which proved to be what was called shackles when I was in the West India trade—I did not count them, but consider, from their weight and appearance, there were nearly 200 pairs—nothing was done with them while I was there—to all appearance they had been in the vessel before—I left the cask nearly in the same place as I found it—we did not take that cask to pieces; we took the head out, hearing the noise—I did not put the head in again myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you the means while in this river Gallinas, from time to time, of ascertaining how many towns or villages there were, as far up the river as you went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were, to my know<lb/>ledge, some three, or four, or five towns on different branches of the river—there are several branches to the river—I went up about ten or twelve miles, I suppose—I am positive there was no trade but slave-trade carried on there—every vessel that landed a cargo there I knew of during a period of ten months, most particularly from March, or April, 1840, till Feb. 1841—I never heard of a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Sublime</hi> landing merchandise there to the value of 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., during that period—I do not at all deny that vessels have landed cargoes there to a very large amount—I say that the slave-trade is exclusive, because no produce in return was exported, nothing but slaves—there are two branches of import to Gallinas—one is the provisions which the slave-traders there eat, and the other the goods which are used by the slave-dealers to buy slaves with—there is no produce exported from there—I do not mean to say to a hundred-weight or a ton, but nothing to be called produce, to be exported—I have known the Gallinas since 1835, and though I have more particularly directed my attention to it for the ten months: I was in charge of that station for two years, during the whole of which time I had vessels stationed at Gallinas, and had reports from that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you have stated there was nothing but the slave-trade carried on there, and that there are no exports, do you mean to include or exclude from your observation the fact of merchandise being landed and purchased there, and being paid for in money, so that a stranger carrying it there, and selling it, and receiving money, would not know but the whole proceeding was per<lb/>fectly lawful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My answer to that is, that persons who land cargoes at Gallinas, in that way, would not be guilty of slave-trading, but all those goods would of necessity go towards slave-trade, because nothing but slave-trade is in existence—the natives have no money to pay for goods, except money that comes from the slave-trade or slaves—there is no produce, and no money coined in that country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As regards a shipper from this country, supposing any one shipped not as agent, but on his own account, and that he receives money for what he exports, do you mean that there is any slave-trading in that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not of necessity, supposing he did not know the circumstances.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230070"/>
               <p>that ever happens? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never known of such a case—there is no English trade carried on in fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the time you were there, do you mean that no English vessels went there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three English vessels passed, and had a little proceeding, the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi> for one—I know, from the statement of the chiefs to me, that there was no trade there—I do not know of the <hi rend="italic">sub<lb/>lime</hi> landing goods and disposing of them to the amount of 13,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no such vessel was there during the two years I was there—I think I can positively say that, certainly not for the ten months—the trade I have described has taken place there since 1835, to my knowledge, the landing of goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1837, do you know of a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Milford</hi>, having carried goods, and landed, and sold goods at the Gallinas, to the amount of between 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in another part of the world at the time—I have no reason to doubt it—it is very possible—that does not alter the ques<lb/>tion, in my opinion, as to whether it was for the slave-trade or not—I know very well that the slave-trade exists, and that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods was landed there, and not one vessel went away without money or bills, except in cases where they were consigned in cargoes from the Havannah, which was the case with nine out of ten, where the freight was paid in the Havannah by the slave-dealers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the sort of business carried on is this; some vessels do carry commodities to a great extent, receive payment in bills or money, and sail away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those are the exceptions—very few such cases occur, some do—the system is not to carry goods there, and receive slaves in return—the sys<lb/>tem of trade is, a vessel is sent from the Havannah with goods to a slave fac<lb/>tor, (Rollo, for instance, or any of these men at the Gallinas,) she sails again in ballast, the freight is all paid at the Havannah—that is the general rule—I do not say that the vessel is of necessity engaged in slave-trade, became of necessity people do not know what they are about; but the consequence of it is of necessity slave-trade, from the way in which the payment is actually made—it furnishes means to persons there of carrying on the slave-trade—a person living in England, or elsewhere, and exporting produce there, may do so, and get his money for it, without knowing to what purpose it is to be ap<lb/>piied—it is very possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not had a hand in destroying certain property there, slave factories, if you please, which is the subject of one or more actions against you at this moment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are certain actions brought against me for the destruction of slave factories at the Gallinas—the destruction of those slave factories took place about Nov. 1840—I have been to various other parts of the coast of Africa, where the slave-trade is carried on—at most of the places on the coast there is both a lawful trade carried on and the slave-trade—the Gallinas is an exception, the only exception I know indeed—I know that from my own personal presence on the spot—if a merchant in England consigns commodities to a person at the Gallinas, it implies a certain knowledge of the party—supposing he knows nothing of the character of the parties by whom he is employed, it does not of necessity follow he should know what he is about—if he knew any thing of the person who desires him to ship goods, or the persons at Gallinas with whom the trader corresponds, I should suppose he would know enough of them to know that there was nothing but slave trading—there are undoubtedly many persons on the coast of Africa who carry on both the slave-trade, and also a very extensive lawful trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how is a gentleman in England, or America, or anywhere else,</p>

On the 2nd of Sept. last I gave him warning, and told him that that day week I should dispense with hit services—I think he said he was sorry for it—on the Saturday, when he came to receive his wages, I told him that his week was up, there was his money, and I wished him health—(the amount of his wages was a guinea)—he said he was sorry for it; he thought that I was peevish, and that I should hare thought no more about it, and then he began crying—I imagine he alluded to having been dismissed from my service—I had not found any fault with him, only that his faculties gave way—when I gave him notice I said, "Your faculties give way, you don't know what you are about"—on the 2nd of Oct. I received this letter signed by the prisoner, but written in another hand.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"42, Watling-street, Commercial-road Bast, 2nd Oct, 1843." Addressed, "Thomas Waller, Esq., Cross-lane, St. Mary-at-hill. Sir, Having for the last three weeks made every effort to obtain employment without effect, in consequence of business being in so bad a state, and finding my means are fast exhausting, I am induced to solicit you to recollect me, should you have any extra work, or can in any way make roe useful, or can recom<lb/>mend me to any situation the duties of which I can fulfil; and shall feel happy in being employed either in town or country, or reside either in the house or out, as may be required; and shall feel additionally grateful to you for any such favour, and hope you will not think me too troublesome when I take the liberty of waiting on you. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS ROWE."</hi>

About nine o'clock on Friday morning, the 6th of Oct., I heard my bell ring—after the door having been answered, Rows came into my room—I said, "What do you want, Rowe?"—he said he bad been trying to get employment from morning till night, but he could not meet with any thing—he said he wished I could give him employment either in town or country—I told him I could not, that he knew nothing about farming—he had wanted to know if I could employ him at my farm—he told me he should be glad, if I heard of any thing—I told him if I heard of any thing I would let him know, but it was not very likely that I should—I said, "I dare say you have got enough to live upon; I understand that you say you have not got the property you had, because you have lent it to your son; therefore, if you are past work now, your son should do something for you"—I believe he said that his son had not had it, but that the greater part of what he had saved had been ex<lb/>pended on his sister, who had been suffering from ill-health—I said, "You</p>

               <p>have been living with me seven or eight years, and I have had very little to do for you, and, therefore, as old age is coming upon you, I have nothing to do with that, you might have provided something for yourself"—he said, "Then you don't intend to do anything for me?"—I said, "I have no em<lb/>ployment for you"—he then came closer towards me, very close to me, and then presented a pistol and fired at me—there is a railing which rails my desk off—I was inside the railing, and he was outside—I could not see very well what he was about—I saw him fumbling about something—I think he took the pistol out of his pocket—it appeared as if he was pulling something out of paper, or something of that sort, in front of my desk, but I could not sea his hand—he presented the pistol at my left side—I did not think at the time that I was wounded, only the shock—I immediately rang my bell, and called my man, Thomas Lock, who came in—the prisoner stood looking at me after firing the pistol—he made no attempt to escape—when Lock came in, I said, "Rowe has fired at me, lay hold of him"—Lock said, "He has got a loaded pistol in his hand"—I then saw there was a pistol in his hand—I went out of the counting-house towards the kitchen, followed by Lock—the female servant ran down stairs frightened, and went out screaming—when she re<lb/>turned I sent Lock for a policeman—the prisoner got out into the warehouse, and was let out at the door—I then proceeded to put on my boots, and found a bullet in one of them, which I took out—at the time I was fired at, the boots were standing on a stool behind me—it appeared as if the bullet had dropped into the boot—it had not gone through the leather—I gave it to the police<lb/>man—in consequence of feeling faint, and what my servant said to me, I afterwards examined my person, and found I was bleeding—I sent for a surgeon, who examined me.</p>

On Friday, 6th Oct., I heard the door bell ring, and, on answering it, found the prisoner there—he said, "Well, Thomas, how do you do?"—I said, "How do you do, Rowe, I have not seen you for a length of time?"—he said he was very sadly—he asked whether Mr. Waller was within—I said, "Yes, do you wish to see him?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—he asked where he was—I said, "In the counting-house"—I went up to inform my master, admitted the prisoner, and left him with my master—in rather better than five minutes I heard the report of a pistol, and the counting-house bell ring—I went up into the counting-house—I found the prisoner on one side of the railing, and my master on the other, both standing—my master said, "Rowe has fired a pistol at me"—I got between them—the prisoner said, "Stand back, stand back, I intend it! I have lost my situation, I can get no employment, and a man like that, (meaning the prosecutor,) is not fit to live"—I saw a pistol in his hand, and said to Mr. Waller, "Get out of the counting-house, whatever you do, get out, he has got another pistol"—my master then made his way towards the kitchen—I followed him, leaving the prisoner in the counting-house—about twenty minutes, or half an hour after, I accompanied inspector Waller down the Mile-end-road—when we had got through the Mile-end turnpike-gate, we saw the prisoner talking to a female—I pointed him out to Waller, who took him into custody—he said, "Yes, it is all right, I am the person."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Mincing-lane, City. On Friday morning, the 6th of Oct., I examined Mr. Waller, and found a small would on the left side of his back which was bleeding—it was about four inches from the spine, directly over one of the ribs, and about three-eighths of an inch in length—I examined his clothes to ascertain how the wound behind had been effected, and found in his coat, flannel waistcoat, and shirt, a hole</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230077"/>
               <p>corresponding in position and size with the wound in the back—in addition to that he had received an injury on the left side of his body—it was a bruise and swelling, without any wound—I was very anxious to know, for his safety, what number of bullets there were, and whether there was or not a bullet in his body at the time—I took great pains to examine the clothes, and as I made out, the injury in front was inflicted by a bullet that had gone first of all twice through the under part of his left sleeve, then through the breast of his cost—it had torn his waistcoat, but not gone through the lining, nor through the shirt, or flannel waistcoat—it might then have dropped on the floor—it must have been a violent blow—I should think woollen stuff would stop the progress of the bullet, if the pistol was fired off near the body—the breast of his coat was loose, and was a very thick cloth—I suppose the first bullet wounded his back, and the second was the one that struck him in front—I have heard the evidence—I imagine the wound behind to be caused by his standing sideways, as he must have been from the position of his counting-house—if the pistol was fired probably at the distance of a yard, the one bullet must have struck his back, and he involuntarily must have raised his arm, or something of that kind, and the second have passed twice through his sleeve, and through this hole in the breast of the coat—the position of the wound behind was such as would have been occasioned from the position in which the man stood at the time he was firing—I have no experience in gunshot wounds—I have attended him—he has been in no danger.</p>

               <p>him by his master that he could do nothing more for him, would be calculated to produce such an effect on his mind and intellect as that he should be inca<lb/>pable of distinguishing right from wrong at the moment of his frenzy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it would act so decidedly, because I have no doubt he is the subject of organic disease—I form that opinion from what I have seen in the progress of this man for the last ten years—he is a totally altered man, and has been progressively altering for the last ten years—I have seen enough of him, in<lb/>dependent of this case, to form that judgment—the change has been particu<lb/>larly manifest in his bodily health—I have no doubt disease was going on in the vessels of the heart and brain—the imbecility, and foolish acts and blun<lb/>ders spoken of by his master, would be the ordinary result of organic disease in the brain, or some of the organs—the decay of some of the organs very commonly happens at his time of life, and that which I have heard to-day is the ordinary evidence of that change—it would be the ordinary result of the change that takes place in the blood-vessels at advanced age, when there is disease, and of which I believe him to be the subject—a swimming in the head, and dizziness about the eyes, would be a marked symptom of such dis<lb/>ease, and is exactly what I should expect to find as one of the results of such a process going on—since he has been taken up he has complained to me of a swimming in the head—I never attended him professionally, at least not for many years; but he did complain to me when I visited him, and so sim<lb/>ply, and so in harmony with his situation, that I have no doubt of its truth, that he was a subject of giddiness—taking all the circumstances of this case into consideration, his fancying that he was dismissed for buying an absurd quantity of cord, and that the female servant was the cause of his dismissal, I believe that when he fired the pistol at his master he was totally out of self<lb/>control.</p>

               <p>thought and action, it would be impaired—I have heard of the conversation that took place—I do not think that that exhibited any increased action or excitement—I think he went there calmly, but that the excitement grew up, in consequence of the conversation with his master—swimming in the head is not an unusual symptom with old age, but he has organic disease, besides the effect of old age—I believe there is ossification, disease of the arteries of the brain and heart—I should think that has been coming on for the last ten or fifteen years—those are not generally diseases of persons in perfectly sound mind—they are not necessarily incidental to persons in advanced age—some<lb/>times they come on in early life, but seldom in early life.</p>

I was in Princes-street, by the Bank, about four, o'clock—I felt some<lb/>thing in my pocket, and at the same time a gentleman behind me told me something—I turned, and saw the gentleman with the prisoner in his custody—he said, "This man has taken your purse"—I saw the purse lying in the street—I picked it up, and the prisoner was given into custody—I delivered the purse to the policeman—this is it—it contained 15.—it was in my coat-pocket not more than a minute before.</p>

I do not sleep on the premises, but many persons do—on Monday, the 25th of Sept., there were a quantity of Bandana silk handkerchiefs in the ware-house, and in another part of the premises some carpet-bags—there is a little court, which leads out of Carter-lane to the back of the premies—there are some iron rails and spikes at the corner, and adjoining these a water-spout which leads to the top of the house—if a person got by means of the spout to the top of the house, he could get to a window on the leads—I do not know whether that window was fastened inside or out<lb/>side—when I came to the house on Tuesday morning, the 26th of Sept., I missed twenty-five pieces of Bandana handkerchiefs from the warehouse—I know the patterns of them—I examined the premises at ten minutes to nine—I found some desks had been broken open in the counting-house, and vio<lb/>lence had been attempted at the door of the strong room, with instrumens—I have since seen ten pieces of Bandana handkerchiefs, which I believe to have been taken from the house—they do not bear any marks of our house—I can speak to the patterns of the whole of the handkerchiefs—I had handled them the night before the robbery—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—they were of this quality—I believe them to be the goods which were taken—I am a buyer of goods of this sort.</p>

                  </hi>. In Sept. last I was in the service of Reuben Barnett. About eight on Tuesday morning, the 26th of Sept., two young men came to my master's house, and stopped till my master came home at one—he had gone out at seven—he sleeps up stairs in the second pair back room—I sleep in the shop going over the front way—my master can leave the house, if he pleases, without my knowing it—he would not pass through the shop—my master knocked me up at seven o'clock that morning—the two men had some cakes and some gin at my master's—they staid till about four in the afternoon, when my master and they went away together—my master returned alone about six—one of the young men returned about eight that evening with a carpet bag like this, which appeared to be full and heavy—he staid about an hour, and left the bag and its contents behind him—my master and mistress went out with him—in about half an hour my master returned—he went in to count the handkerchiefs—I said, "The young man has left his bag behind"—my master said, "The bag belongs to me"—the handkerchiefs had been taken out in the parlour before the man went away, and piled on two chairs—Julia helped them to count them—there were twenty-nine pieces, and two single ones of different patterns—they made me carry them up stairs into the top room—on Thursday, the 28th of Sept., my master gave my mistress, the prisoner Julia, a piece of the handkerchiefs, and told her to pawn them at Mr. Barker's, in Houndsditch—that same day he sent me with a piece to White<lb/>chapel—he told me to give different names—I told him I would not—I gave my own name, and I think I gave his name—on that day he asked my mistress to pawn some more—she said she had her own business to attend to—she deals in second-hand clothes—on Friday I pawned one piece at Mr. Barker's, in Houndsditch, by direction of my master—I asked my master if the goods were got honestly—he called me a fool, and was very angry—on the Friday evening my master and I went out together—he sent me into one pawnbroker's; I do not know the name of the street—the gentleman would not take the article from me—I said my master sent me—my master wanted me to go and take another piece—I said I would never go any more—that was the pawn-shop at which my master was taken—I was outside, and spoke to my master—I went back to my mistress, by his direction—I told her my master was taken to the station—she instantly tied up eight pieces of hand<lb/>kerchiefs</p>

               <p>in a bundle, went with me, and told me where to leave them, in a coffee-shop in Harrow-alley, and deliver them to a man named Levy—my mis<lb/>tress waited outside till I came back—I did not go far in—I could not find Mr. Levy—I left the handkerchiefs on a form, in charge of the landlord, for Mr. Levy—before I took them, Levy had been in, talking to my mistress—I cannot say what passed—Levy deals in shoes and slippers from the country—on the Friday night my mistress gave me fifteen duplicates to burn—I asked why she could not burn them herself—she said, "You know I can't touch the fire on Friday night"—I burnt them—I said, "If I get into any trouble I shall speak the truth"—she told me, if I spoke anything against her or her hus<lb/>band, I should be killed by the Jews going through Houndsditch—I did not look at the duplicates before I burnt them—my master took the duplicates of the goods I pledged—on the Friday before my master was taken I saw him go out at seven in the morning, the back way, with five pieces—that is the way he could have gone out in the night, and I not know it—on the Saturday morning, when my master was examined, before I and my mistress were taken up, we were standing together in Guildhall-yard; my mistress told me not to say anything against her, and I should be sure to get away; and if I did get away, she would not mind making me a present of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I said no<lb/>thing against her—she said I should get killed if I was to say anything—she told me that several times—before I went to Guildhall-yard, when I was at the Compter, she told me that Mr. Levy had returned the eight pieces of handkerchiefs that I took for him, and said he would have nothing to do with them—I asked who had them now—she said a person named Ferguson—I asked where he lived—she said in Bell-lane, Whitechapel—I know him very well—he had been in the habit of visiting at our house—on the Monday morning my master told me to clean two pair of boots—I said, "Where do you go to in the night, that your boots are all over mud?"—he said, "Only to the coffee-shop"—I found his boots were muddy—I was taken before the Magistrate, and afterwards admitted as a witness.</p>

I heard of a raffle, and this pistol was brought to me, which I recog<lb/>nised as my master's—I know it well, and I have the companion pistol—the prisoner used occasionally to call at the shop in the evening, and assist in getting the goods in—being the son of a respectable man in the neigh<lb/>bourhood, I had no suspicion of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, and live in New North-street, Finsbury. In the morning of the 5th of Oct. I saw the prisoners and another in the neighbourhood of King William-street—I afterwards saw them at the corner of Pairs-chain, in St. Paul's church-yard—I then saw them all three, Stand<lb/>ing opposite the prosecutor's warehouse-door—they looked at me, then went back, and stood there again—there was a cart standing in front of the door, and I lost sight of them—shortly after, I saw Jacobs and the one not in cus<lb/>tody, turning down Paul's-chain—I then went up, and saw Jacobs carrying these goods—they turned down Little Carter-lane, up to a gateway, and there Richardson took off his coat, spread it out, and made a wrapper of it—Jacobs put the goods in it, and folded it up—the other stood looking out—Richard<lb/>son then went on to the end of Carter-lane—Jacobs followed him, and when they got to the end, Richardson seemed to be looking up and down, and made a sign to Jacobs to turn to the right—he went, and put the parcel in at a door<lb/>way in Old Change—Richardson then went in a different direction—he came back, went and spoke to Jacobs, who went away from the passage, and left Richardson at the doorway—Richardson took off the coat, put it on his back, a person then went up this passage, and Mr. Spear came out of his door—Richardson looked very hard at him—I was in a house below, and sent for a policeman, but could not get one—I went and told Mr. Spear, and begged permission to put the goods in his door-way—Richardson saw me take the goods out of the passage, and went down Distaff-lane—Mr. Spear and I turned another street, and saw Richardson and Jacobs walking together—we followed them to Gracechuruh-street, and gave them into custody—they were quite strangers to me.</p>

The prisoner came in May last to our house, as a nurse, to attend on my mother, who was then ill—when she had been in the house about three weeks, I left the house, and was away for a fortnight—when I came back, I missed fifteen drawings and three engravings of my father's, from a portfolio in the back parlour cupboard, and a handker<lb/>chief of my own—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—this fan belonged to my late mother.</p>

About eleven o'clock, on the 26th of Sept, I answered a knock at the door, and found the prisoner there—he said he came from the tailor's for a coat—I showed him into the parlour, and sent for Mr. Freeman, but he did not come—I then went to the parlour door and asked the prisoner if he came from Mr. Graves of Holborn—he said yes—believing he came from there, I went up stairs, brought this coat down, and gave it him—he went away, and in ten minutes my husband came in.</p>

At half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 21st of Oct., I was in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner standing against a package or small chest of tea—he was taking out the paper parcels in which the tea was enveloped—he apparently took out two or three at a time—he then moved from the chest, and stooped down—I afterwards saw a mat in which he placed the packages of tea—I passed him, and returned again—he was still there—I had not lost sight of him—he had no business to remove the tea from the chest—he was an extra labourer in the dock—before I returned the officer had taken him, and five packages of tea fell out of the mat, which was then examined, and three more packages of tea found in it—there is a Chinese mark on them—the chest was full of them, and on examin<lb/>ing it I missed eight—he said he knew nothing about them.</p>

"These are not rubbish, they are what belongs to the merchant"—I took the mats, and out fell five packages of tea—they were then examined, and out fell three more.</p>

               <p>Adland—I know Mr. Clark—he is a bookbinder—I ordered the paper to be made—it was made on the 26th—at that time I had a clerk named Hutton—he had been but six weeks with me—I told him to mind that these two reams of paper were sent that day by one of the porters—the porters take a delivery book with them, to have the purchaser's name attached to it, as a receipt—I ordered that the book was to be taken, and the signature obtained—I wrote in the delivery book, "Messrs. Clark and Bedford, August 26th, one ream of demy antique"—this was to be signed by the customer—I left the prisoner and Hutton at my house, about half-past two o'clock—about two hours after I returned, and soon after the prisoner came in—I asked him where he had been—he said, "I don't know whether you meant me to take the whole of that paper; I have taken two reams, one to Clark and Bedford's, and the other to Mr. Adland"—I said, "How came you to take it? I told you distinctly that one of the porters was to take it"—he said, "The clerk told me to take it"—I went to the room where the clerk was, and, in the pri<lb/>soner's presence, I said, "How came you to tell Moore to fake that paper?"—he said, "I did not, I told him I was sure you did not intend him to take if—I asked the prisoner about the book—I said, "Have you got a signature for it?"—he said, "No"—I then took up the book, and wrote in the entry—I said to Hutton, "Mind you get them signed for"—the prisoner said, "I will get them signed for"—some time after I was in the counting-house—I took up the book, looked, and saw the signature, "George Jones, to Mr. Adland"—I asked whose the signature to Clark and Bedford was—he said, "Mr. Bedford's"—I saw no more of the prisoner till he was in custody—then he said he did not deliver it, he had sold it—the signature here is "F.

I had no particular way of getting my living—I have seen William Watts at Mr. Newhouse's, a publisher, in Maiden-lane, Covent-garden—I did not know he was in the service of Messrs. Longman—I had seen George there—I did not know his name, or that he was the brother of William—on the 15th Sept., as I was passing the obelisk in Farringdon-street, George spoke to me—he said, "Good morning, will you <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> a pint of porter?"—I said, "I had no money"—he said, "Have you nothing to do?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Could you use a few books?"—I said, "I can't myself, I know a person who very likely would buy them"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "In Poppin's-court, next door to the green-grocer's"—I said, "I will call on you to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock"—I then went to a person named Saunders, in Wellington-place—on the 22nd Sept. I saw William Watts at Mr. Smalcomb's, in London-house-yard, St. Paul's Church-yard—he asked me to meet him at the Ship, in Little Bridge-street, at one o'clock—met William again that day on Ludgate-hill—he was on the opposite side of the way—he whistled—I went over to him—in consequence of what he said, I went the next morning to the Blue Last to meet him—when I got there William was not there, but George was sitting in front of the bar—I had seen</p>

               <p>nothing of him on that or the previous day, to lead me to suppose that he was coming to the Blue Last—he asked me to come into the tap-room—when we got in, he produced five books—he did not make any observation—I said I would take them to my friend, and asked him where I should see him to give him the money for them—while I was talking to him, William came in—he said, in George's presence, "Have you got the books?"—I said, "Yes, it is all right"—I showed them to William—there was no publishing price on three of them, so I asked him the price—he said I must inquire the price, I could easily ascertain it—I had had no directions from them at to the price I was to sell them—I appointed to meet William at twelve o'clock the same day, at the Blue Last, to give him the money—I left them—I went to the West End with the books to get the money—they were all new books—as I was going along I was taken into custody—the officer took them from me.</p>

On the 7th of Oct., about six o'clock in the evening, there were some hats outside the shop—I saw them fall—I was, picking them up—some one spoke to me, and I stopped the pri<lb/>soner three or four doors off—I pulled her cloak on one side, and found a pair of trowsers, which were safe not two minutes before.</p>

I watched Green by desire of Moore—he was standing at his master's stand—he turned, out, some damsons, and put them down, partly in his master's stand and partly in Wea<lb/>ver's brother's stand—he then spoke to Weaver—they talked together two or three minutes—after that Green went back to his work—Weaver followed him, and took the same damsons on his head to Duke's-court—he took the basket off his head, and put it into the passage, inside the door of No. 14—he came out with the empty basket—I saw Green taken, and heard Johnson ask him if he had authorized Weaver to take any damsons—he said no—he asked if he had authorized any one else—he made no reply—Johnson asked Weaver what became of those damsons he had taken up Bow-street—he said he had taken them to Green's house, by Green's direction—(Green lives at No. 16, and Wearer lives at No. 14)—I then went to No. 16, Duke's court, with Weaver—I heard him ask Green's wife where those damsons were that he took there a little while ago for John—she denied all knowledge of them—I am positive Weaver took them to No. 14—I stood in the court till he came out with the empty basket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Gabriel Hards, a fruit-salesman in Covent-garden market, and live in Basing-place, Lambeth. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of Oct. I was attending to my father's stall—Slaymaker was employed in the next stall—there was a sieve of damsons partly on my father's stall, and partly on the next—Slay<lb/>maker came and took up the sieve—Green was at our stall at the time, and I was at the stand outside the shop—Slaymaker put the sieve on his head, went towards Bow-street, and told Green if any one wanted him he should he back in ten minutes—I told Green I did not believe that sieve of damsons belonged to Bedell, which is the name Slaymaker goes by in the market—Green said, "O yes, it does, we have no damsons on that side"—I know we had damsons on that side—my father had permission to place his on that side—I have seen Green emptying them from there, by my father's desire—in a quarter of an hour Slaymaker returned—I asked him if he had not made a mistake in taking that sieve of damsons, as I had noticed that German sieve standing there for some time, and thought it was my father's—he said, "No, they were not, and as for German sieves, I can show you half a score down in the cellar"—the damsons are worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bushel—Weaver's stall was shut up at the time, and no business going on—the shutters were closed.</p>

In consequence of directions from the prosecutor, I went on Tuesday, the 14th of Oct., to a court leading into Golden-lane, where I could watch the entrance leading into the factory—I saw Fletcher standing at the corner of Arthur-street-leading to the prosecutor's factory—I pointed him out to Cole—he had no appearance of bulk about him—he went towards the factory—in three-quarters of an hour he came from the entrance of the court—there was no thoroughfare, so that he must have come from the factory—he had a bag nearly full—he passed me with it in Play-house-yard—I watched outside a public-house—he went in, and Redman followed George and Fletcher into the house—I had seen George three or four times before Fletcher went into the house—(I had first seen George com<lb/>ing from the prosecutor's residence in Banner-street, about 300 yards off—he went to the factory)—they staid in the public-house three or four minutes—Redman came out before them—George came towards me, and went towards the City, and I followed Fletcher with Redman—he turned round in Chis well-street, saw me, and went into a public-house—I followed, told him I belonged to the police, and wanted to know where he got this hair—he said, "I bought it in the Curtain-road"—I said, "How came you this way from the Curtain-road?"—he said, "Oh, this I bought in Smithfield"—I said, "Which way did you come?"—he said, "Through Long-lane and Barbican"—I asked if he had called anywhere—he at first said no—I asked if he did not call on some one in Golden-lane—he said, "Yes, I did"—I found this hair in the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist. At half-past five o'clock on the 14th of Oct., the prisoners came for a cigar—Keith put down a sovereign, and asked for change—I asked if they had got any change—they both said they had not—I took out my purse, put down a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, four, shillings, two fourpenny-pieces, and took two penny-pieces out of the till—I tried the sovereign; it was a good one, and heavy, a George and dragon one—I got a piece of paper, lit it, and handed it to Wheeler; and while he lighted his cigar, I took up the sovereign, and found it was a counterfeit, and very light—I went round, and accused them of making a mistake—they said, how dare I charge them?—I called my young woman, and she said it was a bad one—I desired her to fetch a policeman—I shot the door—Keith seized my hand and my throat—Wheeler said to him, "Give her the good one, or give me the change"—I heard a something rattling in Keith's mouth—I then found my breath nearly gone, and screamed "Mur<lb/>der"—I threw the counterfeit sovereign from me, and it was picked up, and found where I threw it—this is it—I marked it at the station.</p>

I am footman, in the service of Mr. Thomas Todd Mardon, of Wirapole-street, Cavendish-square—Christie has been butler then for ten years—he had the care of the plate—it had been put away for some time—in August last it was taken out, counted, found right, and given again into the care of Christie—he had the key of the boxes—Ri<lb/>chards has been in the habit of coming to my master's, to see Christie, and came sometimes when we had parties, with my master's knowledge. On the 6th of Oct., about half-past eleven, or a quarter to twelve o'clock in the day, as I went out on an errand, I passed the butler's pantry—Richards and Christie were in it—in about a quarter of an hour I returned, and met Richards at the corner of Wimpole-street, coming in a direction from the house—I went in, and saw Christie there—he went out soon after, and did not return any more—the next day a policeman came—the plate chest was opened, and a dozen table-spoons, and two dozen table-forks, were missed from it—in looking about afterwards, I found some duplicates—I gave them to the policeman—these are my master's spoons and forks, and have the family crest on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Smith, publican, Kinggate-street, Holborn—on the 12th of October I went into my bed-room, which is the front room, second floor, and put two sovereigns, a crown piece, two half-crowns, and seven shillings, into a drawer—there were two spoons and a watch of my husband's in it—I locked it—a tea-caddy was standing on the drawers—my watch was in the caddy—I left the room between twelve and one in the day, locked the door, and hung the key on a nail in the bar parlour—the pri<lb/>soners had been customers—as I was coming down stairs, I saw the prisoners and another man not in custody, in the bagatelle-room, which is on the first floor—they were standing by the board—one had the mace in his hand, and the other was sitting down—I had seen the third man there before in the prisoners' company two or three times—about half-past one the prisoners came from up stairs, and passed through the bar parlour, the bar, and the passage, and went out—they asked for some gin—I was at dinner, and my husband served them—they were all three together—they paid their reckon<lb/>ing and went away—I dined in the bar parlour, which commands a view of the bar—no one had been up after I came down—about four I went into my bed-room and found the drawer and tea-caddy broken open, and the money, watches, and spoons gone—the lock of the door was picked, but not injured in the least—it could not have been opened by my key, because I had it down stairs—there is no other way of going into the bagatelle-room, and to my bed-room, but through the bar parlour—I can undertake to say, that no one had</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this public-house. Between twelve and one o'clock this day, I saw the prisoners and another man at our house—I had seen them in company several times before—Pendleton and the other man came in company on this day—Martin came in soon after, and asked if his friends were there—he walked up stairs into the bagatelle room—my wife was up stairs in the bed room—before Martin came in Pendleton ordered a glass of gin and water—I went up stairs, and saw him and the other man there when I took it up—I came down stairs, and in the course of a minute Martin came in—I afterwards saw them altogether up stairs in the bagatelle room—I was not absent from the bar more than a minute, when I took up the gin and water—while I was gone I let the flap of my bar down, and shut the door, so that no one could have gone up stairs while I was there without my meeting them—no one was up stairs but my wife to my knowledge—she came down in ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—she came into the bar where I was—I did not leave the bar, except when I went up with the gin and water, unless my wife was there—I remember the pri<lb/>soner and the third man coming down stairs—they had something to drink at the bar, paid for what they had up stairs, and left—while we were at din<lb/>ner, no one came in to go up stairs, till the prisoners went away—if they had I must have seen them, as they must have passed through the bar and the bar parlour—no one went out after the prisoners—I went up stairs about four o'clock, with the key of the bed-room, which I took from the bar par<lb/>lour—I found the lock had been picked—the lock had not gone quite back—the drawer had been rifled, and the property in the tea-caddy was gone—the money that was gone was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Saturday night after, I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoners with several others—I ran to the officers who were before me, and Restieaux took Pendleton—Martin started off,</p>

               <p>I first saw them in the evening, they were going down the marshes, and a great many people with them, to see them fight—I followed—I tried to pre<lb/>vent their fighting in the morning, and so I did in the evening, but could not—my son was past my jurisdiction—he told me if he did not fight, he should be called a coward—he was turned twenty years of age—I saw them fighting, and saw my son get weak—Slennet said to Gilson, "Now is your time; give it him; follow him up"—after that, Gilson hit him on the side of the head, knocked him down, and fell on him—my son became stupid, and did not speak any more—he only groaned—he died at half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>

I was on duty in the Walworth-road, coming out of Union-court, leading into the main road, and saw the prosecutor and prisoners pass along nearly in a line together—King stepped into Union-court—I asked what he did there—he said, "I have not done anything"—about a minute afterwards I heard a fall on the pavement just outside the court—I stepped out, and saw the prosecu<lb/>tor lying on the pavement, and Trent leaning over him, with his left hand over his breast, and his right hand was drawing from his right-hand trowsers' pocket—the prosecutor said, "You have robbed me of my pocket-book and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I made a reach at Trent, and also at the female prisoner, who was standing about a yard from the prosecutor—Trent started off—I followed him, crying, "Stop thief," and sprang my rattle—he was stopped by a police<lb/>man</p>

                  </hi>. I am the only surviving son of the late Thomas Ghorst Tawney, and shall be forty-seven years old in December. My father had a vault in the chapel of St. John's, West-street, Walworth—he died in Nov. 1803—I was not present at the funeral, but I recollect his death, and the funeral going from the house—at that time I had an elder brother living, named Thomas—he died on the 1st of Jan. 1837—I have no reason to believe that the tomb had ever been opened for the purpose of interments, between the death of my father and that of my brother, who was also buried in that vault—my mother died on the 27th Oct. 1837, and was buried in the same vault in Nov.—I attended the obsequies of my brother and mother—a person named Ashley opened and closed the tomb at both those interments—on both those occasions my father's coffin was entire, the lead part was—the wood, the external case, had decayed—it was wood cased with lead—it was safe and entire, as to the leaden coffin, both in Jan. and Nov. 1837—there was no other coffin interred in the vault in the meantime—I believe my father built the vault himself—I am a solicitor, and carry on business in King-street, Cheapside—I live in Regent-square—on Monday, the 11th of Sept. last, I received information, in conse<lb/>quence of which I went, accompanied by Ashley, to the house of the elder Mr. Bridgman, on the same afternoon—the door was opened by a servant, and when I inquired for Mr. Bridgman, she asked my name, which I gave—I saw Mrs. Bridgman—the public entrance to the chapel-yard is through the chapel—the coffins are taken that way into the burial-ground—there is no opening to go into the chapel-yard round the chapel—the only entrance is through the body of the chapel—Mr. Bridgman's house adjoins the chapel—Mr. Courtnall's is on one side, and Mr. Genet's on the other—I did not make known my business to Mrs. Bridgman—I sent my name in, and she said Mr. Bridgman would be there shortly—I saw Mr. Bridgman—I told him I came there for the purpose of opening my family vault, as I wished to see what it contained, and I had the bricklayers at the door for the purpose of opening it—he said nothing—I said, "I have the bricklayers here, I will let them in," and I walked into the passage, and opened the street-door, to let them in—it is a very small house—the parlour-door and street-door were close together—Mr. Bridgman said nothing to me—I walked towards the back part of the house, wishing to go through that way, from information I had obtained that there was a passage through the kitchen—Mrs. Bridgman met me at the door of the kitchen, and told me I could not go that way—I cannot say whe<lb/>ther Mr. Bridgman was present—she showed me another way, through a little door by the front parlour-window, which led into the chapel, and from the chapel into the chapel-yard—I went through the chapel into the burial-ground, and went to the tomb of my late father, I saw that the large stone at the top had evidenly been removed, and the brick work damaged—the bricklayer's men re<lb/>moved the stone quite off the top of the tomb—I then observed that my mo<lb/>ther's</p>

               <p>coffin was turned on its side, on to my brother's, and my father's coffin was gone—that is the leaden coffin which I had observed safe in Nov. 1837—there were some pieces of wood lying at the bottom of the tomb, and a patch of hair about the size of my hand—that did not call my particular attention at that time—on the side of my mother's coffin, was a large patch of tallow, at if a candle had been stuck there and guttered—I desired to have my mother's coffin put on its bottom, that I might read the coffin plate on the top of it, and my brother's—the men had a great deal of difficulty in removing it, and talked of taking away the brick-work, but after looking between the lid of my mother's coffin they found this bed-winch jammed in between the lid of mother's coffin and the tomb, so as to make it fast—they could not move it—it has been in my possession ever since—after removing that, they put my mother's coffin flat on its bottom, on to my brother's coffin, not in the place where my father's had been—I directly went through the chapel into Mr. Bridgman's house, I should think that was not exceeding ten minutes after I first saw Mr. Bridgman—I saw the servant, but he was denied to me—I then required to see Mrs. Bridgman, and Mr. John Bridgman, but did not see them—in consequence of what the girl told me with reference to Mr. John Bridg<lb/>man, I inquired for the hospital to which I supposed he was gone—I have since ascertained that he was at that time studying for the purpose of becom<lb/>ing a surgeon—I did not see him, or any of the family before I left the house that afternoon—after this, I consulted Mr. Clarkson on the subject, in consequence of which, on Saturday the 16th, I went to Union Hall, and applied for a warrant with reference to the younger defendant—I tbink no warrant was granted at that time—the elder defendant was summoned—he attended, and engaged to produce his son, who he represented to be away on the 27th—he did not appear on the 27th—on the 19th of Sept., I wrote a let<lb/>ter to Mr. Bridgman, and received an answer—in consequence of further in<lb/>formation, on the 21st, I applied for a search warrant, and proceeded with it and Pritchard to the chapel-yard in question—I observed a spot which denoted that the earth had been recently removed—by my direction the earth was re<lb/>moved from that spot, and within five or six inches of the surface, a wooden coffin cased with lead was discovered—that was fifteen yards from the defen<lb/>dant's back premises—there was no lid to it—there appeared to have been one—the nail holes were perceptible at the side where the lid had been made fast—it was filled with loose earth, and some bones—the officers emptied it, and took it out, and it was left for some days in the chapel-yard in the custody of the police, day and night—after some days, the fragments of wood that I had seen in the tomb, on the 11th, were applied to the coffin, and it formed the entire wooden lid—it had been broken to pieces, and a hole knocked in the middle at the widest part, and when the whole was put together it fitted exactly, might have been nailed on through the old nail holes—I think the coffin was found on Wednesday the 21st, and it occurred to me on Saturday the 24th to do this—I made an appointment with the police on the Monday, to have the tomb fresh opened, and was obliged to have the bricklayers again to re<lb/>move the stones—every possible search was made to find the lead belonging to the lid, but we could not find it—there was a little fir tree which appeared to have been recently planted a few feet from where the coffin was found—we searched there, and everywhere else where we saw any earth recently removed, but did not find the lead—we found bones, and skulls in different parts—close to the head of my father's coffin, we found three skulls, and in an<lb/>other spot quite close to the loose earth we found another skull—the part where the coffin was found, was in a little border to the left of a gravel walk that leads from the back of Mr. Bridgman's premises up to the stable—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230207"/>
               <p>not a place that appeared at all used for burial—in searching for the leaden lid, there was a tombstone raised on brick-work, which had evidently been pulled out—it was all loose—the bricklayers put their hands in, and pulled out three coffin plates—that was not my father's tomb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Messrs. Richards and Co.'s linen factory, in Bread-street, Cheapside, and am the son of Mrs. Courtnall; at the time in question I resided with her and my step-father, next door to Mr. Bridgman's, in West-street, Walworth. On Wednesday night, the 6th of Sept., I went to bed about eleven o'clock—I slept on the second floor, at the back of the house, which overlooks the chapel-yard in question—I put out my candle and drew up my blind, and on doing so, I fancied I saw some<lb/>thing moving in the burial-ground—it immediately attracted my attention—I looked again, and in about five minutes' time I observed three men coming from the direction of the wall that separates the burial-ground from our garden, and go in the direction of Mr. Tawney's tomb—that was in the direction they would have come from Mr. Bridgman's house, without going through the chapel—I did not at that time know whose tomb it was—one of the persons appeared to have nothing on but a shirt, and a cloak over it—one of the others had a cloak, and the other, as far as I could see, was dressed in plain black clothes—I did not see the tomb opened—I observed that it was open—the stone that had been on it was removed to the side—I saw one of the men, I believe the undressed one with the cloak on, descend into the tomb, and saw something handed from the tomb—I also saw it carried away by two of them, one carrying it at each end—they appeared to carry it with great difficulty—I saw some ropes—I could not distinguish whether or not it was lifted up by those ropes—there was perhaps not sufficient light for me to dis<lb/>cern whether what was taken out was a coffin, but I made the remark at the time that it was a coffin—it made that impression on me at the time—the third man then got out of the tomb—the other two carried the coffin in the direction of the wall from where I first saw them come—that is in a direct line with Mr. Bridgman's passage—after they got to a certain extent under the wall I could not see them, from the position of my window—it would lead them towards the house—(before I saw the coffin taken from the tomb, I had given an alarm to my father and mother)—the men afterwards returned from the wall where they appeared to have deposited what they took away, and all three returned to the tomb again—I then saw a lantern—it appeared to be brought from Mr. Bridgman's stable, which is in the burial-ground—one of them descended into the tomb with the lantern, the other two remained about the tomb—after the space of about ten minutes, I observed the party come out of the tomb again—I saw nothing more of the light after it was taken into the tomb—I saw a man bring a lever, or long wooden pole, from the direction of the stable, and replace the stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you, in the course of this time, an opportunity of observing any one of the three persons, so as to enable you to speak to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only from his general appearance and action—I could not see his face, on account of the distance—I have known young Bridgman for a long time—I believe him to have been one of the three, the one that was undressed and had the cloak on—I could scarcely see whether he had shoes and stockings on—the wind blew about his cloak, when he had the lantern, which gave me an op<lb/>portunity of seeing his person and appearance, and that assisted me in coming to the belief that it was young Bridgman—I had not seen him wear a cloak at any time that I remember.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On Wednesday night, the 6th of Sept., my attention was called to what took place in the chapel-yard next to our house—I saw three men engaged at the tomb—one of them was undressed, and had a cloak on—the other two, I think, were in black—two had cloaks on—I saw the dog in the ground, it was quiet—I saw the horse come out of the stable—on Monday, the 18th of Sept., from ten till one o'clock in the day, I was at our back window, and saw the elder defeudant at the wall of his ground, which separates our two houses—it was formerly a garden, but is now part of the chapel-yard—he seemed to be gardening, mak<lb/>ing a border—I am not sure whether I saw a spade—he bad no coat on—I cannot say for certain that he was digging, as my husband was gardening at the time, and it might have been his spade that I heard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mr. Courtnall. About a fortnight before the 6th of Sept. last, I was walking in the garden, and heard Mr. Bridgman, senior, saying that some men had been seen in the burial-ground the night before—I do not know who he said it to—on the night of the 6th my attention was called to what was going on—I slept in the same room with Priscilla Terry, the servant—on the night alter I saw a man come out of Mr. Bridgman's house, and saw my brother follow him—shortly after, I was looking out of our second-floor window, which is even with Mr. Bridgman's second floor, and saw a female in her night-dress, looking out of the window—I am not able to say it was Mrs. Bridgman, but I think it was—at the same time I thought I saw a man with a hat on, looking out of the other window—I do not speak with any positiveness about that—that is their bedroom—I heard somebody talking in Mr. Bridgman's first floor, and heard some one say, "As long as my name is Bridgman"—it was a roan's voice—I thought I heard the voices of two men—I know the elder Mr. Bridgman's voice, and I thought it was his voice—I do not attend his chapel—on the following morning, about nine o'clock, or between nine and ten, I saw Mr. Bridgman's horse and chaise at the door; and between ten and twelve that same morning I saw Mr. Bridgman coming out of the chapel in West-street—he passed me—I saw his face distinctly—I was at home about ten o'clock in the evening, while my brother was watching, I saw the two men at the tomb, but could not distinguish young Bridgman—I saw my brother go out after one of them.</p>

A lodger of ours had a dog, which used to disturb us by constantly barking—I heard from a lady at No. 17, that some persons had been seen in the burial-ground, and remember my husband stating that to Mr. Bridgman, who replied, that he did not think any one came after the bodies in the ground—he made some scriptural allusion, and said if the spirits were at rest, it did not so much signify about the bodies—I do not recollect the exact words, but he said if my husband thought so, he would have a watch in the yard—my husband said, no, he did not think it was required—Mr. Bridg<lb/>man said he did not know that any persons had come there for a very long time, once there was a case of some persons being taken up, and he had to appear against them—about a fortnight or three weeks before this tomb was disturbed, young Bridgman borrowed the lodger's dog—he said his father's horse shyed at dogs, and he wanted to make it used to dogs—I think he had a little fancy dog of his own at that time—he returned the lodger's dog in about a week.</p>

I was in Coalharbour-lane on the 7th of August—I saw Haines with this rule, and I took him into custody by Mr. Cooper's direction—I afterwards saw Byfield, and took him—I took both the prisoners to the station—I was at the police-office afterwards—the Magistrate said Mr. Cooper might take his rule.</p>
