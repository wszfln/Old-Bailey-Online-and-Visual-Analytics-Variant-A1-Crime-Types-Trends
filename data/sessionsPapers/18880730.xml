I am a member of Trinity College, and live at Oxford—I have known the prisoner four years or a little longer—I knew him in January, 1888 as at the address, 57, Bishopsgate Street—I had had previous transaction with him—on January 2nd I received this letter from him, containing a statement that a friend of his had lately returned from visiting the Consolidated Esmeralda Gold Mine, and had advised him to buy shares—I believed he had bought and had them, and that he could supply me with 50 shares at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to cover charges an stamps an everything—I got no bought or sold note—I sent four or five days after a cheque, which has been paid and returned in the usual way—I should not have parted with my cheque had I known that the prisoner possessed none of these Consolidated Esmeralda shares; I should have waited till I knew he had bought them—a bill of his for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was current—I had this letter of 17th January in the course of post; it said he had booked 100 for me, and hoped they would be a good thing—that was after I had bought the 50—I did not accept that offer; I said nothing about it—I wanted no more than the 50—on 20th January I received this letter saying I would find the bill of no good if it were not presented—I consented to renew the bill for a month—I never received any money for it—I had no idea I was not the owner of 50 shares; it was much later that I found that out—I did not apply to him to transfer the 50 shares to me; I wished him to hold them for a time without any special arrangement that they should be transferred to me—I believed he had them—I mentioned the matter to Mr. Holland, my solicitor—it was after the oral examination</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made no demand for the shares to be transferred to me at all—the bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for money I lent him; that was in February, I think—I kept the bill, and took proceedings upon it—I have known the prisoner about four years, or rather less; I don't think it could be more—I knew he was a stock and share dealer—I have had no other dealings with professed stock and share dealers in such a way as this—I have had time bargains, where the actual stock was not taken up by me, but I paid or took the difference on account day—I have not had time bargains with the prisoner, but a genuine transfer of shares in mines and other companies—I believed the prisoner had these shares, and was ready to dispose of them—I have since heard that it is very often customary for outside brokers not to buy till they get an order from the client; I did not know it at the time—I should have left it to his judgment and discretion to sell these shares, knowing nothing about the mine—he told me shortly after the 2nd that the price of the shares had slightly risen—that would be quite a week or more after; and he advised me to hold on for a longer period—it may have been more than a week after I sent him the cheque; I cannot be sure of that; it was a verbal communication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I understood from his letter that he had been advised to buy Alturas, and had not bought them—I understood he had bought the Consolidated Esmeraldas, and sent off my cheque in consequence of that statement—I am under the impression that he twice told me not to sell them, as they had risen; I can swear to once; it was at the end of January or beginning of February.</p>

My complaint is that the prisoner had not got the shares—I did not understand it was a time bargain—I did not intend to take the transfer at the time; I thought he would hold them; I trusted to him as a broker to act at discretion—I intended to sell if the market rose; I thought he had the shares, and would manage the business for me—my complaint is that he got the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because he said he had got the shares—if he had said he was able to buy shares for me I should not have sent him the money; I should have waited till I knew he had bought them—I was very ignorant then that thousands of time bargains are made where there is no transfer of stock—the time bargains I had had before were of a different kind—I never had the shares, nor was my money returned—it never struck me as a speculative bargain in which I never intended to have the shares—I was deceived by his representations—I should not have sent the money if he had said he had not actually got the shares—I considered he held them—I should not have offered them to anybody else, unless I had had them transferred to me—I thought a time bargain meant running to a particular date mentioned—I don't know if the prisoner had become liable for the shares because he had bought them in the market, although he had not received the to transfer of them—I took it he had got the shares; he said "I have secured them, and you shall have some"—I inferred from those statements he had them—the other transactions I had had with him were genuine.</p>

I am a solicitor in partnership with Mr. Sanderson, at 46, Queen Victoria Street—I have been acting for the prosecutor—about 8th May the prisoner called at my office—I had then in my possession a letter from the prosecutor, an extract of which I read to the prisoner; it was to this effect: "The question is what had become of the Esmeralda shares. I sent him a cheque for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The question is did he buy them, or did he pocket the money," the prosecutor added it must be inquired into at once—the prisoner gave me to understand that Mr. Gerome had not paid for the shares, and, therefore, was not entitled to them; at that time I had not looked into the matter, and did not know the exact facts; I did not know a specific cheque for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been given—I won't say he said he had not been paid, that was the impression he gave me—I produce under the Seal of the High Court the examination of the prisoner in the matter of Gerome and Bartlett. (<hi rend="italic">In this examination before Mr. Earl, the prisoner gave particulars of his pecuniary affairs, and said he held shares in various companies, among which the Esmeralda Company was not included.</hi>) I was present at the examination, the prisoner said he had no Consolidated Esmeralda shares—I never got anything on the other matters.</p>

I am a solicitor, the defendant has been in my employ six or seven months as outdoor clerk—his particular duty is to serve process—I do not get to my office at 8 in the morning—I have known him 17 or 18 years, and have employed him off and on before; I should say his character is extremely good, I have always found it so; he is very regular, methodical, and truthful in his business—I know of his having been with Garibaldi—I spoke to Mardell with reference to the debt being due just before he took proceedings—I never saw him before or knew anything about him before process—the money was advanced by Mr. Adams, and Kingshott took over the business from him; he was not a money-lender—made out the action in this matter myself, and Whitehead made a copy of it, and I sent him to issue it, which he did, and brought it back to me—on the 24th he was at the office when I got there—it was customary for him to enter all these things in a book, which I produce, it is entirely in his writing—the only entry on the 23rd is the name and address of Mardell—he made this entry in the morning in my presence, be reported to me what he had done—on the 24th he reported that he had been again, and that the defendant was not in, and that he had served the document in the envelope I had addressed, and left it with a woman in Mardell's house—on the 25th he reported to me that he went on the evening of the 24th, that he called again on the 25th early in the morning, that he saw the same woman and asked her if she had handed the envelope to Mr. Mardell, that she said no, he asked why, and got no answer, that the hall-door was open, and as this conversation was taking place the woman said "Oh, here is Mr. Mardell coming up the street," on which he said "Give me back the envelope I left yesterday," that the woman went somewhere to the back, handed him the envelope, and as he was walking out to meet Mr. Mardell he met him, or the man represented as Mardell, and gave it to him; he said it was somewhere between half-past 7 and 8—these gentry are very difficult to get at—I asked him as to the appearance of the house, I always do—he described it as one of those run in urbe, all bearing the names of trees, but the trees not being there; that it had a bay window with an India-rubber plant in it, and that it was an unmade road; I asked him about the rental of the house, he said he supposed about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. Hopkins and Mardell called on me on 12th May—they did not come into the office, the conversation took place in the passage, I went out first—I suspected who Mardell was because Whitehead had given me such a good description of him on the 24th, he described him as a middle height man with a darkish wiry beard, a bloated face, and a lot of pimples on his forehead—Mr. Hopkins told me what he came about; I threw the door open and said to White head "Do you know this man?" he said "Certainly, that is Mr.Mardell, that I served at Bowes Park"—he said he had served the</p>

               <p>process with a woman in the house—that was how the word "servant" came in, it was I who mentioned with regard to the servant—Whitehead never used the word "servant"—all I said was "Do you know this man?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not point to Mardell, I made a sort of motion—Whitehead had told me that Mardell had been pointed out to him by a woman, not that the service had taken place in her presence—Whitehead at this time was living in Southwark—he said he had served the process between half-past 7 and 8—I saw him make the entries in this book—this was one of a batch of actions in the Mayor's Court, in which Kingshott was plaintiff—I think there were five actions—Whitehead made an affidavit of service in each case, about the same time—Smith was one of the defendants—I always ask Whitehead all particulars as to residence and locality—he described the woman he saw as a well-developed woman, who said that Mr. Mardell was not in—he said he saw the same woman on each occasion, but he was not sure he could identify her in her out<lb/>door attire—I asked him "Do you think she was a servant?" and he said "I really don't know."</p>

               <p>proprietor, of 20, Kean's Yard, Highbury, the prisoner drove cabs for him—on 29th June the prisoner showed me a bad half sovereign, and said "I picked it up in the yard when I was out of work and I thought my luck was in, "Isaid "Give it to me, and I will put it on that cab and make <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> a fool"—<hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> is the young master, and the cab was opposite the door—he showed me the same coin again about 3rd July, and told me the same thing—he took it out of his trousers pocket among the silver that he was going to pay the cab hire with—he gave it into my hand and I asked him to let me put it on the cab, he said "No, I shall make use of that another night," and put it back into his trousers pocket with other money—he said that when he picked it up he thought it was not a half sovereign, and he thought his luck was in—he pays his cab hire to me every morning, he paid me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the morning of 15th July—he is not a night cabman, he is a long day man—he paid me with eleven shillings and three penny pieces, that was about 2.30 on Sunday morning, that was the close of the hire.</p>

I am cook to Mr. Samuel Sturgess, of 38, Brunswick Gardens, Kensington—on the evening of 26th July I went to bed at 11 o'clock—all the doors and windows were fast, especially the window of the smoking-room, in the basement near the window was a table close under the window, upon which were six pairs of boots belonging to my master—anybody putting a hand through the window could reach them—there are upright bars outside the window, I came down at halt-past 7 o'clock in the morning—I found the window of the smoking-room open and the boots gone, these three pairs of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of those I missed—one of the bars had been tampered with.</p>

I know nothing about this job," and in answer to the charge he said, "We did not go inside the house, we took the boots from outside"—about half-past 4 that morning I was on duty in Bangor Street, I saw the three prisoners together in St. Clement's Road—they went into a common lodging-house, No. 12, Bangor Street, about half a mile from the prosecutor's house, where I lost sight of them—I did not see them again till they were arrested, one of them appeared to be carrying something under his arm, it was not large enough to hold six pairs of boots—I know the three prisoners very well.</p>

I live at 1, Letherstone Road, Fulham—I am a clerk at present in employ—I was in the defendant's employ on two occasions—on the first he was trading as Smith and Co., 42, Essex Street, Strand—I left that employ in September, 1887—I re-entered his employ three weeks or a month afterwards; he was then trading as Blackie and Co., 1, Denman Street, London Bridge—I left finally in April, 1887—my wages were then about 13 weeks in arrear, at the rate of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; that would be 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in order to obtain that I placed the matter in the hands of Mr. Gedge—on 2nd March I saw Mr. Gedge, who showed me this letter, which is in the defendant's handwriting.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807300028"/>
               <p>I was 14 years and 3 months old—I came to London in February, 1874, and went into the employ of John Maple and Co., of Tottenham Court Road—I was in uninterrupted situations down to my marriage in July, 1877—the person I married was a widow, who had a milk business—I took a part in the conduct of that business—I introduced the glass trade into London; that was at 3, Southampton Buildings—I personally worked in the business—I made the welkin ring by verbal advertisements—I attended in the shop—I went round with the milk to customers with the yoke on my shoulders—I was separated from my wife in September, 1884—since that I have been earning my livelihood by the milk business—I am a Liberal in politics—that party protested against the prison policy of Her Majesty's Government, and in 1887 I took a strong view on these subjects, and in May, upon the anniversary of Her Majesty's birthday, being then and now a member of the Holborn Liberal and Radical Association, I inaugurated a mass meeting on Mount Pleasant, Clerkenwell, and in August we commenced mass meetings in Hyde Park on Sunday afternoons, up to 23rd October—Mr. Dadeboy Naroji, a Parsee gentleman, was introduced to me by Dr. Gould president of the Holborn Association—he contributed money and speech—the Rev. Stewart Headlam, Mr. Beal, and others were associated with me—Mr. Teage, barrister-at-law, was treasurer of the Association—this was developed into the Anti Coertion Committee—money was collected from the masses at the meetings, and was sent to the Metropolitan Radical Federation—Mr. Loban was acting as chairman and treasurer of the meetings—the money was used for the objects I was working for—it was proposed that delegates should be sent to Ireland, merely to imitate the big Liberal leaders, a resolution was carried to that effect, and they gave me the wings to fly to Ireland—it was proposed that I should be the first delegate—I believe Loban was in the chair every Sunday; I believe I collected the bulk of the money in my hat—an account of the money collected was announced at each meeting; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the largest amount realised—Loban took the money and held it for the public—Mr. Wilfred Blunt was arrested on the 23rd October, and I started on 25th October—I addressed meetings in Ireland—I resided one evening at the Imperial Hotel, Dublin, the 12th November, and during the 18 days I was in Ireland I spoke at Drogheda, Louth, and other places—the total amount collected during eight weeks was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd., and I had 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself—it cost me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during the eight weeks for travelling, correspondence, &amp;c.—Mr. Loban handed me statements of the sums collected, and the defendants have them—the amount was announced at a subsequent meeting; that was the only mode in which it was accounted; no other account could be made—I was arrested on the evening of 12th November—I was convicted of holding an unlawful meeting—I was sentenced to one month's hard labour, which I did in three gaols, Ennis, Limerick, and Tullamore, on account of the popular enthusiasm—I am none the worse for it—I was released on 15th December, and returned home on the 17th—I immediately went to Loban's address, 9, Harper Street, Theobald's Road, and had a conversation with him, and next day held a meeting, and raised about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the day of the funeral of one of the Trafalgar Square victims—the meetings were held on the same plan as before, and on 8th or 9th January the Anti-Coercion Home Rule Association was formed at 9, Harper Street, with Loban as chairman,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807300029"/>
               <p>and bills were issued—there were about a dozen or 15 members—Mr. Naroji and the Rev. Stewart Headlam were elected on the committee—the majority of the members were working men—public announcements were made at these mass meetings with regard to the organisation of this body—Loban was named as chairman and a Mr. Smith as treasurer—I believe he attended the majority of the meetings, and Loban continued to take the chair at the public meetings until he was practically expelled on 9th February—we found him guilty of being in a state of drunkenness in Hyde Park—then Mr. Headlam was elected chairman, after going through the accounts, and he publicly stated every Sunday what he bad in hand—from 8th January to 19th February Mr. Smith acted as treasurer? and he held what was collected after 8th January—at the executive committee meetings the meetings were arranged and who should speak at them, and carrying on the correspondence with the executive of the Irish National League—the delegates were selected at those meetings, but they were elected publicly at the mass meetings—the committee agreed on certain terms, which were to be accepted by each nominee—one of the terms was that he should go at once and give up any work he might have—that was put to Lloyd in my presence, I offered that to the public in the first instance and it was accepted—Lloyd was sent on 2nd February, and he received 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his expenses—after that Snelling was sent on hearing of Lloyd's arrest—the mass meetings have continued up to last Sunday, and the collections have continued—the Rev. Mr. Moll, as an outside spectator, has checked them; before that they were audited by Mr.Headlam—the books of the committee were accessible every day—I purchased this copy of the <hi rend="italic">St. Stephen's Review</hi> at 21, John Street, Adelphi, the publishing office—it is dated 24th March, 1888—I have never derived any profit from this or any other political agitation—I did part of the work of the Liberals at the last election—I did not receive a farthing for it—I am not correctly described as "a plunderer of the poor"—I have not called these meetings for my own profit, or appropriated any of the subscriptions—up to the date of the libel of necessary expenses of the meetings expense of the <hi rend="italic">'buese</hi> from all parts to Hyde Park; that would amount perhaps to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—then there were banners, and sometimes a band—I have spoken at Hyde Park every Sunday in this year—the name of the Committee has never been changed—I don't think I ever told a lie—I have not paraded every suburban thoroughfare compelling ladies to give us pence—since April the masses have allowed us to appropriate the funds towards the sustenance of this prosecution—I have never been chairman or trustee; I have been merely a democrat, trying to do my duty—it is dastardly false to say that I fell out with hard work some years ago or that I have been supported by my wife in <hi rend="italic">boosy</hi> idleness—for seven years I was a teetotaller; I have been merely a democrat, trying to do my since this libel, I have been advised by the Queen Square Hospital to drink stout, in order that my leather lungs might be sustained by Guinness's Dublin stout—I have not provided myself with many luxuries; I am just outside the workhouse—I am only here in a suit of clothes lent to me.</p>

               <p>go to Ireland instead of working at my business—my wife had a milk business, and I developed it six-fold in about six weeks—I do not carry it on now—I carried it on for seven years until I left the premises in 1884—I sold a great deal of it, and went to another neighbourhood—I am managing a business now at 177, High Holborn; I am paid by the results, and have contracted with the actual proprietor that the place shall produce a sufficient profit not to cost him a farthing; it is a milk shop, registered under the Metropolitan Act, under the name of Neale Corbett—I realised a living by it up to the time of going to Ireland, since then I have been taking a great part in public work; election work and public speaking, committee meetings, and so forth—the committee meetings, as a rule, are held on Saturday evenings, and on Tuesday for the last three or four months—sometimes my speechifying is on a Monday evening; if I knew that you or any other Gladstonian would be at Deptford, I should go there, with a view of converting them; these Gladstonians are very weak-kneed—I use that as a term of reproach; I am an ultra-Gladstonian, not a sham one, the others are sham Gladstonians, bogus Gladstonians—I apply those terms to them as the <hi rend="italic">St. Stephen's Review</hi> does to me, but I don't say that they reap any money by it—when I found my work was very slack of an evening, I thought, instead of going to places of amusement, I would go and do my duty as a politician—I believe since February the Deptlbrd committee have held their meetings on Tuesday evenings, at the place I lived at, in the room adjoining my shop—I keep one person in my shop—Mr. Loban was my fellow member of the Holborn Liberal and Radical Association, and you also, and he was a member of the Home Rule Anti-Coeicionists Society—it was not affiliated with any other London association; we are only four or five months old as an organisation—an association must have had sufficient length of existence to be affiliated, it is for experts to judge what length—Loban had to be dismissed, he was drunk about 7th February; that was an unusual occurrence in public—I have seen him the worse for drink once or twice—he was a member of the Holborn Liberal and Radical Association, of which you were vice-president—Dr. Gould, your colleague, introduced him to me—I do not belong to the Holborn Liberal and Radical Club, that was started when I was in Ireland—I applied, they refused because they were afraid I should come in with Loban—I found while I was away that Dr. Gould and he had a personal quarrel—I had a gold watch and chain, not a purse of sovereigns, presented to me the day after the date of the libel, I believe the testimonial was being prepared in January and February, and it happened to fit in as an answer to the libel—I presume the watch and chain were subscribed for before—since this prosecution was instituted, I have heard various things of Loban—I only heard during this prosecution, and from those who profess to be his friends, that he had been in prison—Dr. Gould, the Gladstonian candidate, introduced him to me in December, 1886—some say he was in prison for two or three months, some for two or three weeks—I have no idea what it was for—I did not inquire, I had done with him on 9th February—I heard he had been convicted in a criminal court for some offence against honesty, I should say several years ago—Loban never lived with me—from 8th or 9th January to 24th March I wished to remove the impression from your mind that I was never a delegate of the Anti-Coercionist Home Rule Committee—I was not appointed by any public meeting or organisation prior</p>

               <p>to 9th January—I should think, up to 24th March, the executive and general committees taken together were about 30 strong, all told—I entertain very strong political views—I don't think I use rather strong political language; I am not what you call a violent speaker—those that libel me I am in the habit of calling "vile miscreants" in public—I don't think "contemptible liars" is my phrase—it a man was a liar he would be a vile miscreant—I don't think I used the term "plunderers of the poor," as applied to the Duke of Westminster—I call the Irish land lords that—I have used the term" ruffians "for them—it has been my habit to say that some Irish absentee landlords live in luxurious idleness on a good deal of what the poor ought to have, and that they are found in luxuries and follies by those who don't assert their own rights, by the rack rents—I took these proceedings to clear my character, and to punish the offenders—it was the Rev. John Clark who suggested criminal proceedings—I said at a Hyde Park meeting lately that I wanted the nine creatures to stand at the bar of the Old Bailey—that was not my main object in adopting this form of prosecution, it was to clear my character and punish them for their criminal offence—I said I wanted to send these people to gaol unless they made an adequate apology and paid the costs of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOWEN ROWLANDS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here said, in reply to</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COSTELLO</hi>, <hi rend="italic">that he was willing now to offer an expression of regret, and to say that it was never intended to charge any offence of a criminal character against the prosecutor.</hi>) The course of this prosecution has driven me to the workhouse—if the costs of the prosecution were paid I would propose, after deducting for my loss of time and my solicitor's bill, to hand them over to the people who subscribed—the people in the mass meetings know me—I summoned somebody for biting me at one of Mr. Richard Chamberlain's meetings—that summons was dismissed; I was bitten in the dark and could not identify the Brummagem biter—I went to Ireland and to 43, O'Connell Street—I was directed to the Imperial Hotel and slept there one night; I dined there the last evening I was there in company with various of your Gladstonians—since the practical expulsion of Loban the committee meetings of the organisation have been held at my house—Lloyd lived there from about l✗the or 12th April to after the libel—I went to Ireland to help with reference to protestations against evictions—I did not take all the furniture away from my own tenant and make him and his child sleep on the floor, not in the way you put it—my tenant owed me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I seized his goods when he told me he would not pay me, and dared me to do my right. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at the same time owe your landlord 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was altogether between us, a dispute between us—I paid him beforehand, I would not pay him twice—my tenant said he would not pay me because of a dispute between me and my landlord—my tenant had not a counter claim against me, and never said he had; I had against my landlord—he was a cripple as regards a physical development, but he was an expert master tailor—Loban, as my agent, employed a broker for me to evict this man—before I went to Ireland I went round with the hat and called out the amount of the collection—there were two or three collections before I went—a man would take the hat round, but never touch the coins; he would have the eyes of the public on him; he would come to the platform, and in a promiscuous manner dash the coins on a newspaper, with the eyes of the public still on him I hope—then it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807300032"/>
               <p>given to the treasurer, and the amount would probably be announced to the meeting and entered in a book—the Rev. Stewart Headlam audited the accounts when the society was only a month old; he had warrants for payment; slips of paper with the amount of the collections and the chairman's signature, and that would be copied into the minute and treasurer's book, and then the auditor would see the warrants and the minute book—supposing I wanted to go to Stoke Newington, the treasurer would pay me 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my fare, and take my receipt for it—there could not be any voucher as to receipts at a mass meeting; if you went round with a hospital box it would be the same—Rev. Stewart Headlam's auditing was adding up and a surveyal of all that was before—he signed this balance-sheet, it is a summary; he would necessarily peruse various vouchers—I heard the treasurer examined last time; he did not say the vouchers were at home and were not produced to Rev. Stewart Headlam—his name is Smith; I attended with Hammer—I got no more money in Ireland, certain Irish friends kept me after my 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been spent, but I had no public collection—my contract was that I was to exercise my birthright of free speech for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 14 days, and I travelled about 100 miles every day; I was to keep on doing it till I was cleared—I believe Lloyd gave up his work on the Saturday before going to Ireland on the Tuesday—Loban is an accountant, land agent, house agent, &amp;c., &amp;c., too numerous to mention—I believe Lloyd was what you call an unskilled labourer; he would earn about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as a casement maker, or something of that kind; on account of this libel he was unable to obtain any work—I am at work now, but I don't earn enough to live on without the assistance of my friends, through this libel—the milk business had not gone to pieces before the libel—I have fallen into a state of insolvency through litigation with my land lord; I said at Bow Street "In consequence of my political principles, and other unhappiness, I fell into a state of insolvency"—that is true—attribute my insolvency to my political principles, so far, not absolutely; it made matters worse; it was just this, through one thing and another, through the coercion of some of my friends, I went to the meetings more.</p>

Judd and Co. were, and I was introduced to Lieutenant-Colonel Creagh; I believe that was on the Monday after I bought the paper, I don't think I had seen my solicitor in the interval—I did not try to buy a copy of the paper there—I learnt that they were printers of a number of other papers, but I am</p>

I will take it"—he said "I won't pay you anything because you are a Parnellite"—I said "As you have thrown the gauntlet down, neck or nothing I will have my due," but I gave him a recommendation to the Charity Organisation Society, as I thought the man was in poverty at the time; but I found that he had means and assistance from the Tory clubs to employ counsel—I put all the details before the mass meeting before I went to Ireland. and I said "Supporters of the Plan of Campaign, I demand your support," and they gave it me—I have used strong language about political persons—I called some of the defendants miscreants; that was after the publication of this libel, and in reference to it—I believe I spoke of a man who would libel me like that as a miscreant beneath contempt—what I said about the landlords represented my own opinion—I have never attacked the private character of political opponents unless they have made a personal attack upon me—as to Loban, up to the time of his expulsion on 9th February, he was a most respectable man; he was on the executive council of the Holborn Radical Association.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated May 1st, stating that he was doing his very best to settle with the persons who had sent money, naming several whom he had paid, and asking whether his partner, Mr. Gilbert, could not be made to give up</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in money and goods, which he had taken away.</hi>) I have seen the prisoner write; I have examined the whole of the documents attached to the depositions, and in my opinion every letter but two is in his writing, and the original telegram—I have been to Stratford, and cannot find any place there which he has had anything to do with—he was remanded from Saturday to the following Friday, April 5th or 6th, and then discharged.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner has never mentioned before to-day any address at Stratford where he alleged that he carried on business—he mentions Mr. Carr in his letter—I had a complaint from him, and another from George Smith—there was a complaint from Bowden, and I found a letter from Fairish in the prisoner's possession.</p>

Grocott," and a number of printed billheads in the name of W. Clayton—I said "Who is Clayton?"—he said "I am trading in that name"—I took him in the name of Walter Reeves—I examined the premises thoroughly; there were no bicycles or tricycles there—I found this parcels book, but Mr. Grocott's name does not appear in it—I do not find among the papers any receipt for a bicycle supposed to have been given to the London and North-Western Railway, nor have I been furnished with the name and address of the person who is supposed to have stolen it and absconded—I saw two or three saws there, and a plane and a hammer, but not 60 tools.</p>

               <p>night, past Madame Tussaud's, and they were stopped by a fellow who asked Cole where he came from; he said I think from Frederick Street. Hampstead Road; this fellow says "Do you know any of the Fitzroy Place lads?" he said "Yes, and glad to know them to; this fellow said "Somebody wants you at the corner," he whistled and called 20 or 30 more fellows; he turned to one and said "Dick, do you know him?" he said "No;" he then said "Take that," and then struck him on the eye, and another on the nose; and <hi rend="italic">Cissy</hi> turns round and says "How many more of you?" and the others turned round and said "Take that, you cow," striking her in the eye. That, was Cole's description of what happened, and he asked me to go up on Thursday night to Marylebone to find these fellows—I said "Yes, I will," we then parted—next morning, Thursday, I saw Galletly in Grafton Street—<hi rend="italic">Garry</hi> was the name I knew him by—he said "Have you seen <hi rend="italic">Cissy's</hi> eye?"—I said "No"—he said "She has got a black one"—I said I had heard about it, and heard about fellows beating her last night—he said "Will you come up to Marylebone to find these fellows that hit <hi rend="italic">Cissy</hi> Chapman?"—I said "Yes, I will"—about 7 or a quarter-past, that same evening, I was in "the fair" in Tottenham Court Road—it is a disused ground connected with Whitfield's Chapel; it is an open space, it backs on to Whitfield Street—about a quarter of an hour after I got there I saw Galletly along with Dodd and <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Harvey—Galletly said "Are you coming up to Maryiebone, <hi rend="italic">Dave?"</hi>—I said "Yes"—he said "Can you get a couple more?"—I said "Yes, "Iturned round and saw Doolan and Elvis, aud I said to them "Will you come up to Marylebone to find those fellows that hit <hi rend="italic">Cissy</hi> Chapman?"—they said "Yes," they had heard of it before—before I left "the fair "Lee came up—I met him outside—Cole came into "the fair" before that, I saw him speaking to <hi rend="italic">Garry</hi>—I also saw Tom Brown and my brother Thomas; we all left "the fair" together, about half-past 8 or a quarter to 9, and just outside I saw Lee, and he joined us and walked, with us—I saw Graefe going down the Marylebone Road; before that I saw Henshaw and Govier in "the fair, "Iforgot to mention them; there was also <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Britton, but he left us just outside "the fair"—after leaving "the fair" we went on to Tottenham Street—before that, when we were about 20 yards from "the fair, "Lee said to all of us "I have got a knife to defend myself"—they could not all hear that, about seven or eight—I was about two yards or a yard and a half from him—he showed the knife, it was like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I could not swear to it—it was in a sheath like this; he took it from his right side; he had it in his hand and twisted it round like this (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—I should think about two or three persons could see it—I don't know who they were; I know one that saw it; that was Galletly—he said "Show me that knife," and Lee showed it to him—after putting it in the sheath, he pulled it put again, and handed it to him—Galletly said "This will do for one of them"—he had got the knife in his hand when he said that—he handed it back to Lee, and Lee put it back into the sheath, which he was wearing in a belt—I cannot tell who were standing near Lee and Galletly at the time—I said to Lee "Put that thing away"—we then started off through Tottenham Street, all in one lot, and into Union Street—Britton left us about 20 yards from the fair—when we got to Union Street, two or three of them said something about looking into</p>

                  </hi>. I am a polisher by trade, and live at 131, Whitfield Street, Tottenham Court Road—I am 16 years of age—on Thursday evening, 24th May, about 9 o'clock, I was in the fair in Tottenham Court Road; I there saw Frank Cole, I had known him before—he told me that he had been up Marylebone On Wednesday night, and some lads had set about him—I said "Have they? what for?"—He said "Nothing at all;" so he then asked me whether I would go up Marylebone with him that night to help him to see if he could find any of the lads who had insulted him; I agreed—Cleary was in the fair at the time and Galletly, no one else at that time—I remained in the fair a little time, when I saw Lee there—I left the fair with Cleary and Galletly—when we got outside, about 13 or 14 of us went down Tottenham Street, Lee, Galletly, David Cleary, Thomas Cleary, Graefe, Govier, Doolan, Elvis, and Cole—I did not see Henshaw at that time—Dodd and <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Harvey went With us as far as Tottenham Street—in Tottenham Street Lee said to me "I have a knife"—he showed it to me, there was a sheath to it, it was such a knife and sheath as this, and I believe this is the same belt—he took the knife out of the sheath and showed it to me—the others were behind us, they could not see the knife—he put the knife into the sheath, that was round his waist with the belt—we all then went on into Cleveland Street and Union Street, and down some bye-streets into Portland Place—by that time some of them had left the crowd, Dodd, Elvis, and Harvey had gone—in Portland Place Galletly asked Lee to lend him his knife—Lee said "All right," and he took off the belt, sheath, and knife, and gave it to Galletly and he put it round his waist—I borrowed a knife from Galletly about three or four minutes afterwards—I Wanted it to use if necessary—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife he lent me, it is a pen-knife; I put it in my pocket—we then all went on to the park—near York Gate there was an organ playing, and some people standing round it, and Elvis and Doolan went over to see if they could see any of the Marylebone <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>—they came back and said none were there—we went on to York Gate, and Galletly said to Elvis and Doolan, "You two go round the other way, and see if you can see any of them round there"—upon that Elvis and Doolan started to Clarence Gate by the Marylebone Road, and I and the others went in by York Gate and round towards the Circle—our party was composed of Galletly, David Cleary, Cole, Lee, Govier, myself, and Graefe—I did not see Henshaw at all—I, Galletly, and Cleary walked on the fence side—after going a certain distance we overtook Burns and Emily Lee, I did not pass them, I went away from there, and went to find Elvis and Doolan—as I went in the direction of Clarence Gate, I saw Rumbold and Elizabeth Lee—I went on to Clarence Gate, and just as I got out of the gate I saw Elvis and Doolan coming up Alsop Place towards the park—I called to them, and we three turned back through Clarence Gate in the direction of York Gate, to meet the others—as we returned we met Cleary and Galletly, one after the other, a yard or two between the two—Galletly said "I have stabbed him"—I said "Who?"—he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807300050"/>
               <p>"One of them"—I asked him where, and he put his hand up to the back of his neck—Govier and Graefe came up directly behind Galletly, and we all turned round and walked in the direction of Clarence Gate, and left by that gate, Galletly, Elvis, Doolan, Graefe, I, Govier. And David Cleary, and went back to the fair, not all together—I and Galletly stopped to have a drink of water, and when we turned round they had all gone—we saw a mob opposite York Gate standing looking, and we did not see where the others went—Galletly and I went back to the fair together; we stopped at the corner of Fitzroy Street and Euston Road—Galletly showed me a knife, he took it out of the sheath he was wearing, it was like the knife I had seen before, which I had seen Lee give to Galletly; I saw the blade, there was a stain of blood on it—it was then that I gave him back his own knife, he asked for it—I had not taken out that knife to use to any one—when he pulled the knife out of the sheath, he said "Look here"—it was about 10 or half-past when we got back to the fair—next morning, the 25th, I was in Grafton Street, and saw Galletly there; as I was talking to him Lee came up—I asked Galletly what he had done with the knife—he said he had put it down a sewer—when Lee came up he asked him what he had done with it, and he said "I put it down a sewer"—I did not see Henshaw at all on the night of the 24th—on the 26th I went and gave information to the police, after I had seen a statement in the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi> with regard to the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. The statement I saw was that there would be a free pardon—I went to the police-station in company with Cleary, I met him in Whitfield Street that evening; I can't tell whether I or he saw the notice first—I did not have any conversation with him about it; he said "Will you come up to the station with me and give information about the murder?"—it took us about five minutes to go to the station—we were not talking about the case on our way—I did not say anything, we were talking about other things, but not a word about this case; we talked about it when we were in the fair having swings—I used not to go to the fair every night, I went there very often, I generally met Cleary there, he was looking after the swings, cocoanut shying and that—I am neither a Marylebone lad or a Fitzroy Place lad, nor a <hi rend="italic">decker:</hi> by a <hi rend="italic">decker</hi> I suppose you mean a Dials lad—when I saw it in the papers I understood it was a Dials lad—I knew there was great enmity between the Fitzroy Place lads and the Lisson Grove lads; I was once present at a combat between them—I am a Fitzroy lad—I knew there was fighting between them—Cleary was not with me at the last fight, it took place near the fair, it was about the same as this, it was all the cause of this, about a girl being hit; they asked one of the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> from Marylebone some question, he said he came from Marylebone, and then they let out at him, started hitting him—Cleary was there at the time, he was fighting, I was not, I was with them, but I was not fighting—that was two or three days before this—it had to do with <hi rend="italic">Cissy</hi>, it was on the same night as we were going up to Marylebone, before we went there, it happened in Howland Street earlier in the evening of the 24th, before we started for Marylebone—I had not been present with Cleary at other fights that I know of, I had not been present at any other fight between the Marylebone hands and the Fitzroy Place lads—when Lee first showed me the knife it was outside the</p>

               <p>Tabernacle in the Tottenham Court Road, I am sure that no one else could have seen it—nothing was said to him by Galletly at the time—I did not see Cleary then, he could not have seen it—I do not recollect seeing Cleary in Court when I was giving my evidence at Marylebone—when we went to the police-station on the Saturday night we saw an inspector first and told him we were anxious to tell him all that happened about this murder—I did not tell him I had borrowed a knife from Galletly on that night; I did not mention that till I was asked at the police-court—there were no stains of blood on the trousers I had on that night; they are now in the pawnshop, they were pawned later on that same evening—no, it was on the Saturday they were pawned—I had whistled just before Galletly, and Cleary came running up to me in the park, I meant it as a signal to them—when I first went into the park at York Gate I was walking with Galletly and Cleary on the fence side, I then passed Barns and Miss Lee—after passing them I went on of my own accord—it is not true to say that Galletly told me to go on—if Cleary says so it is a mistake—I did not pass Burns and Lee again when I returned towards York Gate—I was close by Cleary when the first fight took place—I don't know whether he was very much excited at the time—they were hitting one another, he and the other <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, I don't know his name, it was only a fight between the two, there were no others there—it was about <hi rend="italic">Cissy</hi> Chapman. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I first saw Graefe in Tottenham Street—in going towards the park I was walking in front with Galletly and Lee nearly all the time—I did not think from anything that was said that anybody was going to be stabbed—when I got into the, park I crossed over from the houses side to the fence side with Cleary and Galletly and went straight ahead with them, I did not look back at all—on coming back from Clarence Gate I was on the side where the houses are,. I met Cleary and then Galletly—it was after he had spoken to me that I saw Graefe, he passed along towards Clarence Gate; me, Galletly, Cleary, and Graefe walked along together—Graefe went out of the gate on the side next the houses—I then walked out with Galletly and went towards the fair.</p>

When Elvis, and Doolan went over to the organ, Govier was not by my side, I saw him with the others; Elvis and Doolan were the only two that went over to the organ, I am sure of that—when Galletly came up and said he had stabbed him, I had a little conversation with him for about three minutes—then Govier came up in company with Graefe.</p>

It is the Grove lads that are running after him; then I heard a peculiar whittle and the two walked towards Clarence Gate—before the whistle Galletly said "It was through banging our fellows and giving the girl a black eye"—Burns and I then went towards York Gate and saw Rumbold being put into a cab—I knew none of these persons before.</p>

I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—on Thursday night, 24th May, a little before 10, I was at the hospital when Rumbold was brought in—he was dead; his clothes were saturated with blood—I examined him then, and afterwards made a post mortem examination—there were two wounds: one at the back of the neck just above the collar, in the middle line of the neck, it was about one inch in length and two-and-a-half inches deep; the other wound was in the middle of the back on the left side, just below the shoulder blade, that penetrated the right lung, it was between four and five inches deep—that was the more serious wound, and was the one that caused death, it completely divided the branch of the pulmonary artery, and penetrated the upper lobe of the right lung—the loss of blood from that wound must very soon have caused death; death was caused by loss of blood—the wounds were such as could have been inflicted with the knife produced—they could not have been inflicted with the pocket-knife.</p>

The wound on the neck was not a very serious wound, it merely penetrated the muscles, it was a serious wound, but it did not wound anything of importance—I think a man could very likely run 100 yards after receiving such a wound as that in the back; I should think he could run for a minute, I don't think he could be capable of speaking at the end of that time—I should not have thought he would be able to speak after running 300 yards—blood would come from the mouth from that wound—the air tubes were full of blood, and so was the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. On 4th July I was staying at the.Covent Garden Hotel, and about midnight I was going down Great Queen Street, and found I had gone further than I intended, as I saw the Free<lb/>masons' Hotel, and I turned down a street to the right—a woman had spoken to me just previously, and I walked down the middle of the street—I was pounced on by three men from behind, one took my right arm, one my left arm, and the third man seized me by my throat, and with his right hand rummaged my pockets—he broke away my watch chain, which was a strong one, with a violent jerk, and took watch and all—he then said "All right," and they liberated me and ran away—I called "Police!" and two young fellows in the post office service and a policeman came up—the men ran down a court, I ran after them and found a hat—when I got down the court I had the three fellows, but I can only identify Woodward—I afterwards saw part of my chain at Bow Street—I have not seen my watch, I believe it was dropped at the place, because it was torn from the swivel—I was so violently assaulted that I can scarcely write my name now—I suffered most excruciating agony.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a fine art dealer, at 12 and 14, Queen's Road, Bayswater—Henny was in my employment about four years ago—on 20th March he came to me and said that he was trying to obtain goods for a firm of shippers in Fenchurch street, who had American customers—I believe he gave the name of the firm, I would not be certain, either then or at a subsequent interview he said the name was Charles Deacon and Co.—he said they wanted bronzes chiefly,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807300070"/>
               <p>he wanted a pair of bronze candelabra at the time to show to one of their customers; I understood he spoke of American buyers—I let him have one pair of candelabra to show, and he was to bring them back the same day I understood, if they did not suit—ten guineas was the price—he said "I shall see you again to-night"—he came, he did not bring the bronzes, he told me he had left them with Deacon and Co., of Fenchurch Street, and said he supposed I should have no objection<lb/>he told me the firm would call on me; that he had told them about me and recommended them to call—on 23rd March Deacon called and handed me this card, "Chas. Deacon and Co., 107, Fenchurch Street, London"—he mentioned Mr. Henny's name as introducing him, and said he had American customers for whom he wanted some bronzes—I mentioned the pair I had let Henny have, and said they were very good ones; he seemed rather taken aback, and ultimately said they were too small and did not suit his customer; he seemed to avoid the question; his manner struck me as peculiar, as if he were acknowledging what he did not understand—he walked round my place and selected other things, a bronze clock and candelabra to match, a group of horses in bronze, a pair of old Louis XVI. candlesticks, and a brass Juno and bird, the total value of those articles was 30 guineas—I told him the goods were on sale or returnable at any time to my order if not sold—this is my sale or return invoice-book; there was a verbal agreement and then I wrote this and endorsed it, and he signed it in my presence: "On sale for cash only, or return any time to order—Deacon"—I added after<lb/>wards, "Pair bronze candelabra, by Henny," after the signature for my own guidance—the same evening Werner or Porteons called, he said he came by Deacon and Co.'s instructions, and he took the articles, value 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., away in a cab—I delivered the invoice with the goods to him, I think—on or about 30th March Deacon came, bringing Harris with him—Deacon spoke first.

               <p>and he wanted something of sufficient importance to take the electric light, and that these would just be the thing for him—they looked at between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of articles—they and I made notes of the articles they selected as what they would like—Mr. Deacon wished me to send some of the goods to the value of eighty guineas—I excused myself from sending them on the ground that they were liable to damage:—I did not get back the articles I had sent—on 4th April I wrote this post-card. (<hi rend="italic">Asking Deacon to lose no change of selling the clock and candelabra, and saying he would deal liberally with him, being well aware how hard it was to sell, and that he would take</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for a pair of paintings.</hi>) I received this answer, dated 107, Fenchurch Street, April 7 th.

(<hi rend="italic">Saying he should feel obliged by his early attention, as he had a large sum to make up within a week</hi>) There is a note at the bottom of it in Deacon's writing to the best of my belief: "Answered, paying would try and call to-morrow or Friday; gentleman not yet returned from Paris; fear shall, have, to return clock and candelabra"—he told me in his letter, which I have destroyed, the gentleman, had bought a lot of pictures in Paris—I wrote him this post card. <hi rend="italic">Saying he hoped to see him on Friday, and that under the circumstances he would leave it in his hands to do the best he could with the clock and candelabra; it was no use to stand out for price.</hi>) In answer I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Asking if he should close with an offer he had had of</hi> 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for the goods on approbation, and the Dresden clock, and saying he could not get up today, as he had a buyer with him.</hi>) I then wrote on 21st April, put the letter in an envelope, and addressed it—I cannot say I posted it myself; I know it was posted.

               <p>partner, but I have advised him as to the purchase of goods; I have been with him a good deal, but I am not a partner"—he said he was very sorry Deacon had gone away, and he would try all he could to get the goods back again, "And I will see you have your goods or the money; you may make yourself quite easy on that point"—he said "I did not see any of your other goods, with the exception of that pair of candelabra"—that was the pair I valued at 10 guineas on 20th March—I don't remember his saying anything more—I was very much annoyed with him—he was not successful—I got none of my goods back—I saw Deacon when he was arrested—I saw Henny, and told him he was entirely to blame for my losing my property, as I should never have let him have the goods but for these; he expressed his sorrow, and said he had no idea that they were the kind of men they were; he said they had given him a good deal of trouble, and owed him money—he did not admit that he had taken any part in disposing of the goods at the time—I received a communication, and then went to Henny's house, and told him I was very much astonished to learn that he had admitted to a gentleman with whom I had business that he had pledged some of my goods by instructions of the firm—he parried it for some time, ultimately he admitted it was true, but he said "I am not to blame; I had to do what they told me; I got them to take them out since, and repledge them, and they have shown me the ticket; they are not in my name any longer"—he said Harris had told him to pledge the goods, and after Deacon absconded he wired Harris and said he was not going to be blamed, they were in his name, and he persuaded Harris to take them out of pawn and repledge them in his (Harris's) name—I told him that would not exonerate him—I took down this statement from Henny: "I, Josiah Henny, deeply regret to have to confess that the firm I introduced to Mr. William Ellis, viz., Charles Deacon, T. Harris, Freeman, and many others, trading under the name of C.

It was Harris who first asked me to tell him where he could get some bronzes, and I told him of Mr. Ellis. I believe all the lot are pawned, and promise to assist all in my power to recover Mr. Ellis's property. J. Henny"—he signed that in my presence—I gave informal ion to the police, and as far as possible Henny seemed to assist us, but ultimately my Counsel would not have his evidence—I was present when Deacon was arrested in his bedroom by Detective Sergeant Martin—Deacon turned to me, and told me I had been very badly used—he was taken in a cab to the station; I rode on the box—when I got down, he said "I should like to speak to you before you go, Mr. Ellis, I am willing to admit what 1 have done, but I am not going to be blamed for what I know nothing about. That first candelabra that you told me about, I may as well tell you now I never saw them or knew anything about them"—I reminded him that he had acknowledged having them—he said "I tell you now I never saw them"—I can quite believe he had not see—I saw some of my candelabra at Barnett's.</p>

               <p>not done—his signature in the book is before the words "Pair of bronze candelabra, by Henny, 10 guineas," which was written afterwards—if it had not been written afterwards, Deacon would have been at the bottom of the whole matter—my own impression was that he had not seen them, because I remember he was very evasive when I told him about them; he seemed to be acknowledging what he did not understand—Henny was the person who had the dealing with regard to the candelabra so far as I was concerned, but he brought it to the knowledge of both of the others—Henny was four years ago in my service, for about eight months I think; I have seen a good deal of him since—I had never known Deacon at all—I made no enquiry about him, I took Henny's introduction and acted on that—I always found Henny trustworthy—it was not specified what time the goods were to be returned if not sold; I sometimes have goods out for a year—I am in the habit of entrusting goods to various agents, to keep them indefinitely till sold, it is for me to order them to be returned when I please—I may leave them with them for years—works of art do remain on hand a long time; I have had goods two years on approbation—I may have something I must take a lowish price for and wait till I get a good market—dealers in a small way may from time to time raise money temporarily on articles, meaning to redeem them; I should think there was nothing dishonourable in raising money on articles if they were his own, but I should decidedly object to his raising money on other people's—I had not trusted them to Deacon believing they might remain on his hands indefinitely—these articles were placed in Deacon's hands to show American dealers, and were pledged immediately—if I have confidence in agents I leave things in their hands for a year or two without requiring them to return them.</p>

I first saw Harris about the 30th—I believe I had never seen him till then—he did not give me his name at the time, and I did not know it up to or at that date—I parted with the first candelabra readily to Henny to show to Harris to try and sell, that was the inducement—I had known Henny, and at that time I did not know of the existence of such a person as Harris—Harris in no way tricked me, or came in contact with me, or did anything to induce me to part with my goods, but Henny spoke of them as a firm—Harris said or wrote nothing that induced me to part with my goods, rather the contrary; we did not like Harris's appearance, and would not let anything more go—I had not seen Harris up to 20th and 23rd, when he was charged with stealing—he had never written to me—the goods were parted with to go to an American buyer, and Harris was described as Deacon's American buyer—I had not seen Harris then, and his name was not mentioned to me—the inducement to part with the first goods was that Henny was acquainted and doing business with a firm of shippers, who had an American buyer wanting bronzes, and especially bronze candelabra, and I let him have that pair to show this firm for this American buyer—Harris's name was not given—I took no receipt for the first goods—this is my receipt in the book for the second lot—Deacon signed it—I first saw Harris some few days afterwards—I be<lb/>lieve</p>

               <p>he then told me he had been in America several times, and knew the American market and American buyers or customers, and the sort of things that would be suitable for selling to them—he told me he had been with Deacon a good deal, and had advised him; and he mentioned a firm where Deacon had taken nearly 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods and shipped them to America, and they were returned—it was a voluntary visit he made to me; he came because I had been there the day before, and made very strong statements—I don't think he came voluntarily, I put very strong pressure on him—I had been to his office, 11, Cullum Street, the day before, and left a message with his clerk—I should think I had been to 11, Cullum Street, seven or eight times, but I had not seen him on each occasion, I had seen his partner—before he called on me I had been several times to Cullum Street; I had only seen him once in the office; that was a day or two before he came to me—then I wrote and he wrote and he called—I saw him twice within a week—Henny at first denied all knowledge of pawning, and that he had had anything to do with pawning—afterwards, when I told him I knew he had pawned, he said Harris had told him to pawn, and afterwards that it was Deacon who told him to pawn—he has told a good many lies—we said he should be either in the witness box or the dock; my Counsel said he should be in the dock—I don't know which of his lies to believe—he told me in the information I wrote down that he had given the money to Harris—the statement was my composition, he read it in the presence of his wife, and he signed it—I don't think he would have signed anything that I wrote; I should not have allowed him to do that—he had not made a variety of statements at that time, not till afterwards; I think he was a catspaw, I have known him for years, and always found him thoroughly honest and straightforward; he was entirely responsible for my parting with the goods, because of the belief I had in him.</p>

W."—I called myself Joseph Werner—on about 22nd March Deacon mentioned Mr. Ellis's name to me (I don't think any one else was then present); after that I went to Mr. Ellis's office and brought away some goods from there to Fenchurch Street—I then saw Deacon—I don't remember any one</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman baker, of 2, Spencer Road, Stoke Newington—on Saturday evening, 21st July, I went into the Army and Navy public-house at Stoke Newington—I tried to make my way to the bar for half an ounce of tobacco, and I was pushed right and left, and my hat was knocked forward over my face on two or three occasions—the prisoner Alfred then struck me a violent swinging blow under the left jaw—I tried to make my way out, but was hustled and pushed about, and as I got to the door I was pulled by my coat collar by some one—eventually I got outside, and I was thrown on my hands and knees—I felt a man's hand in my pocket; I don't know who it was—I saw two men, who were the prisoners to the best of my belief, running away—I scrambled out of the crowd and ran 100 or 150 yards, but was surrounded by the mob, and thrown down two or three times—I then got out of the crowd, and met the constables and complained to them, and they arrested one of the prisoners—when I met the constables I looked in my pocket, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I expected to find about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the difference was gone, but I could not say exactly what I had spent—I was perfectly sober when I went into the house; I had had a glass or two—I called for half a pint of beer in the house, but had not drunk it—I next saw the prisoners at the police-station, where they were charged with assaulting me; they were by themselves—I said they were the two men that I believed were principally in. the assault—I had never seen them before to my knowledge—they denied the charge, I believe.</p>

New Zealand Four per Cent, stock, for which he showed me the receipt—I said that we should require the stock to be transferred into the names of the nominees of the bank, and he and I went to Messrs. Hutchinson's, the stockbrokers, and arranged for a power of attorney to be prepared to authorise the transfer of the stock—I did not then know that he was co-executor with Mrs. Kaemena—he gave me this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which purports to be a power of attorney for the transfer of 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. New Zealand stock, stamped, signed, and sealed, August 5th, 1885, by Amelia Kaemena, in the presence of Frank Dunn and John Harms-worth—J saw Roberts sign it—I went with him to the stockbroker, and it was completed there—that was on 5th August—in pursuance of that power of attorney the transfer was made to Mr. Latter and myself on August 7th, as nominees of the Central Bank—I gave Roberts this contract note for a loan; that had to be signed by him and by Mrs. Kaemena—he brought it on the 7th, signed by her, and added his signature at my office—he signed this document "F" on the same day in my presence—it is a request to place the dividends to the credit of T.

               <p>get from her on to the quay by going up the ordinary gangway—I followed him—when I got to the end of the shed, and round the corner, I saw Fitzgerald leaving a cart that was standing there—he had no bag with him then—I saw Rice standing on the raised platform beside his cart, squaring up a bag which was in the cart, and covering it with an empty sack; the bag could be seen as it originally was, and he was squaring it, or putting it down flat, and covering it with a sack—I at once made a communication to Captain Roberts, the marine superintendent of the Ocean Steamship Company—we both went after the cart and watched it a short time, and then followed it in different directions—Rice was driving it away—I got in front of it and signaled to Rice, who had gone 300 yards at least from the platform—he got off and came towards me—I said "What have you in those bags"—he said "Leaves, I think"—I said "Tea leaves, I suppose"—he said "I think not"—I said "I must see what the bags contain"—I cut open one; it contained pure tea—Captain Roberts came up and cut the other bag open, that also contained tea—as far as I could see those bags were the same as those I had seen Fitzgerald carrying round before—Captain Roberts sent me to see the dock superintendent—I afterwards saw Fitzgerald leave the "Priam"—I said "You will get into serious trouble over this"—he said "Try and save me if you can"—I have known him about five years—the prisoners were first charged with smuggling, I believe, by the excise officers.</p>

When I first saw Fitzgerald he was considerably under twenty yards from me—it was a common gunny bag he had—the second time I saw him at the same distance—I followed him immediately I saw him with the second bag—I walked along the "Priam's" deck while he was on the quay—the cart was under twenty yards off—I saw him leave the cart and go through an opening opposite where the cart was—I did not see him put the bag in the cart; when I saw him first round the corner he was leaving the cart, about 15 feet from it—there was a bag, similar to the one he had left, on the cart, and the other man was squaring it up—the nearest I saw Fitzgerald to the cart was 15 feet—because they were gunny bags in the cart I suppose they are the bags Fitzgerald was carrying—I do not think a great many gunny bags run about that size—this occurred in the dinner half-hour, which is from 12 to half-past at the docks—I have examined this tea; there is nothing peculiar about it that I know of; a great deal of it is sold and consumed—I do not say Fitzgerald stole it—I do not know where he came from; I did not see him come out of any shed—I have nothing to do with the tea warehouse; the warehouse inspector Wykes has—I know nothing about the tea—I told Fitzgerald on Saturday he would be in trouble; and I saw him on the Monday, he was at work—Fitzgerald did not see me when he went past the ship the second time—there were very few people about there; there—were some, but not in the place he was—there were plenty of dock labourers and officials about the docks, but not along 33 shed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am marine superintendent in the service of the Ocean Steamship Company—my office is close to shed 33 in the Royal Albert Docks—on 21st July, a little after 12 o'clock, Glencross made a communication to me in my office—I looked out of my window, which over ooks the end of 33 shed, and saw Rice at the end of 33 shed, standing on the platform by the side of which was a cart, into which Rice got and drove away—Glencross went down the quay-side and I followed along the road—Glencross came through between two sheds and stopped the cart—when I got up Glencross was saying "What have you in those sacks?"—I understood Rice to say "Seed"—I asked Rice where he got the bags—he said "I don't know"—the mouths of the bags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were tied up—they had been squared and were lying at the bottom of the cart, covered with sacks or bags or a cloth, I cannot ray which—Rice and Glencross were in the act of uncovering them as I got up to the cart—I cut a hole in one of the bags, it contained tea—I told Rice to come down the road with me, and ultimately he was given into the custody of a Customs House officer—from the time I saw him from my window till he was given into custody, I did not lose sight of him for a moment—the same afternoon about 2. 30 I saw Fitzgerald opposite 29 shed on the quay; I said I was sorry to think he should be mixed up in an affair or business of this sort; he replied he had the opening of packets worth thousands of pounds on previous occasions—so far as we were concerned there was no occasion for Rice to be round with his cart near 33 shed—he has nothing to do with our company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner and divisional surgeon of police—on 13th June with Mr. Sewell I made a post-mortem examination of the deceased—I found the body much emaciated, two sores on the back of the right hip indicating she had been lying for a considerable period, the ankles swollen, an ulcer on the left leg, sores and numerous vermin, thousands of lice, no marks indicating violence, no subcutaneous fat under the chin, nor all over the body, very little muscle, it having been absorbed, and the blood-vessels were almost empty—the heart was small and pale, and the tissues abnormally soft—the right side was full of liquid blood with a small soft clot—the left side was filled, and a recent soft clot—her condition indicated very slow death—the left lung was adherent to the pleura from an old attack of pleurisy, and a small cavity full of pus; the right lung was in the same condition at the apex; there was recent congestion occupying the whole of the base of the left lung—the liver was small—there was no evidence of disease or of alcoholism—the bladder was full of bile—the stomach was small and atrophied principally, you could see through the coats, and it contained at the orifice of exit a small quantity of vegetable food resembling boiled cabbage—on further examination this was found to be decolourised and softened lettuce, the stomach was empty in every other respect—I concluded that no solid or semi-solid food had been taken since that was swallowed, and that the lettuce had been eaten three or four days before—the woman must have been unconscious; if not digestion would have occurred, and food would have passed from the stomach into the bowels—she must have been in a state of profound coma, all the functions except respiration and circulation being suspended—I think I can say she had not eaten stewed eels the day before her death—there was a small quantity of solid bile, stained fæces in the lower bowel, close to the rectum, less than an ounce, the rest was perfectly empty—that would indicate that she had not taken food for a long period—her hair had been cleansed by the Coroner's officer—it had nothing to do with the cause of death, but its bad state showed it had not been brushed or combed for a long time—the immediate cause of death was congestion of the lungs and arrest of the heart's action,</p>

I am assistant surgeon at Her Majesty's Gaol, Wandsworth—I was called to see Skippen about 8. 20 p. m., on 23rd June, in one of the warder's rooms—he wassutfering from a scalp wound about six inches in length, extending from just above the inner side of the left eye<lb/>lash up in a semi-circular manner and-down to the left ear; the whole of the scalp was detached completely from the bone, and hanging over the left eye about the size of one's hand—I put in several silver wire stitches and dressed it, and. had him removed to the infirmary—his injury would endanger his life; the wound was very serious and bled a great deal—great violence must have been used—I saw blood and hair where the head came in contact with the wall; it was a brick wall white-washed—the bone was exposed, but not injured—Skippen is still unfit for duty; he is</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 18, Norwood Road, Herne Hill—on 20th July, about 1. 15 a. m., I was in London Road, Southwark, going home—three men surrounded me; the prisoners are two of them—Murphy, I believe, hit me on my eye, and Biokett snatched my watch, which was in my pocket with this chain, and a sovereign<lb/>purse attached to the end of the chain—I caught hold of the chain, but it broke, and I only saved half of it—I went to the ground, but got up and struck out at the men—they went to the other side of the road, land I pointed them out to a policeman and knocked them all down—he took two, and the third escaped—I have not the slightest doubt of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing through Green Street on this night—I saw Priestly and the prisoner there—the prisoner had a poker in his hand—he struck Priestly on the forehead—I took the poker from his right hand and took it to the police-station and gave it up to the police—I saw Fret coming away bleeding—I took him to the hospital—I am sure the prisoner is the man who struck Priestly with the poker—I took the poker afterwards—I did not see Fret struck at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Back Court, King's Bench Walk—on 17th June, early in the morning, I was in Green Street with Priestly—I saw the prisoner strike Priestly on the head with a poker and knock him down—I went to his assistance and took him home, seeing he was bleeding from the head—after Priestly was knocked down the prisoner lifted up his leg to make a kick at Alfred Lewis, the constable—he Went to kick him in the privates, but Lewis put his arm there, and it caught his arm instead—I saw Kennedy take the poker.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 293). Between 12 and 1 o'clock early on Sunday morning I went to Green Street, where I found a crowd—the prisoner was near his door, walking about in a defiant attitude making a noise—Hannan was there, he and I were in uniform—a witness complained of being assaulted, and told me another man was lying down on the opposite side of the street—I re-crossed the road to him for the purpose of telling him to go indoors—he was in the custody of Hannan; I saw he was acting very violently—I pushed through the crowd; on sewing me he said "You b——sad, I will do for you"—he made a kick at my privates—I dropped my right hand to prevent it, and was kicked in the wrist—I followed him down to the station—I went to the police surgeon and found I had a small fracture of the bone—that was done by the kick—I have been off duty ever since from that injury—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man that kicked me.</p>

There were 200 or 300 people I should say—the prisoner was alone near his own door at the time—they made no demonstration against him; they complained of being assaulted by him—two went to Guy's and were attended to—I did not see the beginning of it.</p>

About half-past 12 early on this Sunday morning, in consequence of information given to me, I went to Green Street in uniform; I saw a erord of people—Doherty made a complaint to me—I saw his hat knocked in—Welch complained to me—I saw some one bleeding—I went and spoke to the prisoner, who was standing in the doorway of No. 42; he was very excited—I told him to go inside till the mob had cleared away; with that some one in the crowd shouted out "That is the man that committed the assault"—he rushed out and said to the man "You b——, if I had you singly I would</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital on this night—I saw Fret brought in—he fainted from loss of blood—I was afraid of his death at the time from loss of blood—he bad a very serious cut across the tendon, and the radial artery was severed—he has been three weeks in the hospital—the cut must have been done by something sharp—he is still an out patient—the poker could not do such an injury as that to Fret's wrist.</p>
