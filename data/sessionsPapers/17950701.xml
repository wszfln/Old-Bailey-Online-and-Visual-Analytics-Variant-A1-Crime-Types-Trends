            From what part of the house did you lose them? - From a room in the back part.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you lose them? - I cannot tell precisely the day; it was on or about the twelfth; I imagine they were taken at different times. The principal witness is Mr. Ford. who knows more of it than I can tell you. The shoes are here; I cannot swear to them. I only know this, that there was a certain number of shoes in my back parlour on the eleventh or twelfth; I do not at all know precisely the day. The witness Ford came down with the prisoner, and said he had bought eighteen pair of shoes of the prisoner at such a price, and that he had that day brought him two more pair, and that gave him suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by? - He was in the house somewhere about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any shoes from this back parlour? - I knew there ought to be twenty-six pair more than I found there, and on comparing the shoes that Ford brought down, they corresponded. I think Ford brought them down Thursday the eleventh of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any before he brought the shoes to you? - I had not. I now find there are twenty-six pair missing.</p>

            How many did you discover were missing at the time? - At least to the number of twenty.</p>
               <p>- FORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a shop, No. 31, Swallow-street; I sell shoes, new and second hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you know him? - I know him perfectly well by seeing him very often. I believe it is about six weeks ago that he brought the first shoes that I bought; whether he brought one or two pair I am not certain, but I think it was two pair; I bought the shoes at four shillings per pair of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions? - I did not the first time; I did not know but he might have bought them for his own wear. When the second or third lot I am not positive which, came to me for sale; the second lot came to me two or three days after the first -</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he bring you in all? - Eighteen pair I purchased, and two pair I stopped, which have not been paid for yet. When he had brought six pair, I think it was, I then asked him how he came by these shoes; he said, that he had lent a man money, who lived in the country, and that he was in the shoe business in the country, that he had wrote for payment of this money that was owing to him; that the man had returned for an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010004"/>swer that he could not pay him, but that if he chose to accept of a dozen or two of shoes for the payment of the money, and vend them in London, he was willing to send them; he said he had received a dozen pair for payment of part of the money he had lent to him; he told me that he lost eighteen-pence a pair by them, that the man charged him five shillings and sixpence a pair, and he received of me but four shillings; I bought a dozen of him, believing the story. Afterwards he brought me two pair more, and said, that he still wished to have his money, and he had sent him some more goods, six pair more, and then afterwards he brought me four pair more, and then when he had said he had but eighteen pair, he brought me two more pair, and when he brought these two pair, I says to him, it seems to me that you are continually bringing shoes on this head, of having them out of the country, I said, I suppose you have something to prove it, as far as letters, to testify that you were going to receive these goods, and you can have no objection to let me go and see these letters; he said he had not; I asked him where he lived? he said in Petty France, Westminster; and if I chose I might go with him. I went with him part of the road, and then he told me he had some business to communicate in Dean-street, Soho, I went with him; when he came there I said, as you are a foreigner to me, talk in a language that I can understand. When he came there he asked about a captain Morris, and there were shoes there; I looked over a great many dozen pair, and I could not see that any there corresponded to these sort of shoes that he had brought to me, and I told the man there my suspicions, and the man of the shop came to my shop to examine these shoes, and he could not tell nothing about them. Then I took him to Westminster, according as was proposed; when we came to Downing-street there he called on Mr. Beazley, he asked me to let him call, and begged that I would stop at the door while he went into the house to ask some question. That was in the direct road to where he told me he lived; I let him go, as I see it was a place that I was not afraid of his going into, and I stopped at the door while he went into the passage</p>
               <p>Q. And that house was Mr. Beazley's? - It was so; he received there some trowsers and some hats from Mrs. Beazley, for Mr. Beazley was not at home. He then begged the favour that I would go back again with him to deliver these things, or else he should get disgrace; I told him that I must go to his house, I insisted on it, and so at last he confessed that he had stole the shoes from this Mr. Beazley.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better for him to confess? - I told him that I imagined, and I was sure they were not his shoes, and I said, tell me whose they are, that the owner may have his property back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of any kind - Not the least in the world. I took him instantly back to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the shoes here? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Can you, or any body for you, speak to the shoes? - I cannot. This man had been backward and forward to my house three or four weeks; he is a soldier, and was servant to an officer that was at my house, who had enlisted him in the Loyal Tay Fencibles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the court.</p>

I was not in the gaol, but my servant, Roberts, came and told me of it, and asked me whether she might lay in the gaol all night?</p>

               <p>Q. Then you let any person that chooses to ask for it, to come down into the lodge after locking up? - Not except they are in the state side.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a singular occurrence? - You may call it a singular occurrence, because it is very seldom that we have prisoners there in that side.</p>

               <p>Q. State candidly what was his general character during the three years that you knew him in that gaol? - I had a very good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were you present at Day's examination at Bow-street? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at any examinations of Day, wherein he said, that Mr Tilly never had any conversation with him respecting the enlargement of Crosswell? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trcbeck. Did you ever take Idswell out of prison after he was finally committed? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When you let Mrs. Idswell sleep in the prison, was it not with the consent of you master, Mr. Newport? - I would not have done it on no account without first acquainting him.</p>

I told him I should not go to see any thing about it.</p>

               <p>Q. To go where? - To No. 13, Artillery-lane. We did not consent to it, and then he asked to let his uncle Johnny come in; that if he could be accommodated to see him, it would be more service to him than writing an hundred letters. Uncle Johnny is

            , that stands at the bar. Mrs. Jones used to call him uncle, and he used too. We did not agree to it at first, and he said, he would make us both a present of a guinea each. He was admitted in and staid near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the 3d of April, that you let him have access? - Sunday, the 29th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever let in a second time? - Yes, the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume you got another guinea for that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first heard any thing about a sick aunt being at No. 13, Artillery-lane? - They began to talk about it on Sunday morning, 29th of March. She said, she must go and see the sick aunt, and would be back again in a short time; she said, she was very ill. The next morning she came again, she said, that her aunt was dangerously ill, and wanted to see Mr. Idswell very much, and from the sight of him she would give him seven or eight hundred pounds, and that he should go in his irons, because that would affect her the more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Crosswell on this? - I did, but we both of us refused it several times, till Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that what had you received from Idswell? - He made me a present of a watch, the first day that he received any property from Bow-street, he called me up in the room, and asked me what I would have?</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were two guineas and this watch, any thing else? - No. On Thursday night Crosswell had got three pawnbroker's tickets, the times were almost out, and he gives them to this Idswell, who, promised to take the things out for him. Before I went, I went up stairs to Idswell, to know if he wanted any thing more before I went home; Mrs. Idswell was there, and he said to her, my dear, have you got this watch, coat, hat, and ring out of pawn? she says, no. Says he, you may as well give Day the money to go and get them out; and she gave me three guineas to go and get them. I went, and when I came back, I gave him the watch and ring, and he told me to take the coat and hat home to my own house. On Friday night, when I went up stairs, he told me he wanted to see Crosswell; and I went down and sent him up stairs to him, and he gave Crosswell the watch and ring back again, and told me to give him up the hat and coat.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010010"/>Q. Did not they give you some cotton? - Yes, they did, for my children. They asked me what children I had? I told them, two, one of four years old, and the other of two. After Crosswell went up stairs, he came down stairs again to me, and said, Day, you have been guilty of a nasty transaction, in not giving me the great coat and hat. Then about nine o'clock Crosswell went up again, and left a great coat, and Mr. Roberts staid in the prison till near eleven o'clock; and when Crosswell came down, he said, he had settled the business for Idswell to go, and be safe, to Artillery-lane, and he was to return in two hours; so I told him, I would not go with him, he might go himself. And he said, he would load a blunderbuss that I might be safe, and he said, the next time he would go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the blunderbuss? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How were his irons tied up? - With four silk handkerchiefs, and Idswell had got a rough great coat on, belonging to one Myers, a prisoner at that same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave him that great coat? - Crosswell. Just as he was going out, he said, go, make haste back, and if you want to go another night, I will go with you myself. We walked as far as Smithfield, and had a coach, and went to Artillery-lane. When we came to Artillery-lane, Idswell did not rightly know the house, and he asked a watchman which was Mrs. Cummings's? He was told, and we were going up to the door, and just as we got up to the door, we see Mr. Tilley and his wife coming away from this door. We got out of the coach about a hundred yards from the house. I says to Idswell, there is Mr. Tilley. He did not speak, nor he did not say nothing to him; but when we came up to the door, the door was half open; the man Bowley was at the door; I knew him from coming backwards and forwards to Idswell. I said to Bowley, there is Tilley, call him; he called him. Mr. Tilley comes up and shakes Mr. Idswell by the hand, and said, Mr. Idswell, who would think of seeing of you here? and Tilley shaked me by the hand, and said, good night, Day, don't be afraid of me; then Tilley went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Idswell went into the house, and went up stairs, and you followed him? - Yes, I was close to him, about two stairs from his all the way. When he got up on the landing place, he turned into the left hand room, as soon as he got in, there were some people came from behind the curtain, after he found the people come from behind the curtains, he said, d-mn him, he has got a blunderbuss with him. They were going to lay hold of him first being mistaken, and they laid hold of me, and tore my coat sleeve off, and I fell down two or three stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the blunderbuss? - I had it under my coat at the same time, the muzzle was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to secure the blunderbuss? - No, I did not; I attempted to save myself. Hardwicke was the first that laid hold of me, and Haydon was the next, and then Henley and Handland; these four were on me.</p>
               <p>Q. When these men were on you, what did they do? - Hardwicke got the blunderbuss away from me, he said, d-mn him, I have got it; and then the light was put out immediately, and the blunderbuss was fired immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you standing then or down? - I was laying down with my hands hold of the banisters.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find what was the consequence with any body else? - I did not till the people broke into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the people broke in, after the report of the gun? - The mistress of the house came out first. They broke the blunderbuss about me, and jumped on me, and left me for dead once, and went up stairs; and when they came down again, they found I was not dead, and they listed me up by the hair of my head, and tried to hang me with my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else while this business was going on in the house? - I see the little one, Jacobs, in the house, and when I went to raise myself up; I laid hold of Delany by the apron; he was at the bottom.</p>

            Was not your reason for keeping it from him, that you knew it was an improper transaction? - Yes, it was an improper transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint Mr. Newport at any time with any proposal he had made you, that you should convey him out of the security of the prison walls? - I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you had been trying to persuade Crosswell in that matter? - No, I never did; no further then bringing of him a message that I acquainted you before, he wanted to do it at last, after he had been up stairs, and all his property was returned.</p>

            Why did not you acquaint Mr. Newport with this? it was an honest transaction of course? - No, it was not; I knew I was doing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you did not do wrong for the hope of nothing, you would not have let this person out merely for asking? - I never received any thing more than I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer. You would not have let him for any thing that could be said to you, unless you found there would be a handsome present? - I expected it.</p>
               <p>Q. No persuasions would have operated on you, except you had believed there would have been an handsome present? - No, I don't think it would.</p>

Do you remember any thing taking place on Good Friday last? - Yes, about half after one on Friday morning, I heard the alarm of murder and fire; at that present time I did not know whether it was in my own house or the next; I got out of my bed and went to the street door, I immediately found it was at the next door; I immediately heard the alarm of a piece going off, I went back and put on my breeches and jacket, and by forcing the door three times, it flew open; the first thing I saw was, Idswell laying on the floor, just within the door; I see the blood boiling out of his hind parts, he lay like on his face; the next was Day, he stood about a yard space from him; I asked Day what was the matter? he said, for God's sake help, or I shall be murdered; immediately Mr. Jarvis, the headborough, came in at the door, and by knowing of me he said, Mitchell, I demand you to aid and assist; I said, it is my intention; immediately we went up stairs, and we see four coming down stairs, two women and two men, one of the men was Barnard Solomon, and the other was Phillips; I asked them what they did there? and they immediately said, that they heard the alarm of a noise, but they did not know what was the matter; they said, for God's sake, what is the matter? Mr. Jarvis made answer and said, d-mn you, we will let you know what is the matter; Mr. Jarvis said, if you don't know what is the matter, we will let you know what is the matter; I believe them to be the words. We secured him, and gave him to the hands of the watchman; we went up stairs, we went to the bed room on the left hand, and we did not discover any person there, but we examined the bed, and on the bed we found a pillow that was tied up at one end, and a woman's night cap on it, in the resemblance of a woman; I shewed it the gentlemen; I see a number of vials containing physic, and them kind of things, some stood on a mantel piece, and some stood on a pair of drawers; and directions on them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else laying about the room? - Not to my knowledge, material.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a blunderbuss in the room? - I picked up the stock of it in the passage, and then I picked up the lock and the barrel in the front room, under the grate, and several pieces in different parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that part of the blunderbuss in the passage, near about where Idswell was laying? - About a yard from him. When we had been in the bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010019"/>room we came down stairs and went into the yard, and by going round into the privy the door was fastened, and Mr. Jarvis put his hand to the top, and said, if you don't open the door I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there? -

I was there that night, I was sent for to the watch-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010020"/>in Artillery-place. When I came to the watch-house, the first person that I knew was Day, I knew him perfectly well, as being one of the gaolers belonging to New Prison; he catches hold of me by the hand, and says, Ray, I am glad to see you; I said, what is the matter? he said, I have been over persuaded by Charles to bring Idswell out, and I believe he is shot. I waited there for about five or ten minutes, a coach came to the door, I went to the door, and the coachman said, the man is dead; I opened the coach door, and saw Idswell dead at the bottom of the coach; I helped put him into the engine-house, and searched him, and found on him fifty-three guineas, eight watches, a ring, a pair of silver buckles and some papers; this paper I took from his right hand waistcoat pocket.(Produced and read.)</p>
               <p>"This fellow who goes with me has a blunderbuss under his coat, so if you think it will frighten any of the family, put it off till another day. Your's sincerely."</p>

There was not an opportunity of searching the prisoners as they ought to be searched in the watch-house, there was such a crowd of people; when I took them to prison I got a candle, and from Handland I took off a stocking that had some blood on it, and the foot of it was all soaked in blood, and all very fresh.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed this night, as I supposed, by the noise of fire, and I went to the top of my house, and I see two men at the bar, Henley and Heydon. (The house where I live is eleven doors off) I see them on the top of the house, next door to me, on the top of some back sheds, or wash-house, making their escape over the tiles; I asked them what business they had there? they said they had been after some jews that were concerned in some stamps; some neighbours said, don't mind what they say, they were two thieves; and I took them, I held them till Day came.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Tilley. I stand charged with being concerned in aiding and assisting the prisoner Idswell Idswell to make his escape out of prison. To prove which, it is represented that I frequently attended them at the gaol; I would wish first to observe that the Idswells were totally strangers to me, I was not concerned as their attorney, but as an agent for Mr. Radley, as such I visited them a number of times; during the whole times that I visited them I never had the least intention, or ever did any thing at all to induce the turnkeys to take Idswell Idswell out of prison. With respect to the scheme of the sick aunt in the house of Artillery-lane, I never knew any thing of it, I never was in the house in my life. The reason why I was more with the Idswells lately then formerly was, because at first I was not allowed to see them but in the presence of the turnkey, but within four or five days before the escape, I had permission to see them alone; they were in different prisons, and I went backwards and forwards in assisting them in their defence, sometimes from prison to prison to them. During the whole time that I attended them as their solicitor, I never used any unfair means whatever to assist them to plan any scheme for their escape. Day, the turnkey, on his examination at Bow-street, declared that I had mentioned nothing at all to him; he now thinks proper to swear, that on my calling to him, I said I had been drinking with Bryant, and that I had told him that Moses was going home that night to keep the passover with his wife and family? that circumstance I must solemnly deny, though I cannot prove false, because he says no other but himself and me was present. The fact was, that I had not been with Bryant, and that I made use of no such expression, nor do I think that I see Day at all, if I did it is very possible that I might tell him that his master wanted him; it is impossible for me to contradict that assertion of Day's, that he very well knows. He at one time swears I was six times at the prison that day, he another time swears I was four times; the reason of being so often was, being first at one prison with one brother, and then going to another prison to another, and then for some things in the preparing of the defence requested to go back; but during the whole of my attendance, I attended for no other purpose then taking and preparing the defence; and so far as my having a sum of money for assisting their escape, I have not yet been paid my bill, there is a matter of fifty pounds now due to me from them; if I had known there was any intention of an escape, or thought there was a plan of an escape, I had seventy-five pounds in my hands, and I might have paid myself what was due to me. With respect to Day meeting me in Artillery-street, he swears that he see me at one time coming out of the house, at another time I was coming from the door; I did meet him at that time, I did not know in what street I was; it is true he stopped me, I suppose he knew me, he says, for God's sake don't say that you see me here to night; I said, it is nothing to me, if you do any thing wrong you must answer for it yourself. I had a message sent me the next day from Mr. Flood, but if I had not, I was going to tell what I had seen, when I heard of the accident that had happened, that I had met the prisoner and the turnkey in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010022"/>street. Day knows that I cannot contradict him, because I have no witness.</p>
               <p>With respect to Bowley, he at one time says that he spoke to me in a whisper, and it was so low that no person in the room could hear it but me; if the fact was as he wishes to represent it, that I was acquainted with the scheme, there was no necessity of his whispering to me, nor me to him, I did not do any thing of the kind, I never had any conserence with Bowley, nor any body at all in this business; I solemnly declare that I always acted fairly as an attorney; it is not probable that having a good character as an attorney to that time, as I had, that I should engage in such a scheme, and if I had been consulted on it by Idswell, I should have advised him from it. When I went away on Friday night I was desired to be with him early on the Saturday morning, and I meant to go to him, but I heard that he was killed. If they had such a scheme in their minds, it certainly never was their intention to let me know of it; Idswell and his wife always talked Hebrew before me, so whatever scheme they had in their heads, it was kept from me. With respect to Day I never did persuade him to take out his prisoner; with respect to the conversation with Bryant, it is false, and was it of consequence I would make my affidavit of it if I was going out of the world this moment. Both Bowley and Day have taken care to six times when there was nobody present but themselves, therefore it places me in that situation that it is impossible for me to contradict them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. At the time this accident happened I was out of town.</p>
               <p>Court. That is proved already.</p>
               <p>Jones. I thought I was in duty bound, as my niece was ill, and had warning to quit, to take an apartment for her; I did not go and take it in any clandestine manner, I told the woman of the house who I was, and what I was, and I agreed with her for the apartment.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Crosswell. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardwicke. I am a ticket porter, unfortunately I was hired with another man to move the goods, and I received fifteen shillings and sixpence for myself and the other man, and there was some more money due to me; and as to what Mr. Day has said against me, it is totally false, because since the last trial I am told that he is the man that actually did fire the piece off, and to save himself he has pitched on me; I never was out of the room, I was by the fire side when Mr. Skelton came and took me in the front room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Heydon. My wife is a washerwoman, and she washed for Mrs. Jones at different times; this day my wife was had with a fore leg, she could not go son the things to wash, and it being Good Friday I had not been at work, I had been drinking; when I came home about nine o'clock, she said, there was a person there that wanted me to go for some soul linen, and they already owed a little bill. And I went to Artillery-street, and asked the maid if her mistress was within? she said, no, and asked me up stairs, saying she would be in presently; and while I was there this accident happened. What Mr. Bowley has swore of my being in Fashion-street, is wrong, for I never see Mr. Tilley nor Hardwicke, nor any of the prisoners at the bar before, they are all strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Handland. I was passing by at the time of this bustle, and I went in with the watchman, for I was very much intoxicated, so I don't know how I got into the house; I am innocent of the charge laid to me; I worked till nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010023"/>o'clock that morning, and then my master told us to make holiday, and we went to drinking; I know nothing of any of the prisoners at the bar, never see them till that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Delany. I was at work that day in Thames street, at a steel-house, and we worked late, and afterwards went a drinking of some grog, and I was passing by the watch-house at this time, going home, when I see the mob, and just spoke to one man going in, and asked what was the matter? and they shoved me in along with them; here is a gentleman knows that I was at work that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jacobs. I hope your lordship and gentlemen of the jury will be very cautious as to the evidence that Day has given; in the first place he is a turnkey, secondley he is a villain in betraying of his trust. This fellow used to admit people to see the Idswell at any hour of the night, at either eleven, twelve, or one o'clock in the morning, because he got a guinea for every one he so admitted. He charges me with coming frequently to the prison, at the same time he knows I am a relation, I am a brother-in-law to the deceased, and I used to come to the prison either with a parcel or a letter, whatever it was I delivered it into the lodge, if it was a parcel, the parcel was opened, and if it was a letter the letter was read before it was taken up; I waited in the lodge till the person came down again, I never was admitted to go up stairs, which I might have done if I would have chose to pay a guinea, but that I could not, and so I never was admitted up to see him, therefore how can I be charged with planning his escape, when I never was with him to plan it, nor has any one evidence said that I was ever with him, since, or before it was planned. I look on the whole of them to be a parcel of villains, from Samuel Newport to the whole of them; Samuel Newport charged him a guinea a week for a small room, and was always extorting presents, and I dare say he has the watch in his pocket now. Certainly he has done it with a villanous intent.</p>
               <p>As for this other man (Roberts) he has been often tried, but now he is deputy governor, deputy gaoler, clerk of the papers, dog-whipper, and the Lord knows what. This Roberts has been guilty of the same thing as Day was guilty of, in betraying his trust; there was an order given by the magistrate, that the two Idswells should not be permitted to see one another, and for that very reason they were committed to different gaols. Now, when they were examined before the justice, there was always a man placed between them, that they should not speak together; but this Roberts, he says to the other gaoler, who had the other Idswell in custody, mind before you take your prisoner to gaol again, to stop at a house in Gray's inn lane, where I will bring my prisoner. My Lord he got twenty guineas for that job, which he know I know; therefore is such a fellow to be believed in any thing he says? If any man has planned his escape, he is the only man that planned it, because this governor came up to Idswell one day, and says, I am very sorry to inform you that your case is very dangerous, and I have it from good authority that it will prove fatal to you; the next day Roberts came to him, and it was told him if he could get eight hundred pounds he might get his liberty; Idswell told him he had not such a sum at present to give him, but says he, if you will admit me to go and see an old aunt I will do it; accordingly it was agreed that Day should go out with him, and with this private order, says Roberts to Day, if you get the money let him escape, if not bring him back, or shoot him, which order he executed to my sorrow; and the gaolers who lets a prisoner escape, are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010024"/>more culpable than the prisoners themselves.</p>
               <p>My lord, how can I be charged with assisting and aiding the prisoner in his escape, when the escape was made before I see him, because the moment Day took him out of the gaol the escape was made. Did I go to the gaol? no; Day is to be blamed, and none of us.</p>
               <p>I have been charged with being in Fashion-street the night this escape was made; I will first give you a reason for that; the house in Fashion-street, where I was, is my uncle's, and this was our holiday time, my wife and I were there at supper, and that was the reason of my being in the house that night.</p>
               <p>When I came up to this gaol, which is the first time I was ever before any justice for any criminality whatever, I was loaded with heavy irons as ever I could bear them, I was locked up in a cell day and night, I was kept without fire and candle and bed, obliged to lay on bare boards; the victuals that was brought to me, was brought to me as far as from Tower-hill; if it so happened that this great man, Roberts, was there, it was kept in the lodge, he hauled it about till he mangled it entirely to pieces, to see whether there was any writing of my wife's to me in it; and when I was taken to be examined, instead of taking me back again to prison, I was frequently put into a house for the sake of shew, at the

            ; we were put into a place where we were railed in like a cage, and one keeper put at the door, who permitted any one to come in who paid him, and being ten days without being shaved or shifted, we looked very pale and miserable; I told them it was scandalous and shameful, and I said I would tell the court of it when I came to be tried; then I complained of this usage to justice Flood, but this great man, Mr. Newport had such an awe over the justice, that he thought nothing about it, and I was threatened if I said any more, I should be put into the black hole, and I was afraid it was such a black hole as at Calcutta, and so I said no more about it. Now whether it was from a deal of money I spent that day, or bow, but I had the happiness to see the Great Mogul; I met a dutchman, I asked him if he had seen my wife? he said, yes, and that she had employed a counsel for my defence, I asked him who it was? he said he was told his name was Knapp. However there we staid, and there this rascal, Day was seated at a mahogany table, with a tumbler of red wine and some nutmeg, to raise his poor spirits, least he should saint. But I am not now in their hands, here I am in a court of justice, before a good and humane judge, who hears me patiently, and a good humane jury, who will consider our lives and liberty before they take it away.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cummings charges me with being at the house, I think she has every reason to remember me, as there was a little incident that happened between her and me, for either on Wednesday or Thursday before this happened, I was in the kitchen, I was there to take care of the things; Mrs. Cummings comes into the kitchen, and makes a deep curtsey, but the curtsey was not made to me, it was to a glass of rum that I had in my hands, it was made to that; says I, ma'am will you drink a drop with me? she did condescend to drink with me, and so I think she must remember me.</p>
               <p>At Bow-street her husband was examined, but they have not brought him forward here; the prosecutors are in court, and they know what I say to be fact; he was there asked where he was that night; he said, please your worship at ten o'clock I went home; says the justice was not you at home? so at last, with a good deal of yawning, he said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010025"/>have parted with my wife. My Lord she is a bad woman, and it is a great misfortune that there is nothing but whores and rogues that swear against us; as to Bowley, he I must not touch, he is like a cobweb, if I was touch it it would break; he charges me with being in the house, I say I was in the house, it is what I don't want to contradict. I will not detain the court any longer, I shall therefore conclude, and leave my cause first to God, and then to your lordship and gentlemen of the jury to decide.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Solomons. Some little time after the prisoner Idswell was apprehended on the occasion of the stamps, Mr. Phillips came to my house, and said, that Mr. Estcourt had sent for him, and told him, that if he could procure the dies, he would give him two hundred pounds, accordingly I went to Mrs. Idswell, and I said to her, if you can get the dies belonging to the stamps, it may be the means of liberating Mr. Idswell; says she, I cannot give them you now, but if you will call on Friday, I will tell you where you may find them. On Friday, about half past ten, Phillips came to me, and says to me, now we will go to Mrs. Idswell's, to put us in possession of the dies; accordingly we went to her in Artillery-street, and we were told she was at Mr. Jones's, in Fashion-street; we knocked at the door, and asked if Mrs. Idswell was there? we were told no, she was not there; and we stopped there till half after eleven, and we went again to No. 13, Artillery-street, and rung the bell, the servant came down, and said Mrs. Idswell would be home in a minute or two, and we went up and stopped, and being taken very ill I went down into the privy, into the yard; I went down into the yard, and had not been there the space of two minutes before I heard the alarm of murdor, with that I got into the yard, and going nearer to the yard door, I heard the report of a gun, and I retreated back into the privy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Phillips. When the two Idswells were taken, the officers at Bow-street came to my house for me, I was not at home, when I came home my wife told me that the officers of Bow-street had been for me; I went to Mr. Solomons the next morning, and told him that the officers of Bow-street had been for me, and if he would go up and see what they wanted with me, and would promise not to keep me in custody, I would go and surrender myself; he came back, and I went before the justice; Mr. Estcourt was there, and they told me I was to call on Mr. Lee, in Shoreditch; they asked me if I knew any thing about the dies? says he, if you will go round the family, and endeavour to find out where they are, you shall have two hundred pounds for your trouble; Mr. Townsend went with me to Mrs. Idswell, and they sent me to Swallow-street, I went there to inquire if I could find any thing of the dies. I said, will you give me leave to go with Mrs. Idswell, and amongst the family? and I will see if I can find them; Mr. Estcourt is in court now, and he cannot deny that what I say is truth. This Friday night I went along with Mr. Solomons, as he has said, and I was but just there, and Mr. Solomons had gone down into the yard, when I heard a scuffle, and the blunderbuss go off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Henley. I had bought a watch of Mr. Idswell for three guineas and a half, and I gave the watch back to be regulated, and then after that I heard that there were many watches gone to Bow-street; I had been looking after him some time, and could not find him; this day, Good Friday, being a leisure day, I thought proper to go again after this watch, I went to Duke-street, and there were a parcel of people there who were jews, and I asked if they knew where Mr. Idswell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010026"/>was? and they said he lived at No. 13, Artillery-lane; I went there and knocked at the door, and the servant maid opened the door, and I went up stairs, and there were two or three people there, and I went out backward, and I heard the report of a gun go off, and I went to make my escape backward, and two or three gentlemen asked me what was the matter? I said there was either fire or murder, and Mr. Spencer said, stand there still, or else I will fire on you; I told him he had no occasion to fire, I would deliver myself up.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Jones called eight witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hardwicke called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Haydon called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Delany called one witness who gave him a character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jacobs. As I was not indicted for a robbery, I did not think it necessary to have any body here, but I never was tried by any court before, and so I did not think it needful to trouble any of my friends.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Solomons called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Phillips called seven witnesses who gave him a very good character, and said he was a glass cutter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jacobs now called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Handland called his master who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>I am a commodore. I found this man absent from his work, and I followed, and went down the warehouse, and in following of him I observed something in the lining of his coat, and I judged it was tea; after this I asked Stuart to go and take hold of him; and he said he had rather not, and I went and laid hold of him, and took him down to the elder's counting house; immediately there was a King's officer sent for, and he searched him in my presence, and he took the tea from the lining of his coat, in both skirts.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have lived twenty years in Whitechapel parish, and thirteen years a housekeeper, and through fire, and not being insured, and distress, and one thing another has reduced me; I have sent to my friends in Whitechapel, if they would be so kind to come here and give me a character for the time that they knew me. I hope my Almighty maker will forgive me all my offences in my life time, and I hope for mercy at the hands of this honourable court; it is the first offence that I have been ever guilty of.</p>

            Where did she sit down? - In the tap room; and the pot was standing on the table; while she was sitting I missed it, and as she went out I followed her, and about three doors off I tapped her over the shoulder, and told her I should be glad to speak to her, I thought she had got some of my property about her; and she went to take the pot out of her pocket, I laid hold of her hand and stopped her from taking it out of her pocket; I told her the constable should take it out. I sent for a constable, and he took it out of her pocket in my house, in my presence.(The pot produced.) This is the pot that was taken out of her pocket, it was marked directly afterwards; here is the mark on it now.</p>

The constable who first took him into custody, I don't know who it was; it was on the other side of Blackstairs Bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this cotton? - About six or seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you stopped him? - I do not recollect, he appeared very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect him? - I was told that he had been seen carrying cotton from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me in your warehouse? - No, I never see you in it, but I see you stand at the door and put your hand in and take the cotton out.</p>

I worked at the water side, I have done so these twenty years, and I get a job where I can; here is a gentleman here, Mr. Miller, has known me these twenty-nine years about the water side; as I was coming down the street I was called to work by a man, a soldier, says he, will you earn sixpence? yes, says I; and he gives me a bag of cotton, or something, I suppose it may be cotton; and he says, if you will carry this to the White Horse, at the bottom of Wood-street, and leave it with the book-keeper, I will give you sixpence, and he gave me the sixpence first, and that gentleman stopped me with it, and said it was his, and he charged me with a constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this information and going after her, did you find her? - Yes, on the Sunday night following she came in my way, I met her between Execution Dock and Gun Dock, in Wapping, but the woman I could not swear to, but only by the appearance of her dress, I thought she was the same person, I stopped her, and she owned to the child directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the woman that you stopped? - Yes, that is the same woman that I stopped, and she owned to the child; I passed her for about twenty yards; Mrs. Redman was with me, and I said to Mrs. Redman, do you turn back and ask that woman whether her name is not Jodith Taylor? and she did, and when I came up to her she told me the child was at home; I brought her into Ratcliffe-highway, then she said she gave it to a woman in a brown camblet gown in the Blue Coat-fields; now, says I, tell me the truth, whether my child is at home or no; and she said she left it in Ratcliffe-highway; so she did, she left it at Mr. Dawson's cellar window, near Old Gravel-lane, and the child knew the maid of the public house, and asked her to carry her to her mother; and when I went home I found the child was taken home to my mother's.</p>

               <p>I went out with Mrs. Martin, and we went into a public house, Mr. Nuttall's, in Ratcliffe-highway, the Bull's Head, and had a pint of beer, and the child was running about.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Blue Coatfields, Shadwell? - Not a great way; I see the child in a woman's arms, and the child was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with Mrs. Martin on Sunday, when the child was found? - Yes; and I laid hold of the prisoner, between Execution Dock and Gun Dock; I did not know the woman, but the mother said, from the appearance, that was the woman, and I followed her, and took hold of her, and asked her if her name was not Judith Taylor? then I looked at the man that was with her, and I knew him to be the man that was her husband; and I said to Mrs. Martin, this is the woman, for this is the man that is her husband; and Mrs. Martin directly runs up to the woman, and says, where is my child; she bid us let her go; we would not let her go; and when we got home, the child was a bed at Mrs. Martin's mother's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Martin charge an officer with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing missing from the child? - The frock and skirt were off the child, and a check apron round the child, made into a gown.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I never spoke to her about it, it is false; this woman's sister came to my place, and went down on her knees, and asked whether I would make it up for half a guinea? and I did agree to it with the sister, but not with the prisoner, if they would shew me the things.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. Your crime is so distinguishable from the other larcenies, that are brought before us, from the attocity of it, that I think it proper particularly to mark it, that all persons hearing you tried, may know the punishment attendant upon the conviction of a crime under such circumstances as your's has been; I cannot conceive an offence more painful to society, than that you have committed. I don't know whether you have been the mother of children, but I found by one of the evidences who has spoken to your character, that you have had the care of children; I am very sorry to find that any one of your sex should be found so very devoid of feeling, for the purpose of getting plunder, as to rob a poor infant; under these circumstances I think it right to punish you with as much severity as the law will permit; therefore I now pass this sentence on you, that you be <rs id="t17950701-10-punish61" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>I am hostler with Mr. Toms. On Saturday night was a week, I received fourteen flats of butter from Mr. Jugg's waggon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see it afterwards? - No, not till they got it to Hammersmith, at the coffee house, where the gentlemen were.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the basket here? - No, it is gone down again. I know I missed one.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear it was the same? - No, I know there was one missing, that is all I can say.</p>

The next morning I went down to Mr. Hunt's shop, to look at some mutton, and I have every reason to believe it was the same sheep, by the colour of it, and being so remarkably sat. I cannot swear it was, because the back of the sheep was all cut off, and a deal of the sat.</p>

               <p>Q. You pursued this woman? - Yes; I found I could not do any thing, and I cried stop thief! and she was very soon stopped, getting through the posts, and she threw the shoes into Mr. Friend's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her? - I did not, Mr. Friend did.</p>
               <p>- FRIEND sworn.</p>
               <p>I was standing behind my counter on Saturday, the 13th of last month, about half after eight o'clock; I see the prisoner at the bar throw something into the shop, and almost at the same instant I see some people pursuing her, and took her, saying this is the woman; I then went round the counter to see what it was, and I see it was two pair of shoes. (Produced.) I delivered them to Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted you had never seen this woman before? - Above a hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you see her throw something in, what it was you did not know? What shop do you keep? - I am a watch-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. To Miller. Are those the shoes that Mr. Friend gave you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Collins. I know them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you keep a large shoe warehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you before taken an account of your stock? - The day before I had taken an account of these shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that these were in the shop at the time? - Yes, I knew they were the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body else serve in the shop besides you? - Yes, my wife does sometimes. These are my own manufactory, but not my own make.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had seen them in another shop, should you have known them? - I know the man's make, and I make such a few, that I take more notice than a man that makes a great many. I know them by my cutting.</p>
               <p>Q. That man is employed by other masters as well as you? - Yes, but I know the cut of the shoe, and the shape.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not such a cut, and such a shape, be in any other shoemaker's shop? - I believe if they were among five hundred pair I could pick them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen shoes of that description before? - Yes, that was the way that I learned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010041"/>Widegate-alley, and I had got a joint of meat in my apron, and a man came and laid hold of me, and then some gentleman that is here, came and brought something out. I know nothing about it, I am as innocent as a child that is just born; I never was guilty of any such thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Prosecutor. I believe that you have offered to settle this business, if it could be settled? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not for any sum of money? - No, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner two or three years, she lodged at my mother's. I went to the prosecutor, and asked him what he had lost? he said he had lost some shoes; says he, if you are in the mind to pay me for the shoes and my time for going against the prisoner, I will not appear; I asked him what sum? he said he would take twenty guineas; I then went to the prisoner at the bar; and told her of it, and she said she had not twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this? - Saturday night, after she was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - The mother of the prisoner at the bar, and we turned the woman out while he went to settle along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nobody by except you and he? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a confectioner, in Woolpack-alley, Houndsditch. I am a jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in his shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Have you heard what this man has said? - Yes. She was taken on Saturday evening, and he came to me on Saturday evening, and he came to me on Sunday morning, so he came and made a pitiful deplorable story of the case, and said he would give me two guineas if I would reconcile the matter, and not prosecute her; I told him she was in the course of the law, and I could not do any thing with regularity and justice. On Monday he came again, and offered me the same again, and I said I would not do it if he would give me twenty guineas; when the mother came I told her she must go through the law, and the worst that would come of it was transporation.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you offered to stop the prosecution, if they would give you twenty guineas? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Wynn. The young woman that this man came to enquire of me for, was in the hospital; she used to live along with me; I came down and told him where she was, and I drank some rum and water with him, and he told me he had been in Bow-fair all night; they went away at one o'clock, and came back again at two, and I was in this sailor's company, that I was to have gone on board a ship with. I gave him the key to go and sleep in my room; when he went to sleep, the young man that was with him drank the ale out, and went away. He is an old acquaintance, he has slept often with the young woman that lived with me, though he never did with me.</p>
               <p>Q. To Passey. Did you go into the bed room of these women any time of that day? - Yes, I went into the bed room to lay down, and take a little sleep, because I had a great way to go that night. After I got up I felt I had the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any body in the bed, or any body with you? - Nobody at all till after they came in, and then they came and sat down by me, just before they picked my pocket.</p>

And I am sure it is a very indecent action, the constable of the night searched me start naked. The prosecutor says he was sober, and I am sure he could not be sober pulling the womens patticoats up all along the street.</p>

               <p>I am a tobacconist and bookseller by trade, and a constable of St. John's, Westminster. I was sent for on the 5th of June, in the evening, to take a disorderly man into custody, and when I came to the house, they told me that the man had got a gold chain about him; I told him if he had such a thing about him, he must shew it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man? - The prisoner at the bar. He told me he had no such thing; I told him that I should insist on searching of him, if he did not product it, so then he took it out of his pocket, and threw it down on the tap room tables, I asked him how he came by it? he told me that he stole it from a thief, asking me at the same time, if it was mine? I told him if he stole it I should make him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010051"/>answer for that in another place, or words to that effect; then I said to him, now tell me the truth, how came you by it? says he, I gave seven shillings for it to a jew; I said, you say you bought it of a jew, I think a jew would know better what he was about, I shall take you into custody; I did not question him any more after that, I was satisfied that he could not come by it properly, according to my opinion; afterwards I heard there had been a gentleman enquiring for such a thing at Queen's-square.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the chain, I lost on the 4th of June.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was the King's birth day, I was quartered at St. James's; at night I went and had some sapper; afterwards as I was coming home through the Park I saw two gentleman, that gentleman and another, walking arm and arm together, and as I came nigher to them I heard some conversation, and I heard one gentleman ask the other gentleman to have concern with him; one gentleman put his umberella down against the seat, and that gentleman put down his breeches, and they fell to work with each other, and I was about six yards from them; I jumped up to them, and they ran off, and I ran after them, thinking to charge the centry with him, and with their running away with their breeches down, they dropped the watch, and I picked it up; that is the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am totally unguarded for the accusation of such a crime, but I think I can prove an alibi, where I was at the time. Good heavens is it possible!</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. When was it you say this happened? - In the Bird Cagewalk, on the 4th of June, at half past eleven at night; right opposite the recruit house, by the corner of Queen's-square.</p>
               <p>Q. They dropped the watch, and you took up the chain? - I took up the watch and chain both together; I don't know that they belong to these gentlemen, I thought there was no person had a greater right to them than myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - It rained very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the justice, did you tell him this story? - No, I told him that I bought it of a jew. Likewise this gentleman came down to me to Tothillfields, and told me to make the best story I could, and he would never appear against me. I desired to speak to the gentleman by himself; and he said, he would not for a hundred guineas have it known.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with the gentleman? - The serjeant, Evans, and the constable (I don't know his name) of Queen-square office. I have no witness, the serjeant and the company that I belonged to, went abroad yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Where were you on the 4th of June, at eleven o'clock at night? - I dined out, and I returned home early in the evening. I live with Mr. Bursland, Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through the Park in your way home? - No, I did not, I dined at Stone's-end, at the King's Bench, with Major

               <p>Q. Do you remember the time of his coming home that night? - I think it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010052"/>be about the hour of half after ten or eleven, I don't think it was later than eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you that day with him? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bly. Did you go to Bridewell with this prisoner at the time he was committed? - I did, I took him down there, it was in the evening when I first apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor, Mr. Frizell, in the gaol at any time with you? - No, he was not, I heard that he had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you go to this man in gaol? - I had been at Bow street office to give information of the loss of my watch; and on Saturday following I heard of somebody that had been taken up on suspicion of having stolen a watch; that was late in the evening; on Sunday I went with an intention to see if it was mine, and the office was shut, and I met a serjeant, and I asked him if he could tell me whether the report was true, of a soldier being taken up for stealing a watch? I never see the serjeant before; the serjeant said, yes, he recollected perfectly well that there was a man taken up with a gold chain, and that he was at Tothillfields, and that he would go with me if I chose. I went with the serjeant to Tothill-fields, to hear if I could hear of my watch, because at this time I had never seen chain not any thing else; and when we went there the soldier was called up by the name of Young.</p>

            Was there any constable of the office went with you? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name? - I don't know. And I immediately said, what a disagreeable situation you have brought yourself into by this act; I said, I suppose you are the man that has got the stolen watch; and he denied it, and said he had got no watch, but he had a chain which he honestly bought of a jew; I told him to be perfectly guarded in what he was saying; he said he was perfectly so, and he could bring evidence to prove that he bought it of a jew.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were by at the time? - There was one man that was with the serjeant, and the constable, and the person who opened the door. When he told me that, I said, be prepared against your trial, for I said it was not my intention to hurt him, for I would not take a man's life away for fifty times the value; on which as I was going away he called me aside privately, he said, as I seemed to be a gentleman not inclined to hurt him, he had not got the watch, but he could put me in a method of getting of it, if I would call the day following, and if I did not appear to swear to the chain, that he of course would be dismissed, and he would restore the chain and watch and all; I told him I would promise by no means such a thing as that, and asked him where the watch was? he told me he could not tell, but if I would call the day following, he would tell me more particular of it.</p>

            Did you call the next day? - No, I did not, I went to Queen's-square office the next day to give evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Bly. I don't think that I have done my duty, except I tell your lordship that when I heard that Mr. Frizell had been enquiring after his chain, I went after him, and told him that I thought it was necessary that he should go and speak to the magistrate, and he rather turned his back to me at the time; whether he did it from tenderness to the prisoner or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to Mr. Frizell with the chain? - I believe it was the Tuesday or the Wednesday following, after the King's birth day.</p>

            To Frizell. You say that you appeared the next day at the office at Queen-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010053"/>square, after having been at Bridewell on Sunday? - Perhaps it was not the next day, but if it was not it was Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Bly. Then I went and told the justice that I had seen the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know any thing of this gentleman? - One of the constables of Queen's-square told me that there was a gentleman outside of the door that had been to enquire after a gold chain. That was on Tuesday, at the office; I followed him, and asked him if he had lost a gold chain? and Mr. Frizell seemed to be rather angry with me, and turned on one side; I asked him if it was his? I cannot exactly say what he said then, but I think he asked who I was, or what I was? or something to that effect; I shewed him the chain, and he seemed to be very indifferent about it, and walked away, rather displeased than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - He did, but I cannot exactly recollect what expressions he made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when Mr. Frizell was examined before the magistrate? - I was; I don't know whether he meant to be examined, but he wished to have his chain, because he did not like to swear to it, and the justice said, if he would not make his affidavit, whether it was or was not his chain, he must be under the disagreeable necessity of committing him for contempt of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the difficulty about swearing to the chain? - He said he had such a chain, but he did not choose to say that was his. When I told Mr. Pye, the justice, that he did not choose to come in, he sent Mr. Shepherd out to him; he came in with Shepherd, Shepherd brought him in.</p>

               <p>Q. To Frizell. When did you first miss your watch? - Not till after I got home from dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had been to see the company pay their court to the King? What part of the town had you be? - I was at St. James's-gate part of the time, and the other part of the time in St. James's Park, and retired to dinner about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been there in the evening, to see them go to the ball? - No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prosecutor coming to make the charge? - He came with very much reluctance; he was waiting while the prisoner was being examined about the chain, at the corner of Queen's-square, in the Broadway, Westminster. One of the magistrates desired me to go to him, and speak to him in a genteel manner, and desire him to wait on the magistrate; I did so, and the gentleman returned with me back to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any difficulty in going back with you? - He said, what was he to go back for? I said the magistrate desired to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. On that he came back? - He did. When he came before the magistrate he hesitated very much in swearing to the chain.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the morning was this? - Between nine and ten o'clock, and I missed a quantity of halfpence out of the cupboard, I believe there was between four and five pounds worth; I went to my wife, and asked her if she knew what became of the halfpence, and to know who had been to her in the bar in the night, while I was out; she said that Martin had been there.

               <p>Q. Have you a house of your own? - I rent one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any property out of that house, and when? - Yes, on the 24th of June, a bank note; it was in my coat pocket; I left it in my pocket book. The lad lived with me as a servant; I left the coat off over night, and put on a morning gown that I have, and went up stairs, and in brushing the coat he took the note out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in your coat? - I am very sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you discover the note was gone? - I did not discover it till the next morning. I discharged him in the morning, he did not suit my service at all; and I went to get some change out of my pocket book, and I missed the note, and I went to the magistrate and got a warrant, and I had a suspicion that he was gone to the White Horse coffee house; I went there, and I see him sitting with some wine before him, and I went in and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010056"/>took him myself, and there he was searched, and we found he had a great deal of money about him, and had bought a good deal of clothes; and afterwards he confessed that he took the note and had changed it, and bought some clothes with it; but that he had left nine guineas in the coach that I took him to the magistrate's in; he said he changed it at a Mr. Banks's shoe warehouse, in Oxford-street. I went the next morning to Mr. Banks, and Mr. Banks had the very note in his hand, going to pay it away; I told him he must not pay it away; he said he must, for he must make the payment; I said, not with that; and I took that note from him, and gave him another bank note of the same value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say that you went to the White Horse cellar, Piccadilly, and there this man confessed? - No, I did not, he confessed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What promise did you make him to induce him to confess? - None.</p>

I think it is spelt.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you see there? - Mrs. Sullivan was there, and her husband at breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other there? - Not the first time that I went. I went and asked her for as much of her money that she sold as she could afford for three shillings, (I only having three shillings) she said, if I took it in halfpence and small sixpences, I should have seven shillings and sixpence for my three shillings; I refused them and went back again, and told my husband; I told her I did not know that they would do, but I would go back and ask, and I came away; nothing more passed at that time. I went back and told my husband and the other two officers. As soon as I told my husband he sent me back again, for the halfpence, if I could not get silver. Then Mrs. Sullivan was in the house and Conway; I told Mrs. Sullivan that the halfpence would do, and I was come for them; and then I gave her three shillings of good money into her hand, and she put her boanet on and went out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010057"/>Q. Had any thing passed between you and Conway at that time? - No, I did not speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Sullivan you say went out? - Yes, and was gone the best part of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass while Sullivan was out? - Yes; there came another young woman into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Sullivan say when she was going out? - She said she was going to get the money. While she was out a young woman came in, Conway asked the young woman whether she would take a walk with her that afternoon? and she asked her where she was going? and she told her she was going over Blackfriars Bridge, into the Borough, and so over London Bridge, home the other way, for the people of the Borough were very easy to be done, and it was some time ago since she was there, that she thought they might welcome her again, for she made a very good afternoon's work when she was there before; and the young woman promised to go with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she meant by that expression? - Passing of bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it to be explained? - Conway was telling the other young woman that she had but two shillings in her pocket the last night, and one she changed for some eggs, and the other for some thread, and the remainder she had got a good supper with.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Sullivan say when she came back? - She said she had not got the money, but she had paid for it, and it would be ready in an hour's time; I told her I had not breakfasted, and in that time I would go home and get my breakfast, and come back again. I went and told my husband that it would not be ready for an hour.</p>

            When you returned again what happened then? - Both the prisoners were there then. The money was not come then. Mrs. Sullivan says to Conway, would she go and see if it was ready, and she went, and was gone the best part of a quarter of an hour; Conway went out for it, and came back again, and told Mrs. Sullivan that the gentleman was not at home; then Mrs. Sullivan said, she thought it was not finished. Then Conway sat a little space of time, and then said to me, will you take some large shillings? and I told her I did not know what she meant by large shillings; then she told me she would shew me; and she pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket, where she had got seven shillings wrapped up, and she gave Mrs. Sullivan six of them, and Mrs. Sullivan gave them to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give for these six? - Three shillings. Sullivan told me that she sold the great shillings at sixpence a piece. I went and carried the money to the officers, and they made me go down and shew them the woman that gave me the money. My husband and the other officers were waiting for me in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money? - I marked it first with a fork, before I delivered it out of my hand, and gave it to my husband in a paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now, Mrs. Elden, who were you employed by to give all this evidence? - My husband had information and he sent me.</p>

            Were you ever on any of these errands before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite a fresh hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband sent you, you say; was that by the direction of any body else? - Only by the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. So he was determined you should find it out. You went for shillings at first, and then they offered halfpence, and then you came back to him for advice. The money would not have been put off at all, unless you had gone there? - They would hardly have brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. So this is the first time that you have been here as a witness? - Yes, it is the very first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that when you asked Mrs. Sullivan the first time, you asked her for money? - I asked her for as much of her money as she could afford for three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of the word whites? - I did not use that word.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were searched? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing found on Sullivan? - She slung a sixpence out of her left hand pocket, and Conway threw away a shilling, wrapped up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Conway was the person that took the seven shillings out of her pocket, and she was the person who gave it to Mrs. Sullivan? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mrs. Sullivan did not give you the money out of her own pocket, but she gave you what she received from Conway? - Yes; Conway brought it in and gave it to Mrs. Sullivan.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was Conway's payment to you, and not Mrs. Sullivan's? - I did not say any thing to Conway about it. Mrs. Conway says to Mrs. Sullivan, after I told her shillings would do, she says, Mrs. Sullivan, I will lend you six shillings, but I must have them again in the course of the afternoon, because I am going out.</p>
               <p>Q. So she gave them you by the desire of Mrs. Conway? - Yes; she lent them to Mrs. Sullivan, for I had paid Mrs. Sullivan for the money.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Elden. This is the money that I had of Sullivan.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find them both in the same house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it? - Mrs. Sullivan's house, in Cock-court, Snow-hill, a private house. Mrs. Sullivan sat by the fire side, and Mrs. Conway by the window; going in I was surprized to see her, because I knew her; I had her here last session; she threw down a shilling before I could take hold of her, and I see Mrs. Sullivan throw a sixpence into the ashes, which I picked up; then we searched them, and found nothing about them, and went and searched about the house, and found nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any good money on them? - No, nothing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. So this was a scheme of you and your wife, to lay hold of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010059"/>defendants by any means? - By all means.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are servant to Mr. Sudlowe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with him the 22d of last month? - Yes, I did, I was in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010060"/>Laundry, at the top of the house, when the bell rung; hearing the bell ring I came down stairs; when I came down one pair of stairs, I looked down the stairs over the banisters (it is a wall stair case) and I see Mrs. Moore in the passage, and the prisoner going down stairs, I see her within five stairs of the passage, going down I said to Mrs. Moore, did you see a woman with a child going down stairs? she said, yes. I ran after her, I overtook her in Pudding-lane, I took hold of her arm, and asked her what business she had up one pair of stairs, No. 4, Monument-yard, at Mr. Sudlowe's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the one pair of stairs? - The dining room. She said she went to enquire after one Mr. Williams, an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any such person as Mr. Williams, at No. 4, or in any other part of the Monument-yard? - No, such person. She came back with me, and I left her in the care of Mrs. Moore, and went up stairs to the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time she was in the stair case to the time you took her, did you ever lose sight of her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go up to the dining room? - To see if any thing was missing, because I knew there was plate there. I missed three silver table spoons and two salt spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen them in that room? - A quarter of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find the salt cellars themselves, and the other furniture of the table? - I found that two of the salt cellars were emptied of their salt, and the salt laying at the dining room door, chucked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Having made these observations, what became of you? - I went down stairs immediately, and on going down I heard some spoons rattle, the noise of the silver spoons falling.</p>
               <p>Q. How near might you be to the prisoner at the time that these spoons fell? - I met her coming up the kitchen stairs; Mrs. Moore was sitting in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of hearing this a search was made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were found? - Yes; they were found at the bottle rack, three table spoons and two salt spoons, at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that near the situation where the prisoner had placed herself? - Yes, it was; she went down stairs while I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that as you went down the dining room stairs, you met her coming up the kitchen stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is the same in Mr. Sudlowe's house as it is in many other person's of business, that on any person's knocking they are let in by the clerk in the office, by a string that fastens to the lock; so then if they have business in the office they go into the office, if they have business in the house, they go into the house? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the office on the right hand or left hand side of the passage? - On the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any person in the office see who comes into the passage? - They cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. May or may not a person, going into Mr. Sudlowe's, get admittance into the dining room without seeing any person in the house? - They may.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many persons are there in the house besides yourself? - Only one, the Cooke and myself; we were both washing in the laundry.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sudlowe's street door is kept shut? - It is.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no reason to suppose that she had ever been there before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it is necessary to knock at the door, and one of the clerks opens it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she told you that she had been enquiring for a Mr. Williams at the house? - She made no enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. The Cooke is not here? - She knew nothing of it; she was up in the laundress, and heard nothing of it, till it was all over.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not observe any person till there was a ring at the door, the induced you to look down, and there you see Mrs. Moore, the laundress? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. There are a great many Mr. Williams about town, you know, It had been a quarter of an hour before since you had seen these things, and therefore who had been there you cannot tell?</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you were at the house of Mr. Sudlowe's, on the 22d of June? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it? - About one o'clock. I take in clear starching; I see the prisoner at the box there; I see her come down stairs out of the dining room. When I came first to the house, I went to the kitchen stairs and called out for Etty, the maid; the street door was open; I called out Etty; nobody answered; the servant not answering the call, I went to the street door and rang the house bell.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go up stairs? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how soon after you had rang the bell, did you observe the prisoner at the bar? - Momentarily; as soon as it was possible to come down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ring the bell for the purpose of seeing the servant, as she did not answer to your call? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. As soon as you rung, you almost see the prisoner at the bar. From whence did she proceed? - Apparently from the dining room; I could not see the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come down the stairs leading from the dining room? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any conversation with you as she passed? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after she passed down the stairs, did you see the last witness? - Before the prisoner at the bar had got down the last stairs Etty was in sight, and she asked me whether I see the person going down with the child in her arms? I told her yes; and she ran after the prisoner, without giving me an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring her back? - Yes; she desired me to take care of her, while she went up stairs to see what was gone off the side board.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you, that she did go up stairs, and left the woman in your charge? - She did.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sent for to Mr. Sudlowe's, on the 22d of June last? - Yes, between two and three o'clock. They gave me charge of the woman at the bar; I asked what charge I was to take? and they said they thought she had robbed them; I said, have you searched her? they said, no; and the maid said, you have no occasion to search, for I heard her drop the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go below? - I did, with a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you exercise your eye sight on the place? Was it dark or light? - Dark; and just facing the bottoms, rather beyond it, under a bottle rack, I picked up these spoons; (produced) I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr.Knowlys. You did not search her at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. She had a child with her at that time? - She had.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have it to my counsel. I went to a house in the Church yard, which I thought was Mr. William's, I knocked at the parlour door; nobody answered. Mrs. Moore came in, and the servant came down stairs, and came after me, and she asked we what I wanted? I told her I had been to ask for one Mr. Williams; she said come back with me. I went with her; she went up stairs, I stopped while she went, and stopped with Mrs. Moore; she says I went down the kitchen stairs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010063"/>but I did not, I stopped all the time by her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character, who said she was a married woman, her husband sold fish, and kept a potatoe warehouse.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Tuesday, the 26th of May, the prisoner Chamberlain was brought down to Bow-street; on searching of her, I found the duplicates on her of the gown and breeches; with that she said it was a young man that had gave her the duplicate; and by the description Mr. Cox thought it was one of the persons that lived in the house. We went to the house, and that was not the person; in the mean time Mr. Harrison's man came and said he had stopped two women, and I went to the two women, and Spencer said she had the things of one Jones, and I went and took Jones into custody; but before that I went to Bambridge-street and there found this crow in the room; then I went with it to Cox's room, and this instrument fits one part of the impression against the door; there had been two instruments used, and this fits one impression. Spencer took me to Jones's lodgings, thinking to find him, for she said his wife was in trouble, and when we came to Bow-street there she was in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Jones. On Saturday night, the 23d Day of the Month, I happened to go up to this young woman's room, and I sat down for the space of five or six minutes, and she was then doing something to that petticoat, which she said she had given her that night, and the bonnet, by one of her young men; and he had left there a pair of breeches for her to pawn, and she asked me if I would be so kind as to go and pawn them for her? which I went and pawned them, it was between ten and eleven o'clock. The pawnbroker asked me where I lived? and I could not rightly recollect the street where she lived, and I said, Tottenham-court-road. I went to her and gave her the money and ticket, and slept with her that night. Sunday morning this young man came and knocked at the door, and we both got up and put our clothes on, and when he came in he said, I think, ma'am, you do it; what he meant by it I don't know;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010066"/>he then asked her whether she had done what he desired? she said, yes; and she gave him seven shillings, which I received from the pawnbroker; and we sat down all three and had breakfast; and then I went, and I never see him since. On Monday I went again, and slept there that night; on Tuesday morning this young woman got up about nine o'clock, and I had but three halfpence in my pocket, I had two waistcoats and I said she might take the under waistcoat and pawn it, to get a breakfast; I was still in bed; and after she had been out some time, she sent an elderly woman to me(I was still in bed, having the head ach with drinking too much, it being holiday time) to desire me to pawn a petticoat and bonnet; and I thought it was an odd thing for me to go and pawn, and I saw these two young women, and I asked them to pawn them for me, as my wife was in trouble; and this young woman came out and said the pawnbroker had stopped them, and I went to the public house, and told the young woman where I was, and they came with the constable and took me.</p>

I was ordered to stand up on some steps, and there was a gentleman sitting reading some news papers, and he asked me what my name was? Mr. Cooke made answer and said, William Harris; he said, have you got your bounty? and he said, here it is for him, and he put seven guineas into my hand; he took me back again to the Star and Gartor.</p>

               <p>Q. A soldier? - Yes.

               <p>Court. Did you receive this indenture from the master at any time? - I see the master give it to the lad's mother, that is here, and she gave it to me. The first that I see of the indenture was on the 12th of May, after the master had been at Marlborough street to get a warrant to bring him up from Guildford; in Silver-street, Golden-square, at Mr. Scott's house; I went there at the desire of his mother; I had been there once before. or twice.</p>

Did you ask him about the indenture when you went before? - No, not till this boy was absent, and he wrote up that he was confined in Guildford gaol, and then the mother applied at Marlborough street office, for a warrant to bring an apprentice up; I think the mother went with me to the master's, when I applied for the indenture and I think it was the 12th of May.</p>

            Did you make a memorandum of it at the time? - Not at the time, till he was sworn in. Every morning after my breakfast I go down to the Star and Garter, to approve of the men that may be brought there as recruits; he was brought there by one Brown, he was to have ten guineas bounty, and three to be deducted for the clothes, knapsack and accoutrements; he was brought down stairs as usual, into the parlour before he was attested, he was brought into the parlour to me; I asked him, my lad, are you willing to go for a soldier? yes, says he, I am; says I, what trade are you? he told me he was a porter that he carried out small parcels; I asked him if he had been ill, for he looked rather as I thought weakley, and I made a cemical observation of him, I said he will make a very good man-midwife, for he has got very long fingers. Now, says I, you are perfectly willing to go into the Louth Volunteers? yes, says he, I am; says I, you are not an apprentice? no, says he, I am not; the consequence was, I told him to go up into the room along with the rest of the recruits; but prior to that, says I, will you like to leave any of the bounty in my hands; no, says he, I will have it all down now, very well, says I take him away; it is my duty to take them to the surgeon before he is sworn, to see if he is found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give direction that he should be taken to the surgeon? - Yes, but whether he was or was not I don't know. The next thing I heard was, that he had deserted.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that William Harris examined before he signed it? - He was, and every recruit that comes to be attested, is very strictly examined by the magistrate; there is none but are very strictly examined, whether they enter voluntarily or not, and whether they were drunk when they enlisted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that William Harris, whoever he was, take the oaths? - I am the person that administers the oaths; as soon as I have administered the oaths, I take the attestation, and the magistrate signs it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man answered to the name of William Harris or not? - Most undoubtedly, for he must write his name, William Harris, before I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever suffer a serjeant or any other person whatever, to give in the name of the man who appears for them, and not let the man give in his own name? - I fit at my desk, at the corner, I call the recruit to me, if he can write his name I make him do it at the beginning of the attestation, if he cannot write his name, I make him make his mark, and I write under it, the mark of such a one; I never suffer a person to be attested whose name is wrote before he comes to the office; if his name is wrote I strike my pen through it, and make him write it over again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney to Bradley. Did you ever see that young man? - No, I cannot say that I did; to the best of my knowledge I don't think I know the man; I took a man that jumped over the wall, and I took him to serjeant Cooke, and asked serjeant Cooke, does this man belong to you? I took the man in the dark, I cannot be positive to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - I cannot positively say, it was on a Monday in May, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. When you carried him to the Star and Garter, was there any light there? - I did not carry him into the parlour, I gave him up at the door to serjeant Cookes there were a couple of candles burning on the table in the parlour, and he took the man from me, and he said, I know the man.</p>

Very early Witsunday morning I was going along the street, I had staid a little late at a house that I had been at in the evening, a public house. I went there about eight or nine o'clock, and I might stay there till half past eleven, at the sign of the Hope, near where I live, Vine-street, Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in any other public house before that? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober at that time? - I was so far sober that I had my perfect recollection. I found that I could not conveniently get into my own house, my little boy slept very sound, and I took a walk down the Strand; I was perfectly full of spirits; I was not in liquor, but I was merry. As I was going along down the Strand I met with the prisoner at the bar, standing at the corner of an alley, and she asked me if I would give her any thing to drink? I told her I would give her a drop; and I went to give her a penny worth, whereabouts I cannot ascertain the place, not a great distance from where I met her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A little before you come to Church-court. After she had the liquor, I asked her where she lived? she said she lived at No. 6, in Church court; and as she was going along she met with a decent drest man, a stouter man than me, and they had a few words pass between them, what it was I know nor, I could not ascertain what the words were.</p>

               <p>Q. The man left you? - Yes, for the present moment; the man did not come with me not that moment. I had not been at the door a very short time, before this man came up and began thumping me about the head in a very violent manner; I don't recollect that he spoke a word to me; and this woman she stood behind me. I was facing No. 6, the door was not open, and I don't know how or which way hardly it was done, but by some means or other they forced my hat and wig off, and my coat; they cut my shirt here, and at the same time, with something, they cut my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else besides this woman and this man? - There was a soldier stood by; but he did not offer to touch me or assist me, he stood on the right hand side of the man in the court, and a very good looking soldier he appeared to be too. I was obliged instantly to run away, naked as I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know what part the woman took in this business? - I have some reason to think that she had a hand in taking my hat and wig off; respecting my coat, I think it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think the woman took your hat and wig off? - Because she stood behind me, and it was taken off by somebody that did stand behind. It was a club wig, and a very easy matter to take it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this hat or this wig in the woman's hand at all? - I did not; I ran away immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the coat in her hand at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again? - No, I never found any of the things.</p>

There was a man came up and I said, that is the woman, lay hold of her; and she was immediately taken to St. Martin's watch-house; but who the man was I cannot immediately ascertain.

            Will you undertake, on your conscience, to say that she was the woman that you see the second time, as was with you in the court? - The case stands as this, before I went to the watch-house I asked her what her name was? She said, saucy Bet Hambleton; but I did not think it any great harm then, as the woman did not appear in liquor. I am positive to the woman as ever I was to any thing in my life; her face had been pretty much coloured with something, and I knew her perfectly; her face is pale now, but then it was coloured with something what it was I know not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man says that I accosted him, he spoke to me first; I could not ask him home, because I was locked out myself; and another thing, I had no place to take him home.</p>

I said nothing to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of this woman before? - No; I may have seen her, but not to swear to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prosecutor to know that you had seen the woman and a hat? - I told our patrols that I see a woman go by with a hat and things in her hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the patrols said any thing to you about any robbery? - No.</p>

This dead woman lived in my house, rented a room of me; this said day she was out the greatest part of the day about business; she came home about six o'clock, and brought two of her friends in with her, one she took out with her and the other she met, and called for a pot of beer in the kitchen; John Hurley and his wife sat at the far end of the house, and another woman that was in company with them, in another room; by and by they settled their reckoning, and they left the room, and they went into their company, the company of the deceased, and they drank together; there was a master of a ship came, and another woman with them; at ten o'clock I went and see them all very social together, as far as I know; I went and told them I was an early woman, and I wished them to settle their reckoning and go; they said they had got a pot of beer, and they would sit and drink it out; and I went and shut up the shutters, and went back again, thinking they had drank their beer, and I heard Hurley's wife aggravating the dead woman, calling her the cock of the walk; and I heard Hurley say something, but I do not recollect; and I begged of them to be quiet; I said, say nothing to that, especially to a woman in her condition.</p>

She ran towards the entry where Hurley and his wife were, as near as I can tell, saying, she wanted a candle and candlestick. When murder was cried I went in, and Hurley's wife was the first woman that I met with, and I took her by the shoulders and put her towards the door, and when the light came I see this woman all in a gore of blood, and I did not know where the blood came from; I could not see her face disfigured, or a black eye or any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing else happen besides? - She cried out murder! murder! and called out for the watchman, and said, that Hurley was the man that murdered her.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a surgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was called in to examine the woman before the coroner? - I did not see her before she had been dead eight and forty hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that she died by any external-violence? - It was from external violence. The uterus was bruised, and likewise the placenta was separated; but whether it was from a kick or fall I cannot say.</p>
               <p> - HURST sworn.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a surgeon? - Yes. When I was called in I found the deceased extremely ill, in strong convulsions; no signs of labour pains, or any probability of her being delivered. After having given the necessary directions how to proceed, I went home and sent some medicine, in hopes of a recovery. On Wednesday I examined the body, after it was opened; I observed an extravasation of blood on the external part of the uterus, internally, a separation of the placenta from the posterior part of the fundus.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether that was produced by any blow or kick, or any thing of that fort? - That might be from any common causes; from a fright, or any exertion on her own part, or any fall or blow.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present on the night this woman died? - Yes, I was; on Wednesday, the 15th of last month, I happened to go to Hobbs's house, about the hour of eight or nine o'clock; I sat in a box in the tap room, and had part of three pots of beer; then I chose to go home, and it being a little late, I was advised not to go home so far as Holborn that night. Then this company in which the deceased was sat very comfortable, as it seemed to me, I never entered their company; they had a pot of beer, and by some unluckly unhandiness the pot of beer was spilt, then the deceased and another in company began quarrelling; the deceased in a rage got up and used very scurrilous expressions to Hurley and his wife; directly Hurley's wife said, I believe you are cock of the walk; that is meaning a governor in the house. In a little time the deceased person got up a candle and candlestick, and called Hurley vile words, and she took up the candlestick, in order to throw it at Hurley and his wife, and the candle fell out of the candlestick; I called for a light, and it came. Then the deceased woman withdrew into the tap room, and she came in again in two or three minutes, and ran again at Hurley's wife, and tore her cap off, and it fell to the ground; I stooped and picked up the cap and said, go along home, let us be all peaceable. Hurley was behind my back, and he said, I will have your cap off as you had my wife's; and Hurley came over my shoulder and took hold of the deceased woman's cap, and at the same time, according to my best belief, and according to my conscience, I believe she was spent in passion, and had been drinking to excess, and by her own fall she lost her life. I never see Hurley lay hands on her, but just laying hold of the cap.

               <p>I am a patrol of St. Dunstan's parish. About a quarter before eleven, on Sunday night, the 7th of June, I was going my round, I goes up Crane-court, and just by Mr. Stafford's window I see a tall man, that man seeing me coming behind, he passed on towards the top of the court, just at the top of the court he stopped to make water; I passed him a sew yards, and I thought that he lived in the court, at some of the houses in the top; I returned, and as I returned I see Mr. Stafford's parlour window open, the sash lifted up; I could not see any body about the house then. I immediately comes down into Fleet-street, and I says to the watchman, do you know Mr. Stafford's window is open?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back again? - Yes. I took the watchman with me, and as I was going up the steps, the same man that I see standing to make water at the top of the court, I see exactly under the parlour window that was thrown up, and he met me about ten yards up the court; says I, what do you want here? says he, I come to ease myself; says I, have you been easing yourself since I see you making water at the top of the court? says he, that is easing myself; says he, don't handle me, I am a housekeeper, I will give you my address. I immediately leads him back under the window; the watchman knocked at the door, William Hull came and opened the door; I asked him if he knew his window was open? he said there was somebody in the parlour; I thought he meant there was somebody belonging to the house there, and I losed the man that I had by the collar, and he instantly ran away, and at that instant, momentarily, I see the prisoner in the parlour, laying down on the window seat, inside of the parlour; I instantly rushed in and seized him. In the parlour there was a knife case moved from a side board from behind the door, on the carpet; there was a bonnet on the floor. We took him to the watch-house, and he had nothing found on him but a tobacco box, two shillings and a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to your superior judgment, and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do? - I went with him, and we met a tall young man in the court, and Mr. Quick collared him, and he asked him, what do you do here? says he, I am easing myself, says he, you cannot have eased yourself since I see you.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010086"/>So we went up to Mr. Stafford's door, and I gave a double rap at the door, and I asked the young man if the house was all safe; and he saw a young man in the parlour, and he said, here is somebody here; and Mr. Quick let the person that he had in his custody go; and he took to his heels; and we seized the prisoner in the parlour. When I went round my round at ten o'clock, the windows were down; both of the window shutters are inside, so that they are out of the command of a watchman, but the windows were down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask every one of the servants which of them recollects shutting the window; this man has swore that the window was shut; it is false, the window was open.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know his name? - Yes; Moses.</p>

               <p>Q. How old is he, twelve or fourteen years of age? - Older than that. I went down into the poultry yard after the watchman was gone; I missed three.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know there geese again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could venture to swear to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them again in the course of that day? - Yes, I see them at the watch-house, three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them to be lady Grosvenor's geese? - I know them to the best of my knowledge; I knew them ever since they were hatched, about three months; one is a darkish one, with a mark half round its neck, and two black feathers on its back; the other was a brown, not quite so dark as that there, a brown head, and much the same mark on its back; the other was all white all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say positively, or only to the best of your knowledge, that they were the three? - I have said to the best of my knowledge that they belong to lady Grosvenor. They were left in the watch house; two were alive; and one he killed; the live ones are brought here.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was killed? - The lightest of the speckled ones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How is your court yard situated? - It is before the house, and the poultry yard is by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it senced off? - It opens with two gates, it is senced all round with paling; the paling is a pretty good height, and there are laths over the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so high as you are? - Yes, very near; I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the geese may now and then get over? - It is two high for any geese to get over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these geese fly No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were their wings cut? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if they were inclined to sly from a good place, they had the liberty to do so. Now you say very fairly, that you cannot go beyond saying, that these may be lady Grosvenor's to the best of your knowledge, but you may be mistaken in them; that is the furthest you can go. What kind of gates are they secured by? - It is a gate wide enough to let a carriage go through; it is made of close paling the same as the court yard.</p>

            Which way was he going? - Towards London, from the house. There were two more men coming after, and I let that man go on, and I searched them two men, and they had nothing, and I let them go forward; by that time the prisoner got from my beat, from my premises, and I went to the other watchman, Grant, and I told him I believed the man had got something on his back which he should not have. That is all I know about it till the next morning; I went the next morning to lady Grosvenor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010088"/>about nine o'clock; I asked the maid if she had lost any geese? - I did not know any body that had any geese besides.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you had heard something in that house? - I went to the watch-house, and the geese were there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to the watch-house? - I cannot say rightly because we went to justice Bond before that; it might be before twelve o'clock; I see three geese.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In custody? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That something that he carried on his back, was it in a sack, or how? - No, it was butioned in his coat, a common close bodied coat.</p>

             - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Ann Gibson. What time did you see the geese at the watch-house? - I don't know hardly what time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to see my wife that lived at Brompton, and I stopped at the White Hart public house. When I returned to town, in the road I see two men, and I was in a hurry running along, I saw these geese, I thought I see them fall from their backs, and I picked them up, thinking that morning to enquire out an owner for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character; he was a gentleman's coachman and in place then.</p>

               <p>Q. What public house was it? - The sign of the Phoenix, at Chelsea, kept by one Allen.</p>

            You went on this to his lodgings? - Yes; on the 23d of May, Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know them to be his lodgings? - Because I had been there to call him to his work sometimes. And there I found the articles in the indictment; the iron shoved pans have my marks; two pair of hinges, them I cannot swear to, but such hinges were in the warehouse where my pans were. They were locked up in a closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when the closet was opened? - The constable. Three keys are remarkable, that I can swear to by a particular make. I missed keys often, but I cannot swear but to three. I did not know these three were missing till I see them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the shovel pans were missing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture, from the observation you have made, to swear that the pans, and the keys are your property? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The keys were my own property that I brought out of the country with me.</p>

            Who brought you the key? - I think it was Mr. Rogers's man. I have kept them ever since in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. On finding these things, did you go home and search your warehouse, and from that search can you say that these things were missing from your house? - I cannot really say, but I know the mark.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever authcrise the servants to take those things, or to sell them for you? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there singular about these keys? - The clumsiness about the throat; I had a dozen let made, and I did not like them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss them out of the dozen? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that on examining your house and shop, you could not miss any? - I thought you meant the shovel pans. I had only three keys left out of the dozen, and they were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the others? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not some of these keys with clumsy backs be sold in your business? - I don't know but they might. As to the pans we never fell them in this state, we join them to the handles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The material goods I am accused of I brought up out of the country, being in business for myself, and the keys I brought from Woolverhampton, which I believe there are not such keys made in this part of the country, none of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Is there any thing in the appearance of the pans that you can say they did not come out of the country? - I am positive, because I bought them in London. He worked with me a twelve month, and I never found any thing amiss before.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, belonging to the police office. Queen's-square. On the 15th of June, Monday John Wilson, the prosecutor, called and told me he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010092"/>been robbed of a watch, and that the woman that had been seen with the watch, was then in Westminster. I went down to Frith's gardens, near the Horse Ferry road, where she was sitting at work, and took her into custody; I told her that she was accused of robbing John Wilson of a watch; I told her that she must come with me before the magistrate; coming along I told her that the magistrate was then sitting that committed her for the former offence, on that she told me that she was not guilty of the former offence, but she was of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what the charge was? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the prosecutor's name? - I did, I asked where the duplicate was? she said she had not pledged it, she had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise? - No; she wished to speak to Wilson; I told her I would speak to the magistrate, that she should speak to him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not recommend her to do it? - I did not, her friend did that was in the house, but I did not say any more than what I tell your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that this conversation with you, was as you was going along? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what the person said, that it would be better to confess, was after? - No, it was before, in the place where I apprehended her, but I did not say any thing to her then.</p>

As soon as I see him do that I came out from where I was standing; he was then just going to run away down Drury-lane, and before he entered into Drury-lane I caught him in my arms with these shawls underneath his coat.</p>

               <p>On Friday morning, the 26th of last month, in St. Ann's-lane, Westminster, I went with the prisoner at the bar, about half past twelve that morning; I met her in the Strand, and being intoxicated she induced me to go home with her at that hour; I had been at my friends that night; I went home with her to her lodging, where I remained till about half past seven, and at half past six in the morning I awaked in her apartment; when I awaked I found my watch in my pocket safe; and being amazed at the place I was in, I got out of bed and dressed myself, went to the window, and found the morning very disagreeable and wet, and did not like to go out at that time; I sat in the chair and dozed a little, and afterwards fell asleep, and in the same time the prisoner at the bar got out of bed, she drew my watch out of my pocket while I was asleep, and at her drawing it out I awaked, and I perceived it in her hand; but seeing a soldier in the room, and another woman, I was afraid to make much resistance in getting my watch from her; I told her to give me my watch, but she refused it; I asked her for the watch, she would not give it me; she said, she would pawn it for half a crown; then the other woman and the prisoner went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010099"/>out together, and left the soldier and myself in the room; after some time the other woman returned, I asked her what became of the prisoner at the bar? she told me she did not know, but she believed she was gone to pay a chandler's shop score. Some time after the prisoner returned, I asked her what she had done with my watch? She told me she had pawned my watch for eighteen shillings; I told her I thought it was very hard, and asked her for the duplicate; she would not give it me; I asked her at what pawnbroker's; she would not tell me. After that the prisoner went out; I remained in the room with expectation of finding from the other woman what she had done with the watch, or where the chandler's shop or the pawnbrokers were; but the soldier told me that he believed there was a pawnbroker's in Sutton-ground, of the name of Brown; I went to Brown's, and there was no such thing left there that morning. Then I returned to the Strand again, and I met with the prisoner at the bar; on my seeing her I kept back that she might not perceive me, thinking to find a constable that would take her up, and I met with a man and I asked him if he knew of any constable in the neighbourhood, and I told him I would pay him any thing for his trouble, if he would go and call a constable, and the constable came, and took her to the public office Queen-square; I went with the constable; we were rather soon, and there was a mob of soldiers, about forty or fifty, and some that endeavoured to rescued her; one of the soldiers told me that he perceived the chain of the watch hang out of her bosom; I went up to her and asked for the watch, which she refused to give; I put my hand to her bosom and drew the watch out, in the presence of them all, and gave it the constable, which was produced before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he did not give it me to pawn for five shillings, because he had no money? - When I met with this woman I had five or six shillings, but that money I either gave to her, or she took it from me, I cannot, tell being so intoxicated.</p>

I met this gentleman Friday morning, he had no money, and he slept till between six and seven o'clock; he gave me the watch to go and pledge to pay myself, and get some coals; I was to have four shillings; and his coat was all over mud, and he wanted it dried by the fire before he went out.</p>
               <p>Bowes. As I took her along she was very much intoxicated with liquor; I asked her what she had done with the watch; she said she had not made away with it. I was surrounded with a parcel of the guards, and I was very much afraid of a rescue.</p>

               <p>I was employed by Mr. Hughes to watch his ground, in the night of the 30th of May, I happened to see this man; he was wrapping up a parcel of mats; and on my coming up, he ran away; and I told him, if he did not stop I would blow his brains out; and I came up and took him into custody, and took him into St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken in the garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a place where the mats were placed over the glasses? - No; in a different part of the garden, where there should be no mats. Before my master came home I missed six from one part of the ground, and Mr. Hughes missed six more from another part of the ground, what I knew nothing about; the six that I missed had been on the glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he carried them when you see him bundling them up? - I suppose about eighty yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming that way, and I see three people come out of the garden, and I asked them if I could cross over that way to Tothill fields? they told me I might; and as I was coming along this man called out, who are you? Stop, or I will blow your brains out. He startled me, and followed me, and laid hold of me. As to the mats I know nothing about them. I came up from the country about two months ago.</p>

In about half an hour after that he brought in two bundles and separated them out into three; they each one took one into Phoenix alley(the two prisoners at the bar) and I was afraid of my husband's coming, and his being angry at my keeping such company, I took the third myself into Long-acre, and he took it out of my hand to take it into Phoenix-alley; I was to stay there in a public house till they came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you? - Yes; and he took it of me himself. After that, when they came home again, (they were gone about half an hour or three quarters.) they gave me these two silk handkerchiefs to go and pawn them; and using Mr. Lloyd's shop I took them to Mr. Lloyd's for three shillings; I gave the money and the two tickets; and about ten o'clock they came and found the handkerchief in my name, and they took me out of bed,and I told them who gave me the handkercheiefs, and they were taken in the morning, but before they were taken

               <p>Q. Did you live there the 5th of June? - Yes, for these twelve months; I was a hottler for a week. They came up with the waggon, and I went out to feed their horses, as I do other peoples. Horton came with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the others come with him? - I cannot say for that. I watered their horses and gave them hay; when they came out again they gave me a penny for my trouble, which is my wages; Horton and Thomas Mann set off with the waggon; and William Mann after a few steps, returned to me and called me by my name, and asked me if I would ask my master if he would take a sack or a couple of sacks? I asked my master, and he said, no, by no means, he would have nothing to do with it. They returned from Enfield Downs, and coming back again they asked me what my master said(this was when they returned with the empty waggon) I told him he said, no; he said, he was very glad of it, he had got a better customer, or something of that. They watered their horses, and they went away again; and they afterwards returned; but in the mean time there was a post chaise came up, or a couple, and I was feeding their horses; I let off to take their horses into the stable down the yard, while I was gone they had pretty well done, and

               <p>I have got the shawl (Produced.) It was taken in on the 12th of February on pledge, of whom I really cannot tell, I believe it was taken in by me, but I have two young men that write tickets, and it is one of them that wrote the ticket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know it by the particular dirt I made in it when I left it off, and by my suckling my child when I had it on, because it is dirted with it, it is not marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - I knew her by coming sometimes to my shop, the had lived sometime before with a woman in the kitchen out of place, in the same house where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the live there then? - No, the woman was gone away as well as herself. I left her in the room, when I missed my shawl; she called in one morning for something the wanted in the shop; it was before I missed my shawl that the was in my apartment; I left her in the parlour about ten minutes, rocking of my child, I went into the shop to serve some people; whether it was Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday I don't know.</p>

            In consequence of some conversations that had passed between you and your master, and you and the rest of the ser ants in the house, you was induced to observe the conduct of the prisoner at the bar? - I was induced to stop him. He was a porter.</p>

He was going out with a basket on Tuesday, the 16th of last month, he told me he was going to the engravers, I told him to wait a little,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010107"/>es there was no one in the shop to assist me in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he set down his basket? - He did in the back of the shop; he had occasion to go up for something for a customer, and I weighed the basket by the handle, and I knew it was more than mug; he told me the was going to carry out glass mugs, I asked him what quantity? he told me eighteen glass mugs, or thereabouts, to carry them to the engravers's, to put a border on them. It was before that that I had felt in the basket; he did not say the number at first.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the basket, what did you find there? - I only felt in the basket; I found one ale mug under the mugs, and at the bottom of the basket I found a row of tumblers, put one within the other; I left the basket for a considerable time; after that I sent him out of an errand, and I felt again to be sure I was right; the basket then stood there till about three o'clock I said I would go up stairs, and desired mine to wait till the shopman came in, he said he would as there was nobody there; I went up stairs, I came down some time after, and I saw the shopman and him standing together, over the basket, and

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing in your presence, respecting them? - Being asked if that was all, he said yes. He went away and left the articles on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you thought that there were these little articles in the basket, more than what should have gone to the engraver's? - Yes, there were.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of some information did any thing pass between you and the prisoner, on the 10th of June? Yes, I came in from my dinner on the 10th of June, and by a trunk which he was going to take out, which was his own, there was a basket; there came a customer in the shop, I went to serve him while he went to his dinner, and before I had done serving the customer he was going out with this basket, and his own trunk; I asked him what was in the basket? he said some few mugs, going to the engraver's; I asked him how many? he said at first four, I then observed that it could not fill the basket as full as it was; he went towards the door, I went after him, and desired he would tell me particularly what was in the basket, that I might set them down right, and then he made two or three ifs and ands, and he said he believed there were half a dozen, and I found his speech betrayed him, and then I followed him till he came to the stone steps, and he looked at the pattern mug, which was marked sixty-seven, and then I observed there were other things in the basket, and when he pulled out six glass mugs and the pattern, I desired he would pull the rest out, which were twenty-two half pint tumblers, and eight ale glasse, them he pulled out of his basket, and set them on the floor, and went to put them in their proper place, where they came from, I told him not to do it, but leave them there and go to dinner; he was so flurried he did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this you got a search warrant? - My master did.</p>

               <p>Q. I thought so by your saying his speech betrayed him. I believe there is a little balance of two pounds twelve shillings between his master and him, that his master owes him? - There is I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner afterwards returned back to the house? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had the long stick? - I cannot say perfectly; they were both close together. They looked at the house to see if any body were looking out of window, and up and down the street; on which the short one laid down on his belly, and presently I see him pull up from the window a piece of white linen, which the big one put in his apron, and went out to the middle of the street and looked round, and by that time the short one had another piece up with his stick, and after that he hooked up another; and by that time the watchman began to come his beat, and they walked away, and went down and informed the watchman what I had seen, and I went down the back street to endeavour to meet them, and before I got to the watchman again he had got Smith, the tali one; the other I did not see; then we took him down to the watch use, and there I left him.</p>

This gentleman came over to me, just after four o'clock in the morning, and told me that he had seen two men lurking about there, and observed them drawing some linen out of an area window, and that the best way to take them was to go up the back street; accordingly we did, he went round, and I went the other way; I caught the biggest of the prisoners with the hook in his hand, tucked up his sleeve.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Vincent; James Atkins came, on Thursday, and gave an order for some scales, the 8th of June, and I wrote it down; he said they were not for himself, they were for a gentleman at Croydon, and he looked them out, and said, they would do, he was going to learn him the art of gingerbread baking, and he would bring him the next day to look at them. The next day he came again to know if this gentleman had been there to look at the scales, I told him no; he asked to wait till the gentleman came; I went to reach a pair of scales down and I happened to turn my back round, and I see him move his hand and took a seven pound weight off the board where I was, and put it into his basket; when he got the weight he said, I don't think that the gentleman means to come, I will go and get a glass of gin, he says, will you have one? I said, no, I have not had my dinner. With that he went to the door, and I said to my shopmates, that man has took a seven pound weight off the place that we use; and I ran after him, and told him he had got a seven pound weight; and he said, what weight? says I, that weight in your basket; and he opens his basket and says, take it again; I said, I will not touch it; and so the people round says, take him back, and so I took him back into the shop, and he put it down out of the basket on a bulk in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other witness, Chancellor, see it there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that weight to be Mr. Vincent's weight? - Yes; I have had the use of it for six years; it is one that we keep for our own use to weigh the others by.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am a gingerbread baker by trade, through misfortunes in trade I have been obliged to leave my native place; coming along through Croydon I met a man who asked me what business I was? I told him; he said he was going to set up in that business, and if I would stop a bit he would give me employ, and he asked me if I was coming to London? I said, I was; he said, he should be at a public house in Thames-street the next day, and if he and I could agree he would put something into my pocket, being greatly distressed I had nothing to subsist upon for two days, but two rolls, which were given me by two bakers, and that induced me to do that rash action; I knew if I had engaged with that man, I should want scales and weights.</p>

            Where was this money lodged? - In the middle of a bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday morning was there any property of any other kind missing? - Yes, a set of china. On that occasion the prisoner advised my wife to go out; we had a woman occasionally came to us, my wife's own sister, and she missed coming that day, and my wife went out to see the reason she did not come, and to enquire about the china; he told me that my wife had better go and see after her sister, perhaps she knew something of the china; I told her she had better go then; and as we had no servant, he said, he would assist me in drawing beer; and I returned him thanks, as I was very poorly. She went a little after two in the day; she came home about five minutes before five.</p>
               <p>Q. What past, when she was away, between you and the prisoner? Did the prisoner assist you as he had promised? - Yes, he did; and he told me he had two friends of his coming to tea, and begged I would make tea for three, and let them have it a quarter after four; and in the mean time he went several times up and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this when your wife was absent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him afterwards? - He came down again, and sat down with his friend; one of his friends came and the other did not, he was a stranger, whom he had got some clothes to mend for, and they sat and had a pot of beer. In about a quarter before four he told me and his friend that he would go out about a little way, and in about a quarter after four he came back again; he was out about twenty or twenty-five minutes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him then? - In the mean time I got the tea ready for three, then he came home, and came to our house, and they drank tea together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stay at home till your wife came home? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing before he went out? - When they had tea he said to his friend and his wife, (a woman that lived with him as his wife) that he had a little way to go, and he would meet them about the end of Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was going? - No, not that I could observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose wife was that woman? - A woman that visited the prisoner, who went under the denomination of a servant, but was another man's wife. She came and drank tea with him in the time of my wife's absence, in the back parlour, down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his friend ever up stairs with him? - No, neither of them; nobody went up stairs but himself all the time.</p>

            Did the prisoner at the bar say any thing to you on that occasion? - I spoke to my husband first, and then to him; says I, Mullet, I have lost a set of china; and he says, O dear, Mrs. Hallewell, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010114"/>are robbed again, Betty has not been here to day; no, says I, she has not, and sometimes she does not come; (she used to come to assist me because I had no servant) says he, Mrs. Hallewell, if I were you I would go after her, most likely as she has not come she has got the china; and he asked me several times, and asked my husband why I did not go after her. I believe he did not think, at that time, that she was my sister. I said, perhaps after dinner, I will take a walk and ask her when she remembers seeing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go? - I did, about a quarter or half an hour after that at the far theft. Before I went out I went into the bed room to put my hat and cloak on, and my husband gave me half -.</p>

            Was it usually kept locked? - Always kept locked. I took a wooden box that I kept the money in, and put this half guinea in, and a guinea that I had in my pocket; and I counted the money out, and there were sixteen guineas and a half, with the money that was in the box before. There was one that was an old guinea, as I supposed it to be a plugged guinea, and I made a mark on it to shew it to my husband, I made a mark something resembling a T, to the best of my knowledge, there was a little black spot in the neck of it that appeared to be a plug.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other piece of money remarkable? - A new bright guinea that I thought was a counterfeit from something that I read in the newspaper, I scratched that on the back of the king's head with two or three scratches, and a little scratch on the nose, I think it is a cross; one of these guineas was dated 77 and the other 88.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your husband in health? - He was but middling in health. This Mullet offered to stop and draw a little beer for him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the money into this little box, what did you do with it? - I put the box into a little well with a door in the bureau, where there were four pounds worth of halfpence in five shilling parcels, and I put two or three five shilling parcels on the top of the box, and locked my bureau, and locked the bed room door, and put the key in my pocket and came down stairs.</p>

As I was going out my husband said (the prisoner was present) will you leave the key, Nancy? perhaps I shall want change. I said, Oh! I shall not be long, you will not want it till I come back; the prisoner made answer and said, that is right, safe bind safe find, Mrs. Hallewell.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return? - About a quarter or ten minutes before five. I went up stairs directly to pull my hat and cloak off in the bed room, as I always do.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the door? - Locked as I left it. I went and stopped in my bed room a good bit; by and by my husband called for change for a guinea; I answered, and went to the bureau, took the key out of my pocket and unlocked it; I went to the box to get the half guinea out to give change for the guinea, and I could not find either box or money; all was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your halfpence? - I did not miss the two five shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010115"/>papers of halfpence just then; on that occasion I stopped and unlocked every drawer in my bureau</p>

               <p>I am a constable and opposite neighbour to the prosecutor, and justice room door keeper at the Mansion House. On Monday evening, the first of June; I was informed of the robbery; in consequence of that I went to Mrs. Hallewell's, and I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; I have seen him up in his own room.</p>

            How long did you stay in Mr. Hallewell's house? - From ten o'clock at night till near four in the morning. The prisoner did not come home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after that? - About nine o'clock on Tuesday morning, I had been to put the supposed wife into the compter; they had been both to the play together the night before. When we had lodged her in the compter, I got out of the compter gate, and I see the prisoner across the way, and took him; I observed that he wished to put his hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket, he got his hand in, I got my hand on his wrist, and took him in that situation into the compter lodge, and had him booked; I observed that he wanted to make a shift, he seemed to be of a bustle, as if he was going to make a snatch out of his waistcoat pocket; I said, my good fellow, give me leave to search you, he asked me if I wanted to rob him? I told him I wanted to find Mr. Hallewell's property, and I put my hand into his pocket, and out of his right hand waistcoat pocket I pulled this purse out, I immediately put it into my own pocket, and put my hand into his coat pocket, and pulled out sixpence, and three penny worth of halfpence, a knife, and two small keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the purse now the same contents as when you took it? - All the same, except the sixpence and three penny worth of halfpence, which I have put to the sixteen guineas, it had but the sixteen guineas in it when I took it out of his pocket, when I took the watch out of his pocket he made some reply, was he brought there to be robbed. After I had put the man in the compter I went back to Mr. Hallewell's house, and went up to Mr. Hallewell's bed room, and tried this strait warded key, one of the small keys on Mr. Hallewell's bureau; I believe there are five locks, and this key opened every lock, I began at the top and went down to the bottom; I unlocked them and locked them again with the same key, and left them locked. The over night I thought that Mr. Mullet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010117"/>had I left the key; Mullet's door was locked, I looked about to see if I could find the key, coming down stairs I observed on a ledge, a flat tin candlestick, which I supposed Mr. Mullet had put there, the candlestick was taken up, and this key.(Produced) I found there, I immediately applied that key to Mr. Mullet's room door; I had free access to the room, it opened it, I locked it again, I came down to Mr. Hallewell's room door, Mr. Hallewell and Mrs. Hallewell were with me, we came down together, and I tried Mr. Hallewell's room, I had free admission there with this said key, and according to my judgment I rather suppose it is not as strait as it should be.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any use of the other key? - Yes, to open a trunk in Mr. Mullet's room, with the mark of I. M. on it; the fluted warded key opened that trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any things in that trunk? - Yes, a number of duplicates.(one produced on a waistcoat for five shillings and sixpence, on the first of June.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So, this said key you have had in your custody ever since, and the wards of the key are a little distended? - Yes.</p>

            Other wise it is a very common key? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you used to see keys? are you in the smith's line at all? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see keys that have been used for a great number of years, distended like that? - Yes, I may.</p>
               <p>Q. That appears to be very little distended, if it is at all. Now with respect to the little key; did you ever see a fluted key before? - Yes, but that was not the key.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to be extremely forward? - Not forward at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place is the key that opened Mr. Hallewell's bureau, a plain warded or fluted one? - It is a strait key, not a fluted warded key.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing uncommon in that plain warded key different from any other plain warded key? - .</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you observe the key before you put it to the lock, whether it was strained or no? - I did not</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Has that key ever been out of your house since you took it from him? - It has not, except under my lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Hallewell. Pick out the two guineas that were marked? - This is the one that I thought was a plugged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take your oath that that is one that you marked, and was in the bureau? - Yes, I will take my oath of it; I put the mark on it to shew it my husband when he came home, whether it was a good one or no, and he said could not I remember a guinea without marking it? and I said if it is a good one it is no harm; and the new guinea I made a mark on it, for fear it should be counterfeit.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When White and Tidmarsh came back, what did they do? - Then White packed up one of the other hampers, and Green had done his, and tied it up with cords, and then he helped to pack up the others.

            Did you see any of them on the 23d of May last? - Yes. About seven o'clock, or a little more, in the morning, Green came into our house and requested the loan of a three dozen wine hamper; I told him I had not such a thing in the house. He asked if I had a basket.</p>

I told him I believed there was an old basket in the cellar, if it was of any use to him he might have it; it had been left at our house some time before, by mistake by one Charles Clarke; it was a butter flat.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - I don't know whether I should or should not. He took it. (Produced) It was very much like this; I believe this is it; I am sure I know of no marks, because I never looked at it.</p>

               <p>Q. A little time before the 23d of May had you let any of the rooms to any person? - Yes; I let my room to Mr. Samuel, three weeks before he went into the country, and was gone about a fortnight, and I did not let the room, and he applied for it, and I let him have it again.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you? - I was at the kitchen window, and faced it the same as I do you. Mr. Samuel came down stairs, and said that his wife's brother had took a large house. The small hamper is not here I perceive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that hamper since? - Yes, I see it to day, and not till to day.(Produced.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am Mr. Stonnard's milkman; I went to milking last Saturday fortnight, in the morning, about half after six o'clock; when I came I lost the calf, directly I followed it by the track of the feet, over the hedge into another gentleman's field, I followed that same track over the fields, till I got to the high road, opposite the Weaver's Arms, they there heaved it over pales into a ditch.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t17950701-59-person838">

            Where is the Weaver's Arms? - At the end of Newington. I see that by the track, and the hair on the pales. From there I followed it the same road a hundred yards, till I got to a little alley, and then out of the road up that alley, to the back side of John Butcher's, the prisoner's door</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house was the prisoner's? - A little pudling room, the shop is next to the road, not adjoining to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you track it? - To the door where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is his shop from this place where he lives? - Ten or a dozen yards. Directly I could track it no further, I went home and told my master, and he ordered me to get a search warrant, to search and see.</p>
               <p>Q. In what parish is it in? - Hackney. We searched the house, and found the side of a calf in the house, and the entrails of a calf.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take your search warrant to this house the same morning as the calf was missing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it in the morning that you first tracked the calf? - About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it that you arrived with the search warrant? - Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge whether that calf was fresh killed that you see in his premises? - I examined it, and it seemed to be killed for two or three days; the entrails were green, and the side of the calf too.</p>

            Did you ever see any calf afterward that you believed to be your master's calf? - No,</p>
               <p>Q. And you are perfectly sure of this track all the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wet or dry weather? - Wet weather, there had been a great deal of wet two or three days.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Could you observe whether it was the track of one calf, or more beast than one? - Only one, and the track of two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the mens feet of different sizes, that you could say it was the track of two men? - One foot was larger than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose this track? - Not all the way till I got to his door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that you can swear that the calf was carried to his door from this track? - Very safely.</p>
               <p>Q. So you tracked it along the field? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That there is no great deal of difficulty in going? - No.</p>

            But you never came into the turnpike-road? - Yes, after I had tracked it out of the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you never see any body travel that turnpike road? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the day after the market day to London? - I don't know for that.</p>

            What day was it? - A fortnight ago last Saturday</p>
               <p>Q. Then there must be a number of cattle pass that road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you swear that on a turnpike road you could trace the trace of one single calf; do you think we shall be such calves as to believe you? - All the cattle from the north come along that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010132"/>road? - I believe they do; I tracked that track, and no other track.</p>
               <p>Q. You tracked it half a mile? - Yes, I did, from the field into the road, about a hundred yards along the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of an alley before you could get to the prisoner's house, is not the the way in which all the calves and sheep must go along to the common? - That alley that goes up to his house comes into the high road again.</p>
               <p>Q. That alley leads on to the common or green? - There is a passage that way, but I could not track it on that common.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010135"/>Mr. Knowlys. Did you ever particularly undertake to pay for this particular bullock, if it was lost? - Yes, it is always the custom ever since people take them. Mr. Hellum well knew that I was responsible.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you paid him? - No, because Mr. Bond told me not, till this business was over, but I have promised to pay him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 18th of May, last purchase an ox? - Yes, at Smithfield, of one Mr. Harris; it was a kind of Linconshire bullock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you purchase it? - About nine or ten o'clock in the morning, or thereabouts; it was a black one, not a right down black, but mixed, as if it was sun burnt. It was a bullock bought for my own killing, it was under the description of a fat ox, but not so fat as I have seen them sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole was it a particular ox? - It was one that I should be able to distinguish, because it was a colour that does not often appear, I cannot say uncommon, because I have seen half a score of that description of a market day.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have sworn to it if you had seen it a week after in Smithfield market? - I could; moreover when I bought it I marked it, three clips on the hip, and two on the tail.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a face had he? - I am not particular as to the face of it, the head is not an object that we want to look it; after we have bought our beasts we then call out to our drover, and tell him I have bought so many beasts to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Just at this moment I would ask you do you know these men? - Yes, all three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Corderoy? - A master butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Joseph Spencer? - A Smithfield drover.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he one who should wear a number? - I believe he should. The other is a drover, he has been in the habit of bringing home sheep for me many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him wear a number? - I think I have.</p>

            Should he wear one? - Yes, they are all obliged to wear one that attend Smithfield, or else they are liable to be laid hold of. After I have bought my sheep at Smithfield I deliver them up to my drover, Mr. Anguish, I do not always stand to see the beasts taken away; I gave Anguish direction to take three away, to be sent to Mr. Harpur's field.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of the other two of the same colours as this you lost? - No, quite the contrary, almost as much as black to white.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Harpur's field? - At Paddington, I believe they call it Edgeware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen it again? - No, I have had all of them oxen home from the field but that, that I have never seen since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So this ox is so particular that you have seen half a score of the same sort? - Something of the colour, but not exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was the 18th of May? - Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever since you lost your ox, seen oxen of the same sort, with the one that you have described? - I don't know to my knowledge I have, I cannot say whether I have or have not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. I believe you don't know that any body has found the beast? - Only by report.</p>

               <p>Hellum. I bought four, but one of another man.</p>
               <p>Court. How many did you order to be taken to the field? - I know them three beasts particularly went to the field; I might send four, but only three that I bought of Harris.</p>
               <p>Anguish. I took them to Mr. Harpur's field about twelve or one o'clock, as nigh as I can guess.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you deliver them to? - To Dick, Mr. Harpur's man; my man did that I sent with them; I see the beasts on Tuesday, we always book them of a Tuesday, and I booked them myself then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of these oxen since? - I have seen three, two of the fellow beasts and the odd bullock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the fellow beasts those that were bought of Mr. Harris? - Yes, three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were all something alike? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the two beasts that you have seen since? - No, I do not take particular notice of every particular beast that I have seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you while you were driving them? - No, I did not particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those beasts that you have seen since, the beasts that you drove from market? - Yes, by the mark, I only take notice of the marks, I do not take notice of the colour of every beast that I drive.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the marks? - Three clips on the hips, and two round the tail, that is Mr. Hellum's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all three clipped and marked the same way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the third beast, which you have not since seen, was a white or a black beast? - I cannot say to the colour, but I know there was never of them three, white ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that beast again if you was to see him? - I should know him by the mark, but no further.</p>

               <p>Q. After these oxen were brought to Mr. Ward's, do you recollect seeing any of the prisoner's at the bar? - Yes, I recollect seeing Rose and Spencer; I see them every day of the week that they were lost; I see them Thursday in the afternoon, the 21st of May, to the best of my knowledge it was about four o'clock, they came in the lare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink together? - Yes; I asked Rose what he wanted? he said he wanted nothing; I asked him where he had been? he told me he had been to get some flowers.

            What sort of a beast was it? - A black bullock, rather sun burnt, which I accounted for from the hardness of the winter; I considered it as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any particular remark on this beast? - Yes, I made a remark, because I considered it as very strange; I had suspicion, that made me take the notice I did take, of its being a long legged bullock, blue brown, as if fun burnt, rather by the hardness of the winter. It was bought as I supposed for the butcher to kill, but may have fasted from Monday till Friday, and that made it look thin. I know a little of all kinds of beasts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if it is a common thing for the strange beasts to prevent another beast from eating? - O, yes! and with every kind of animal almost, when they get into droves, or into fields. The tail was cut, I don't remember seeing any other marks. On my return from the place where I had been at in Hampstead-road, to one Mr. Rose's, a seavenger belonging to St. James's parish; I see the prisoner, Rose, standing on the step of a public house door, at the corner of a gateway in King-street, Bloomsbury, and the bullock was up the gate-way.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was that? - That might be about five, but I passed it twice after that; I had a pig, and I did not speak to the prisoner at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - In Turnstile, Holborn, leading into Lincoln's-inn-fields. I was going to the same place to fetch another pig, and the prisoner was on the step of the door at that time, and the bullock up the yard; this was before six.</p>

            Was that the same bullock you had seen at the end of the Duke of Bedford's-road? - Yes, the very same; I asked him where he brought the bullock from? he said a man gave it him to drive into the New-road; I asked him where his partner was, that was helping him to drive the bullock along the field? he said his partner was gone to get some more beasts, and to mix this bullock with them, to take him to the slaughter-house; I asked him where his number was? he said, what is that to you. He had no number on his arm; I asked him whether he was not a Smithfield drover? he said he was not. The ox was down at the bottom of the yard all this time; then I left him; on my return again he was sitting there again; I had a pig then, and the pig was rather wild, I could not stop, then the bullock was down the yard; I called on a publican, Mr. Ordish; I did not know any thing further till I heard that Mr. Harpur had lost a bullock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Ordish go any where when you called on him? - No, I only told my suspicions.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the prisoner afterwards? - Not till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it that you last see him? - About half past six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe it was in consequence of an advertisement that you applied to Mr. Harpur? - Yes, it was, it offered two guineas if it was strayed, ten pounds if it was stole, and fifteen pounds if the person was convicted; would you wish to see the advertisement?</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you describe the marks at Bow-street? - I described his tail being cut, I mean the hair being cut off the tail.</p>

               <p>Q. You have had a copy of the advertisement ever since? - On my seeing the advertisement in the paper, I kept the paper by me, for I said as I see the advertisement, I said that is the bullock that I see.</p>

            Have not you read it once from home to here? - One of the evidences that is here I shewed it to.</p>

               <p>Q. And you attending to give evidence shewed the advertisement to the slaughter-house man that killed the ox, and he is to be a witness called soon to describe it? - I suppose so, but I did not think any harm; it was read while we were drinking a pot of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you read the advertisement? - I cannot tell how many times I have read it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. After you had read it once, did you immediately say that was the ox? - I did, and I went to Mr. Harpur's immediately, and I said, that is positively the ox that I see last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you shewed the paper to one of the evidence's; you were all here to give evidence? - We were.</p>

            Did you take particular notice of the G, C? - I did not take any particular notice. If we see a mark we are used to see we don't take particular notice of it; but if it is a mark that is not customary we take further notice of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You did not receive this beast of Corderoy himself, and you was paid by Corderoy's wife? - Yes, to the best of my recollection.</p>

            When you made your observation on the beast, how was the beast? - Laying down in the pound, with his face towards me; I see it up afterwards. I think it laid on the left side, then of course the mark was uppermost.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You recollect no mark but Corderoy's that you see.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck to Hellum. Were your marks large or small? - Small.</p>
               <p>Q. To Brookes. Was the mark small or large? - Large it generally is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If this beast which you see with Corderoy's mark on it, and had at all been clipped on the off hip, as has been before represented, do you think you could fail to observe that? - Probably I might have overlooked it; beasts that came out of the country, and are jobbed about from fair to fair, have many marks on them, and I never take notice of any marks but the person's who sends them to me; if they were there I may have overlooked them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Which is the off hip? - The left hip.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010141"/>Q. Where you see Corderoy's mark was the right hip? - I think it was. When this beast was delivered at my house I was not at home.</p>

               <p>Q. When this was brought to you, was the prisoner a servant of Corderoy's? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not you know him in the market? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have never heard any thing contrary to the credit of his character? - I never heard any thing to his credit.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Corderoy called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rose. I know no further than going to Smithfield on Friday, and it was before my master came in, and Mr. Corderoy called me, and delivered this same bullock to me to take home, in Smithfield market, and this here laid bullock he ran down St. John's-street, up Turnmill street, and up the New Road, and that was how Mr. Hawkes came to see me up the Duke of Bedford's-walk with this bullock, and I took the bullock home along with five more beasts, and I turned the bullock up the yard and two more, and told the man to take care of it, it was rather fresh and cut down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Rose called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not put Spencer on his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. Did you take out a warrant till the 2d of May? - I did not. I went to Mr. Davis, of Rupert-street; he said it was so long ago he could not give any warrant, he said I must indict him.</p>

               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. Did not you offer if you could get the two guineas again, you would not prosecute him? - I told him he must come and settle it with his master and my master.</p>

            To Prosecutor. Do you remember bringing an action against Mr. Brown?

            To Midbust. Are you sure he took the guinea out of her hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you know the black before? - Yes. I knew him in his white wife's time. The guinea was to get bail for her husband, I took on it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear this, that he was to receive the guinea in order to pay it to Mr. Noy, or the bail, in order to procure the discharge of the black out of custody? - I know nothing about it farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar? - I know he was a jew; I have seen him before, but I know nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Positively, my lord, it is a very false accusation; I went to the lock-up-house to Bowley, he told me that he was falsely arrested; I offered the bail of Mr. Benjamin, Mr. Hill refused the bail; I then took the woman to Mr. Noy, and then she gave Mr. Noy one guinea, and Mr. Noy went and searched. When she came to me again, I then said, good woman, I will trouble my head no more with you, I must be paid for my labour; she said, if I would do justice to her she would give a guinea. That other woman never was there, as sure as there is a supreme judge. I believe the prosecutrix gave me the second guinea in East Smithfield. Afterwards they came to me, on the 9th of June; I went up to them when they came and asked them if they knew I was a thief? They said, I was not the person; I was retained in Mr. Horsey's custody three quarters of an hour; then they came back, and the woman said they would make it up for two guineas; and the man says, you d-mned b-ch, I will have the expences of the indictment. She made no reply, but he tells her, positively swear, right or wrong, he robbed you; for which afterwards they made me out a bill of five pounds; I told them I would not go nigh them; then they wanted six pounds one shilling and sixpence; I then said, if I did any thing illegal I would go through the law. On that motive I come before this honourable Court and jury, to surrender myself up under no bail, in order to thew you my innocence. I have been brought up in the Portugueeze Hebrew College for fourteen years; I never wronged man, woman, nor child. I undoubtedly, at this present time, do educare poor children who cannot afford to pay me, because the times are hard; how much less would I commit that horrid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010144"/>crime; and therefore I hope you will hear my witnesses.</p>

He told me he was to be found at one Mr. Phillips's, in Cartwright-street, Rosemary-lane. I asked him at what time? He told me he would be there teaching some children between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I told him if he should come I would go with him, but I could not tell the man by his description. Accordingly he came about eight o'clock, as nigh as I can guess, and I went with him to the house of Mr. Phillips, in Cartwright-street; I look upon it there were six or seven people sat there, all jews.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wife with you at this time? - No. I went in first, and he followed me; when he came in he staid for some considerable time, I said to him, who is the man that you want? he made me no answer; I said, God bless me, don't you know the man that you want He goes immediately up to this man that was sitting teaching some children, and he says, is your name Fernandez? Says he, what do you want with him? I said, he wants you to get some wages for him. He says, is not your name Fernandez? He says, no, I have a brother of that name. I says, God bless me, are not you certain of the man that you want? He then said, I will go and fetch my wife; and he went away, and I detained the man. When his wife came she stood similar the same as he did for some time, and she looks round, and says, is not your name Fernandez? He says, no, I have a brother of that name. Says he, mind what you are about, for if you take a wrong person you will be punished for it. Says she, then let me hear you speak; the man spoke; she then says, I don't think it is the man, I think he was rather taller. She asked him if his brother squinted the same as he did? He said, yes. The black said to his wife, d-mn your blood, don't you know Fernandez? Then afterwards she said, she did not believe it was Fernandez, she thought it was taller; then she said she wanted her two guineas; and her husband said, he wanted his expences. I said, as neither of you know the man, it will be very unsafe for me to take him. I left him there; the black and his wife, and I came out to gether, and she told me I should have took him till he had found his brother. I told her I had no right to take him for his brother, unless she was punctual that was the man. The next morning they came to my house to know whether Fernandez had sent to his brother to settle it with me. I told them he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fernandez run away from you? - He went out backwards, and I thought he would run away, and I went out after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What past the next morning? - I went with the black to petticoat-lane, to see to find him again, I told them if I should see him again, I should know him among a thousand. I went and found out where he had a school. I did not hear much about it that day, but the next day the black sent a little man for me to the public house, a lawyer, I believe he was; accordingly I went; there was a man with him, a short man, called me backwards, and he puts a note into my hand (I think they called him Ferguson) that was made out for the two guineas and the expences, they came to five pounds something odd; I gave the bill back again, and I said, if you settle it you must settle it among yourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did you ever see any more about the black? - Not till he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010145"/>to my door, making a noise, because he said I had let the man go.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the man was not taken by you? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. You are headborough of the parish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man came to you with the judge's warrant, what did he say? - He said I was to find the man in Cartwright street, Westminster.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the man live there? - No, Mr. Phillips where he was teaching lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he had been there some time he went up and said that was the man? - No, he stood for some time, and then I asked him which was the man? and I told the prisoner, if you are the man, I have got a judge's warrant against you, for stealing two guineas, and I shewed it him; he said he was not the man, he had got a Brother of that name.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what became of the man? - The man I detained there till his wife came; he went back over some low pales in the yard, he said he was going to the necessary.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present with the last witness at the time that a judge's warrant was going to be executed on him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the black man, the prosecutor, come with him? - Yes. When the black man first came into my house, he asked whether one Mr. Phillips lived there? I told him yes, I was Phillips; he asked me whether there was not a man in my house that used to get wages from on board a ship? I told him no; as soon as he spoke, before ever he spoke the officer came up to the man, and says, is this the man? he said he did not know, he would go and fetch his wife; he said he came for two guineas that his wife gave to bail him out. When the wife came she did not know the man, she knew he had another brother, and she thinks it was his brother, she was not sure it was he; the black man says to his wife, is this the man? this is Mr. Phillips's-schoolmaster, why will not you swear to him? she said she could not swear to him, she would see the other brother first; afterwards they reconciled it, and they would go home, and they desired me to speak to his brother for the two guineas, and the expences, what was the sum they mentioned I cannot pretend to know the particulars; they came to my house the next morning, and brought me a bill, and said they would take it as a say if I could give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the black afterwards? - A great many times, I met him once in Holborn afterwards, and I asked him how he came to swear a robbery against the prisoner, why did not he summons him? he said Mr. Benjamin had advised him to swear a robbery against him, because then he would be sure to recover damages.</p>
               <p>Court. When Bowling said he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010146"/>for two guineas that his wife had given him to bail him out, what answer did the prisoner make? - I don't know he made any answer at all; I had a little child went into sits, frighted at seeing the black man, and we were all so confused, that we took no notice of what past.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him go out and brought back again? - No, I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was desired to speak to his brother about the two guineas, what did he say to that? - He said if his brother had it, he dare say he would not wrong any body of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to his having it? - He said he never robbed any man on the highway in his life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bowling. When you went to take this man, had you any doubt about his person? did you know the man before? - Never before Benjamin sent him; I went to the house where he lodged, and the woman tells me he is a very bad man. When I went with Horsey and my husband, I told him he was the man, and when I came out, Horsey says, d-mn him he is the man, at last I said, why did not you take him, I told you he is the man, and my husband told you so six times.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am brought in guilty; as true as there is a supreme being reigning over the universe at this present time, I am as innocent of the accusation as a child not come forth from the womb of his mother, and if you was to take and hang me up momentarily, I should die with a free conscience.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You know that you are the man that had the two guineas, by your own defence; you have attempted to set up a defence, founded, I am afraid to say, in perjury; your calling God to witness is a mockery of the deity. You know in your own conscience that you snatched the money out of this poor woman's hand, and these witnesses have aggravated your case exceedingly indeed, for you have now con-vinced me that you are a very hardened sinner indeed.</p>

Mr. Helus said something to you which induced you to follow a man and woman out of the house? - I sent Mr. Helus after the woman, I was got up to the door, and see Mr. Helus bring her out of the public house, Mr. Cooke's, the corner of White Cross street; I see Mr. Helus and the prisoner at the bar come out there both together; he brought her into the shop, I told her that I had a very strong reason to think that she had got some property of ours, which did not belong to her; she immediately assured me she had not, and seemed very ready to be searched; she had got two cloaks on, a black one and a red one; she seemed to throw them both entirely aside, so that I could see all round, and laid her hand down, and said we were very welcome, any in the house, to search her; from what observation I could make, there did not appear to be any thing of any bulky nature of consequence, she was not searched; after she was gone Mr. Helus comes up to me, and said, I am certain, or I am sure she has got something; I said then why have you let her go; I gave him no other answer, but went out myself; I went to the public house, I went up to the landlord, who was in his bar. I found the woman in a box by herself, I told her I was not at all satisfied about the business after all, for I found that the had brought a parcel into the public house, which she had not with her when she went from us, as I could perceive; I was determined I told her to see it; she told me she knew nothing of a parcel or bundle, she knew nothing what I meant; I repeated the same words over again, and told her if she did not produce it I would charge Mr. Cooke, the constable, who was the landlord of the house, with her; he immediately came up, and I gave charge of her; she immediately says, then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010148"/>what parcel is it you want? is this the parcel you want? pointing to her foot; I looked round and see a piece of cotton lay down on the ground, close by her feet; I immediately stooped down, and took it up, and found our private marks on it; the constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. After you had searched this woman in the shop, did you hear her say to her husband that she was going back to the public house? - I did not.</p>

            Pray do you know how this public house in situated? - There are four boxes in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication from one box to another? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>EDWARD COOKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the King's Arms, Whitecross-street; I was in my bar, and Mr. Hurd came in, I cannot tell the day of the month, he asked me if there was not a woman that came in with a parcel? I told him there was a woman in the box that had a parcel with her, and I went along with Mr. Hurd, and shewed him where the woman was, and the parcel was laid by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else with her? - No, nobody at all; Mr. Hurd then gave me charge of her, Mr. Hurd went round, and took the parcel from the side of her, and gave it me into my possession.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you mean to say that it was laying by the side of her? - When I went in it was laying by the side of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the bottom of these seats communicate one with another? - Yes, they do, there is room enough for a dog to go under from box to box.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Lord Mayor at this examination? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor woman's husband was there? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any body in that other settle, next to where this woman sat? - Nobody sat in the other box on the other side.</p>
               <p>Hurd. I can swear to its being Mr. King's property, it has a private mark on it, my own making, on Wednesday morning, as it was lost in the afternoon; this is the same that I picked up from the ground when I went in, and it was laying on our counter when the man and woman came in, I had just unfolded it to shew a lady that came in for something to make a boy's striped waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. When you picked it up, was it on the seat, or down by her feet? - I only see it but once, and it was down by her feet, I see her before the landlord came up, I went round twice to her, and asked her for it before Mr. Cooke came up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. At this time there were some customers in your shop? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And yet you take on yourself to say that that bundle was on the counter when that prisoner came in? - Yes, it might for five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not some other customer take it as well as that woman? - I knew it was on the counter when she came in, and the next time I see it it was at her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not employed in serving customers when that poor woman came into the shop? - Yes, one customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I suppose you were occupied in serving and shewing your goods, and I dare say you are very police and genteel in praising your articles? - Undoubtedly I might, as all other tradesmen will do, I can swear that that was on the counter when the man and woman came in.</p>

               <p>I happened to be coming into the public house, and I see the piece of linen laying under the bench of the settle in the tap room of Mr. Cook's house, and I asked the prisoner whose it was? and the prisoner said it was her's. I believe it may be about four o'clock, as near as I can tell. Soon after that Mr. Hurd came in while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Hurd came in did he claim the piece? - Yes; he came in, as far as I could understand, to see what piece she had, and he took it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. The piece that she claimed as her property, was that the same that Mr. Hurd took? - I don't know, it might possibly be the same piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other piece there? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he claimed the same piece? - I think it was. I have not any particular doubt; but it is so long time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you whether that piece that Mr. Hurd claimed was the same that she spoke of before as being her's? - Yes, that was the same piece that I detected on her certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How long had you been in this public house? - A few minutes before Mr Hurd came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body by at this conversation between you and the woman? - Not at all; she was in a box by her self.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me leave to ask you who are you? - I am a painter by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - Whitecross-street, Cripplegate, right opposite Mr. Lewis, the organ builder and turner; I cannot tell the number of the house; I have lived there now going on six years.</p>

I immediately ran out of the door and fetched him back, and sent for his master, his master came, and he begged to go into a private room; I told him we had no private rooms for any body. He went into a parlour after his master came, and there he pulled out the goods himself, without any searching, from under his coat, lapped up in his apron, six iron bars. His master asked him how he could think of doing such a deed as that where he was employed? He said, he found them in the cellar, under some rubbish, with a board on them.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I produce the property given to me by Mr. Potter, and they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. The same bars you found on the prisoner, you gave to the constable? - I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was working at the house four days; I was ordered away on Wednesday night, to do a job in Fetter-lane, from there I was ordered to a stationer's facing the plaintiff's house, which I worked the remainder part of the day. Friday morning I got up at three o'clock and took my tools and pail of water, and a scaffolding to do a passage that joins to the stationer's house; I went through Mr. Potter's house to a large back building that leads into Lombard-street; I went down into Mr. Potter's cellar for some stuff; at seven o'clock I had used my stuff, I went to Mr. Potter's house again to get some more, and I took a bit of board up for to put some stuff on, and I saw these old bars laying, in a cellar forty yards from the dwelling house. Mr. Potter said they were his property; I begged his pardon, and told him to have them, that I did not know they belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is your wash house far from your house? - It is a detached building from my house; I have a little yard between it and my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you used this copper before? - We had not used it for some time because the back premises were under repairs.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 13th of June, having received information that gave me reason to suppose that the prisoner at the bar robbed us of soap frequently; I ordered Mr. Rutter, our clerk, to mark the soap in such a manner as he would be able to swear to it, and to watch the prisoner at the bar. I should also mention that I ordered him to mark both ends of the soap. They were marked (I saw them afterwards) at both ends with a key, which one of the witnesses has in his possession. On Tuesday morning, the 16th of June, I see him go down into the cellar; I told Mr. Rutter, our clerk, of it; and he went down after him. When the prisoner came up again out of the cellar, I employed him unpacking a bag of sugar; when Mr. Rutter came up, in consequence of something that Mr. Rutter had said to me, I told him that I was told that two cakes were missing, that I suspected he had them; I felt in his pocket and found he had half a cake, before I searched he denied having any about him; he produced the one half cake, and said it was the only soap he had ever taken from me; I told him it was marked with a key pointing to the end, and I was convinced he had the other half about him; he absolutely declared he had no more. I stroked the other pocket down, and I thought I felt something, and I told him it was there; he said it was a bone; he put his hand in, and he pulled the other half out; I told him he had another cake about him, I told him that the constable was sent for, and he must find it when he came. He pulled off his apron and pulled out half a cake from each side of his breeches, which was marked in the same manner that the other cake was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You told the prisoner that if he did not confess to you he must when the constable came? - I told him if he did not produce the soap then he must be searched when the constable came; I told him that if he would confess, so that I might prevent such things in future, he might expect mercy. This was before the constable came. He would not confess, he still continued to deny it.</p>

               <p>Q. You were sent for by Noton and Eade this day, did you take the prisoner into custody? - Yes. I see him take a cake of soap out of his breeches; I afterwards searched him and found nothing on him. There were two other pieces laid before him; it was all sealed and put into my custody.(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Rutter. This is the same soap, I have no doubt in the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Rutter has sworn as false as God is in Heaven; at the time the soap was produced he was not in the parlour. The soap was given me because I had a family, a wife and four children, and it was given me because the distress that I was in to help in washing.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you robbed at any time of the things in the indictment at any time? - Yes, I lost them from the parlour adjoining to the shop, on Tuesday the 9th of June; I was gone into the bake house out of the shop, while I was going I thought I heard somebody, but when I returned I perceived the prisoner at the bar with five tea spoons in his hand, and a pair of sugar tongs, and the saucer, and he ran out of doors; I ran out and gave the cry of stop thief! and he ran into Bridgewater square, where he was stopped, and he flung the tea spoons down an area, in a court adjoining to Bridgewater-square; I did not see him fling them down; I never lost fight of him at all. A man stopped him who is not in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they picked up in the direction that the man went? - Yes, they were; they were brought back to my house by a person of the name of Dawkins.</p>

            How soon were they brought to you after the man was stopped? - I suppose it may be ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had the care of them ever since? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought back were they delivered to the constable or to you? - They were delivered to neither at first. I was asked to describe the cypher on the spoon, which I did. I received them of the man that found them and delivered them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure the prisoner is the same man that was in your house? - I am positive that is the same man.</p>

            Whoever the person was, he had got out of the house before you came up with him? - O, dear, no; he was in the parlour, behind the door, when I came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you lost sight of him? - No, I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What pace was he going when he was stopped? - Running as fast as he could, to make his escape from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as sure of that as you are of every thing else? - I certainly am sure of it. The man who stopped him, I believe, has some inclination to say what is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. You appeared before one of the justices or aldermen? - Yes, Alderman Plomer, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he committed on the first examination? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a second examination? - He had.</p>

            And perhaps a third? - Only two examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that account before the justice, and say that he never was out of your sight? - Yes. The alderman put it off till another examination, in consequence of the man that stopped him not being there, and then he asked him if he stopped him? and he said, yes; that was all he said.</p>

            Whereabouts was the prisoner when you see him run? - In Hart-court; the shop window faces up Hart-court. I directly runs out of doors, and I see the prisoner as if he was raising himself up from the area, he had in his hand a blue white saucer. A man had then got hold of him by the collar, with his shirt sleeves tucked up, but there was another man that came up and took hold of him.

               <p>Q. How soon did you go down? - Immediately, and I went down stairs and picked up the spoons immediately, and carried them to the house of Mrs. Robinson, in Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver them to? - To the constable I think I gave them to; I made her describe the marks first of all; I believe they are all odd spoons.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them in her possession? - I did not, I see them in the kitchen afterwards, in possession of the constable; I believe the constable took them off the table.</p>

The foreman asked him if he wanted any back legs; he said no; the metal was weighed for him, and brought into the counting-house, I reckoned it up what it came to, and he had not money sufficient to pay me, and he wanted it on credit, and I refused it on credit, because he owed me three shillings and sixpence before, and I could not let him have any more till that was paid; after a great argument to get me to consent to give credit for the metal, he went out into the street, and my foreman and I followed, and my foreman stopped him, and took this pair of back legs out of his pocket; I went for a constable, and when I had been for a constable my man had been to his house, and brought the fronts back.</p>

I said no, I will not any more, then says he, I must leave it; he went out of doors and I went after him about fifteen or twenty yards, and I said, what have you got in your pocket more than you should have? he said, nothing; I felt his left hand pocket, and there was nothing in that, and I felt in his right hand pocket, and there was the back legs that I see him put in.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor and salesman, in Monmouth-street. This gentleman (the prisoner) I believe it is the same, he came to my house on Saturday as he was taken up with the coat, he told me that a lady had given it to him to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. On what time did he come to your house? - About the middle of the day I think; he asked me a guinea for it, he said that was the price he was to have for it; I told him I would give him seventeen shillings, he was going towards another shop, and I called him back, and told him I would give him eighteen shillings, and if the lady did not like to take eighteen shillings, if he came back again I would return the coat; whether he meant to bring the coat back again with out my calling him I don't know; I did not hear no more of it till Monday; I have got the coat, I gave him eighteen shillings, he left the coat with me; on Monday his wife came, and asked me and one of the servants, whether we had bought such a coat? - I said I had, and she said it was a coat that her husband was intrusted with. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the coat you bought of the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Frost. It is my property, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Palmor. When his wife came she said that she would give me the eighteen shillings to let her have the coat, for the owner had promised that if the coat was brought back she would not hurt him; I said I would not deliver it to her, I would deliver it to the owner myself, and when I took it back to the owner, they said they must not take it in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentlewoman delivered the coat to me to carry over Blackfriars Bridge, and I carried it to the second horse ride ever the bridge, and I delivered it to a gentlewoman that I never see before, nor I never see since; I took it to be a gentlewoman that was maid to the house, or bar-maid, or something; I came back again to Mrs. Munt's, and she paid me a groat for carrying it; about eleven o'clock at night I was going to bed, and the son came and told me that the coat was not delivered; I told him I would go and shew him the place, I went with him at that time of the night, and shewed him the place, and the people were gone to bed, and they took me to the watch-house that night. As to that man (Palmer) I never see him with my eyes to my knowledge, nor this Mr. Frost; I did not sell him no coat, no never; when I was taken to Guildhall the first day, I was remanded back again, thinking I should tell where I had pawned it, or sold it, but I said, I have no other story to tell, nor no other story will I tell.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witness who gave him a good character.</p>

I told him to the White Bear; he then told me he was not got to the place where he lived, and he went with me to the inn-yard, I thanked him, and told him I was sorry I had been so troublesome, he told me he would go up the yard with me; I asked for my box of William Baker, the book-keeper.</p>

He told me that was the stand for coaches, and there was no coach there; he says, I will leave my mackerel at the corner here; then he said, be so good as to go in and take a glass; I told him it was what I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in? - No, he did, and left the mackerel there; he came out to me, and took me up a passage close by the door, and I see the kitchen, and he took me through a great many more alleys, till he took me into Smithfield; as we were going along I told him I was very sorry there were no coaches nearer; he said there were no coaches allowed to stand in the City, they stopped up the gateways; I went along, he told me that the goods were conveyed in coaches to the lower part of the City, and then took into carts; he asked me if I was not a Yorkshire woman? I told him I was brought up in the city of York. I then went into Smithfield, and he said, look here is a coach. There was one coach and only one that was on the stand at that time; he went along till we came to a narrow passage, and then he went against the wall, as though he was going to make water, and told me to go to the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the coach? - I did, and I waited ten minutes for him, and he did not come, and I told the man to drive me to the White Bear, Basinghall-street; I thought he did not want any more trouble with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before? - No, never in my life.</p>

               <p>I am stableman to a gentleman in Basinghall-street; I attended formerly as porter in this yard to the waggons. Between eight and nine in the evening. on Thursday, the 11th of June, I locked Mr. Brookes's stables, I was going into this yard, and I met that man, the prisoner at the bar, with the box under his arms, and I asked him if he wanted a porter? he was within two yards of the street, he had pitched the box on the end facing the tap room door; I told him the box was heavy and would give him a sweat if he intended to carry it without a knot; with that he takes the box up, I told him I would thank any person to give me a lift, and that I was a porter; I did lift it on his shoulder; he said he was going no further than Aldersgate-street; he went through Church-alley, and there I lost fight of him. About a quarter of an hour after, I cannot say to a few minutes, the woman came and asked for the box, and then Mr. Jackson said the man had been there and had got the box. I went with the woman till we came to Aldersgate-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you the wife of the person that keeps the public house, Bridewell precinct? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any box left at your house? - Yes, there was, the 11th of June, between eight and nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person that left it? - The prisoner at the bar is the man; he put the box on the table and called for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010163"/>a pint of beer; he said he wanted to leave it there for half an hour; I told him if he would fetch it away in about half an hour he might leave it. Presently I heard a noise, and I called to them below, I thought it was like knocking. The prisoner had broke the box open, and that was the noise that I heard. I presently went into the tap room, and I see the box open, and some things laying on the table, white hose, whether they were womens or mens I cannot say. I told the prisoner I thought it was a pity that he could not get the box open without splitting the lid. He said it was split by coming up in the waggon out of the country. He then wanted to leave it with me open as it was; I told him I could not be answerable for people coming into my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see the man before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very odd to let a man leave a box there? - It is what we are very liable to in a public house. Three watchmen came in and corded it up with a cord, just on the hour of nine, and one of them left it in the parlour.</p>
               <p>

            And you was at Mrs. Woodland's this night? - Yes. This is the box, and that is the man, I believe. I had been there some time, the prisoner had an handkerchief open at the side of the seat, there was something in it, but what I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the box? - Open. Whether he took any thing out of the box I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put any thing into the handkerchief? - No, he asked me to cord the box, and I did, and afterwards he asked me what it would cost for a coach to go to John-street, Oxford-road; and then he called for a pint of beer, drank it, and he tied up the handkerchief, and went away, and I see nothing of him any more till I see him in Bridge-street, as I was on my beat, I see him go along; he asked the landlady to let the box stay there half an hour, and she consented, and she locked the door, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away to your beat? - Yes, the corner of Tudor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew you was a watchman? - Certainly he did by my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other watchman there? - I am not certain whether they were or not. Before I carried it up I was untying the cords, and he said cut the knots off; and I said, if you out all the knots off it will be too short.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not this create a suspicion in your mind seeing a man uncord the box? - I did not see it broke, it was broke before I was in.</p>
               <p>Court. Next time you see a man with a box open, ask him how he came by it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the contents? - No. I lived in Yorkshire, and there is the direction of Hulme on it; I have an uncle there.

            After she had refused, what then happened? - She said, it I followed her she should murder me. She went out, and I followed her at a distance from her, I followed her up to Bunhill-row, and a gentleman stopped her; I was crying, and the gentleman asked me what was the matter?</p>
               <p>Q. After he had stopped her what became of the prisoner? - Then she ran into Chiswell-street, by a worsted shop; she put her hand into her pocket and pulled something out from her pocket, in a paper, and it dropped down; it was a bit of white paper wrapped up.</p>
               <p>Q. When the paper was undone, did you see what fell out? - Yes, the money fell out; I did not see it, but I heard it fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken up? - Yes; I believe it was six sixpences; I cannot say; I see some of them taken up, three or four by Mr. Fielder that had stopped her. She was then taken to the watch-house by Mr. Fielder.</p>
               <p>Q. You then appeared before the alderman the next day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is every part of what you have said true? - Yes. That is the woman, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the sixpence that woman gave you? - I gave it to Mr. Fielder.</p>

On Tuesday, the 6th of June did you see the little girl? - Yes, I did, about five o'clock in the afternoon, or a few minutes after, I was coming up Chiswell-street, and there were a number of chil<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010166"/>dren (there are two schools in the street) to the amount of twenty I believe, and this little girl was among them. On her telling her story to me, saying the prisoner had given her a bad sixpence, I took hold of the prisoner's arm, and the child was coming after, but was afraid of coming to the woman, she said, the woman will murder me; the child had a sixpence in her hand, saying, this woman has given me a bad sixpence, and will not change it; my daddy and mammy is gone on some business to the Minories, and will beat me when they come home, if she will not change it; I took the sixpence into my hand, from the child, and have kept it ever since.(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. That is the same sixpence? - It is, it appears to have been rubbed? I asked the child where she lived? she told me she lived in Grub-street; from the circumstance of her telling me that her daddy and mammy were out, I took the child to the shop, in order to put the child in possession of the house, and in passing by the hosier's in Chiswell-street, the woman seemed as she would go into the house; I stepped up to her, and laid hold of her by the right arm; I see her put her left hand into her pocket, and she pulled out some paper, I see it was paper before she dropped it; my suspicions were alarmed that it was more bad money, and she opened her hand and dropped it by her side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pull it out so as to avoid your seeing it? - She did exactly; it happened on falling on the pavement that three sixpences sell out, and some of the by-standers delivered the others to me, and I have had them ever since; I marked them.</p>

A little after nine o'clock at night, Tuesday last, my son and I were left in the shop alone; we are linen drapers, and have a parlour behind, in which is a window that we can see if any body comes into the shop, or passes the door; the candles were lighted on the counter, my son went out of the shop to put on his old clothes, to shut up; I see the two prisoners at the bar (they are two notorious villains) going to and fro before my shop window; I perceived them six or seven times; I suspected their intentions as knowing them very well. I put myself in a position if they entered the shop to take them. The young one he stooped into the shop, and then he looked round, and then he looked forward, and then he stood up; he saw every thing was clear and nobody was in the shop, he turns himself round to the window, and beckons to the other; then he took and turned himself short round, and wheeled himself where a bundle of muslin lay and laid hold of the wrapper; I jumps into the shop and caught him by the collar with my right hand.</p>

            . And the other was just at the door, and I sprung and caught hold of him by the left hand; I got hold of them both. Levy then said, I want some shirts. Brown was not in the shop, but they were in company together. I pulled them both round into the street, and sent for a constable, and they were taken to the watch-house; on searching them there was an old nail found on them, which they star the windows with, and by which I have been unfortunately hurted. They had no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them searched? - I did not. I would wish to remark that the tall one, and which I believe the constable will witness, d-mned his eyes, and said I should not live long.</p>

I never was near the door before nor since; I never walked past it at all; I went very quietly. What the constable says I am sure is false; I never put such a word out of my lips; I looked like another fool, to see him lugging the boy about, and he lugged me in.</p>

            , and Thomas Hammersley, against the form of the statute. The jury found you guilty of this charge on very clear and very satisfactory evidence, but the counsel made an objection in arrest of judgment, insisting that the bill was improperly described in the indictment in as much as it charged that the bill purported to be signed by Thomas Exton, clerk, and be directed to Lord George Kinnard, William Moreland, and Thomas Hammersley, of the parish of St. James's, bankers and partners. This objection has been considered by ten of the judges, who were all that met on the occasion, and who have agreed in opinion that which I shall now state; but before I mention the result of the opinion, it may be proper for me to observe that it is the office of a prudent, and cautious pleader, not to clog the record with unnecessary matter, or to throw a greater burden of proof on his client than the law requires; it is still more his duty not to state things which on the face of the indictment are repugnant, inconsistent, or absurd; old cases have given rise to much learning and argument, on the meaning of the word purport, or tenor, and on the necessity of using one or other of these terms, but no judicial determination has ever required that the purport and the tenor should both be stated in any case whatever. The purport of an indictment means the substance of it, as it appears on the face of the indictment to every eye who reads; the tenor of an indictment means an exact copy of it, and where that is stated, the purport of it necessarily appear;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010170"/>the forms of indictments for forgery are different in different instances, and of late years they have been more complicated then they used to be, and in my opinion very improperly so; in one which I have seen it was stated that the prisoner forged a false writing in the name of I. S. and others bearing the form of a warrant of attorney, which writing follows in these words: if an indictment stated merely that the prisoner forged a paper writing to the tenor or effect following, which on the face of it appears to be a bill of exchange, or other instrument within the statute, I see no objection to it, and at all events if it be stated that he forged a paper writing, purporting to be a bill of exchange, in the name of

                  Thomas
                   Exton

            , and then set out the bill, I think it would be good and unexceptionable; for the words purporting to be a bill of exchange, can only be necessary for the purpose of shewing which sort of instrument the prisoner has forged, mentioned in the statute; in order to do that, it cannot be necessary under the word purport, to state all the contents of the bill, the bill it self shews all those things; and the law has required that a copy of the bill should be stated on the indictment, in order that the court may see it is such a thing that falls within the meaning of the statute. The blunder in this case has risen from the circumstance that Lord Kinnard and others have carried on business under the firm of Messrs. Ransom, Moreland, and Hammersley, and the person who drew this indictment, forgetting that it was wholly immaterial whether any such persons as Lord Kinnard, Moreland, and Hammersley were mentioned, has taken great pains to shew that the bill drawn on Ransom, Moreland, and Hammersley, was drawn on Lord Kinnard, Moreland, and Hammersley, and in order to do that he has attested that the bill purports to be drawn on Lord Kinnard, Moreland and Hammersley. The bill purports that alone which appears on the face of the bill, on the face of this bill Lord Kinnard's name is not mentioned, and therefore the averment is not true, that it imports to have been drawn on Lord Kinnard; the consequence of that is, that <rs id="o17950701-3-verdict390" type="verdictDescription">

               the indictment is repugnant and defective, and you are to be discharged from it
            </rs>, but as the objection goes only to the form of the indictment, and not to the merits of the case, you must be remanded to prison till the end of the session, the prosecutor being at liberty, if he thinks fit, to prefer another, and a better indictment against you.</p>
