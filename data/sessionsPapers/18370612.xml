                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and keep a tobacconist's shop in Church-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. On Sunday night, the 4th of June, at a quarter to ten o'clock, I was in the shop and heard a scuffle outside—I went out, and found the prisoner scuffling with a gentle<lb/>man, who had hold of him, and three tobacco boxes were on pavement under his feet—I immediately asked the prisoner whether he had got say—he said no, he had not, but that a boy had run down the street—I pulled his coat open, and saw two projecting from his pocket—I did not take them out but sent for a policeman, and detained him—I examined my window, and found a piece of glass had been taken out, large enough to admit a man's hand—I missed seven tobacco boxes, which I had seen ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before, when I left that part of the window—they were quite close to the pane—it was not broken then—it was a piece that had been broken and puttied in three weeks before—the putty was quite hard—it was quite safe ten minutes before—there was no hole whatever I am sure—the piece of glass was taken entirely away, but not the whole piece—I could find no pieces—a person could put his hand through the hole and reach the boxes—the policeman took two boxes from the prisoner in my presence—they are all mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>).</p>

The prisoner was a lawyer's clerk—I had only known him a short time—he caled on me the latter end of last August, and said that he was out of employ, that his friends were respectable, and that he had an uncle in Ireland who had befriended him often, but that he, had displeased and he would not do any thing more for him—he asked me to take him in for three weeks, he expected to receive a remittance from his uncle—that he had correspondence with him, and they were quite reconciled—he asked me to give him board and lodging—I received him into my house and himlodging, food, and every thing, for about three months—Aemanpt get a situation which he said he was looking for; and one evening I said to him, "Roche, your uncle does not appear to come forward, and while I am employed in-doors, perhaps you will collect some sums of money which are due to me, as it is necessary you should do something if you can to assist me, you being an additional expense," the time I had consented to take him in being expired—he replied, that he should see his uncle the following week, and he had no doubt his uncle would discharge the debt, meaning the sums of money I had lent him—he said he would collect and do any thing for me in the interim, till such time as his uncle got him a situation and he did so until the month of March—he brought me several sums of money correctly, which he had received from my customers—from this time up to the time I discovered something wrong, this arrangement con-tinued—I told him on the 12th or 13th of March to call for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the Queen's Theatre, on Mr. Salter on Saturday—I gave him an invoice with the amount—he Continued after this till thee 14th of March and then left—I did not see him again till the discovery was Roberts and Mr. Mori were customers of mine—I had directed him to receive money from</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Briggs, of Blue Boar-court, Friday-street. About five o'clock in the evening on the 25th of May, I saw the three prisoners at the corner of Bridge-street, Blackfriars—I did not know them before—they formed themselves into a triangle position—I saw Smith pull up her clothes, and take some plait from under her gown—she drew it under her shawl—I saw two policemen near, and told them—as soon as they saw the policemen, Smith gave the plait to Sawyer, and she retreated back again—I was not near enough to tell the policemen—I took hold of her, and said, "What have you got here?—you did not come by this rightly"—I took it from her, and held it up to the policemen—I told them to take the other two, and said where I thought they had got it from—they were not more than twenty yards from the prosecutor's shop—we took them into the shop, and there was a box of the same sort stand<lb/>ing on the end of the counter—I did not see them walking from the shop—they might have met each other near the shop.</p>

On Saturday, the 29th an April, in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Dexter, the pawnbroker's, in Union-street, and found the male prisoner standing at the counter, offering some shoes for pledge—I asked him how he came by then—he said he had bought them overnight in Petticoat-lane, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked if he should know the man again if he saw him—he said she should not—the pawnbroker took the shoes, and I took the prisoner to the station-house—he said he lived at No. 14, Wheeler-street, Spitalfields—I found no such person living there—he afterwards said he lived at No. 14 Nesbit's-court, Fashion-street—I found that was correct—he said her sister bought the shoes overnight at eight o'clock, and was to make money of them for rent—I asked him how he came to tell me he bought then in Petticoat-lane—he said he was in a flurry, and did not know what he said—I found the female prisoner at the lodging, sitting with the other prisoner's wife—I found no duplicates there, and told him I could not find them—he said he must have them in his watch-fob, and he pulled on three dublicates, and said he had pawned two himself, one his sister pawned—the silk-weaving business was carried on there.</p>

My mother sent me to Mr. Child's, at the Hay-field, for a pair of sheets to be washed—the bar-maid gave them to me—I had a cloak on to put them under—I know Hemmingway, in the Mile-end-road—I saw the prisoner there—she tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me what my name was—I said, Pilkington—she said she had known me ever since I was three years old, and when she was a little girl my mother bought her a great wax doll, and she would give it to me; she asked if I had a pinafore on—I said no—she said, "Come with me; I will give it you; my mother just now bought a clothes-basket, and I will put the sheets on the bottom, and the doll on the top of the sheets, and the cloak over them"—she took the sheets away from me, and the cloak off my back, and said she would run down to the woman's house, and I was to stay—she ran away, and I ran home and told my mother.</p>

I was sent for to the prosecutor's about six o'clock—Mrs. Croome asked me whether I thought any thieves had got in at the front place—I said, "No, they could not"—I went and saw the cupboard which was broken open—I came down and asked the prisoner what she had done with the spoons—she would not give me any answer—about nine o'clock she said, "Here is a shilling for your goodness to my sister"—I said I did not want it—she then told me she had broken open the cupboard with a hatchet, and would have broken two or three more if she had not found the property—she would not tell what she had done with them—she said she wished to be transported.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold-beater and live in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner was my servant—having missed money, on Tuesday, the 30th of May, about half-past two o'clock, I marked one penny, ten halfpence, two half-crowns, five shillings, and one sixpence, and put them into my cash-box in the bureau in the back parlour—the box was occasionally locked—they were safe between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—on going to bed I locked the bureau, to the best of my knowledge—the key turned in the usual manner—in the morning I missed one shilling and two halfpence—I then marked two shillings and one sixpence, and added them to the number which I had previously placed there—I went out about two o'clock in the afternoon, and left them safe—I returned before five o'clock, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been abstracted—I sent for a policeman, and asked the prisoner if she would consent to be searched—she did so, and we found in her pocket a piece of gold, which I had missed about three weeks before—not finding the marked money on her, I asked if she would consent to have her box searched—she said yes—on getting into her room, she said, "If I confess the truth, will you forgive me?"—I said, "Open your box"—she did, and I saw a bag—she said, "I have taken 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the box, and no more"—we only discovered two shillings and three halfpence marked, which I recognised and a scent-bottle, which she afterwards said she had taken from the kitchen.</p>

Mr. Thornton lives in the house with us—on the 23rd of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner called at the house; he was quite a stranger, and asked me if Mr. Paris was at home—he was a gentleman living in the house—I said no, he was not—he said he came for an answer to a note which was left that day—he said a note was to be left in the drawing-room—I went up to look for it, and was hardly a minute gone when I heard the door open and shut—I ran down, and saw him cross the road with the coats on his shoulder—he was brought back with them soon after.</p>

Cook's room—my sitting-room was next to the prisoners' rooms—Mr. Cooks' room is on the same floor—there is a staircase from the counting-house to Mr. Cook's room, at one end of the building—it was usual to have a taper candlestick kept in the counting-house—we invariably burnt wax in it—on Saturday afternoon, the 6th of May, I was in the counting-house as late as half-past four o'clock, and much later—I sealed a letter with the taper at half-past four o'clock—the candlestick contained about an inch and a half of wax candle—this is the candlestick—I left the premises at near seven o'clock, and returned as usual on the Monday—in the afternoon of Monday I saw the taper placed on the mantel-shelf in the counting-house, where it usually where it usually stands—Mr. cook, Sen., was there at the time—we sent for the male prisoner, and ques<lb/>tioned him—the man who cleans the candlestick had brought it back—the prisoner was asked why this candlestick was so dirty—(I had not seen it dirty myself)—he said he took the candlestick when he broke the room door</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Bow-street. I was sent for to the prosecutors' premises, and went there on Tuesday, the 9th of May, about eleven or twelve o'clock—I saw in Mr. Cook's inner room, a quan<lb/>tity of things spread about, partly burnt and wet, and a cheat of drawers very considerably burnt by fire, the top long drawer was very much burnt, and the drawers upward from that, having the appearance as if a light had been put in about the centre of the right hand part of the drawer—the drawers had a lining to separate one drawer from another, and imme<lb/>diately over the centre of the right hand part the fire had nearly got through, showing that the fire was in that part of the drawer, and had burned there more than other parts—in that part the fire was spread, and had burnt through the front, and burnt upwards—none of the drawers were burnt below that one—it bad burned completely through the back part of the drawers—there was nothing burnt in the room but the, drawer and the things that were in it—the fire had just reached the ceiling but not burnt it, only blacked it, but in five minutes more I should think the place must have been on fire—I then looked at the door, leading from, top of the stairs into the outer room—that is the door opening from the counting-house—there was grease against the front of the door, as if a tallow candle had been accidentally pushed against it outside, and on the right hand side of the jamb the candle had also been against it, and I saw the fastening of the door was broken quite to pieces—it was a common, catch, and there was also a piece of the door jamb broken out, as if by an instru<lb/>ment—this was inside the door, immediately under the fastening, and I saw that could not be done by breaking the door open from without—I put the door to, in order to show the effect of it, and it was impossible to get a straw in where the piece was broken out of the door post—it is an iron box, which the door lock shoots into, and it was under that that the</p>

               <p>pieces were broken out of the door post inside, and that could not have been done while the door was, shut, it must have been done afterwards—the effect of forcing the door would have bulged out the iron in the centre, and made the door faster—there were marks inside of something have been put in to force it out—it was utterly impossible to get a straw in outside✗—the poker was shown to me, but it had then been straightened—I have no doubt the marks inside the door had been made with a poker, because it was a sort of three cornered mark—if there was an inch, or an inch and a half of wax candle in this taper stand, it could produce the fire—on the front edge of the drawer there were marks of wax, and one or two ✗ of wax in the drawer—I called Mr. Rowley's attention to this afterwards—I did not observe the spatters at first—I asked for the male prisoner to be sent for—he was brought to me, and I told him I was an officer of Bow-street, and had come to inquire respecting the fire, and then I asked him✗ what called his attention first to the fire—he said he was sitting up stairs with his wife, and that she went down stairs for the purpose of getting some water, and returned and told him she smelt fire—that he took his✗ lantern and went down, and proceeded up the yard as far as the pump, (which I found was about thirty-six yards from the door which enters the house stairs,) and that on turning his head round he saw fire, and sparks of fire lying before the window of Mr. Cook's room, and he immediately went and burst the door open with his foot, and in doing so his lantern fell down and the light went out, that he then went down stairs into the counting house, and got the wax taper, or candlestick, from there—I said "That had wax in it, had you no tallow candle?"—he said, he had not, that✗ they did not use tallow candle at all, they had none in the house, that they always burnt oil—I said, "Do you mean to say you have no tallow candle in the house at all?"—he said, that he had not—I then left him with Mr. Cook, and went to the female prisoner in her room, and asked her the same questions as to what called her attention to the fire on the Saturday night—she said she went down stairs to get water, and smelt fire, and returned and called her husband; that he went down for the purpose of putting out the fire, "she went to the public-house and called Davis, who came and assisted—I then commenced searching the prisoners' room—one part of the room is partitioned off, and forms a closet, and in the joist at the side I found the gloves—I afterwards searched the prisoners' bed✗ room, and found this coat among some things at the side of the bed, and at a subsequent search I found this scarf among the bed things—I had another scarf which I found there, but am afraid I have lost it—I returned to the male prisoner, and after putting some other questions to him he said, "I hope you do not suspect me?"—I told him that I did, and that I was satisfied he had broken off the fastenings from inside the door, and put on an appearance—here is also some address cards of Mr. Cook's, with an engraved plate, which I found in the prisoners' room—none of the articles I found in the prisoners' room were either burnt, scorched, wet, or damp, (except that I found part of a pair of stockings in a tub of dirty water, after the male prisoner was taken into custody) the articles I found in the drawers were all more or less scorched or wet—I took the male prisoner to Bow-street office, leaving a person to take care of the female prisoner—I returned immediately, and went to the room where the female prisoner was with her children, and observed that the fire had been fresh made, there were fresh coals on it, and bits of wood sticking out in front, and I observed a cotton glove burning on the top of the fire—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183706120059"/>
               <p>—I said, "What is this for?"—she said she did not know, she supposed the children had put it there—I said, "That cannot be, for I saw that glove on the shelf in the cupboard, and they could not get at it as it was above their reach"—I took up the poker and began to poke the fire out, and at the back part of the bottom of the grate I found this part of a vel<lb/>vet waistcoat and the tops of a pair of stockings with the initials H. C. on them, and I found the leg of this stocking afterwards in a tub of dirty water, the tops have been cut off; I also picked this watch key out of the fire—I showed her the things and said, "What can you say to this?"—she made no answer—I said, "Now, after this, what have you done with the table cloth?"—she said she knew nothing about it, she had never seen it—I made diligent search but found no shirt studs—the clothes I found in the closet of the room could not have been in the drawer where the fire was while the fire was in it, and present the appearance they did, for they were perfectly dry and had not the least smell of fire—tile other things all smelt strongly of fire.</p>

I remember when the fire was supposed to have happened—I left the premises about eight o'clock that night, and went to the Welsh Harp public-house; the female prisoner came to me a long time afterwards—it might be about nine o'clock—she called, "Davies," and I went with her; and when I went into the passage leading to our yard, she told me Mr. Cook's room was on fire—1 went into the premises, and went to the counting-house stairs, leading to Mr. Cook's room, and saw the male prisoner in the room—the upper part of the drawers were on fire then—I turned round, and went down as quick as I could, as George Wall called out for water, and I did not see what he was doing—there are two pumps in the yard, and there are pails kept by the pump for the use of the workmen—it is the custom to keep the pails about there—Walls knew that very well—I went and found a pail at the pump, and went part of the way up the yard—I fell over a ladder, and spilt the water—I went to another pump, filled the pail, took the water up to the room, and then the male prisoner was not there—he was down at the pump, with a square box, with a bit broken from the side of it—the box would not hold water to carry up stairs—it would not hold it long enough—I do not know whether he had that box in Mr. Cook's room—I assisted in putting out the fire—when the fire was out I asked him how it happened—he said, God Almighty knew, for he did not—he told me he had burst the room door open with his knee—he</p>

               <p>showed me how he did it—I asked for a light when I fell over the ladder, and the female brought a tallow candle—I am certain it was tallow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a travelling servant. I was in service on the 16th of May—on the night of that day I met with the prisoner in the street, and went with her to a house in Off-alley about, half-pas twelve o'clock—I went up stairs with her on the second floor, and the door was fastened inside—after we had been in the room she went down stairs and, returned again—when she came in the second time the door was fastened—it fastened with a spring—I went to bed there—I had a gold watch with me at the time—I wound it up before I went to bed, and put it in to my hat on the table—the prisoner came to bed to me—there was then a light burning in the room—this was about half-an-hour after—I went into the room about one o'clock—I went to sleep, and the woman of the house came and made a noise, and called me to look about for my things—I looked for my watch directly, and it was gone—the prisoner was also gone——I saw her again on the next Wednesday, the 23rd, I think, at Bow-street station-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183706120062"/>
               <p>—as soon as I awoke I sent a man after her to offer her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to bring back the watch—at Bow-street I said I would give her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bring back the watch—I asked her where it was—she said she had left it with Mrs. White, in Crown-court, Fleet-street.</p>

On the 16th of May I recollect the prosecutor coming to master's house with the prisoner between eleven and twelve o'clock—I think nearer twelve—I showed them into a room—I went in, and got the bed ready for them, and received the money—I did not go in after that—I heard no one go out of the house—master said he heard someone come down, and on that 1 went up to the room, and knocked at the door—the door was then ajar—I think it was then half-past twelve o'clock, but I could not exactly say—the woman was not in the room then—I awoke the prosecutor, and asked him if he knew that the woman was gone—he said, "No"—I saw him get up, and look for his watch—he said his clothes were all right—he went to his hat, and said his watch was gone.</p>

On the 13th of June, about eight o'clock, I saw Ashby go into our parlour, and throw the petticoats under a chair—Sutton was with him, but did not say any thing—they sold a table-cloth to Mad<lb/>dox, who took it away—Ashby took one petticoat out under his jacket, and left the others in a bag under the chair—he said he would come back after them, but he did not—Sutton had brought the things in under his jacket, and Ashby took them from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Riley, a shoemaker in High-street, Shoreditch. On Monday the 22nd of May, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came into my shop—Johnson asked to try on a pair of Adelaide boots, and while I was looking for a pair, I turned round and kept my eye on them, but before I could reach a pair, I saw a vacancy in the window—they immediately rose from their seats, and said they were going a little further, and would call as they came back</p>

               <p>—I said, "Stop, let me see what you have got"—I saw Smith patting something under her shawl—I pulled one boot from under her shawl—they both immediately rushed to the door—I laid hold of them, and Smith left her shawl in my hand—they both got away—I called "Stop thief," and Johnson was brought back—I am quite certain of them both—I found the other boot under a chair near the door, where Smith would pass to go out.</p>

In consequence, of information, on the 13th of June, I went down to Reigate, and appre<lb/>hended the prisoner in the service of a chemist there—the Duke's groom was with me, and asked her if she knew him—she said, "Yes"—I said I was an officer, and had come down to inquire about property lost while she was in the Duke's house—I said I suspected she had sold the things, and purchased a watch with the money—she said she had not, and she had not taken them at all—I said, under the circumstances, I should feel it my duty to take her to London with me, and I wished to search her box—she said it was at Dorking—I asked if she had no box at Reigate—she said, "No"—I said, "You must have something here, and I must go up and see what you have got"—I went up, and found the vinaigrette in a pocket, tied up with other things—she said it was her pocket—I, asked where she got that—she said it was her own, and had been given to her by a friend who was a long way off—next morning we went to Dorking—the persons there refused to let me see the box unless she was present—she after-wards went with me to the house, and a box was produced which she said was hers—I unlocked it with the key which I found in her pocket at Reigate, and found the ear-rings and brooch—she said nothing about them—the Duke's house is in the parish of St. James, Westminster.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Caplin-street, directly opposite Mrs. Harris. On Whit Monday I was at work in my shop, and saw Blackson go into Mrs. Harris's house—it was near upon three o'clock when he came out—I cannot say the time exactly—I had seen Mrs. Harris go away before he went in—I did not see anybody with Blackson—I saw him go in, push the door open in the passage, and turn round towards the stairs, and the door shut afterwards—I saw him come down and open the door, and he came and spoke to Mrs. Roberts—he pulled out a piece of something white while he was speaking to her—he had a dark frock coat on—I saw Mrs. Harris come home afterwards—I had seen nobody go into the house from the time Mrs. Harris went away to the time Mrs. Roberts went to tell Mrs. Fox, besides Blackson.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of June I put down my basket of bread at the corner of Alfred-place, Store-street—when I gt some dis<lb/>tance I saw the prisoner take the basket up like a baker would, put it on the top of his back, and carry it into Tottenham-co«rt-road—he was just crossing the road when I collared him, and told him he had no business with that—he said he hoped I should not give him in charge, as he was a baker out of work about six months, and had had nothing to eat that day.</p>

On the 13th of June I was at Billingsgate—I bought sixty mackerel, and placed them in two baskets, on my dog-cart—I went down into the market again to buy some eels, and when I returned, I heard the basket, and mackerel, and all were gone; the man that minds the carts had run after the thieves, but did not take them.</p>

On the 13th of June I was standing at the corner of a lane near Billingsgate, and saw the two baskets of mackerel standing—I saw the two prisoners come down St. Mary Hill, and go up Cross-lane, and then they came and stood by the baskets—Jackson looked to see if any one was coming, and then went and put the basket of mackerel on Gloster's head—he went up Idol-lane, and the other went up St. Mary Hill—I am quite sure they are the same two—I had seen them about the market—I found them the next morning, and pointed them out to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Langham-place, in the parish of Saint Mary-lebone—the prisoner was my under housemaid for two months. On Wednesday, the 31st of May, I placed a purse, containing a £10 note, a £5 note, two or three sovereigns, and some silver, on my dressing-table in my bed-room previous to going to bed—I missed a £10 note on Friday morning when I left my bed-room and came to my dressing-room to dress—the prisoner had access to that room in the course of her duty—I first missed the £10 note, and afterwards the sovereigns and silver, finding only the £5 note remaining—I had received the note from Hammersleys, my bankers, on the 30th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 15, Crown-street, St. Giles's. On Friday, the 17th of February, I left home at four o'clock in the afternoon, leaving my lodgers in the house, but nobody in my own apartments—I occupy the two parlours and let out the rest—I locked them both up when I went out—the street door is always shut—it was on the latch, and cannot be opened outside without a latch-key—I re<lb/>turned about ten o'clock, and went to bed without noticing any thing—about twelve o'clock next morning I had occasion to go to my drawers in the back room, and missed two boxes—(one of which had jewellery in it,) and my watch which laid by the side of it—the other box contained an eye-glass, a certificate of my marriage, and memorandums—I had seen the boxes not five minutes before I went out the day before, when I took two rings out of one—I also lost a silver tea-spoon off the mantel-piece in the same room, which I had seen about twelve o'clock the day before—I had not been out of the house between twelve and four o'clock—I might have been down</p>

               <p>stairs—the window was shut down when I went out, and secured by a catch✗ on the 18th or 19th of May I was fetched by the policeman, and saw pair of ear-rings, and the chain of my watch, which had been in the box which was missing—I know the watch-chain by its being broken, and I had tied it with a bit of string to the snap—it was attached to the watch at the time it was taken—it laid by the boxes in the drawers—1 had the keys of the drawers and of the door in my pocket—I noticed no marks of violence on the door—I cannot say whether my drawers were locked or not—I put the key in as usual next day, and did not notice that they were open—I slept in the back room, and locked the door when I went to bed—1 should think nobody could have gone into that room while I was there that morn<lb/>ing, and take the things without my perceiving them—I did not go out before I discovered my loss—I did not know the prisoner before now, but I have seen him pass before, as his mother lodged in my house—he came his to his mother several times before the robbery—I knew he was her son.</p>

It is a most fortunate affair I was not taken as well as yourself. I am obliged to be from home; nevertheless, I am hard at work for you, and I feel well satisfied you will come off triumphant, as every thing is being done for you to meet your enemies. One thing you must do is, to make over your property as soon as possible, in case of accident. I understand there is about forty witnesses against you, such as they are. Myself and Mr. Cockerill have been to the Register<lb/>office, and found a lease granted to Mr. Hammond, in 1756 adjoining, and all round Fisher-house, besides other property Mr. Hammond was possessed of on that estate; and up to the two houses Weaver's, and the other Pickering has got possession of, I have spoken to Mr. Rogers, who is ready and willing to conduct your case, which I hope will meet your approbation and I do expect you will be well supported by counsel—there are two questions at issue, the production of Miss Joburns, and the title of Mr. Pickering to Fisher-house, and they must both be produced, or you must be acquitted, that is the question."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George William Hoyle—I am a milliner and dressmaker, and live in Regent-street, in the house of William Bartelot. On Tuesday, the 9th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon I was sitting in the front drawing-room with Miss Marsh—I saw the prisoner coming up stairs, and sent Miss Marsh to speak to her in the back room I overheard her use the word "apprentice"—Miss Marsh came to me—the prisoner put her head into the room I was in, and said, "If you are engaged Mrs. Bee, I will call some other day" (my maiden name was Bee)—I went into the back room to her, and she said she had come about an apprentice—I asked her who recommended her—she replied the lady would know; she had only come to inquire about the terms—she was so flurried she scarcely gave herself time to speak—she inquired about my terms for three years and before I had time to reply she said, "Sixty guineas, I suppose?"—I said no, my terms were forty—she said they would no doubt suit the lady, and would I call on her—I hesitated, and she said should the lady call on me—I said, that would be better, and she appointed for her to call next day, between twelve and one o'clock—she then left—about half an hour after I went into the back room to get my purse, which I had left in a bag about ten minutes before she came in, and missed it—it contained a £3 Colchester note, eight sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and about 2 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is silver—it was a brown silk purse—nobody but the prisoner, myself, and Miss Marsh had been in the room from the time I placed the bag there till I missed the purse—all the doors were open—the rooms communicate by folding doors, and one folding-door was open—this is my purse, I am certain—I know the ring, which I put on it about three months ago.</p>

"Are vou not ashamed to stand and abuse a respect<lb/>able female?"—Mr. Richardson said it was only an attempt to extort money, and he would kick her out if she did not get out—she made use of a very dreadful expression, which I cannot repeat—she said Mr. Richardson was one of our confederates, meaning of me and the girl—the servant girl heard the whole of it—the psisoner then left, and on the step she took a very dreadful oath, and said I had better give her the money, or it would be the worse for me—she did not say any thine else that I remember.</p>

I saw a woman come out of the defendant's house, with beer in a pewter quart pot—I did not see her go in—I saw a girl go in with a blue jug, and come out with beer in the jug—I afterwards went to St. Leonard Shoreditch church—service was then on—I got there twenty minutes after four o'clock—it was the front door that was open—they came out at that door—the defendant's house is the White Swan, Long-alley, Shoreditch."</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 171.) On Sunday, the 2nd of April last, I saw the prisoner at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon in Milton-street, St. Luke's—after we had been together sometime, he asked me what time it was, as he said he would not lose the last half-hour—that is the time the persons are praying in church—I believe the church is open at St. Luke's at that time—1 pulled out my watch, and told him it was eight minutes past four o'clock—he had been with me then about half an hour—I am sure it could not have been less than a quarter of an hour—he left me after I told him—my watch was right by St. Luke's clock and the brewhouse clock—I should say it was very nearly a mile from where I was to Mr. Bray's public-house—it might be more or less—I did not know what he meant by losing the last half-hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you with him altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half an hour—I will swear it was not ten minutes or eight minutes before four o'clock—when I looked at my watch there was nobody within two or three yards of me—there were no girls—there were not two prosti<lb/>tutes in my company—I know Mr. M'Donald's public-house—I was not in that public-house that afternoon—I cannot say that I saw Mr. M'Donald nor any one connected with that house—another policeman was sent for from the Featherstone station, to state he saw us in the same street that afternoon—he came afterwards, but he did not recollect the day.</p>

               <p>me why I did not come, when Tucker's case was heard—I said I was not called in—the Magistrate said he wondered how a person could stand the office and hear false evidence given—I recollect this 2nd of April, from taking a boy into custody for breaking a square of glass, between two and three o'clock—Bray told me you were to give evidence in his case—I have not been to any solicitor's office with the other witness—I was on night duty—I got up, as near as 1 can guess, at twelve o'clock—I might go to the station-house before I went to bed—I do not recollect that I was in any particular place before twelve o'clock—I set my watch about half-past twelve o'clock—I went down Whitecross-street, and passed the brew house—I was at St. Luke's a few minutes before I was at the brewhout—you can go in a few minutes from there to Bray's—it is much further than from M'Donald's to Bray's—I have been in London very nearly two years, and have known Mr. Bray very nearly all the time—I sometimes drink there—I was detected drinking there while on duty—Bray is not the only person that would serve me—I have never asked you to lay informa<lb/>tions against any houses because they would not serve me, nor against Mr. Gold's in Old-street.</p>

On the 10th of May the prisoner came to my shop, at Hampton-wick—he said he came from Teddington for a brace of pistols for Mr. Strachan's son—I knew Mr. Strachan, and said, "Has Mr. Strachan got a son big enough to use pistols?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I don't like to send pistols without his father knew of if—he said his father was present when he gave the order—the value of them was about 305.—I gave him a pair—he came the next day, about seven o'clock in the evening—the first word I said was, "How about the pistols?"—he said, "You will know all about that to-morrow; I want a percussion gun: they are going to shoot: my young master has thrown down his watch, and put his foot upon it, and he wants a watch to go to the dinner table"—I said, "What sort of a watch was it?"—he said, "Like that," pointing to one—I said, "Take it"—he had the powder-flask and the other things stated, as I thought he was Mr. Strachan'a groom—he was dressed like a groom.</p>

                  </hi>. My father, William Morris, is a farmer, living at Eltham, in Kent. He had a quantity of sheep on his farm—I had the care of them—I counted them on Saturday, the 20th of May, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning, and found them all right then—I did not see any more of them till the Monday morning, about eleven o'clock—when I counted them, and missed one—on looking about, I found the skin, breast, neck, and feet in a shed—I took possession of them—Barry, the police man, came to me on the Tuesday, and compared two shoulders, which he brought, to the skin, in my presence—they corresponded entirely—I am satisfied they must belong to the same sheep—the two feet were left in</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of May, I was on duty at Deptford, and saw the prisoner about four o'clock in the morning, carrying a cloth containing two shoulders of mutton—I stopped him, and asked what he had—he said, "Meat"—I asked where he had got it—he said he had bought it, and directly afterwards he said, "My brother bought it for me at Woolwich"—I took him to the station-house—the meat was scarcely cold then, and not cut up as a butcher would; and there was some blood on the knee of his trowsers, which appeared fresh—I went to his brother at Woolwich, in consequence of what he told me, and told him what he said to me—I afterwards went to the prosecu<lb/>tor's house, and took the mutton, and was shown the skin with the feet—I fitted them together—they corresponded, and 1 have not the slightest doubt of their belonging to the same sheep.</p>

On the 25th of May, be<lb/>tween four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty in New Crotss-road, Deptford, and saw a brewer's dray drawn by three horses—it stopped at the Marquis of Granby—Walton was driving, and Ashton was on the side—when it stopped, Ashton tried to get some hay out from between two butts, and Walton held a butt on one side—Ashton threw the hay into the road, Brighton came and took it up, put it into the stable, and locked it up—brother officer came, and we watched for about half an hour—I saw a man go and speak to Brighton—we went and asked him for the clover which was taken from the dray—he said there was none—I said there was—I took him down the road, and told him to unlock the door, which he did, and I pointed it out, lying on the right hand side—he said it had been there the whole of the day—I sent Walton for Ashton, and asked him if he had any clover on the dray—he said he had—I said, "Do you know where it is?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I am certain you do; you were here when the man took it away"—he then said he thought the man was going to feed the horses with it—the horses remained in the dray, and were not fed with it—I said I should take them into custody—Ashton</p>
