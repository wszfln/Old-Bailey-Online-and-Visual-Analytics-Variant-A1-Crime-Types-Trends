On Friday, the 1st of October, I remitted two £10 and 1 £5 Bank-notes to my sister - I put them into a letter, which I sealed and gave to my sister Frances to take to the post - I directed the letter to Miss Dorey, No. 22, Finsbury-place, Finsbury-square - I had written on the notes before I sent them away, and I took the numbers of them, but not the dates - (looking at two notes) these are two of the notes I sent; I know them by my own handwriting on them - as near as I can recollect, it was near three o'clock in the afternoon that I sent the letter to my sister; and on the Saturday morning I had occasion to send a box to my sister, and on the Saturday evening I received intelligence that the letter had not arrived - on the Sunday morning, I went to town; and the first thing on Monday morning, I went to the Post-office, in St. Martin's-le-Grand - I did not go to the Bank myself - these two notes were not produced to me until lately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is this the writing to which you refer just over the amount? A. Yes - I wrote on one, "Mr. Ryde," and on the other, "Taylor," and I think, "

            . In October, 1830, I was letter-carrier at Enfield. I remember receiving a letter from Mrs. Jelly that month, with a string round it, perfectly well - I packed the letter with the rest of the packet, and put it in a bag - I tied the bag, and conveyed it safe to Edmonton - I sorted the letters out regularly at Edmonton, and tied them in separate packets, according to what they were - this letter was sent to the chief office in Lombard-street - I heard of a letter being missed in the course of two or three days; when the officer wrote to me respecting it, and I wrote him an answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been asked if you received a letter with a string round it - perhaps my friend has called your recollection to it by mentioning that? A. I am always very particular in remarking such letters - I have a perfect recollection of the string - I think it was a red string, but I will not be positive - there was sealingwax on it, and I think it was red wax - in fact, I am positive it was - I have not a shadow of a doubt of it - I have a recollection of such a letter with a string confining it - as to the colour of the wax, I cannot be positive, not to swear to it - as soon as they wrote to me from the office, it brought every thing into my mind - that was in 1830 - my memory has not been refreshed about it since that, till very lately - it had entirely escaped my memory till I came to be asked about it, when the officer wrote to me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a letter-carrier now? A. I am on the sick list - I never saw the prisoner, except at the office.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Is this the letter you wrote about it? A. (Looking at it) Yes, this is my writing - this brings the transaction to my recollection.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there any thing more in the letter than your saying you recollect the missing letter? A. I gave no statement in that letter about the string - I recollected about the string at the time I wrote that letter - I could not tell whether it was requisite to mention it in the letter or not - I gave every information I could - I do not think I have got the letter which this is an answer to.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier in the Postoffice: I have been so about thirteen years. The prisoner was formerly a letter-carrier, and was so on the 1st of October, 1830 - I made this memorandum (looking at it) within the last fortnight - I got it from a book, where he signs in one column, and I in the other - the book is here - (looking at it) these entries are signed by him - I have seen him write many times, and can take on myself to say, he was a letter-carrier in the employ of the General Post-office, on the 1st of October, 1830 - his walk was Finsbury-square - he delivered the twopenny-post letters in Finsbury-square - No. 22, Finsbury-place, was in his walk - if a letter had been sent from Edmonton, about three o'clock in the afternoon, it would come to St. Martin's-le-Grand between five and six o'clock, and would be sent out by the seven o'clock delivery, and should be delivered before eight, or about eight o'clock - it was Nichols's duty to make the delivery at that place that day - we have a regular mode of changing duty, and at seven o'clock at night, he takes Finsbury-place and square, and the right of the City-road - he was my assistant, and I took another part of the walk - here is his own signature to show he was on duty that evening - I am well acquainted with his manner of handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those notes - here is, "John James, John-street, Stepney" - can you say whose handwriting that is? A. That I verily believe to be in the handwriting of Nichols - they are both alike - I believe both to be his handwriting - he left the Post-office on Saturday morning, the 2nd of October, a little before eight o'clock, to make the eight o'clock delivery - that would be over about ten or a little after - he left the Post-office finally on Tuesday, the 5th - he went out with the letters that morning, with the eight o'clock delivery, and never returned - I did not see him again till he was apprehended in September last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He stayed on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and morning of the 5th? A. Yes - the third was Sunday - he did not undergo any examination about this letter in the course of that time, that I know of - we were both called to the desk to give an account who went to the Finsbury-place district at a certain hour - that was an inquiry - that inquiry was made on the Saturday or Monday, I am not positive which.</p>
               <p>Q. Show me the prisoner's handwriting in the book? A. This is it - here is a line with "Finsbury-square walk"- you will find he has written, " R. Nichols."</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write any thing but his name? A. Yes - there is no writing of his in this book besides his name - I should not be involved in any difficulty by the loss of this letter, that I am aware of, further than an inquiry - I should not have to make any payment on account of the loss - I was not suspended - I underwent an examination at Mr. Peacock's office, after the prisoner left - it was only once - I am the letter-carrier - he was my assistant - I did not appoint him or pay him - I have the stopping of the wages as charge taker - he does not look to me for his wages - I account to the Post-office for the payment of his wages - I do not think he was in debt to the Post-office at that time, as he was on duty - I am not aware that he was threatened to be turned out of the office if he did not make up some payment - I have no recollection of his being in debt at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two notes, and at his signature in the book - do you mean to say they are both alike? A. It appears to me, there is a great similarity, only one has been done with a pen more worn than the other - my conclusion is not so much from seeing his name in the book, as from other writing of his which I have seen on letters - the writing on the notes is like his ordinary way of writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he left the Post-office, had these notes been seen? A. I am not aware of it - I never saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the notes shown to you when you were questioned - before the prisoner went away, did you see the Bank-notes? A. No - I first saw them at Mr. Peacock's office, three or four weeks back.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When was the last time you saw the prisoner write? A. It might be the day he went away - it was about that time - we occasionally see one another write on letters.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. About how long had he been in the service of the Post-office? A. I do not know - he had been my assistant five or six months - I knew him a long time before, in the Post-office, but he did not work with me - while he was my assistant, I saw his handwriting seldom less than three times a day - if any addresses cannot be found, or letters are refused, or the party are gone away, we have to write that on them, and have to get answers to our letters, and write the answers on them - I have frequently seen his writing in that way - I have no doubt the handwriting on these two notes is his handwriting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Nobody is taken into the Post-office without an inquiry into his character? A. No; very strict inquiry indeed is made.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you express an accurate belief of it? A. I have seen him write his name on the bills, and have seen him write every day - I believe it to be his - I feel confident of it, from his particular method of writing - I seem to have it so fresh in my mind - I do not think it at all disguised - it is his general ordinary hand - I never saw him write the name, "John" that I know of - I may have seen him write, "John" - I have seen him write, "James," no doubt, but I do not recollect - I am in the employ of the Post-office.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Post-office, as inspector of letter-carriers. The prisoner was a letter-carrier, in the employ of the Post-office, on the 1st of October, 1830; his district was Finsbury-square - he was on duty for the evening delivery, on the 1st of October - a letter, put in at Enfield about three o'clock, would be delivered on the same day - on Monday, the 4th of October, I recollect a lady coming to the Post-office to inquire about a letter - I cannot recollect Miss Dorey's features exactly - two persons came - she gave the name of Miss Dorey - she gave me the numbers of the notes - I took them down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160008"/>correctly from what she stated, and have the entry here-(reads) - "A - 10 note, No. 743, dated the 6th of September, 1830; a - 10 note, No. 11, 120; a - 5 note, No. 1848"- the two last are without dates - I questioned the prisoner on the subject on that Monday evening very strictly - that was the first time I mentioned it to him - I told him there had been inquiry for a letter addressed to Finsbury-place, and asked if he had such a letter or not, and what he did with it - he stated positively he had not had such a letter - he would have to take out the eight o'clock delivery next morning, which he did, and he never returned to the Postoffice - he assigned no reason for his absence, and I do not think he returned any letters - he never returned - I have seen him write several times - my business was to examine the directions of letters brought back - I believe the words,"John James, No. 10, John-street, Stepney," on these notes, to be his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is his ordinary mode of writing, is it? A. It is - the letters from Enfield or Edmonton are conveyed by riding-boys - I have not the means of telling who was the riding-boy that day - all letters put in at Enfield or Edmonton would, in the ordinary course, come through the hands of the riding-boy; they would be sealed in a bag, and put into his bag at Enfield - he could have access to them by breaking the seal, which would be observed on his arriving at the office - I cannot tell whether he is now in the employ of the office - I do not know who he was - it is not in my duty - that duty is done in the sorting office - perhaps Simms can tell.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN SIMMS re-examined. I am the porter who received the Edmonton bags. All the bags came safe, or I should have made an entry in the book - I never look at the seals - the officer who opens the bags would see the seals - I do not know whether he examined the seals.</p>

            . In 1830, I was a clerk in the Post-office. It was my duty to open the bags of the two-penny-post letters, and the Edmonton bags, among others, on Friday, the 1st of October - they came safe as usual - I look at the seals of the bags - I was asked about it, soon after this letter was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was the riding-boy of that district? A. I do not know - I open the bags, and then the letters are taken round to be sorted - I dare say they may go through five or six hands, before they come to the assistant letter-carrier.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In the ordinary course of things, would the bag from Edmonton be brought by a riding-boy to the office? A. Yes - the porter, Simms, would have the handling of it first - he would only receive it - the officer of the road, Browning, would have it next - it would go from him to the stamper, and then to the sorter - the porter takes them from the office to the stamper, from him they go to the sorter, and then to the letter-carrier, and from him to his assistant.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When the bag comes into the hands of Browning, would it be sealed up? A. It should be so.</p>

            ? A. No; I do not know any woman who is now a prisoner in Bridewell, unless she is the person whom I asked to allow me to go into the place - there was a person before the magistrate- I had seen her when I was at the house - I live at No. 2, Tinley-court, Old-street - my husband is in the country, and he was so at the time this happened - the last time I saw him was about nine weeks ago - he is a labouring man - he has lived in Tinley-court - he is a tailor by trade, but is very handy at every thing - he was out of work, and he went into the country to his friends to try to get work - since he has been gone I do work when I can get it - sometimes cleaning and washing - I have worked for Mrs. Welch, who lives in the same court - I washed for her twice a week - I was paid 1s. 6d. - I have not worked for any body but Mrs. Welch, but I had been that morning to a person to know if they wanted me - my husband left me 5s. when he went away - the persons where I lodged have seen part of the 5s. - I have the two rooms on the first floor furnished - I have no family living - I came from the hospital to this Court to-day - the last time I was in Tinley-court was on the Sunday this happened - Mrs. Welch is my landlady - I have not had any visitors since my husband has been in the country, except a person from Berwick-street, who called to say she should want a person to work for her - I have had no male visitors but the landlord of the house - no other man has been to see me, neither young nor old - I am never up later than nine or ten o'clock, or very likely eleven - I have been out as late as twelve or one o'clock with my husband - I swear I have never been out as late as twelve or one o'clock since my husband has left town - I have been out as late as eleven o'clock with my landlady, but not alone, unless I have been at the next door or so - Old-street is not quite a mile from Field-lane - this happened about eight o'clock in the morning, as near as I can say - I went down Field-lane in my way home from the female in Berwick-street, who wished to employ me - her name is Mrs. Goodacre - she lives at No. 3, Downe's-place, Berwick-street - I got to her about a quarter before seven o'clock that morning - I got up a little after six o'clock - it is about two miles and a half or two miles and three quarters from where I lived - I did not stop there many minutes - I did not stop any where else - I had been there once before, but I did not come through Field-lane then - I passed by it once or twice - I have lived a year and nine months in London, but I have been in the country several times during that period- the door of the house I went into was open, and the shutters were up - the woman who was at the door had a handkerchief over her neck - her breasts were partly exposed - she had no bonnet on - I did not know what she was - there was a door in the passage with a little window in it - I cannot say whether there was a curtain to it - I did not know what place it might have been - I did not guess - if I had had the least idea, I would not have gone to such a place - I have heard of a house of ill-fame, but I did not know what they meant by it - I am twenty-one years of age, but I did not know what is the meaning of a house of ill-fame - there were public-houses before I got to this house, but I did not go in there because I did not want any thing to drink myself - I have been married five years - I married at sixteen - I have lived in town almost two years, but I did not know the appearance of a house of ill-fame - I thought I was going into a respectable house - it is the same lane where there are a number of pocket-handkerchiefs exposed on one side, and there are shoemakers on the other - there was no one with me - no one went with me from my lodgings nor returned with me - this occasion occurred to me before I got to Field-lane - I was about half way down Holborn when I first wanted - I went down some places in Holborn, but there were so many persons passing I did not like to go in.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get the 2s. from? A. It was part of the money my husband left me - I had lived upon the other 3s., and what I got from Mrs. Welch, but she used to give me victuals as well - there was another woman came into the room I went into - I do not know who she was - I have not searched for her - I could not - I was in the hospital, and not allowed to go out - I was married in Moorfields, five years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had been in London a year and nine months? A.

             (City police-constable, No. 79). I was fetched to Field-lane about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, on the 14th of September - I knocked at No. 19, the diar was opened by a female, and I went in - I saw the prisoner on a sofa in the back room - the prosecutrix was in the yard - she was covered with blood, and her things all torn off her, except a small portion of her gown at the lower part of her - she was washing herself, with two females, in the yard - she said the man had ill-used her, and nearly murdered her, and I took him into custody, to St. Sepulchre's watch-house, and then locked him up in the Compter - the yard had the floor were covered with blood, and her clothes were from her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the size of the yard? A. About three or four yards square, and the room was about two yards and a half wide, and about three yards being - the place was all smothered with blood - I had known field-lane - there are about four bawdy-houses in it - they have the doors open night and day - the shutters of the one the prisoner has the care of are never down - there is a glass door in the passage, which is the general rule with houses of that description - I should know houses of that description from my own experience - if a half-naked woman was at the door, it would not increase the difficulty of knowing them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix came into the house about eight o'clock in the morning - she was in the house about a quarter of an hour before I saw her come into the back room, and ask permission to wash herself - she was told, certainly she might do it - the servant of the house asked her to stand some gin, and she gave some money to fetch some - I do not know what she gave her - when we had drank that, she asked me personally to go cut, and have some rum with her - I went out after a good deal of persuasion, and we went into Thompson's, on Holborn-hill, where she called for a quartern of rum, which she paid for herself - after we had drank that, I paid for a quartern of rum, and we were in the public-house about an hour, talking over it - then I left her, as I thought, and returned to the house in Field-lane - I did not think she was following me - I returned to the house, and fell fast asleep, in consequence of the liquor I had had - I suppose I was asleep two or three hours, when the servant of the house suddenly awoke me, and told me that woman there had robbed me of half a sovereign - I felt in my pocket for the half-sovereign, and found it was gone - I arose up, and accused her of taking it - she denied having it, and a scuffle ensued between us - by this time, there were three or four women in the room - in the scuffle, the half-sovereign fell from some part of her person - I cannot tell what part it fell from - I picked up the half-sovereign, and then sat down on the sofa, - then the officer came and took me into custody - there was a woman that saw the whole of the transaction, but the officer heard she was coming to speak the truth, and he has brought some trifling charge against her, and confined her in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to FREDERICK PRINCE. Q. Who took up Mrs. McCarty? A. I took her up on Monday afternoon last - Catherine Saunders is her name - I took her for an assault and striking the prosecutrix - I had repeatedly seen her, but I did not know she was the person till she was described by the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MARY SCULLY. Q. Do you know Thompson's gin shop on Holborn-hill? A. No; I have heard speak of it many times - I know Holborn-hill - I passed down there that day - I do not know on what side of Holborn-hill Thompson's is - I do not know the house - I had no spirits that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Up to the time that the woman struck you and took the 1s. 4d. out of your hand, did the prisoner do any thing? A. She said to him, "I told you she had been robbing you," and he took the 1s. 4d. and put it into his pocket - when the woman struck me and took the 1s 4d. from me, the prisoner was standing by her side - he had one hand in his pocket, and the other in this manner against me (clinching her fist) - when I was before the magistrate I was hardly able to speak - the prisoner did not meddle with me till after the woman had taken the money.</p>

            . I am a lamplighter, and live in Marsham-street, Westminster. I was in St. Martin's-lane on Sunday morning, the 21st of September, at ten minutes before five o'clock - I went to turn off my lights - I saw the prosecutor standing with his back against a pawnbroker's shop, a few doors from St. Martin's-court; he seemed very intoxicated indeed - I know the prisoners, I saw them both with two more, they were coming from St. Martin's-court - they came up to the prosecutor, and one of them pulled his hat over his eyes, and the others struck him - I do not think either of the prisoners was the person who struck the prosecutor - Sullivan is the man who pulled his hat over his eyes - I went back to them and told them not to ill-use the gentleman - they then left him and went into the middle of the road - they then said something to one another and went back to him, under the pretence to pick him up - they then dropped him and left him, crossed St. Martin's-lane again, and went up into a court opposite - I then went into New-street, and saw two policemen, and told them what had happened - they directly ran and told me to follow them - (when they went back to him, with the pretence of lifting him up, I did not see what they did to him, as they were all four round him, and two attempted to lift him up) - the policemen desired me to follow them, and when we got into Bedfordbury the two prisoners ran into the first court out of New-street, in Bedfordbury - they all just came out of the court as the policemen got to the corner of it, and three of them ran down Bedfordbury, and the prisoner Anderson ran up the Bury - I followed him, and said to the policeman, "There goes one of them" - I followed him into Rose-street, calling, "Stop thief" - a policeman stopped him - I told the policeman to bring him back into Bedfordbury, and there found the other policeman had got Sullivan in custody - I told him I would go down to St. Martin's-lane, and there I found the prosecutor still lying where they had knocked him down - we took him to the station-house in Bow-street - I assisted the policeman in taking him there - the prosecutor was searched there, and two half-sovereign taken from him, some silver, a few halfpence, and his watch - I did not see any thing attached to his watch.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty in New-street, Covent-garden, on Sunday morning, the 21st of September, about half-past four, or a quarter to five o'clock - Atkins came to me - I ran on before him to the top of Bedfordbury, and saw the two prisoners and two more come out of Goodwin-court - they were running - they turned to the right and ran down Bedfordbury, all four of them - I heard Sullivan say, as they ran, "Not that way, you b - , there is no thoroughfare - up the next court"- meaning Chimister-alley - I was about two yards behind Sullivan then, and immediately laid hold of him, and said,"You shall not go up the next court at all events" - one of them ran up Brewer's-court - another policeman went up there after him - I took Sullivan and held him at the end of that court to prevent any body coming up - I then took him to New-street, and saw Robinson standing at the end of St. Martin's-court with Atkins the witness - I proceeded to the station-house with Anderson, who was in custody of another officer - on going to the station-house Sullivan said, "This will do you no good, I shall be one with you" - on getting to the station-house I searched Sullivan, and in his pocket I found this piece of tow with this piece of chain on it, as it is now - I took this knife and a latch key out of his pocket - Anderson was taken by Attfield - he was searched, but I believe nothing was found on him - the prosecutor was also brought to the station-house - I took his watch from him there; there was nothing attached to it but a split ring.</p>

               <p>Sullivan. Q. You say, the four men went one way? A. They all turned to the right, and went down Bedfordbury - when I had Sullivan in custody, Anderson turned back, and ran by me, and Atkins said, "There goes one of them" - I said, "Run after him, and cry, 'Stop thief;'" but at first they all ran one way.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty in New-street, and heard the cry of "Stop thief" - I saw Anderson in Lazenby-court - I was coming through the dark part of the court - it is very narrow - I met Anderson in the dark part of the court - I asked him what he was running for - the lamps had been just put out - he said he was going home - I told him he must have been doing something, or he would not run so fast - he said he had been doing nothing - at that time Atkins came up, and told me to take him into custody for knocking a gentleman down in St. Martin's-lane, and that there was another in custody in Bedfordbury - I immediately took him into Bedfordbury - Sullivan was in the custody of Johnson - I searched Anderson at the station - nothing was found on him.</p>

             re-examined. I found the tow in Sullivan's left hand pocket - the chain was on it, and slightly entangled in it - it was not covered over with the tow, but lying on it - a person in the watch-house, who stood in the light, said, "There is a bit of chain in that tow," before I saw it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160012"/>Sullivan's Defence. On Monday morning, when I was taken before the magistrate, a bit of chain was produced which the policeman said he took from my pocket - I was sent to Clerkenwell for a week, and brought up again, and the magistrate asked the prosecutor if he had found any more of the chain - he said, "No" - he asked if any was left on the watch - he said, "No" - now he says, that three or four days afterwards, he found part of the chain in his pocket - in the mean time I was remanded from Monday to Monday, and now he says he has a piece in his pocket couresponding with it - he said, on the second Monday, that no more of the property was found, and he had nothing to add to his evidence - a week had elapsed between the examinations - Anderson was not in my company - I never saw him before I went to the station-house with him.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. As I was coming down New-street, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" - I was not in company with the prisoner, or any body - I saw a man running- I ran after him - a policeman stopped me, and asked me where I was going - I said I was going home, but seeing a man run up there, I had run after him.</p>
               <p>JAMES ROBINSON re-examined. I do not know when I found the part of the chain; it might be a week after, or more - it was my daughter found it; she took it out of my pocket - I do not think this could take place at the second examination - when I left the public-house, I would not let the waiter see me home - I suppose I walked about the streets, and stopped to rest myself till this happened - the landlady said she thought I had had more than would do me good - I was in no company after the waiter left me.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I can account for being there - I was going to Covent-garden market, and had the money in my pocket, which the policeman took from me.</p>

             re-examined. When I took the tow out of Sullivan's pocket, it was not put on any table - I had it in my hand, and while in my hand, Stace, who was formerly a serjeant in the police, said, "Why there is part of a chain in that tow" - it had not been out of my hand at the time.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. Two pieces of chain were put before the clerk at the office - the policeman said it was broken, and the clerk said it was of no consequence, he might join them. Witness. I put the chain in a piece of paper, and when I took it out at the office it was in three pieces - I put them together, and there is not now a link missing - took all that from Sullivan's pocket.</p>
               <p>JURY to ATKINS. Q. Are you quite certain the two prisoners were in company together? A. They were, I am certain, with the other two - they all four together, and there was no other person there - all four came down together, and went to the prosecutor, who stood with his back against the shutters, and Sullivan pulled his hat over his eyes - I never saw either of the prisoners before - I knew one of the others, which made me suspect them, as I knew he was a suspicious character.</p>

On the 26th of August, just before twelve o'clock, I heard a violent sereaming, and ran down stairs - on going down I saw the prisoner leaving the street door - Mrs. Clements came out of her room with her hands extended - she appeared to be wounded - I saw blood on her thumb and fingers - I pursued the prisoner, and caught him - he ran, and when he saw me coming out of the door he rather looked round, and mended his pace - I followed him, secured him, and said,"You rogue, what have you been doing?" - he deliberately said, "I have stabbed the woman, and I hope I have done it effectually - I shall die happy to-morrow for it" - I took him back to the house - when I took him into the house I said to Mrs. Clements, "Is this the man who stabbed you?"- she said, "Yes;" and he said, "If I have done it effectually I shall die happy," and after that he asked her to shake hands with him - I said no, he had shook quite enough with her, and hindered him - he said she was the girl he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160013"/>loved, and the girl he would die for - he said he had contemplated this two months to do it, and he had whetted the knife that morning to do it.</p>

On the 26th of August I was on duty in the neighbourhood, and saw the prisoner pursued down Manchester-street - he was stopped, and I came up and saw Saint holding him by the collar - I inquired what was the matter - I took him to the house where the prosecutrix was - I saw her sitting on a chair, and blood flowing from her left side on the floor - I asked him where the knife was - I saw a number of knives lying on the table - he said the knife was gone - I looked among the knives on the table, and asked him which one he did it with - he said it was his own knife - I found no knife on him - a knife was afterwards delivered to me by a brother constable, Jeremiah Haynes, 130 - he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I state any thing further to you? A. On the road to the station-house, he said it was not done in a drunken frolic, it was meditated in his breast for two months, and he was sorry he had not done it effectually - and at the station-house I said to the inspector, that I must go back to the house to get a doctor to attend the woman, and the prisoner said he wished that I might bring news that she was no more - these stays were given to me.</p>

            . On the 26th of August I was standing almost opposite the house - I heard a scream, and went towards the house, and the prisoner came out with a knife in his hand - he ran about eighty yards, and then Martha Clements came out and said, "Stop him; that is the man" - I did not see him stopped.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to state that in the morning I had no knowledge of what I did - I know nothing of the transaction - I am a stranger in London, and have no witnesses.(The prisoner here handed the following written defence.)"I beg your clemency, your protection, your gracious assistance. I humbly place myself at your feet, imploring your mercy and the humanity of the Court. I have known Martha Clements from my childhood, and at the age of seventeen I have formed a strong attachment for her. Soon after, I entered the East India Company's service, and served in it the term of seven years. On my return to this country, in May, 1833, I landed at Gravesend; I came direct to London, and made inquiries after Martha Clements, and found she was not married, but had a child, who is now living. I remained in town three days, chiefly with her. I left and went to my friends in Gloucestershire, with a full intention (as I then promised) to return in a month, and that we would then get married, as my affections were very great for her, and I believed she felt the same ardent wish for me. When I returned to Gloucestershire, my health became much impaired from the sudden change of climate, and continued so a long time, which prevented me coming to London for nine months. I returned in February last;

             and I, from that time, associated together: we arranged to get married, had the banns put in and registered at Shoreditch Church; we then mutually agreed and cohabited together until circumstances would admit of our union. I am a shoemaker, and with our industry we lived in comfort: we were several weeks in this mutual, and, as I believed, affectionate way. I have done all in my power to make her happy, and resolved to get married in a few weeks. She caused the marriage to be delayed. I was told that she was carrying on an unlawful intercourse with another man, which caused a dispute between us, and much uneasiness to me; she denied it, but in a short time after she proved it to be too true, for she left me and took with this man. I went after her four different times; each time we met, and she told me that she was cohabiting with this man, (

She did not say that she would agree to my wishes, but told me she would come to me at my lodgings: she did not come to me. I was very much troubled and unsettled in my mind since she left me, and from that time I could not rest but thinking of her. The morning I was taken into custody, I drank several glasses of spirits; I therefore lost all command of myself, all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160014"/>reason and judgment. I could not rest day or night from her ill-nature to me, for I was excessively fond of her.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did she own she had taken it before you said you would forgive her, if she gave you back the money? A. No, I think not - she did not tell me that till I told her I would forgive her, I think; but I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. After she gave you some account, did you require to have her boxes searched? A. Yes; I fetched the landlord of the house up - they were searched by three people - I was present, and the master and mistress of the house - among other things found, my maid found a piece of paper in a box or bag of hers - I was in the room when it was found - it was a rough memorandum which I had made of the money, and had left with the money in my desk - it is in my own handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever told the prisoner you had money in the desk? A. No; I am a widow - I had never sent her to the bureau for money - she has been to it for other things - she came to me on the 30th of December - I had a good character with her - I returned from Bath on the 15th or 16th of August - it was safe then - and I then put 35l. into it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you returned from Bath there was 55l. in the desk, and you put 35l. to it? A. Yes; this is the memorandum I had in the desk with the money - it contains the particulars of the money I had before I went to Bath - there were several other memorandums with it - I missed all the papers.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell us when you last saw that memorandum before the 31st of August? A. I never saw it since I came from Bath - I left it safe when I went there.</p>

            , SEN. I am a proprietor of cabs, and live in Paradise-place, Lower-road, Islington. On the 5th of September, I was in the neighbourhood of Finsbury-square, talking to Jolly - the prisoner came by on a mare, and asked if we knew any body who would exchange this mare for a pony - Jolly said he thought he knew a man who had a pony to part with - he produced the man to him - I followed him soon after - the prisoner looked at the pony - they did not agree about the exchange; and after that, Jolly asked him the price of the mare, as he thought he knew who would buy it - he said, about 15l. - I thought her cheap, and afterwards said, "If you will buy the pony, I will buy the mare" - I at last bought the mare of the prisoner for 13l. - I was met with the same mare, driving in a cab, by Mr. Boutall, afterwards - the prisoner said he had her from a gentleman named Windle, and had had her six weeks - this was on the 5th of September - in consequence of suspicion I afterwards entertained, I only paid him part of the money - he was to come for the rest on the Monday following - he gave me the name of

I was left in care of the shop on Wednesday, the 10th of September, from a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning till eleven o'clock: during that time I placed this silk on the counter - it was in one piece - Mr. Moore and I had occasion to look for it, and it was gone - it was brown silk for covering umbrellas, with a tobine border - it was lutestring, twenty-seven inches wide - there were ninety-eight yards, and it was worth 20l. - I had placed it on the counter in the morning to clean out the shop, and missed it about ten o'clock, when Mr. Moore came to town; there was nobody in the shop but me - before that I had occasion to go out of one shop into the other, and I suppose in the mean time it was taken - I had but one customer there all the morning - it was a large roll of silk - I went round to a great many umbrella makers and pawnbrokers, and told them of our loss - next day we heard it had been offered for sale, and I saw that day a pattern about two inches wide at Mr. Wilson's, in Crown-street - the pattern is exactly like ours - it has a tobine border - I have not seen the piece itself since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you examined before the magistrate at the first examination? A. Yes - Lloyd was examined as a prisoner - he was not desired to tell all he knew that day - he said he would cause the person to be brought forward who gave him the silk - he was the only person in custody then - that was on the 11th - he said he had received it from a person, and he would do all he could to get the person into custody - the next examination was next day, Friday - Lloyd had been asked to find bail to appear if the person was taken - he at first said he thought he could find bail, but he did not - this was at the third examination - at the first examination he gave an account how he got the pattern - he was asked who he received it of - he was not asked to find bail at the first examination - he was taken by his own desire to a coffee-shop, for the purpose of finding Bradley Potts - he expressed his readiness to discover the person for whom he received the pattern - he gave a full account of what he had to say on the subject - he was not sworn - on the third examination the magistrate asked Lloyd if he received the silk from Potts - that was on the Tuesday, and that was taken down, I believe, in writing - he was treated as a witness on the part of the Crown at that examination, and he seemed to render every account he could of the pattern, and from whom he received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. It was after Lloyd was in custody on this charge that he gave this account? A. Yes - he did not give more than one account of it in my presence - he said he received it from Bradley - he did not make use of the name of Potts - I do not recollect that he gave any address - I was in my master's shop on the 10th at a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning - I had one customer come in about nine o'clock in the morning - I missed the silk about an hour or an hour and half after the customer left the shop - when the silk is rolled up it would make a parcel of twenty-seven inches long- there was a wooden roller in it - it could not be doubled up.</p>

            . I am an umbrella manufacturer, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury. I have known the prisoner Lloyd about six years - he was formerly in the house of Morrison and Co., silk-mercers - after leaving them he was in business for himself in Fore-street, City - all I know of him for the last three or four years was his calling on me to ask for relief - on Thursday, the 11th of September, between two and three o'clock, he called and showed me a pattern of silk, and asked if I could purchase it, and what was the worth of it.</p>

             re-examined. I have no doubt this is the pattern - the prisoner showed it to me - he asked if it was worth 2s. 6d. a yard - I replied, that I could not buy under these circumstances - I must see the manufacturer - he replied, that he would bring the person to me who had the piece - I said that would not be sufficient, I must go to his house to know that he was the manufacturer, having my doubts of it - he said there were about one hundred yards, and afterwards he said it was exactly one hundred yards, and the manufacturer was Mr. Taylor, of Gee-street, Goswell-road - I said I would keep the pattern - he urged very much to have it back - I then told him I suspected it was stolen - he said he knew nothing of it if it was stolen - I said, having known him when he was respectable, I hoped he had not lost his character, and would give what information he could, as he declared he was innocent of any thing - he said he met a man named Bradley, in Bunhill-row, and that he would bring him to me next morning at ten o'clock, as he had appointed to meet him next morning at a coffee-shop in the City-road - he wished to bring him that afternoon, but I told him I should not have time to attend to it - he then left - after he went away I made inquiry, and discovered a piece of silk had been stolen from Mr. Moore the day previous - between five and six o'clock that evening, Lloyd called again, and inquired if I had heard any thing more about it whether it was stolen - I told him what I had learnt respecting it, and asked him if he could produce the person directly from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160018"/>whom he had it - he said not until ten o'clock in the morning - I desired him to give me every particular respecting it - he said he had had it from a man named Bradley, whom he met in Bunhill-row - that Bradley had asked him if he knew any umbrella maker where he could sell such a thing, and that he replied that he did, and had come to me with it, being the nearest - I asked if he had any objection to go to Mr. Taylor's, in Gee-street, who he said was the manufacturer - he said it would be of no use going there, for Bradley had sold it since he had seen me in the morning - he said he was to sell the silk for 2s. 4d. a yard, and what he got more he was to have for himself - I sent for a constable unknown to him - when the constable came, I had advice how I ought to act - Mr. Moore's brother afterwards came, and gave him into custody - I suspected it was stolen, from the price he offered it at - it was worth about 4s. 6d. a yard at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. If he had asked a reasonable price, perhaps you would not have objected to purchase? A. I should, unless I found he had bought it honestly - I never suspected him before - I told him my suspicions the first time he called, when he wished to have the pattern back - he returned to me the same evening, to know if I had ascertained whether it was stolen - I do not think he has varied from the account he first gave - I told him I believed he had become the dupe of somebody who had come improperly by it, and I believe so now - I was before the magistrate four times - he appeared ready to give every account of the transaction which he was able - it was in consequence of what he said that the other prisoner was taken - he was told by the magistrate he must find bail for his appearance or be committed, that justice might be brought home to the person from whom he received it - I believe he was treated as a prisoner until the last time he was brought up - Potts had been taken into custody on the Saturday night before - he was told at the final examination that he must remain in custody to bring the case home to Potts - he was asked what he had to say, and it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the magistrate say he felt convinced Lloyd was innocent, but he must remain in custody till Potts was tried? A. He said he thought so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. All you know is, that his statement was taken down? A. Exactly so - the statement was not taken down before the magistrate the last time - it was done in a private room by the clerk, and after the examinations were taken down, Lloyd was asked what he had to say - I understand Potts gave himself up - Morrison and Co. are in a great way of business.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you business there at that time? A.

Sir, I should thank you to give me a final answer, and that is, whether you intend to give me the full amount of my loss, which is more than you may think for. The clothes which my uncle bought me for the sea, amount to 2l. 4s.; my wages 3l. 15s.; the full amount 5l. 19s. Now, Sir, it is determined by myself and my uncle, if the money is not paid some time this week, he will write for the captain to come to London; if such should be the case, it will cost you 20l., besides disgrace you for ever; but, Sir, my uncle do not now who it is, nor shall he now, if all things go wright to my mind; but i shall expect to have the full amount. Sir, the captain have wrote to my uncle concerning the villainy that some person or persons have been guilty of, as the case is something similur to that of Mr. Barnes and the soldiers. Sir, i can assure you, unless you pay me the full amount, something serious will occur, but i should be very sorry for such a thing, as it very possibly might ruin you for ever; but, Sir, perhaps you would rather pay a little than pay a great dell, but you can please yourself, and act as you please; but by God almighty, if the money is not paid me by three o'clock to-morrow afternoon, dread the consequences. 3l. 19s. is my demand. I remain, your humble servant, Henry Smith;"

I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, before the 23rd of September - on the 1st of October, I was in the neighbourhood of the Minories, and saw him there, waiting at the corner, evidently watching my coming out of Mr. Richardson's, the grocer's shop - he came up to me, and put this letter into my hand - I read it in his presence, and said to him, "I thought you told me you were going into the country" - he said he had been advised not to go - I made an appointment to meet him again in Fenchurch-street that afternoon - this was about ten o'clock in the morning - I then proceeded to the Thames police-office, and saw Mr. Ballantyne, the magistrate, and in consequence of directions I obtained there, I went into the City, and Herdsfield was sent with me - I marked a sovereign - I met the prisoner in Fenchurch-street, at three o'clock - I went up to him and said, "You are here waiting" - he said, "Yes" - I said, "What a villain you must be, to give me this trouble" - he only laughed at me - I put the marked sovereign into his hand - Herdsfield then came up, and took him into custody - I gave him the sovereign under the decided impression of fear - it was arranged that he should be taken into custody by my giving him the marked sovereign - I had no apprehension when I parted with the sovereign, because he was to be taken into custody - I never supposed he would take any step for the purpose of extorting money - I gave him that sovereign for the purpose of having him taken into custody - I was under no apprehension.(The letter was here read, for which see the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JONES. Q. When was the first time you saw the prisoner? A. The 23rd of September was the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that I ever saw him in my life - I swear that positively - I am a ship-chandler, and have a warehouse - I never gave permission to any person whatever to sleep in that warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. In the early part of this year, for instance, did you happen to meet with any sailors or others, in a destitute condition? A. Not to my knowledge - I meet with such persons every day - I was never applied to to allow persons to sleep there - I have been applied to for relief almost every day by persons of one sort or another - I never told any body that I had seen the prisoner before - I swear positively I never spoke to the prisoner before in my life, and never saw him, to my knowledge - I never gave him permission to sleep in my warehouse, never at any time in my life - I never gave him any money before the 23rd of September - I never gave him any bread and cheese, nor any victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to him, "If you come about half-past nine or ten o'clock, I will let you in; but do not let any of my people see you stand about the gateway, but walk up and down on the other side of the way, and when the shop is closed you can walk through?" A. Never - I do not know a person named Dixon, nor John Pettigrew, that I know of - not by name - I never gave money or victuals to the prisoner before September, nor any articles of clothing, to my knowledge - I will swear positively I never gave him a waistcoat, or any thing - I did not go into my warehouse between four and five o'clock one morning in July, and see any persons who had been sleeping there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on any morning in July, say to any person in your warehouse, "Put up the rug and things in the same state as you found them, otherwise my servants may suspect that somebody has been sleeping there?" A. Never - I have no such things in my warehouse - I never said so to the prisoner, nor any thing like that, overnight, to any body - I never, to my knowledge, saw the prisoner till he put the first letter into my hand - I never gave permission to the prisoner and another young man to sleep in the warehouse, nor on any boxes there - I never told him or any person, that before he left the warehouse in the morning, after he slept there, he must look out to see if the watchman was off his beat.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, you never, on any occasion, attempted to take any liberty with this man? A. Decidedly not - he never said to me, "Come, Sir, this will not do for me" - I never said to him, "I hope you will not take any notice of what has occurred," and gave him 6d. - not give him biscuits and cheese, saying, "Take this; I hope you will never notice what has occurred."</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you authorize any body to go to the attorney for the prosecution to see the letters in this case? A. Never - the person now standing behind the Counsel came to see them - I told him they were in the hands of my solicitor - I never authorized him to go and see them - I have a shopman named

               <p>MR. JONES. Q. Did you not give the prisoner authority to go to your solicitor, to see the letters, and give him the name and number of the street? A.

            . I am porter to Mr. Collins, and have the care of the warehouse from six o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night; and sometimes later, when we are busy - after locking up the warehouse, I go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160022"/>and hang the keys up in the shop - I never knew the prisoner to sleep in the warehouse - he could not have gone into the warehouse while I had charge of it - I have been in Mr. 
Collins' employ about two years.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lock the warehouse at night, and hang the keys in the shop, where your master can have access to them? A. I always hang them in the shop - the shopman mostly has the keys - my master can get to them at any time - I shut the shutters, and the shopman locks the shop doors - I shut the warehouse up - the gates of the warehouse lead into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a passage through the house or shop into the warehouse? A. There is a yard - if I had taken the keys home with me, and my master wanted to get to the warehouse, he could not have got to it from the shop, without breaking locks open, as the place was bolted and locked- the yard door was padlocked and bolted - the key was along with the other keys - if my master took the key of the padlock, he could get into the warehouse without going into the street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does Walker, the shopman, sleep on the premises? A. Yes - the prisoner never slept in the warehouse, to my knowledge - Walker and I once let in a young baker, who was destitute, unknown to our master - we let him in twice, but unknown to master - nobody ever slept there, to my knowledge, except in those two instances - we let the baker out, on both occasions, in the morning, unknown to master - nobody else was ever let in to sleep, or be there any part of the night, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. Q. You never told your master of it at all? A. Never, up to this moment - this is the first time I have mentioned it in his presence - he has never asked if any body slept there - I locked the young man in the loft, before I went home, and let him out in the morning, for he had no place to go to.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you any motive for letting him sleep there, except from motives of charity, knowing he was destitute? A. None whatever.</p>

            . I have been shopman to Mr. Collins eighteen or twenty months. The warehouse keys are placed in the shop after Manning has locked it up - I sleep on the premises every night, on the floor between the shop and warehouse - a passage leads by the head of my bed to the warehouse - a poor baker was allowed to sleep in the warehouse two nights, unknown to master - I know of nobody else ever sleeping on the premises during the time I have been there - I have slept there ever since I was in his service - nobody could have been brought to sleep in the warehouse without my knowledge - nobody, except the baker, ever slept in the warehouse or loft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you generally go to bed? A. From ten to half-past eleven - the porter locks the warehouse up, and hangs the keys up in the shop, and I lock the shop up - I am not in the habit of going out on business for my master in the day time - my duty is in the shop - I was never out during the day in July last - never for an instant - I take my meals up in the parlour - I never go out with bills, or to collect accounts - we give no trust - I have a holiday on Sunday - I am about the warehouse- it is impossible that a person could be introduced into the warehouse, in the course of the evening, without my knowledge - I look over the warehouse every night before it is locked up - it is impossible persons could sleep there - they must come through the side door, by the shop - the gates are not open in the day time, only when a truck is going out- we go through a small door to go out, through the passage, out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you necessarily and unavoidably go through the shop to get to the warehouse in the daytime? A. Yes - if the truck is going out, the porter puts it out at the gate, and returns through the shop - the gate is wide enough to admit a cart - several trucks stand there, belonging to different tradesmen in the parish - they can come for their trucks without my knowledge, but our place has no communication with that - the gate has nothing to do with it - the yard has cottages up it - upon going through the gate, I could not go into the warehouse without going through the shop - I get up at six o'clock in the morning - my master gets up about seven or eight - I never knew him to get up earlier than half-past six o'clock - I never found him up when I got up - it is impossible for any body to pass from the shop without my hearing them, at any time of night - the keys of the warehouse are locked up in the shop, and the key of the shop is in my pocket all night - I first saw the prisoner when he was at the Mansion-house - I never saw him about the warehouse, nor in the street - it is a street of extensive traffic - I am always in the shop, or from the shop to the door - we have a window looking into the street - I attend to my business in the shop - I never told my master about the young baker up to this moment- I never had any conversation with him about this prosecution - he told me to attend here, and at the Mansion-house - I went to be a witness, if I should be required - I have not had a word of conversation with him on the subject of the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave me clothes before I went to sea - he has given me clothes several times to go to sea with, and several times he has given me victuals when he has seen me stopping about; and three nights he gave me leave to sleep in his loft with a young man who is at sea - when I took him the letters, before he looked at the first letter, he gave me 2s., and told me to meet him in the afternoon, and he would give me a sovereign - before he gave me a sovereign, he took me into a gin-shop, and called for a quartern of gin, which he gave me, and told me if I met him at three o'clock he would give me the sovereign - he gave me another on the Friday, and then he shook hands with me, and bid me good bye, and told me to go home and send a brace of partridges and a hare up to him for a present, and he would give me more money at another time, as trade was very bad with him, he did not take 5s. in a day - he shook hands with me, and bid me good bye; and said he hoped I should not trouble him any more yet - I went home: when I gave him the last letter, I told him I would take him before my uncle- he said, "Very well, meet me at three o'clock, at the same place" - I was waiting for him there - he came to me, and offered me a sovereign, which I refused at first, and he pressed me to take it - he said, "I will make it up 5l. to you; but I can give you only this sovereign at present" - instead of his going with me to my uncle, he went round to the Mansion-house, and brought an officer and took me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160023"/>into custody - he pressed on me not to let the charge be known, and he would be a good friend to me.</p>

            . I live in East Smithfield, and get my living by selling things in the street; fruit and oysters sometimes - I keep a stall - I know Mr. Collins's shop and warehouse, and know Mr. Collins - I have seen Mr. Colling, as he passed the prisoner, nod to him, and ask him if he had any thing in view - this was about the month of July last, just close to my stall, opposite St. Katharine's dock gates, about one hundred yards from Mr. Collins' warehouse - I have seen this occur numbers of times as he passed my stall - one morning, as I was coming from market, I saw Collins give the prisoner some rashers of bacon, and some biscuits, I have frequently seen him nod to the prisoner, and ask if he had any thing in view.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? A. It was about the beginning of July that I first saw him - I have no acquaintance with his family - I do not believe he lived at any place in particular in July - he did not keep a stall - I believe he was destitute - I live in May-pole-court, opposite St. Katharine's gates - I am married - my wife gets her living in the same way that I do - she keeps no stall - she stops at the Marquis of Granby - I deal in every thing as it comes in season - the person standing behind the Counsel is the prisoner's uncle, as far as I know - I believe it was this day week that I first saw him - he called on me - I only knew the prisoner by seeing him sitting on the steps by the side of an empty house, where my stall is with the lumpers - I did not know where he lived - I never told him where I lived - I cannot tell whether he knew, nor how the uncle found his way to my house - I can write - I do not write letters - I was not at my stall to-day nor yesterday - I have been at work as a bricklayer's labourer for my landlord, Mr. Hurn, No. 1, May-pole-court, for the last three weeks - he is not here, that I know of - I believe I have spoken to Mr. Collins - I believe he had some oysters at my stall the very first day they came in, in August - I saw the prisoner's uncle when he called at my house - I believe the prisoner's brother called with him - they asked if my name was Dixon - I told him it was - I cannot tell how he knew my name - he asked if I kept a stall at the bottom of the court - I said I did at times when I had nothing else to do - I was brought up as a gentleman's servant, and for the last seven or eight years I have been in the army till I was discharged - I was in the navy some time - I have not been any thing else - if I can get a day's work I do, at any labouring work - I never beat a carpet in my life, except when I was a gentleman's servant - I cannot exactly mention the last day I was at the stall at St. Katharine's dock gates - I have been there within the last two months, selling oysters ever since they have been in - when the prisoner's uncle and brother called, they asked me if I remembered two young men at the dock gates (countrymen) being about there - I told him I did - he asked how long it was since I saw them - I said,"To the best of my knowledge about three months since I saw one of them" - he asked if it was Henry - I said I did not know their names, they were quite strangers, I only knew them by asking where they lived, and where, they came from, at different times - he asked if I ever knew him sleep at Mr. Collins's warehouse - I said I never did - he asked how long it was since I saw him last - I said, to the best of my knowledge, about three months; when the prisoner went away from the dock gate, he told me he had got a schooner, and was going away - the uncle asked if I knew where he went to when he left the dock gates - I told him he told me he had got a schooner which laid in the London docks - I do not recollect saying any thing else - the uncle asked if I had ever seen him speaking to Mr. Collins - I told him that I did - he did not say any thing to me about a letter - the gentleman who was with him spoke about a letter, but not to me - Mr. Garrett told me the day before yesterday what the charge was against him - he did not mention the letter to me the day he first called, to the best of my knowledge - the uncle mentioned about the letter to the young gentleman who was with him - when they questioned me, I heard the uncle say that the letter corresponded with what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. That was his nodding, and asking him if he had any thing in view? A. Yes; they had no letter in their hands - I have got my living for the last three weeks by working for my landlord at 18s. a-week - when I went to Mr. Garrett, on the Saturday, he gave me 1s., to get a drop of beer, going home - I think it was last Saturday - he asked me if I had got any money, and I said "No" - it was his pleasure to give me 1s. - he never gave me any thing before or since - I have not received any money from him or any body - nor the promise of any - I am brought here to-night by Mr. Garrett - he sent for me from my home without any subpoena - I have not been examined by an attorney to see what I had to say - Mr. Garrett did not take down what I said - he gave me his direction where to call on him, and I called - I believe the other witness who is coming, is tollman to the London Dock Company - his name is Pettigrew - he has been always tollman there during the five years - I saw him first about this the day after Mr. Garrett called on me - he came up, and asked if a gentleman had been to me - I told him there had - Pettigrew did not go with me to Mr. Garrett's house, nor did we meet there - I have never been in Mr. Collins's warehouse myself - I do not know that I am to receive any payment for attending here - I do not expect any - there was no promise made to me about it - I have not said I expected to be paid for my loss of time - I have not been promised any thing for coming here - Mr. Garrett never promised me any thing - his words were last night, "I dare say you will be satisfied for your trouble" - that is all I ever heard from him or any body - I do not know who was to satisfy me - I said nothing to him about it - Pettigrew was not there then - he had not been at Mr. Garrett's that night - I had been with him that night - I see him almost every day - I saw him last night in Mr. Garrett's company - I was never in any trouble myself, nor ever charged with any offence - I was before a magistrate four years ago for breaking some of my own windows when I was intoxicated - that is the only time I was ever before the magistrate in my life - I have never been a witness before, nor ever in a court of justice before.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. Q. Is there the slightest pretence for saying you were ever paid for giving evidence in Court? A. No: I was seven years and nine months in the 50th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160024"/>regiment of foot; and was invalided, after coming from the East Indies, having constant fits - I left the navy in May, 1820 - I was there from 1809 till 1820 - I was servant to different gentlemen - Captain-General Foulks - I lived with him about three years, and with Captain Duncan about five months; and I was servant to Captain Dixon - I did not leave any of those gentlemen in consequence of any complaint of my conduct - I was paid off on the peace establishment, and have kept a stall in the street almost ever since; but at first I was a watchman of Marylebone for three or four months - I have kept the stall about four years - no accusation has been made against me on any occasion - the rent-gatherer took me before the magistrate for breaking the window - I paid the fine, and was discharged - I have no doubt of Collins's person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been accused of writing improper letters? A. No - I have not been constantly at work for the last three weeks - one week I made four days, the next five days, and the next five days - I was at work for my landlord last, on Wednesday week, the day before that gentleman called on me - the gentleman never told me the charge against the prisoner, and I did not know where the young man was - after answering the questions put to me by Mr. Garrett and the other gentleman, the young gentleman said to Mr. Garrett, "That all corresponds with Henry's letter."</p>

            . I collect the East Smithfield tolls, and am employed by the London Dock Company - for the last four years I have been employed by the Dock Company - I have been fourteen years collector of the tolls - I first saw the prisoner about five months ago, in East Smithfield, nearly opposite St. Katharine's dock - I know Mr. Collins - his warehouse is about a dozen or fourteen houses from my standing - I never saw Mr. Collins and the prisoner talking together - I have seen Mr. Collins nod to the prisoner, and speak to him one word - he said, "How do you get on?" - that was all that passed - I have seen him do it ten or a dozen times between three and four months ago - it is more than three months - I have seen this in East Smithfield by my standing - I have seen nothing else pass between them- I am sure the prisoner and Mr. Collins are the same persons.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the expression? A."How do you get on?" - I never heard him say, "Have you any thing in view?"</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he sometimes say, "Have you any thing in view?" Dixon says that is what he said? A. I might not have heard it when Dixon was there - I never heard it - I have known Dixon upwards of three years - I cannot say exactly - I have known him four, five, or seven years - I have not known him ten years - it may be between four and five years - I do not know any body belonging to the prisoner's family - I have seen him and another young fellow there when I was taking toll, four or five months ago - he never said any thing to me about a letter which he had written - I never heard of it until this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, to-night is the first time you heard of a letter being sent, written, or delivered by him? A. Yes; Mr. Garrett, his uncle, has been to me in East Smithfield - I saw him yesterday evening in Back-church-lane, at my residence - I first saw him about a fortnight ago - he came to me in East Smithfield, at the toll place - I did not know him before - I do not know how he found me out - he never said a word about a letter - he talked to me, and gave me a glass of ale at the Phoenix - he went there with me - we had a glass of ale together, nothing else - I did not see him again till yesterday evening, which was the second time I ever saw him in my life - he did not take down any thing I said to him - I do not know who is to pay me for coming here - I did not come for gain - God will, I hope, pay me for speaking the truth - I have never received any money from Garrett - I was in company with Dixon last night, about half an hour, at my house in Backchurch-lane - he came to the house at six o'clock - this gentleman was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. If Dixon swore he never was in company with you and Garrett together, is that true? A. At the door, we were in company together, and talked together - Garrett told me to come here at five o'clock this evening - Garrett never mentioned the letter - I never heard what the prisoner was charged with, nor for whom I was to appear, nor what I was to say - the prosecutor sometimes nodded to the prisoner, and sometimes said, "How do you get on?" - if he was in a hurry, he would nod his head - if not, he would say, "How do you get on?"</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Comyn, the barrister, and have been so twenty-six years - I am now in my twenty-sixth year. The prisoner is a nephew of mine by marriage - I ascertained from the prisoner where Dixon lived - this was the day after he was committed; and in consequence of that, I went to his house - as far as Mr. Collins has stated, he is correct, but he did not state all - Dixon has stated perfectly correct the interview I had with him - I went down to Mr. Collins, as I had not decided about doing any thing - I went down merely to know the nature of the charge - Mr. Collins was not within - when I did see him, I asked if he had got the letters - he said he had not, that they were at his solicitor's, who was Mr. Wooller, in Hatton-garden, somewhere - I understood him to say, "No. 30," and the name of Tomlins was on the side of the door - I went from his house to Mr. Tomlins, and found it was No. 40 - I wished to know the nature of the charge, and what it was - he then said,"Very well, Sir, you are quite at liberty to see them" - I went to Mr. Wooller, but I have never seen them till I saw them in Court to-night - I never held out any promise of money to the witnesses to give evidence here - I told them, over and over again, it was not in my power to do any thing for the lad - that I had a very large family of my own, and had not 1s. to spare, nor had either of his relatives - they said, all they wished was to come and speak the truth - I gave Dixon 1s. when he came up to identify the prisoner at the prison.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How could you know you and he were speaking of the same person if he did not know who he was? A. The prisoner gave me a particular description of the persons, for he did not know the names of any of them - he gave me a description of several persons whom I have not been able to find - they said they had seen two lads together, but could not tell who it was till they saw the prisoner - I never gave Pettigrew any thing except the glass of ale.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at that letter, whose writing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160025"/>is it? A. I do not think it is the prisoner's - I never saw his writing in my life till this occasion, till I saw this statement which he gave me - (looking at another letter) I cannot tell whose writing this is - I have no knowledge about the handwriting - I think it is the prisoner's - I can pretty well say it is by the small "i" - it does bear the character of his handwriting - I think it must be his - I do not know why I should have any doubt about it - it is not exactly like the writing I have seen of his - I should say the first letter is the same handwriting, but written with a different pen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean you never saw the prisoner's writing before to-day? A. I saw it in his statement which he sent me - I have spoken to him about his statement - I have been in Newgate with him several days - he said the statement was in his handwriting.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now look at the first letter, have you any doubt that is his handwriting? A. The character of it certainly is very similar to the statement I received from him - I believe it to be his handwriting - I think I need not have any doubt of it being his - they are written with different pens - I have known him since he was a boy - he has been voyages to sea, and has been about in different situations within the last twelve months - at the beginning of this year he was some time in a public-house - he left that, I think, in the spring, and then went into the country - he was there a little time, and the next I heard of him was about Midsummer - I do not know how he got his living then - I do not know what he was doing in July until about the 21st September; he returned to London from an eight weeks' voyage - I only know that from his statement - he did not tell me where he had been - I did not write to the captain of his vessel "to know about the villany practised" - he has other uncles - he made no communication to me on this subject - he knew where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. In July last did he complain to you that Collins or any body took him into their warehouse, and attempted to practice indecencies on him? A. No - I knew where he lived - I never supplied him with clothes to go away with - he has an uncle or two about Ipswich - he did not come to me after he returned from the eight weeks' voyage to complain of being ill-used by Mr. Collins - I first heard a suggestion on his part, on the subject of the prosecutor, from receiving a letter from him when he was in Newgate - I never heard of the charge until he was fully committed - he did not send to say he was going before a magistrate - I went to Mr. Tomlins' office, in Hatton-garden, on the Saturday as the prisoner had been committed on Thursday- I represented to Mr. Robinson that Mr. Collins gave me permission to see the letters - Mr. Robinson expressed the greatest readiness to show them, but said they were gone to your chambers, and he expected them back on the Thursday, and that if I would call I should see them - I did not tell Mr. Robinson I was his uncle, and very likely he thought I was a friend of Mr. Collins's - I called a second time at Mr. Tomlins' office - my nephew, the prisoner's brother, was with me then - when I went the second time I did not see Mr. Robinson - I saw a clerk, who said, "I am sorry, Sir, to find you come here with a falsehood, for Mr. Collins never authorized any body to see the letters."</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. Q. Have you or not been on habits of intimacy with the prisoner? A. When he has been in town he has called on us occasionally and had a meal.</p>

At the different times I saw the prisoner, he was in company with another lad - I have seen him return what Mr. Collins said by making a bow - that was all the notice he took - he did not say how he got on - Collins never stopped, but went on - there were various persons about the gate - it was not addressed to any other person - I am satisfied it was addressed to the prisoner, because he has told me with his own mouth that Mr. Collins was good to him - that was before any charge was made to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he say he was good? A. By giving him victuals to eat at different times.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS re-examined. It is occasionally my custom to give away broken victuals and biscuits, at different times, to poor people; when I am clearing my shop, I instruct my servant to give away what there is to poor people, and if I am at home I do it myself - I sometimes know persons I give things to, and sometimes I do not - sometimes five or six distressed sailors together apply for the damaged provisions - one person brings another - they do not require much introduction.</p>
               <p>COURT to WALKER. Q. Have you a place called the loft? A. Yes - nobody slept there except the baker - the warehouse and loft are all one - I sleep in a room leading to the warehouse - the loft is an upper part of the warehouse - nobody can get to it without going through the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness is not Collins's shopman; he is only backward and forward - there is him and another young man - there is a young man who has played the same tricks with a young man who was with me - Collins's man has served the same trick to a young man who is at sea.</p>

Perhaps I did - I think it is probable - I knew the name on it, but I thought it was necessary I should know the number, which I did not - I had paid for a room in that house - I had given the prisoner some money - I had not promised that I would stay and breakfast with her - I had not given her the note as an earnest that next day she should have more money - I never said I did not believe she intended to rob me - I paid her what she asked, but I cannot say what - it was all the silver I had about me - it is likely that I said if she conducted herself well, I would give her more next morning - I might say so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by conducting herself properly? A. If she did not conduct herself riotously - I do not think I promised her more the next day - I will not swear I did not - I do not know what I paid her - I suppose 7s. or 10s. - I do not know what she asked - my memory was a little hurt - I had taken two glasses of ale - I might have said I would treat her, but to the best of my belief I never said I would give her more the next day - I suppose I left the house about five o'clock - I had not got above twenty yards from the door, when I saw the officer, and gave her in charge - I swear I gave her more than 5s. - I was not exactly sober - to the best of my knowledge I was in a public-house with her - I had never seen her before - I cannot swear whether I was in two or three public-houses with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was not your memory very bad? A. It was not at all equal to what it is sometimes - I sent for some ale when I got to the house with her - I drank a very small portion of it - it was a pot, to the best of my recollection - I dare say I paid a shilling, but I will not swear it - I believe it was a woman I sent for it - to the best of my belief it was the landlady - I will not swear it was not a boy- I do not recollect seeing the person - to the best of my belief I placed it on the table - I will not swear positively- my memory was in such a state that I would not rely on it for all things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell how much silver you had when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160027"/>you went? A. Ten or 12s. to the best of my recollection - I had none in the morning - I gave her all I had after paying for the room, and said if she conducted herself well I would give her something in the morning - I am certain I did not give her the £10 note.</p>

            . I am an inspector of police. The prisoner was brought to the station-house - I asked her if she would allow us to search her, and told her she was charged with stealing a £10 note out of the man's fob - she said, "I did not take the note, I did not see a note - I did not know he had a note - I deny all knowledge of it" - she then took off her gown, threw it down, and called God to witness, and took an oath that the note was not on her - I took up the gown and examined the hem, where I found a bit of paper, which proved to be this note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember the magistrate asking Mr. Fitzgibbon why he charged the woman? A. Yes; and he said once or twice, "I do not wish to punish the girl, only to get back the note" - I am not aware that he said he thought she did not intend to rob him - I believe Mr. Conant asked what was the reason he gave her in charge - he appeared sober when he gave her into custody - there were three or four shillings found on her - it was given up to her - it was not in my hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him about half-past nine o'clock that evening - he told me he would give me 10s. to sleep with me - we walked some distance, and he asked me to have something to drink - we went to the house, and had a bed for half-a-crown - he then said he would give me 5s. that night; but if I thought he was without money he had got a £10 note, and he gave it me to keep till the morning - in the morning he asked me to give him the note - I said I would not till he had given me a sovereign - when I was taken I had 1s., and the 5s. he gave me, and 5d. change from the pot of ale.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Richard Robinson and another. I was in their shop on the 6th of September - about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came, in and took a bottle-case and bottles, worth 40s. - I went out, and caught him about three doors off with it - he was walking - I told him to come back, and he did - my master fetched an officer - the prisoner did not see me when he came into the shop - the case stood on some desks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I saw him when I went in - he was knocking with a nail - this case was by the side of the door, and I was ordered to go and fetch it - a person came in at the back door, and he asked me if he sent me in for the case - he seemed very much agitated, and said, "No" - I told him to go to the corner of Great Queen-street, and he would see the young man. Witness. No, he did not - he said he had been sent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Queen-street, and a young man stopped me near the corner of Drury-lane, and told me to go and get this case - he was very much like the person who came in at the back of the shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has he been in your employ? A. I think, twelve or thirteen years, or more - I asked him, one Sunday morning, if he had any more money belonging to me, but we had no quarrel at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not leave you on a Saturday in September? A. No; he left me on a Sunday morning, when I asked him if he had any more money belonging to me, as there was some which had been standing a long while; and when I came to cast up my book, he had 2s. more than his wages - it was his habit to deduct his wages from what he received - some of the entries in this book are mine, and some my son's - there was an account owing from Miss Oakey, of about 1l. - there is a carrier of the name of Bell, who lives about a mile from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner left you, did he go into the service of Bell? A. I know he was in his service on the Tuesday, and he was then taken - Bell is a Highgate carrier, and I am a Holloway carrier - I charged the prisoner with taking 2s. above his wages - I did not take him then, but I did not know he was going to leave - I expected he would come on the Monday morning - I do not know whether I should have proceeded against him if he had come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160032"/>back - he took money to carry on my business - he had my permission to make payments for me, and he took his wages at the end of the week.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say he settled every morning? A. He did not give me the money, but he settled the account, and if he had more money than I thought he wanted, I took part of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you had a regular settlement with him since the 30th of July? A. Yes, every morning; he has never owned to having received these sums in his account.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you go before Mr. Sergeant Sellon? A. Yes; he said this was not a case that ought to go to a Jury, and I might go outside and settle it - but I did not think it right to settle it - if the prisoner should be discharged, he may go back to Bell, and welcome - he offered to pay me 1s. a week.</p>

               <p>JOHN BASS. I had taken the house of Mr. Holland, but I never got possession, because

             kept possession - I called on Walker about October last, and asked him when it would suit his convenience to give me possession - he answered, "Mr. Holland has robbed me of 200l., and until he makes me recompense, I will not quit possession" - he said, "I am sorry for you, but as I was robbed by Mr. Holland, I shall not give possession" - a person called on me, on the 27th of September, 1833, and said something, which I told Mr. Holland, but he did not agree to it - I never authorized the prisoners to take any thing away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was investigated several times at the police-office? A. Yes. I was at Marlborough-street when Mr. Holland made a charge against Walker for an assault - there was no charge against me - I have no recollection of Walker stating that he kept possession in consequence of some agreement with Hawkes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to HENRY HOLLAND, ESQ. Q. Had you any transaction with Walker by which he could lose 200l. by you? A. No. An agent of mine put a distress into the house to secure the remaining property of Hawkes, and some trifles belonging to Walker were taken, but the whole did not sell for 4l.; therefore they must have been extremely trifling - Walker occupied part of the house while Hawkes was there, and he claimed to continue there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you given direction, in any way, to eject Hawkes? A. No - he was my tenant at the time he absconded - Walker had lodged in the house before, and was there when Hawkes left; and at the Christmas following, I gave a notice to quit, addressed to Hawkes, or whom it might concern - I knew that Walker was in possession after Hawkes had disappeared.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had not Hawkes, before that, given up the key? A. Yes, to my agent, but I never saw it.</p>

             (police-constable K 62). On Tuesday morning, the 25th of September, I was in Harford-street, and saw some lead rolled up on the top of the house, No. 48 - I did not see any one there - I watched till night, but did not see any one come out of the house - on the next morning, at twenty minutes past six o'clock, I missed the lead<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160035"/>- I continued to watch the premises till twenty minutes past eleven o'clock - I then saw Isaac Walker bring a truck to the door, and all three of the prisoners assisted in putting a large box into it - the two younger prisoners went out with the truck, and the elder returned to the house - I followed the truck to No. 34, Bedfordbury, to the house of a man of the name of Carr, a marine-store dealer - they took the box in - I was close to them - I went into the shop - Alfred Walker took up the cover of the box, and I saw the lead - he let the cover slip on again - I took it up and put my hand on the lead - I had it weighed and marked - I left the lead there while I went for another policeman - there were 164lbs. of lead - when the other officer came, we weighed the lead again, and then took the prisoners to the station-house - the elder Walker came to the office in the evening, and he was taken - I afterwards went on the roof of the house, and the lead fitted the roof exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go into the marine-store shop with Alfred Walker? A. Not exactly with him, but directly after him - the box was opened in my presence, so as to enable me to see what was in it, and then the lid slipped down again - I desired the marine-store dealer to take care of the lead - I did not leave the prisoners in custody - I was not in uniform - I said I was an officer.</p>

             - she was up stairs in room with me - I was scouring the room and cleaning paint - I went down stairs between four and five o'clock was not down more than a quarter of an hour or ten minutes - I was down there five minutes - the girl was not the bed-room during that time - she was out of the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you about half-past two that afternoon, were you not shut in the coal-hole with one of the painters? A.

            . I am an officer. I received information of this, and on the 16th I met the prisoner in the met he lived in, and told him I had a warrant against him breaking the locks of the prosecutor's drawers - he said he knew nothing about it, but he recollected very well he had been drinking with the painters that day - Appleby me this card - it is, "John Baxter, locksmith and bellsger, Hale-street, Edgeware-road."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed to go to the house to repair the bells - I went there about nine o'clock, and went home about four - next morning, to my great astoliment, my wife told me a girl had been there from the house, (a friend of the witness,) who said I was accused of robbery, and she should advise me to settle the case - I said I should do nothing of the sort, being confident I had done nothing - I went about as usual till the Sunday following, and at about half-past one, the same girl came again, and stood directly in front of my area - my eldest boy said,"Mother, here is a young person looking down" - my wife went to the window - the girl beckoned her, and said, "Is Mr. Baxter at home?" - she said, "Yes, he is, but he is cleaning himself" - she said, "Tell him to go out of the way - there is a warrant against him" - about a quarter after eight the same evening, a double knock came to the door, and the girl came in with another, and said, "It is an arbitrary thing - your husband had better settle it - the officers will be here at ten o'clock to-morrow morning; for God's sake keep out of the way" - they said they were in the habit of going backwards and forwards to the terrace, and would let Mrs. Baxter know every move - I was at home all next day - no officer came - on Tuesday night the girl came again, and said, "Is Mr. Baxter taken?" - my wife said, "Nobody has been here after him" - I heard nothing more of it till I was taken - I was about my business at all hours in the day, and if I was guilty, I should consider the girl would have done her endeavours to secure me, and not advise me to get out of the way - had I known myself guilty, I should not have remained in the place - I never was from home - as regards the card it was eleven o'clock in the morning that I gave it her, in the presence of the painters - I solicited them for their future favours - the foreman said, "Let us see one of your cards," and I gave him one - when Ward was asked her name, she refused to give it.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint, and have been so a great number of years. I have had experience in matters of this sort - this half-crown produced by Goose is counterfeit - it is the one which fell from the mould - here are also eight other counterfeit half-crown- the first five produced are impressions from the same mould, the other four are not impressed from that mould - here is a good half-crown, which Goose produced, which appears to have been the half-crown that made the- all the thirteen half-crowns produced have been made from moulds made from the same good half-crown, and only nine of them from the mould produced - the good half-crown has made more than one mould - Banister his produced some broken pieces of a plaster of Paris mould which has been used for casting half-crowns - here are five pieces of a mould, having parts of the impressions of the obverse side of a half-crown - here are parts of the letters and date, and here are three other pieces, having parts of impressions of the reverse side - I believe nine half-crowns have been made in this mould when perfect - the four finished are not from the same mould - this pipkin has white metal in it of a description like the counterfeit even - this spoon is of the same white metal as the counterfeit coin, and such as is usually used to melt for casting coin - this tobacco-pipe has white metal in it of a similar description, and may have been used to lade metal out of the pipkin - this get fits the channel of the mould, through which the metal flows down into the impression.</p>
               <p>Page. Q. I wish to know whether you say that is a mould? A. These are parts of what I believe has been a mould.</p>
               <p>Page's Defence (written)."You have heard the evidence adduced in support of this charge, and I leave it with you to determine as to my guilt or innocence; but, at the same time, I confidently rely on your verdict. The only circumstance at all implicating me in that offence, is the finding of some whitening in the room from which I was taken, and which I am in the habit of using, or causing to be used, for the purpose of cleaning the hearth - which the police preternd was used by me for the purpose of forming moulds - a corresponding circumstance, and which, in a great measure, leads to my being thus charged, was the circumstance of the melted metal being on the fire; this I was about to form into a weight for a pully to the spring of a pigeontrap - the circumstance of having counterfeit coin found in the room, I cannot attempt to deny, but many other persons had access to the same room, and I do most solemnly deny that any thing was found in my possession to justify this prosecution - when the police arrived, there was no person on the premises but myself: the female was only an occasional visitor at my lodgings, and was gone out, at the time the officers came to search my room, for some milk for my tea - whatever verdict you may see proper to return, as it regards me, I do most solemnly protest the female prisoner is innocent of having done any offence in conjunction with me."</p>

The prisoner was a private in the corps - I saw him on the 23rd of September, at Chatham - he had been away on furlough - he gave me a bundle to take care of for him - I saw two black handkerchiefs, and one corner of a handkerchief was marked "B.D." with white silk - I kept them for him till the following morning - he said his friends, or his sister, had made him a present of them - (looking at the property) I know this handkerchief and eye-glass - I cannot swear to the other handkerchief.</p>

My husband and I left the house, about half-past nine o'clock on the evening of the 16th of August - we have only one room - Mr. Jackson is the landlord - he does not live in the house - I locked it, and gave the key to my husband- I was absent about half an hour - on my return I found the room door broken open, a chest-of-drawers open, and things scattered about - I missed my husband's clothes, and the other articles stated in the indictment - I and my husband went towards Bartholomew Fair about the 3rd of September, and met the prisoner with one of my gowns on in Chiswell-street - she looked at my husband, and he looked at her, and called my attention to her gown - we followed her - he let go of my arm - I went up and told her I had lost some things, and she had got on one of the gowns I had lost - I asked her where she got it from, as I had lost some more things - she said she bought it in Rosemary-lane - she did not know the person she bought it of - I told her the body was lined with white - she said it might be - I told her the skirt was lined with dark green - she said it was slate colour - I wanted to look to convince myself, but she refused - I asked her how long she had had it - she said six weeks or two months - I told her I had not lost it so long as that - she said she had had it two months, if not longer, and it could not be mine, and said she would call on me the next day, or I should call on her - that she lived in the City-road - she said she could not give me any more satisfaction - she told me where she lived in the City-road, and gave me the number, but I do not recollect it - I told her my husband was just by, and I wished him to speak to her - she had a young woman with her - they were whispering - while I was looking for my husband they walked away - I lost them - my husband came up to me - I told him she had got on my gown - he had seen which way they went, and went after them - they looked back, and saw him coming towards them, and stopped - he asked her where she got the gown - she told him she got it in Rosemary-lane, and did not know the person she bought it of - he said he was not satisfied, and led her till he came to a policeman, and gave her in charge at Bunhill-row station-house - the inspector asked her where she lived - she refused at first to tell - she said she lived at Hoxton - they told her they must know where she lived, and the gown must be taken off her - then she said she lived in Old Nicholl-street - the gown was taken off her, and kept in the station-house - after the robbery I found a phosphorus box in my drawer, which was not there before - I know this is my gown - it is lined with three different colours - it is an old gown made up - there is a cut on the left shoulder, and a piece let in between the lining and the silk, it being a damaged silk dyed - the body was lined with white, and the skirt with dark green - I am sure this is the gown - I have not seen any other part of the property- the value of all the property I should think is about 10l. when new, and about 5l. 10s. when stolen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner told you that she lived in the City-road, and at the station-house she said Hoxton? A. Yes. I do not know Plummer-street, nor Old Nicholl-street - the door of my apartment appeared to be burst open with violence - the drawers did not appear opened with violence - the other locks appeared to have been forced open with violence - I did not find any mark of any instrument on them - the house was broken on the 16th of August - I have not said it was on the 5th - it was not quite three weeks when I saw the prisoner - my husband's waistcoat was a buff one, and kerseymere - I believe he had had it for four years, but never wore it hardly - he had been to sea - he gave 10s. for it when it was new - he had the coat about the same time, and gave 5l. for that and the trowsers - he has been in London two years, but he did not wear the waistcoat a great deal - he wore it on Sundays in the summer - he used to wear the coat and trowsers on Sunday - there are three other lodgers in the house, men and women, and there were so at the time in question - they are all there now - the prisoner did not say she had had the gown three or four weeks - I never saw her before September - I was about ten minutes' walk from my house, when I saw her - I never saw her in my neighbourhood - she said she had worn the gown in Finsbury-square - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160040"/>been in Rosemary-lane once - I have seen people standing there selling old clothes - the officer could not exactly find the number of the house she gave them - I think it was on the 3rd of September that I met her.</p>

             (police-serjeant G 49). I was in Bunhill-row - the prosecutor and his wife gave the prisoner into my charge on the 3rd of September - I asked her where she got the gown from - she said she bought it in Rosemary-lane - I asked, "Of whom?" - she said, she did not know who the person was - I took her to the station-house, and afterwards received the gown, which was taken from her by a female who searched her - I asked when she bought it - she said, "About six weeks ago" - she told me she lived in Nicholl-street, in Spitalfields, and in Whitecross-street - she stated that at different times; the first time, she said, "Old Nicholl-street;" and at the station-house, she said, "In Spitalfields" - I did not go to either of the places, as she mentioned no number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Nicholl-street? A. I believe there is a Nicholl-street in Hoxton Old Town- it is a long way from the turnpike in City-road - I know Plummer-street, in the City-road - that is away from Nicholl-street - I was not directed there - the inspector was present when she gave me the different addresses - she told him Nicholl-street; the other two addresses, she gave me in the presence of other persons, but not in their hearing, as there was a bustle in the station-house at the time - I never expressed my anger towards her at all - I never said I had got her in my power - I knew her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say in any body's hearing, that now you had her in your power you would give her a lift, if possible? A. On my oath I did not - Jews, and such persons, sell things in the street in Rosemary-lane - I never went to the prosecutor's house - the prisoner is a woman of the town - I did not know where she lived - I had not seen her in the neighbourhood of Chiswell-street, near Shoreditch - I believe she has always said she bought the gown in Rosemary-lane.</p>

            . I was sitting up that night, lying on the sofa - I heard a noise about two o'clock - I could not exactly say what it was - I again heard a noise like glass breaking - I went and alarmed my nephew - I am housekeeper to Mr. Crook.</p>
               <p>Davis to R. HARRIS. Q. You say you came to the door and saw three men running away - I want to know if you can swear I am one of them? A. I cannot say, I can only swear to the other by the glazed hat.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the morning in question, I was on duty about half-past two o'clock - there was a cry of police - I ran towards the alarm, and saw Harris standing at the shop-door in his shirt - he gave me information, and I saw the shop-window broken open, and the shutters on one side - he said three men had run down Dock-street - I followed down the street, and into two dark places, and at the bottom of the street I looked to my right up East Smithfield - I saw Trower and Cummings, two policemen - I came up to the three prisoners in a dark corner in Cooper's-court, Blue-anchor-yard, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's - they were in the corner of the court - it is a large wide court - I took Smith who had a glazed hat on - I brought him outside, and sprung my rattle - two other constables came down, and we went in search of the sugar, and found it inside a door where they were standing - the other two prisoners were taken - I showed the loaf of sugar to Harris as I passed the shop with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether any people lived in the house in which you found the sugar? A. There were some people up the stairs - they were in bed - I went up stairs and searched the whole house - the sugar was in an empty room on the ground-floor - the prisoner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160041"/>were in a dark corner of the court close to the door of the house - when I put my hand on Smith he was about a yard from the door - the door of the house was closed - one of the constables gave it a gentle push, and it opened - if it was fastened it was very slightly done - we went in, and in the empty room we found the sugar in the middle of the floor.</p>
               <p>JESSE TROWER. I am a policeman. I was on duty - directly the alarm was given I went into White's-yard and into Blue-anchor-yard - I was in company with the sailor Evans- Clay came to my assistance - I was with him when the prisoners were found - I did not see the sugar found - I found the prisoners in the corner of Cooper's-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the court from Crook's? A. It might be four or five hundred yards - about a quarter of a mile, but I cannot say exactly - I opened one or two doors in the house, but my prisoner was rather restive, and I proceeded to the station-house - I did not open the door of the house the sugar was in - Cummings was with us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which prisoner had you in charge? A. Maney - when I first took him I went into one house, and when I came out he tried to make his escape - I called the sailor to go with me to the station-house, and as we went along Maney said, if he was as big as I was he would see me *** before I should take him, using a bad word.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was with the other officers, and found the prisoners in a corner of Cook's-court, all three together - I secured Davis - I did not ask him any questions - he said, "I have nothing to do with it, I do not know them" - I said, "You do know the other prisoners," I knew that - he said, "Yes, but I had nothing to do with the robbery."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who opened the door where the sugar was found? A. I do not know; I did not see it found - the prosecutor's house is between four and five hundred yards from the court, I imagine.</p>

I was returning home along Rosemary-lane, and met the prisoners - they asked me to go and have a pot of beer - I went down Blue Anchor-yard, and knocked at the door of the King of Prussia, but received no answer - Maney went down the yard to ease himself, and, being longer than usual, I went down the court to see what he was about - an officer came and took us.</p>
               <p>Maney's Defence. I went up Shoreditch, and spent the evening there - I was returning home, and in Rosemary-lane I met Smith at the top of Blue Anchor-yard - I asked him to have something to drink - I was rather intoxicated - he said he would - I was going to the King of Prussia to get it - I met Davis in the road, and asked him to have a share of the beer - I knocked at the door of the public-house and got no answer - I wanted to ease myself, and went down the court for that purpose, and after buttoning up my clothes the officer came and took me.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I received the prisoner in charge on Monday, the 8th of September, and asked her if she actually broke the box or not - I neither threatened or made her any promise - she said not - that she received the things from her mistress, a gown and shawl, and had pawned them - I went to the pawnbroker's she mentioned, and found the things - the pawnbroker gave them to me to-day.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it uncommon to try a coat on at a sale-room? A. It is a common thing - the part where the coat hung was not darker than the part nearer the door - it was about the same light - there is a sky-light at the back, and he was near the skylight, adjusting the coat - he went out of the shop - I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160045"/>him go out - he returned in five or seven minutes - I was there looking at furniture - the coat appeared to fit him - he took off his own coat - that was down by the side of him- he did not take that out with him - I did not see him hold up the tail of the coat, to look at the colour, as he went towards the door.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Johnson.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever given a different account of this? A. Never - I never said I took him with the coat at the door of my master's sale-room - I took him with it on his back in White Hart-court, fifty, sixty, or seventy yards from master's - it may be one hundred - I never stated that I saw him standing at the office door of the sale-room - I do not know Hewick, or any such name - I have had no conversation with any person on the subject - it is not uncommon to try clothes on - I told the Lord Mayor I saw him cutting off the ticket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the coat he now has on the one he had on in the sale-room? A. Yes; it was given to me in the sale-room, and I took it to him at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will consider the situation I am placed in - I pledge my word I had no idea of committing a felony - as to the witness taking me in the court it is entirely false - I was taken at the door with the coat on, and was returning with it - I went for the sole purpose of looking at the texture of the cloth, being a tailor by trade - this man came and accused me of intending to steal it - I denied it, and in consequence of that he took me to the Mansion-house - it is not very likely I should have taken the coat and left the one I have on - the difference between the two is not sufficient to cause me to commit the act - when you have heard my witnesses you will believe it not possible I should so far have lent myself to commit such offences - I have a wife and family.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are your marks on this? A. Yes- file-marks - they are cuttings - I did it with the edge of the file - there is nothing peculiar in it - I can swear it is the silver I marked - I would swear to it if I saw it at any distance off - other workmen might produce the same mark- it was marked on purpose to detect the thief - here is more than I lost - I only identify part of this - I said I marked some of it - my brother William was present.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you put any mark on it when you took it? A. Yes; I did not know the prisoner before, but the party with him were friends of mine, and I asked them if it would be right before I changed it - I cannot be mistaken in his person - he was about an hour in the house, and dressed nearly as he is now - I know his features - I cannot say whether he had a white cravat on - I think he had the coat he has on now, and the waistcoat too, but I will not swear it - I think he was dressed as he is now - I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

             re-examined. This is the note I lost - I have no mark on it, but I remember the number, it is No. 2043, of the Cirencester bank, for £5.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you be certain that you recollect the number? A. Now I see it I do - I should not remember the number without seeing it; but I had five running numbers, from 2041 to 2045 - on seeing it, I swear it is the one I lost - it was not shown to me before last night - I had the number in my mind - not of the individual note, but of the running numbers - the first number was 2041 - I have no name on this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Wiltshire, and went with my uncle to Scotland - I returned, and went as junior clerk to Mrs. Guthire, of Ivy-lane - I was taken ill, and went into the country, and returned to the Old Bell, to sleep there, three or four nights - when the gentleman suspected me, I told him I had once been in a scrape similar to this, and rather than be exposed in the papers, if it was agreeable to him - (he had said, "If you will pay 5l. I shall be satisfied") - I called for pen and ink, and asked him the sum he lost - I gave him an order on my guardian to pay the money on account of my uncle - he took the order, and was well pleased - before he got out of the room, the officer came in, and said, "No; you have given the prisoner into my charge, and I must take him" - I was rather doubtful whether the order would be paid, and I wrote that letter; but my mind was so agitated at being accused, I knew not what I wrote - the letter was then not half finished, and the man would not allow me to finish it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARLES re-examined. He did not give me an order - he wrote an order - he did not do it at my request, and did not tell me he was doing it - I did not see him write the order - I saw him write the letter, and, it appears, an order was written - I never got it, and do not know who did - I saw it produced at the watchhouse - it was taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to a gentleman named Holmes? A. Yes, with Mr. Bunyer - Mr. Bunyer took the order, I believe, but I did not see it - he brought something with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see it, or hear it read? A. Not to my recollection - I went in order to get the money - Mr. Bunyer had that letter with him at the time - I saw the order presented to Mr. Holmes - I was not aware then that I was obliged to prosecute the prisoner - I did not consider myself the prosecutor then - I intended to get the 5l. if I could; and, if I got it, I intended to give up the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not tell you he had been in a scrape before, and, sooner than get his name into the newspaper, he would write that order? A. I do not recollect it; I have not the slightest recollection of any thing of the kind - I cannot say whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I put the order into his hand, and he read it; and he said, "I do not want to prosecute you, if you will pay me part of the money now, and the rest afterwards"</p>

            . I live at Hutton, in Essex. I was in Spitalfields on the night of the 4th of September - Sims came up to me in <placeName id="t18341016-79-crimeloc443">Brick-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where had you been? A. I had been collecting rents - this was a little after two o'clock in the morning - I suppose the last money I received might be at nine or ten o'clock - I then stayed with a friend - I was sober - I had not been at Bartholomew fair, nor above one hundred yards from where I was robbed, which was in Brick-lane - I had come from Booth-street, where my property is - I knew as well what I was about, as I do now, or I should not have got my money again - when Sims took hold of my arm, she drew me down Hanover-court, and said she had something to say - she did not draw me far down - we were not there two minutes - I told her I had nothing to say to her - I was going to my lodgings, at Aldgate - I turned up the court by compulsion, not voluntarily - Sims took hold of my arm, and, almost by compulsion, pulled me down the court - I felt her hand rustling about my person, and saw my purse go, and she gave it to the other woman - she took me by the arm, and said she wanted to speak to me; I had scarcely come to my senses when it was gone - I did not know who the prisoners were - I had no thought of being robbed - I had drank a small glass of spirits and water, at a public-house, with a tenant - there was a little brandy and water, and some ale - there might be some gin and water - I do not know what public-house it was - it was opposite one of my own houses, where I had been to collect rents - I believe it is the White Hart - I went in there about nine o'clock - I went into the parlour, and we sat there talking about business, and one thing or another, and stopped till two o'clock - there might have been several glasses - it was a respectable party - we proposed playing at whist - there was very little drank - I was perfectly sober - I do not know exactly what money I had, nor what I lost - I suspect some dropped down - my trowsers were large, and she put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the station-house, did you say you had got your money; that you might have dropped it, as your pockets were large, and you wanted the girls to be let go? A. I might say to the policeman, in going along, that I did not wish to prosecute - he told me I could not get my money without - I did not say, "then I must prosecute" - on the second examination the prisoner said I was under the influence of liquor - the magistrate asked me, and I said I was perfectly sober.</p>

             (police-constable H 82). I was passing the end of Hanover-court - I saw the two prisoners - Brown ran out, and in a minute the prosecutor said, "Stop that girl!" meaning Sims - he then said, "There was another run out" - I said, "Yes, I saw her" - I pursued Brown, and took her as she was stooping down to an area railing, and trying to put this purse down - I took it from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor before this took place? A. No. He appeared quite sensible - if I were going from Brick-lane to Aldgate, I should not go down that court - I should go past the end of it - I was stationed in Brick-lane - I might not have heard the prosecutor if he had called out - I was five or six hundred yards off - I had not seen him, but I had seen the prisoners just before - they knew I was in the neighbourhood - the prosecutor said, in going to the station, that he did not wish to prosecute.</p>

            . I am a police-serjeant - I was on duty - I saw the prosecutor go past - Sims came up to him - he did not appear to want to say any thing to her - I saw them go on towards the court - Cooper then came up, and I sent him after them - I saw Brown run from the court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was Sims and the prosecutor from Hanover-court when you first saw them? A. Fifty or sixty yards - she had not hold of his arm then - she was walking by his side and talking to him - I did not see them turn into the court - they went close past me - I watched them about forty yards, and then Brown went after them - if the prosecutor had called for assistance, I should have heard him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which of your customers have lost any silk? A. They did not complain of any loss - they said I returned the silk very damp, and asked if they had all their silk - there is a boy and girl who do nothing but tie up silk - other persons do it sometimes - I had not missed any silk, that I know of, but my customers complained - this silk would be kept in the skeining room, if it were in my care - I went to France about two months ago - when I returned, I went all over my place - I did not miss this silk - I do not deal in silk, but when I have it left on my hands, I do the best I can with it - that is damaged silk - I have sold Dumar damaged silk very like this - I never authorized any person to sell silk for me - I think the prisoner has been six years in my employ - when manufacturers send me silk to dye, they send the weight, and it is weighed when it goes home - the prisoner chiefly attended to the weight with the street man - he did not tell me, when I returned from the continent, of this silk being detained at Mr. Lane's, till he was called into the parlour - he then turned, and said, "You know I took it, as I have done before" - I had a partner before I went into the country - his name is Davis.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could you give this silk to any body to sell? A. No; I could not - when I returned I had perhaps 3000lbs. of silk in my house - Mr. Machu was a customer of mine - this silk was supposed to belong to him.</p>

            . I am a silkman, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 11th of September, a woman called on me in the afternoon - she brought two small samples of silk, and the next morning she brought 34lbs. or 35lbs. - I had some conversation with her - I afterwards saw the prisoner - I told him what had passed between me and the woman - when I first saw her she said she had some silk to sell, would I buy it - I said I could give no answer till I sw the bulk - she stated she could not bring it that afternoon, as she lived a considerable distance off - I asked her where, and she said in the Commercial-road - she then went away - on the following morning, she drove up to my door in a cab, and brought about 34lbs. of silk - this is part of it - she stated the silk had belonged to her father and mother, and had been in her possession two years - I asked her her name, and she said it was Jones, and she lived at No. 3, Lower Chapman-street, Commercial-road - I detained the silk, and told her to come with her husband, which she did in the afternoon - the prisoner was introduced as her husband - I asked him his name, he said, "Jones," and that he lived in Lower Chapman-street, Commercial-road - he said he was a cabinet-maker - I stated I had detained the silk, and should do so till he could give me a satisfactory account of how he became possessed of it - he stated the same as his wife had, that it had been the property of her father and mother, and their name was Jones - I asked him how it was that the name of Jones was attached to all the family - he said, after a moment's hesitation, "That is all right, we were first cousins, and we married" - I noticed that he had a pair of black gloves on - he pleaded great ignorance about silk, and said he knew nothing about it - I afterwards saw him at Mr. Labussiere's - he was summoned into the room for me to identify him - I said, "This is the man who came to me about the silk" - he said, "I will tell you all about it," and turning to Mr. Labussiere, he said,"You know I had the silk from you to part with, the Friday before you went to France - you called me and gave me that bag of silk - told me to put it to rights and dispose of it, as I had done former parcels" - he was then taken into custody.</p>

            . I am partner with Mr. Labussiere. I went into partnership with him about four months ago - I think the beginning of June - there is silk comes from Mr. Machu's, generally speaking, every day - this is the dye-house book - I see by an entry of my own that Mr. Machu's silk was all cleared off on the 18th of August, and on that day we received from him 106-3 of Bengal sewings, which corresponds with the number of this silk, and 54-5 came in at the same time - on the 24th of August, we received 24-6, and more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As you were not a partner before June, you cannot tell what he received before that time? A. I cannot - he had received a great quantity according to the book - the mark I spoke is No. 15 - it is the mark of the cotton to distinguish different manufacturers' silk - it is only the quality of the silk - here are two knots with a coarse cotton, No 15, which corresponds with the mark on the 106-3.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you, to the best of your knowledge, believe that this is part of the 106-3? A. I do.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any means of believing that except from the number? A. No; it answers to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160051"/>number in the book - it is impossible to miss what is taken.</p>

            . I live at Kingsland. On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner - I asked him if he would stand any gin - he took me to the Acorn, and treated me with a glass - I then asked if he would have any - he said he did not care - I paid 2d. more, and we had a quartern - he afterwards got a cab to take me home in - I was rather in liquor - he put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket and took out 10s. - I saw and felt his hand take it - I can swear that I had 14s. in my pocket - I gave charge of him when I got home - he took bitter oaths that he had only 10d. about him, but the officer found 7s. in his shoe, and 1s. 10d. in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. A. It happened to be your birth-day, did it not? A. No, I do not recollect saying it was my birth-day, but I had a little money, and said I would get drunk - I was in the Blue Anchor - I had part of a quartern of gin, and of a pot of half-and-half, then a quartern of rum, and then sixpenny worth of gin - I said, "I have never been drunk in my life, I will get drunk to-day as it is my birth-day" - I recollect it now - I then went to the Acorn again - I began to play at skittles - I lost two pots of beer - the prisoner played one game with me - he drank some - I then played for two pints more, and lost them - it was then half-past eleven or twelve o'clock - we then went to the Anchor, and had beef-steaks for dinner, and a pot of porter and some wine - I offered to bet sixpence that the prisoner did not get a floorer with the skittles - I did not pitch my money into his boots - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160052"/>did not call the cab, Chapman did - I indicted Chapman, and the bill was thrown out - I cannot swear I was not at the Royal Oak - I do not recollect going to the Goldsmith's Arms, or to any public-house where they refused to let me have any more liquor - I could walk a little - two men took me by the arm and lifted me into the cab - I know who took my money - I paid 4s. 1 1/2d. in money, and 4s. 4d.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPPS. Q. What time of the day was this? A. Between three and four o'clock- I had had my dinner, but nothing after it - I was quite sober - I had never seen Gray before - I went about two hundred yards to where she lived - I was sitting on the bed about a minute - the door was not shut - I said nothing at all to her while I sat on the bed, nor she to me - this money was in my watch-pocket - it was my master's - upon my oath, I did not spend it - my waistcoat was not buttoned, when I was on the bed - my fob is about six inches deep - I had a watch and chain in my fob under it - she got her hand into my fob, and took my money, and I could not prevent her - she pulled me about, and felt where the money was - she put her hand against me - there was no purse found on her - I described her as having thin shoes and a black gown on - she has the gown on now - I gave her the nuts very near the lane - her house was 200 yards up the lane - no one let us into the house - I was not asked for any money to pay for the room - I saw Gray searched - she denied all knowledge of me - there were two or three other women in the house - when I got into the room, I put my hand into my fob, and pushed the purse further down - she took me there to pick my pocket - I thought so then, when I was going up-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you not go down again, in place of going into the room? A. Because she took hold of me, and led me in - she had not hold of me in the street - I did not think in the street that she was going to pick my pocket - I am twenty-five years old - I am in the habit of coming to town to sell cattle, and am intrusted with money to buy and sell - I had left a lot of cattle at Windsor - I was going to Romford to fetch a lot of cattle - I got off the coach in Piccadilly, and only walked through London.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that you think now, that she took you there to rob you? A. Yes - and I thought so then, when she took hold of my coat - she took the money out of my pocket, and was gone in an instant - she felt my pocket, and put her hand in.</p>

            , at a house - the prosecutor said that she was the girl who stole his purse - she denied any knowledge of him - I then took the other prisoner - I found nothing on them but a small penknife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor take you to the house where he said he had been robbed? A. Yes - the prisoners did not live there - I knew they frequented that house - I asked the prosecutor if he saw Townsend - he said, "Yes - she stood at the bottom of the stairs, and threatened to do me some bodily harm."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the phrase he made use of, that she threatened to do him some bodily harm? A. I cannot exactly say he used those words - he used several phrases tantamount to that - I thought it was a more soft way of expressing it, than to say she would knock his b-y brains out - he made use of several other words.</p>

            . I am a carman. On the 27th of September my caravan was in Thames-street, at the corner of the Custom-house gateway - the prisoner had no right to have it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you followed the business of a carman? A. Five or six years - I have known the prisoner about two months - I know Mrs. Cleaver; she is the widow of a person who was one of the fellowship of carmen - I carry on my business in her name - my caravan<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160056"/>has her name on it - I had employed the prisoner occasionally as a driver of the cart, and so has my servant; but my servant is not in Court - I did not hear from him that the prisoner had my cart for the purpose of doing this job - he has been authorized to employ the prisoner to drive the van - on the 27th of September the prisoner came to me, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, after my man had booked the work he had done in the day - the prisoner said he had taken my van for the purpose of taking a chest of indigo - he said he had received 3s. for it, which he gave me, and I gave him 1s.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he tell you where it was taken? A. He said from Cutler-street to Whitechapel; but he did not say who had employed him - I should not have known my van had gone for indigo unless he had told me - I heard from my own man that the van had been used while he was away for five minutes; but he did not know by whom.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you not surprised that your van was gone? A. Yes; but when we got to the corner we heard who had taken it - I do not stay with the van.</p>

               <p>Langley's Defence (written). The witness says that he saw me take the things down and give them to my fellow-prisoner as he stood at his shop door - I leave you to judge whether he could see my face as I was cutting them down,(if I had been doing so) from the other side of the way, for any one cutting them down must have had their back toward him; and, my Lord, it is very probable that if the witness had seen any one cutting them down he would have cried out to stop them - he also says that he saw us about twenty minutes afterwards, near the shop - I leave you to judge, whether, if I and the prisoner Clark (who was behind me, and I did not know him till we were both taken) had committed this robbery, I should have come near the same place so soon after.</p>

In the forenoon of Saturday, the 4th of October, I went into the Bull public-house to have my breakfast - I was reading the newspaper, and had a beef-steak, which I gave to Shearman, the servant, to be dressed - the prisoner came in, and asked me for the paper - I said he should have it in a minute or two - he said, if it had not been for me, he should have been in service at that time - I told him he had no business to make use of my name -(he had got into service by making use of my name, and the gentleman did not approve of him afterwards - I understood that to be the case) - he then began to abuse me dreadfully - I told him if he did not hold his tongue, I should get up and shake him, which I did, and struck him before he struck me - we had a scuffle, and when I got about the middle of the room, he struck me with a knife and stabbed me- he took the knife up in the middle of the room, and struck me with it in the left breast - he was in a passion, and had not time to cool after I struck him - it happened immediately after the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. Before his blood had time to cool? A. Yes - the knife laid on the table ready for his breakfast.</p>

On the 24th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160061"/>September, I saw the prisoner Barrett in the machine-room knocking up some tallow with his fists - it was in a wrapper of paper - he asked me what made me come from dinner so soon - I left him, and went into a little room - he came there, and looked to see if we were looking at him - he asked if we had any money to lend him - we said, "No" - he then went out of the room and looked in the window, and then went down the court - we went up to the engine to see if the tallow was gone, and missed it - we then went out, and met a workman at the bottom of the court - I saw Mr. Smith in the shop - I did not see any tallow in the possession of Barrett, out of my master's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever tallow you saw elsewhere, how can you tell it belonged to your master? A. Because I had seen it in the machine-room, and it is particular tallow which we use - I saw it in Smith's shop, and saw the prisoner Barrett in the shop where it was - I did not speak to him - when I got back to the machine-room, I saw Barrett again - he asked if we had told Mizen, the foreman, any thing - we told him no - he came to us several times, and said he would give us half-a-crown not to tell about the tallow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use the word "tallow?" A. No - he said, "Do not tell about that" - he did not say what.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's solicitor, and live in Church-court. I prepared a warrant of attorney, and saw it executed by Mr. Ogle, for 613l. - this is the warrant I hold in my hand - on the 26th of September, I attended at the chambers of Mr. Justice Vaughan, and made an affidavit of the due execution of the warrant of attorney - I left it in the custody of Mr. Wilkinson, the Judge's clerk; and finding there might be some delay in obtaining the signature of the Judge to it, I said I would send my clerk for it, and left it in his care, in the mean time - I sent for it a day or two afterwards, and did not receive it back - I went myself to the chambers on the Tuesday following, and saw Mr. Wilkinson, but could hear nothing of it. On the 1st of October, Twisden called at my office in Church-court - it was Wednesday or Thursday - he told me he understood a warrant of attorney had been missed, and he thought he knew a person who had it in his possession - he produced me this note, which he said was sent by that person giving him the information - he then said, as the person had been at some expense in obtaining it from the person who had found it, he wished to know if I would give any thing for the purpose of obtaining it- I said I certainly should not advance or pay sixpence to any body who I thought was connected with taking the warrant of attorney, as I was certain it must have been taken from the Judge's chambers - I would not allow any thing for it; but as far as he was concerned, if I found he was in no way connected with the party, I should have no objection to remunerate him for his trouble if it was brought to me - he then said it was a £5 stamp - I said that would make no difference, for I was certain the defendant would execute a fresh one, and I should get that allowed - he then asked if I would give two or three guineas - I said I would not give him a single sixpence, as I felt it a duty to myself to prosecute the parties connected with it, if I could find out who they were - he then left me, and said he should call again - I sent Mr. Weemys, who was waiting there at the time, to watch him - and in consequence of information from Weemys, I went to the Mansion House within ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and procured an officer - my attention was directed to a public-house, and I saw the prisoner, Amos, in the street near the public-house - I cannot say I saw him come out of the house - I was with the officer when he was taken into custody - we then proceeded to my office with the officer, and found Twisden waiting there - I saw Amos searched at my office in Church-court - he was taken into custody and searched on the spot- when I saw the affidavit it was on a whole sheet of paper, and the blank half of the sheet on which the affidavit was written was found on Amos - (looking at it) I believe this to be the half-sheet certainly - when Twisden was about to be searched, he put his hand into his pocket and took out the warrant of attorney, handed it to me, and said, "There, Mr. Knight, there is your warrant of attorney, and if you behave like a gentleman you will do as you said" - we went to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. When did you first send to the Judge's chambers after leaving the warrant of attorney there? A. I think I directed my clerk to call the following day - I called myself, three days afterwards, in consequence of a communication from my clerk - I did not go the same day - I left the warrant of attorney myself at the office on the 26th with Mr. Wilkinson - he was then standing in an outer office, to which the public have access - I suppose there were fifty persons there on business at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that document be of any possible benefit to the defendants, except by getting a reward from you? A. If they delivered it over to Mr. Ogle it would be of benefit to him; but I knew he had honour enough to execute another - Twisden said himself, before the magistrates, that he had been endeavouring to see Mr. Ogle several times as a party to that warrant of attorney - he did not say he wanted to inquire of Mr. Ogle where my office was - my address is in the document itself, and the affidavit states my description and address at full length - Twisden did not tell me, when he called, that he had been to Ogle - he said he knew the parties - the note did not contain my address - it says, "a Mr. Knight" - he did not say he had been to Ogle to inquire my address - he was taken the second time he came - he stated before the magistrate that he went to Ogle to inquire my address.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The representation he made to you was, that the warrant was in the possession of another person, and he applied that two or three guineas should be given for the trouble the party had who got it from the person who found it? A. Yes - Twisden did not tell me he had seen the document - he said he was acting under the instructions contained in the note - he said he would see the party, and endeavour to get it - he came to me as a man knowing the person who had the warrant of attorney - he came to my office of his own accord the second time - he did not produce the document as soon as I came in - I told the officer to search him - he searched Amos; and after finishing his search, and putting down the particulars of what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160062"/>he found, he proceeded to search Twisden; and when he began his search, and not till then, Twisden put his hand in his pocket, took out the warrant of attorney, and handed it over to me - the officer had laid his hand on him before he produced it - I have the half-sheet of the affidavit - there is no writing on it, nor mark - to the best of my belief, it is the other half of the affidavit - it has the same watermark as my own paper, and there is the mark of a pin at the top, which I recollect pinning at the Judge's chambers- the affidavit has never been found; and there is a crease- it is the common way of creasing paper in the profession- the affidavit was appended to the warrant of attorney - if it had been lost, it would be likely to be lost with it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Twisden did not tell me he had called on Mr. Ogle - I understood from him, when he first called on me, that I was the first person he had been to. (Note read.) "Mr. Twisden - Sir, I will get you to call on N. Ogle, Esq., No. 58, Baker-street, Portman-square, and inform him I can return into his hands a document of the value of 613l. 15s. 3d., with a £5 stamp thereon; but I must know what reward he will give you to deliver the same into his hands, as I have had both exponse and much trouble in obtaining the same from the party who found it- I know it must be of value to him, but do not much understand such things - I do not find any name on the document except 'Knight,' the witness thereto. I expect he has nothing to do with it as to the value. - WM. B."</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Justice Vaughan. On the 26th of September, I received a warrant of attorney from Mr. Knight, with an affidavit annexed to it - he left it for me to take care of till he should send for it - he afterwards sent for it - I had not got it then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were you to do with it? A. To get the Judge's signature to the affidavit - I could not immediately get it signed by the Judge - I afterward obtained the Judge's signature, and had it in my care for Mr. Knight - he sent for it on the Saturday or Monday - it was given to me on Friday - I left it on my desk - I never took it out of the premises - I looked for it when it was sent for, and could not find it - it had not been out of the chambers - I replaced it on my desk with some other papers - the warrant and affidavit were pinned together - I have seen Amos about Sergeant's Inn frequently - I do not recollect seeing him that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your desk is in the outer office, is not it? A. Yes - a great number of persons have access to the office - there are generally a great number there when the Judge is in his chambers - there were a great many on the 26th, (Saturday) - the Judge was not there on the 27th, nor Monday - when it was applied for, I looked among a number of papers on my desk, expecting to find it - I occasionally go into the Judge's room, leaving my office with persons there - persons occasionally, of their own accord, take, from my department of the office, affidavits, which have been left, without asking me for them; but I know who they are - I cannot say whether any of those persons took this document.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it left open? A. Yes - I should not think it could be taken up with other papers - I am quite certain I laid it on my desk - I never saw it afterwards, till I saw it at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. Q. You have been asked whether any body could go and take any papers; do you deliver out papers to people yourself? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. Did not you tell me people were in the habit of taking their own papers? A. They generally say, "I want such an affidavit" - I say, "Take it" - they are within arm's length of me, and I can see that they take their own paper - my desk is quite open - I can reach to the back of my desk without rising from my chair - there is another clerk in the office, but he has nothing to do with the papers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. May he have delivered out the document? A. I do not think he would without speaking to me first: he does not attend to that department - he gives out documents, certainly - he was there that day - he is not here.</p>

            . I am a cooper. I was in Mr. Knight's office on Thursday, the 2nd of October - Twisden came in, and, in consequence of directions from Mr. Knight, I followed him into Clement's-lane, and saw him join Amos - they appeared in close conversation together, about seventy or eighty yards from the office - I watched them along the new street from the bridge - they walked together, and stopped several times, and appeared in very close conversation together - I watched them into a public-house opposite the Mansion House - I went back to Mr. Knight's office - then went to the Mansion House, and got an officer - I saw them come out of the same public-house - they stopped near the Bank a few minutes, then crossed the road towards Mr. Knight's office, and went down the new street, stopping several times as before - Twisden left Amos at the corner of Clement's-lane, towards Mr. Knight's office - at that time Mr. Knight came up in company with a policeofficer - I pointed Amos out to the officer, and he took him to Mr. Knight's office, and I there saw Twisden - Amos was searched, and several papers were found on him - I cannot say whether this note was found on Amos or Twisden - I saw Twisden searched, and after the officer began searching him, he pulled a paper out of his pocket, thrust it by the officer, and presented it to Mr. Knight, saying,"That, I believe, is what you are wanting, that is the instrument; if you are a gentleman, I hope you will act as one," or words to that effect - while I saw the defendants in close conversation, something passed between them that appeared like paper - Amos had on a brown hat.</p>

Do you know Mr. Knight?" - I said, "Yes, I have heard Mr. Ogle speak of such a person" - he said, "Do you know his office?" - I said, "No; it is somewhere in the City" - he held up a piece of paper, and said, "I have a property here, 700l." - then called his words, and said, "615l." - I said Mr. Ogle was not at home - I went in, had my dinner, and then went into the City - I met Mr. Ogle, and told him what had passed - he went to Mr. Knight directly - when Twisden came to our house, I saw a person across the road - it was rather dark, and I could not observe his dress - he appeared a short, thick man.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Shoreditch. On Saturday, the 9th of August, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop and offered me the parts of two broken tea-spoons - the bowls were off, and the letters had been battered, apparently with a stone, but I could trace a "G" and a "K," as the first and last letters - I asked him where he got them - he said he picked them up in Tooley-street - I detained him, and he was taken to the office - he was remanded, but no person appeared - the officer unfortunately gave him the spoons back, but I afterwards ascertained where they had been taken from, and he was taken again - I saw a spoon produced by the prosecutor - it had the letters, "D K," and a letter between, and the same hall mark on it, as those the prisoner brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you find him? A. I informed the officer where he was most likely to be found- the hall mark denotes the year the spoons were made.</p>

             (police-constable D 207). On the 9th of August, I was sent for by Mr. Burgess, and received the prisoner into custody, with parts of two spoons - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160064"/>was taken to the office, but there was no charge against him, and the magistrate suffered him to go, on his own promise to appear the next Monday, which he did; and as there was no further proof produced, the magistrate discharged him, and gave him the spoons - I had examined them very minutely - I could trace the last letter to be a K - I could not see what the two first were - my brother officer produced another spoon which exactly corresponded with those I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You examined the spoons produced by the pawnbroker, to ascertain what was on them, and you could not find the G? A. No - there has been no opportunity of comparing the spoons, except by recollection.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he at work? A. At Mr. Charrington's brew-house.(The prisoner received a good character, and

O." - I undertake to swear I had not sold this pair - I had been offered money for them, but did not take it - they are unlike what I generally purchase - I purchased a lot of them for Mr. Cole, a pawnbroker - I sent them, and several pairs were returned - this is one of them- they were returned as too narrow for the country trade - this pair was soiled when I bought them, but they had not been worn - I cannot say when I missed them; it was in the middle of the summer - I swear that no person in my employ ever sold these boots.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You told this gentleman he was not intrusted to receive money on your account? A. Yes, he was - I paid him 8s. a week, and gave him bills to go to the houses, and get the money - he never accounted for these sums - he went to Bartholomew fair, and the next day he did not come - he went away on the 4th September, on a Thursday, I believe, and he had come to me on a Friday morning - he was taken on the Saturday, and we found this bill in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never authorized him to receive any money? A. Yes; any money that was offered him - I do not think there was any thing owing to him - it was his business to carry out goods, and go and get money- I have known Mrs. Robinson these six years - I did not give the prisoner authority to receive her money - I said to him, on the night before, "Have you called at No. 22, Oxford-terrace, for orders?" - he said, "No" - I had given him the bill on the Monday morning, and he said the lady told him to take change for a sovereign - he took the change, but brought it back to my wife, and said the lady was not at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he receive this money from Robinson with your approbation and consent? A. No; I did not authorize him to receive it - I had sent him with several bills, and he brought the money - I did not give him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160068"/>leave to receive money of any regular customer who dealt quarterly.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Suppose any customer had brought this man a sum of money, would you have found fault with him for receiving it? A. Yes; if he had not paid it to me.</p>

The prisoner hired a first-floor back room of me for 3s. a week, two years and a half ago - he stopped four or five months - he left me in August, 1832 - he was single, and had plenty of work - he left a guinea unpaid when he left - I found there was no one in the room - I went in, and missed the bed, blanket, and sheet, and other things - I gave information, and searched every pawnbroker's shop, but have not found the property - the prisoner is a tailor - I found him on the 29th of August last - I met him in Old-street, close by where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Did he keep the key of his room? A. Yes; I went in two or three days after he was gone - there were three or four other lodgers in the house - there is a private door the lodgers went in and out at - it is kept locked in the day time - it cannot be opened unless I open it myself inside - the prisoner's room door was locked - I opened it with a key of my own - I kept a bunch of keys - it was not a key made for that lock- it is usual with those who let furnished lodgings, to have keys that will open the lodgers' doors - I do not know whether that same key would open the other lodgers' doors- when I met the prisoner, I was riding in my chaise - I believe my horse touched his shoulder, and he looked up - I spoke with him for about ten minutes, but not about the rent- he could have gone off when he saw me, but I should very soon have gone after him - I do not know that he was in the habit of frequenting an eating-house in my neighbourhood - I saw nothing of him till I met him in Old-street - I know a man named Sweet - I have seen him in the prisoner's room, and in the street - I have been with him in a house, but I never drank with him - he came to my house, and said he knew where the property was, and dragged me about day after day, and wanted to extort half-a-sovereign from me - I said if he produced the property would give him half-a-sovereign.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You knew him before? A. Yes; and Mr. Wakefield knew him - I refused to let him hold my bag, but it had no string to it, and he took it from under my arm - Wood-street is two hundred yards from Friday-street - when I got up to him he was laughing, and he told the gentleman it was only a lark - he walked on to Watling-street, and I walked with him - he told the officer it was only a lark - I did not know the prisoner's name till I heard him give it at the Compter - I have seen him at Mr. Wakefield's, but I do not know that he has ever worked there - I did not tell him these articles were Mr. Wakefield's, but he saw me come out of the hall with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he an opportunity of running away after you had taken the bag from him, as he walked to Watling-street? A. There were a good many people walking behind us.</p>

            , JUN. I live at Shepherd's Bush. In consequence of something which happened, I made a search, and found the prisoner in Old Oak-lane, about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning - he had the mare out of the cart, about one hundred yards from the cart - the prisoner was between the shafts of the cart - he had the collar and traces (but no bridle or saddle) hanging to the shafts of the cart - the mare appeared to have drawn the cart - I asked who that mare belonged to - he said it belonged to him, or his brother, it did not matter which, for they were all one - there was no other horse there - I asked him to go with me - he said he would go with the greatest pleasure - I and my father took him along, and gave him to Brown - Arnold claimed the mare, which the prisoner said belonged to his brother.</p>

            . I pawned the articles, with Staples's, by direction of the prisoner. She asked me to pawn them for her; one parcel for 1s. 6d., and another for 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JONES. Q. Are you married? A. I am. My husband is a cordwainer, and lodges at the prisoner's house - she gave me the things on the 4th and 6th of October - she gave me the first articles in her own parlour - I did not tell any body of this till the policeman asked me the question, which was nearly a fortnight after I pawned them - the prisoner was then in custody - I never pawned for her before - I never heard it said that I had taken the things - I am certain she asked me to pawn them - I think it was after dinner - it was not dark - I gave her the money- she said she intended to redeem a blanket with the money- I pawned them in my own name - I did not doubt their being Wood's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Tinsley went out - I do not believe she did lock her door, for she left her window open- a poor woman came to lodge with me, and came backwards and forwards, but I had no idea she would go up to their place - I picked up the duplicates, and a blanket and purse - I asked her whose they were, being convinced it was not right - I went up stairs, and found the prosecutrix's door open - as soon as they returned, her husband came in, in very great haste, and asked me for some warm water to clean her donkey's eye, which was hurt; and, directly they came in, I told them I was sure they had been robbed - previous to this I had asked Holman to pawn these things, to get the blanket out, thinking they were my daughter's, and not the prosecutrix's - I redeemed the blanket - the prosecutrix said that was not all - I said, "I will make you recompense for the rest" - I let her have a pig worth 12s., and forgave her 6s. which she owed me for rent, that she should not be angry - I agreed, as to the two duplicates and things pawned by Holman, that I would take them out, and if any belonged to her she should have them - I hunted nearly two days for the woman, and when I came in at night she fetched a policeman to take me, saying she would have her revenge.</p>

             re-examined. I did not agree to take one of the pigs for part of the property - she wrote a note, and laid it down on my table - I said I wanted nothing of the kind, for it was as hard for her to lose a pig, as for me to lose my property - I never suspected her till two of the duplicates were found - she offered us a pig not to make a disturbance about it, as her husband knew nothing of it - she gave 2s. 0 1/2d. to get my blanket out - I agreed to that- she said she would redeem the rest of the property in a week - I did not say afterwards that as it was not redeemed I would have my revenge, nor agree to take any thing for the property.</p>
               <p>MRS. HOLMAN re-examined. I have known the prisoner three or four years - I never heard her character questioned before - she is rather in comfortable circumstances - she had five pigs - I heard Mr. Tinsley say they were going to have one of the pigs, and he had agreed to find potatoes, and fatten it; and, afterwards, Mrs. Tinsley said she had got a paper that her pig was paid for - she afterwards said, she was given to understand that Mr. Tinsley would be taken up for a robbery, if he took the pig from the stye - she did not tell me she was to have the pig for the property lost - she was talking about the property lost, and said what use was the pig to her, for she wanted her property she complained that Mrs. Wood had not got her property back, and she would have her revenge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I found the duplicates of the things, and got them out, and got Mrs. Holman to pawn them to get the blanket out - I took nothing out of the room - the instant I found the duplicates, I turned the person out of the house- her name is

I do positively - it had three sovereigns in it before, and they had been taken out - in going to the watch-house, she dropped the sovereigns - the watchman picked them up - I heard more than one fall from her - the watchman could only find two - I heard them fall from her - I had about 4l. when I came from home, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - I am employed in the City - I met her soon after one o'clock in the night - I had been to the Albion Tavern, and dined with about 120 gentlemen - I had very little wine, and was as sober as I am now - I went to the watchhouse - I did not charge the watchman with taking one of the sovereigns; nor any one else - I said there were three sovereigns taken from me - I saw I had three sovereigns and a half and a little silver safe at the Albion - I was not two minutes with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of Aldersgate-street. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse between one and two o'clock in the morning - the prosecutor charged her with robbing him - I found nothing on her - the watchman handed me the purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prosecutor quite sober? A. He seemed very talkative - I presume he had been drinking - he talked rational enough - I should say he was the worse for liquor - the prisoner appeared quite delirious when I told her the situation she was in - she said, "Oh my child" - there was a half-sovereign in the purse - I asked the prosecutor what he had been robbed of - he said, three sovereigns more - I said, "Who has got them?" - Martin said, "I have one, and Vine has got the other" - the money was produced, and I had it marked - Vine is a watchman - he is not here.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner, and on her person I found the purse containing the half-sovereign - in taking her to the watchhouse, some sovereigns dropped behind her - Vine picked up one - nobody could have dropped it but her - I swear she dropped it - I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there another watchman with you at the time? A. Yes; I saw her drop the sovereigns behind her - one watchman was on each side of her - we each had hold of her arms - she put her hand behind her and dropped them - I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The watchman swears falsely - he did not take the purse out of my hand - he told the constable of the night that he found it on the pavement.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever state with respect to your insurance and the fires any thing contrary to what you have stated to-night? A. Nothing - I did not on the last trial state different to what I have to-night - the prisoner has never produced, or offered to produce, Mr. Alexander, the executor, to me - I never should have parted with a shilling, except on the authority of that paper - he never produced the will to me - the magistrate offered to admit the prisoner to bail - he has given seven or eight notices of bail - they have been examined and rejected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This transaction took place on the 27th of June? A. Yes; at the Bank Coffee-house, opposite the Bank of England, between twelve and two o'clock - I paid the 25l. at that time - I went to make inquiry of Robson, No. 6, Bank-buildings, before I paid the money - my inquiries were respecting the bill, and respectability of Alexander - the prisoner told me the bill was given him by Alexander before I went to make the inquiry - I paid him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160075"/>the money more on account of the document than the inquiries - my inquiries related to the document.</p>

            . I am a bill-broker, and live in Thaives Inn, Holborn. The defendant offered me this bill for the purpose of being cashed - he told me his wife had lost a relation who had left her 2000l. - that Mr. Alexander was executor under her will - I meant to discount the bill on his telling me that, but I did not - he said Alexander lived at Maidstone, in Kent - I had only known the prisoner a few months - I have seen him write - the signature to this paper is his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How often have you seen me write? A. Once, at my office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Look at the signature to the bill, whose handwriting do you believe it to be? A. I believe that to be the defendant's.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOUGLAS. I am assistant at the debtor's prison, Whitecross-street - I know the defendant - I could not swear to his hand-writing - I do not know that I have ever seen him write - I have seen him at the prison several times- he was clerk to an attorney, and came to follow his occupation there - we had a Mr. Alexander in gaol at that time - I have my book here - he was in prison on the 29th of August, 1831, and was discharged on the 10th of November, 1831, under the Insolvent Act - he was in custody for debt afterwards, in December, 1832, and was discharged May following, by a compromise of 5l. being paid from a charity - I have seen him and the prisoner conversing together, and walking the street together, many times near the prison and in Fore-street, after the discharge from Whitecross-street, walking about as acquaintances - his name in my book is James Wade Alexander - his initials were J. W.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe you have known me some years? A. As coming in and out of the prison; prisoners have made complaints of you, as well as others - I never knew the prisoner to transact business for Alexander - he knew he was imprisoned for debt.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBSON re-examined. I have been to Doctors'-commons, and made inquiry if there is any such person as Alexander, executor to Mrs. Bradshaw - I searched the books, but could find no such will as Bradshaw's, nor executor as Alexander.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a painful duty to address you, not only because I have never been in the habit of speaking in public, but because I have to contend against the evidence of a man not worthy of credit. I will state the real facts, and on the evidence I will produce, leave you fully convinced that Millingen is not worthy of credit - he has said I owed him 25l., and how the 25l. originated - he says the debt never was paid - but I know it was paid in the beginning of last year - when this bill was put in his hands, I was not in his debt - I gave it to him, explaining that it was an accommodation bill - I admit that I had the money, and he sold me a gold watch as part of the consideration, for which he charged me fifteen guineas, deducting the remainder as discount - he never applied to me for payment of the bill when dishonoured - he never let me know it, but apprehended me on a charge of stealing the watch - I was tried here last Sessions, and the Jury, without the slightest consideration, acquitted me - in order to keep me in prison, he preferred an indictment for fraud - I have not, to my knowledge, given more than one notice of bail, and he went to those persons and so alarmed them, that they never came forward, though he says they were all examined and rejected - he explained the serious consequences of becoming bail for any person in Newgate - I do not know that it is necessary for me to say much - you are not to be led away by any thing I or counsel can say - respecting the memorandum, I acknowledge it is my writing, but certainly it was not given to him at the time the bill was discounted, nor till three days afterwards, when he met me at the Royal Exchange, and asked me for it, stating the purpose for which he wished it, and that it should never prejudice me - he did not discount the bill on any representation of mine - he knew that it was an accommodation bill, and for what purpose I wanted money - he was from the 18th till the 27th of June satisfying himself of the statement I made before he parted with the money, and it was nothing but the extraordinary discount, the great benefit he expected to derive, that made him do it - he is a discounter of bills - I will prove he offered to compromise the charge for 45l. last week - 25l. to be paid down, and security for the rest in twelve months - I believe he made the proposition to a witness, in consequence of her going to him to know if he intended to prosecute me, and the dangerous illness of the whole of my six infant children - he then said he did not wish to prosecute if the matter could be compromised - he offered his own terms, and told the witness to go to his house in the evening, at Hackney, and it might be settled - when it was told to me, I rejected it - I preferred going before a Jury and taking their acquittal, or be found guilty there, as without going into the world honourably acquitted, I may as well be transported.</p>

            . I am a diamond merchant, living in Finsbury-square.

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you and he are on bad terms? A. Certainly we are; five Juries have decided that he is guilty of corrupt perjury and conspiracy - a rule nisi for a new trial has been granted, but not argued.</p>

On the 29th of September I was behind the counter in the evening - the prisoner, Smith, came in with a man, who is not in custody - the man asked for a piece of ribbon - he looked at some, and hesitated, and said, "Have you not something better?" - I showed him some better, and then he said he wanted it stouter - I showed him some other, he then said, "Have you not something different?" - I said, "This is what we sell for shoe-ribbon" - Smith stood behind him the whole time - I asked him if they belonged together - he said,"Yes" - I cut the man off a yard of ribbon, and he put me down 6d. - I went to the till and gave him change - he hesitated a moment, and I said, "Is there any other article?" he said, "Yes; I will take a ball of worsted" - I went to get it, and gave it him - he then gave me a penny, and they went out of the shop - a woman came in, and from her information I ascertained that I had lost a piece of merino from off the counter.</p>

            . I am single, and live at No. 184, Church-street, Shoreditch. On the evening of the 29th of September, I happened to be looking in at Mr. Webb's window- I saw Hensby and Jones looking in at the other window- I then saw Smith come out of the shop, and another lad with him, who is not in custody - the other lad had a piece of merino - Smith said, "Over the road and down the alley," and they all ran off together - they ran about half-way across the road, then separated; and Smith and the one not in custody, went down the alley, and the other two went on to Bishopsgate - I gave information to the witness - the merino appeared to me to be a puce colour by candle-light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you known them before? A. Yes; all the four.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was the person who is not in custody, a man or a boy? A. A young man; I suppose he is twenty or twenty-one - he ran down the alley and Smith after him - I had known Smith before- the other had the merino - I saw it in his right hand just by the door - he was not running at that moment - I saw it fly open, and I know it was merino - I will not swear it was- it was about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

I have known the prisoner about three months - on the 31st of August my wife and I went hop-gathering, and left the prisoner in charge of our house - we returned on the 9th of October, and found the door was locked - we got in at the window, and missed the articles stated, and a great many more - every thing was gone but an old chair - we found the prisoner in a public-house - she had this shawl, apron, basket, and shoes with her - I had been two days looking for her - she had before behaved decently.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lent your wife two half-crowns when you were going into the country. Witness. We had let her lodge there - she gave us 5s. for her lodgings, and said she would take care of the place while we went into the country.</p>

On the 27th of September the prisoner came to my shop, asked to look at some thimbles, and had one which she said was to make a present to the cook's daughter - she bought one for herself - she then asked if I had a good watch which I could recommend - I said I had one or two - I showed her one which was not jewelled, and one which was - she said it was for the cook, and she would like one with diamonds in it - I said she might show it to any tradesman, it would bear examination- she said, "I have had dealings with you before, and I believe you are an honest man" - she then asked for my boy to go with her to where she lived, at No. 38, Golden-square, to take the watches to show - I asked her if she would like to take a gold one - she said no, that would be too fine - her master would not let the cook wear that - if she had taken that, I would have gone with her myself - I sent the other two watches by the boy, and said to him,"Mind, the money or the watches" - he said, "Master, I am not to be done" - I have seen them since at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). About ten years ago, I married my first wife, and, after her confinement, it was mutually agreed that we should go to service, and each of us succeeded in getting a situation - my wife had not been in her place long ere she purloined some of her employer's property, and was sentenced to seven years' transportation; and after remaining four years in Newgate was acquitted - I had placed my child under the parental care of my mother, prior to my wife's conviction - after her discharge from prison, I used my utmost endeavours to find her place of residence, but without effect, and continued without any knowledge of her till the 13th of the present month, having previously married the second wife, which was in a great measure pressed by herself, and having previously apprised her that I had one child.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you part with the money from time to time? A. She terrified me so much, and talked of telling my father what I had done previously.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you parted with it without exercising your own free will? A. Yes. I am not twenty-one years of age - my father had given me the money to use, but they were his stockings and other things - she told me she could tell my fortune - she said she told by planets - she said she had been over to Mr. Scholey's niece, and got a sovereign of her, and a gold chain - I shall be twenty years old in March - my father is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. When she obtained these things, did she, in each instance, represent that they should be returned? A. Yes; and I believed she would return them - she told me they would all fall into holes if she kept them - I did not mean to part with my property, but to have them returned - the first time was on the 10th of October - she then had a shirt, a handkerchief, and a pair of stockings of my father's - she said she must have them, but did not say what she meant to do with them - she engaged, in each instance, to return the things - I only gave them her to use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you ask me whether I could tell your fortune, and say you would give me a shilling to tell yours and the servant's? A. No, I did not - I did not say I should like to have my fortune told, as I was deeply in love with a young man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she would give me any thing if I would tell her the young man that she was to be married to- I said I could get a person to tell, and she gave me 5s 6d. to go to the person - the person sent me back, and I asked her for either a piece of gold, or 5s., and she told me the hours at which she wished me to come. Witness. She kept teasing me to let her tell me, and I told her to go away - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160081"/>said she wanted the money to set the planet, and said she would wait and see my mother or father, and have the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you in each instance part with the money and the articles, not intending her to keep them, but to return them? A. Yes: I never meant that she should keep them - she said they would fall into holes if she did.</p>
               <p>ANN LOW. I am servant to Mr. Mather. I recollect the prisoner coming into the kitchen, but she would not let me stop - she said she could not speak before me - she afterwards stopped me in the street several times - she said she wanted a shirt, stockings, and handkerchief, and a piece of gold; and she wanted something that Miss Mather wore - she wanted the money for the planet - she applied again on the Saturday, and Miss Mather sent her out 8s. - she was to return every one of these things when she had them, but she did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you tell me I could see you any time, and you did not care about Miss Mather's fortune being told, so long as I told you yours, as you were eight years in love with one young man? Witness. No, nothing of the kind - I knew my fortune - go along with you.</p>

I do declare on oath that I never put her in fear, nor held out any threat to her whatever, the servant telling me what hour I could see her, between one and two; if not then, at a quarter past eight o'clock at night on Monday; being sent again by the woman when I saw the servant, after going twice, when she gave me 10s. more for the woman, being with me at the time - on our way home we met the mistress at the shop door - she came after me, and said, "Have you seen our servant?" - I said, "Yes, and have received 10s." when two persons coming up to speak to my prosecutrix, the woman calling me on one side, telling me to ask for 10s. more - when she said she could not get it without taking it out of her sister's till - I told her not to do that - she said if I would promise her it should be the last money; I was to come on Tuesday, between three and four o'clock, and she would give me the money; and if I could cause her sweetheart to be with her that night, I was to keep all I had got. I was completely drawn into it by the woman, not thinking of any harm to myself and family; and greatly do I now repent having any hand in it."</p>

About four years ago was the commencement of the prisoner's irregularity - he would lie in bed from morning till noon, and from noon till night- just get up to have his meals, and he began to treat his parents very badly - he would come down in the middle of the week, and not know what day it was - his parents were obliged to apply to the parish authorities to take him into the lunatic ward, and he was there till he was set at large - since then, his conduct has been very bad - he would take the cat and throw it at the children; and dirt about the house- he has come to me and said, "What at work at this time of the week?" - I said, "Yes" - "Why," he would say, "it is Sunday."</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How has he been for the last three months? A. They said he was better, and he had liberty to go into the yard - he then came home, and I found him in victuals and drink, but he absconded from me - my life is at stake if he is not confined.</p>

Yes, as far as one sample is like another - they are very fine oats, but others may have such - I can speak positively as to the sack - it had a particular mark, and it is here - all my sacks are marked, but this had been mended by one of my men - I took particular notice of it - the prisoner is a stable keeper, and had occasion for hay, and oats, and sacks - I lent him one sack, but that had no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that all your sacks were marked? A. No; not all - I never lent him but one sack - I never gave him one, nor sold him one - he never had a sack from my wife, to my knowledge - it was about the 29th of September that my attention was called to this - I do not remember the prisoner leaving town on the 28th, to go to his father, at St. Alban's - I do not remember him coming back till he was taken into custody - the first thing I said to him when he was taken was, that I had a strong suspicion he had some property of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to him, "Good morning, Sir; I was at your house yesterday?" A. No; I did not - it was on the Sunday that I saw his wife, and she said he was out- I did not know it till that night - I told him there was some oats and hay in his stable, and I wished him to tell me where he got them, as I had matched them with mine - he said he could very soon tell me where he purchased them - I said, if he could, that would be sufficient - he then said,"If I must tell you the truth, I had them from my father"- he then took me into the stable, and said if I would forgive him, he would tell me the truth - I said, "If you will tell me the truth, and no other person is connected with you, I will forgive you" - he then said he was afraid I would not forgive him - I do not think the policeman heard this - I did not ask the prisoner about my men being concerned- I had had no quarrel with him about a harness - I never had any words with him in my life - his father appeared before the magistrate, but he did not produce any sample of oats - he was ordered out of the office by the magistrate - he came to bolster up his son.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of oats were yours? A. Scotch potato oats - the hay was Aylesbury hay, cut in a particular shape, to fit boats - I missed the hay when it was found.</p>
