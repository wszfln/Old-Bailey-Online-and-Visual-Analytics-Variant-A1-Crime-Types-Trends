            , ESQ. On Wednesday the 18th of October, the laundry belonging to my house, at the foot of the garden was robbed of a large wash, soon after I was informed of it; on Thursday morning, the 19th, I went to Bow-street, I took with me a list of the articles; they told me they had the goods; I fancy there was one basket which they had not recovered.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your dwelling house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the laundry connected to your dwelling house - A. A wall goes down on each side, to the foot of the garden from my house in <placeName id="t18091101-4-crimeloc24">Gower-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are they in the same enclosure - A. Yes, I go down the garden between two walls.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no intermediate passage to it - A. No, there is an outlet; there is a door to the laundry, and there is a door that goes into the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that door in the fields open - A. No, it was seldom used the lock was rusty, we had no communication with the fields; it was barricadoed with old boxes and trunks because we had no occasion to open it.</p>

               <p>Q. And you have since seen several of these things that you have missed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the laundry secured - A. The window was shut, but not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive where the persons had entered who had taken the things away - A. No, unless they came in at the window, when we first saw it the window was shut.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did you go out - A. At half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any reason to know whether any other part of the family went in after you - A. No. I locked the door after me and the window was shut down but not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had come in they must have opened the window and shut it down again - A. We found the back door open.</p>
               <p>Q. How had the door been shut - A. The back door had been bolted and we found it not bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the back of the door forced - A. No; it was bolted when I left it. The lock was very bad but it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q.When you came back was the lock forced - A. No. The bolt had been drawn back and the door opened.</p>

On the 27th of September, at seven o'clock in the evening, the men left work, they had to pass through the accompting house; I observed Stratton was very much padded across his shoulders, and appeared very different to what he did at other times; the moment he left the premises I laid hold of him and told him I heard he had got what was not his own; he was confused and said it was of no use making words, I certainly have that which does not belong to me, I have cotton upon me; I then desired that he would return into the accompting house, and Turtle with him, knowing they were employed together, one could not be guilty of such conduct without the other being privy to it. I sent for a constable, Stratton produced a quantity of cotton; Turtle said he had no property about him but what was his own; on searching him he produced the Peruvian bark.</p>

               <p>Q. When - A. I do not exactly recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the 15th or somewhere thereabouts - A. I believe it was. I saw this man with his head and shoulders out of the flap of a cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a cellar that is closed with a flap - A. Yes; he had his head and shoulders out of the cellar, and with three bottles of wine down on the flap. There was a large flap that lies down and a small one that lifts up to let light in; this small one he was coming out of; the large flap is to let the beer down, and the small one is to let the light in, it is against the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the head and shoulders of a man out of this flap - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose house was it - A. Mr. Mahony's, the Cock, in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. That is his dwelling house is it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This cellar is a part of the dwelling house - A. Yes. I immediately laid hold of the man, he made a spring and got out of my hands. He was in the cellar when I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the three bottles of wine - A. I picked up two and carried them with me, I left the third there; I pursued; I was never more than five yards behind him, I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards secure him - A. Yes, by the assistance of the watchmen in Percy-street, their names are Smith and Sykes. Upon that we returned to Mr. Mahony's with the prisoner and found the other bottle that I had left on the flap; he had opened that small flap; it is about eighteen inches wide.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned you found one bottle standing as it was when you had left it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered that wine I suppose to Mr. Baker - A. Yes, he is here, he is a watchman.</p>
               <p>COURT. If a man got in did you observe enough to know if the flap would close after him - A. Yes, it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had opened the flap and had got in whether it is necessary to do any thing to raise the flap in order to come out - A. He must raise it again, for when he was in it naturally would fall down.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have fastened it after he went in, and then open it to come out again - A. He must so; I saw no more than his head and shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q.When he came out that flap was kept up by his head and shoulders - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a flap was it - when it fell down did it lock itself into any thing - A. No; there is a bolt inside to bolt it; it falls on the large flap where the foot passengers pass, there is no grove at all to receive it.</p>

               <p>Q. And part of your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see whether the cellar was secured that night by bolts - A. No. There is a large flap that lets the beer down; the little flap falls down upon the large flap and is fastened by two bolts the same flap is used for the purpose of letting air into the cellar; I cannot say whether it was fastened that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wine that was produced to you your wine - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that wine in your bin on the over night - A. Yes; I generally look over the wine bin every night; I had looked over the wine bin that night.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been removed from the place where it originally was left to be upon this flap where Irrons found it - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss that quantity of bottles from the bin - A. Yes. As soon as I was alarmed I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity had been removed from your bin - A. I missed eight bottles, I found three.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the others - A. That I cannot tell. This wine had been four years in the cellar, I never took any out of that bin.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other five you did not find about the cellar - A. No; they must have been conveyed off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there sufficient circumstances about these bottles for you to know them to be yours - A. Yes; there is a passage over this cellar where there was a rat hole, the wet came down; I stopped that rat hole; the dirt was dry on the bottles, I believe the bottles came out of that bin. The cellar door that parts the wine cellar from the beer cellar was broken open, it was locked before; I locked that door myself that night; he must have been concealed in the porter cellar to have broken into the wine cellar; he must have broken the door to get in there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. What time did you go to bed - A. At half past twelve. I was the last person up in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into all your cellars that night, did not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark and you had a candle with you - A. Of course it is dark at twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you awaked in the morning you found this inner cellar door open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person that entered into your wine cellar must have broken the door open on that side - A. He must be in the beer cellar, and have broken the door open to get into the wine cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing him to have come from the street -</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010008"/>COURT. What door was it was broken open - A. The liquor and wine cellar door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday night I had received my wages, I stopped a little at my pay-table; it was about half past twelve o'clock at night when I had done settling for my labour in the house; I was very much in liquor, I did not know rightly which was my best way to go home; I was walking about, I did not know where I went to.</p>

They laid some silver in order to detect the man on the benches, and on the 17th one of the men saw him take them away. In consequence of that, on the 17th, in the morning, I went with one of the constables to his lodging; I challenged the prisoner with robbing me he denied it. There was nothing but one silver spoon tea spoon found at that time in his apartment, which had my mark upon it. I gave him into the custody of the constable, and afterwards some of my workmen went with another constable. The prisoner was one of my journeymen.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am a journeyman to Mr. Adams. On the 16th of September, in the evening, after all the men had done work, me and two more of Mr. Adams' men made a hole in the cieling, where we could see over the work benches; Mr. Adams requested some of us to come down, two of us did; we left one in the loft and the others went to work. The prisoner came into the shop about a quarter before eight, I bid him good morning; I went down stairs and the other man followed, we staid down some time, the other went up; Arnold, the witness, told him he had seen him take the silver, he came down and informed me of it; I saw they were informing Mr. Adams. I went up stairs and at breakfast time I went out, leaving the prisoner and the witness in the shop. I met the prisoner and the other two witnesses in Noble-street; I procured an officer. When Hawkins the officer found the silver I immediately said that was the silver that we had marked.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Adams. I was upon the watch. The silver was put on the benches; the prisoner was the man who took it, I am confident of it; I informed Mr. Adams of it, he desired me to go for an officer, which I did; we followed him home; when we came into the apartment where the prisoner was, he said you will recollect gentlemen this is not my apartment, it is my daughter's. Mr. Adams asked him if he was willing to be searched, he said he was. The apartment was searched, nothing was found but a spoon which Mr. Adams believed to be his property. We afterwards went to his own apartment in the attic, the daughter's was the two pair, we found nothing there. Mr. Adams gave charge of the prisoner for that spoon; we left the apartment and came away. On our return we met Mr. Hawkins the marshalman, he searched the apartment again, he found on the second search the pieces of silver which I saw the prisoner take.</p>

            . On the morning of the 7th of September, about three o'clock, I was called up by the watchman, who told me that my warehouse and printing office doors were both open. The property was missing both from my warehouse and the printing office.</p>
               <p>Q. How are they connected with the house, be so good as to describe the situation of your dwelling house - A. The dwelling house is connected with the printing office; the back door goes into the yard, and then you ascend a small flight of steps into the printing office; they are distinct buildings, but in the same yard, we go from one to the other without going into the street. On searching the premises with the watchman I discovered that the robbers, by removing a pane of glass in the warehouse window, where the paper was, had opened a window and got in; they forced the warehouse door open and got into the printing office. I did not at the moment discover what was gone. On the next day I received information that some paper had been stopped in a coach and the property taken to St. James's watchhouse. On my going to the watch-house I found that it was part of the property that had been stolen from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, prior to your going to the watchhouse, discovered what paper you had lost - A. Yes. The robbery was on Thursday morning; on Monday I had forty reams of royal printing paper from Messrs. Fourdrinier, nineteen of which I discovered were stolen; it was not paper much in use; it was of particular quality and make; Messrs. Fourdrinier have a patent for it; it is made by a machine; the marks of the wrapper are F Y R. On looking at the paper at the watch-house I compared it with the paper left behind, it is completely the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the quantity of reams shewed you - A. Six reams. Since which I learned that the remaining part were sold to Mr. Denham in Broad-street, the day after the robbery; I lost nineteen reams, and we have recovered above eighteen reams.</p>
               <p>Q. What means have you of knowing that paper was there the night before - when had you the last view of the paper or any body else, so as to know the paper was there - A. I had no view of the paper. On the Monday the prisoner Bracken was the warehouseman, he had the key of the warehouse; I knew the paper was there, it came in late on the Monday evening; I saw Bracken bringing it up from the cart to be put into the warehouse; I certainly saw it in the warehouse the day after, or else I asked him. Out of these forty there were nineteen taken away and twenty one were left behind in that warehouse.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of September, a coach, No. 177, came up to me where I stood in Hopkins-street, the coachman turned short into another street, he jammed his coach against a post; he alighted from his coach box and called to me; the lamplighter stood along with me; while we were endeavouring to get the coach off the post there came two watchmen from Wardour-street, one of them told the coachman he believed he was the man that was lurking about his beat. Some of the watchmen opened the coach door, the lamp lighter having the light with him perceived the paper, upon which they said he and the coach should go to the watchhouse; I called the coachman to assist in getting off the coach from the post, he went as if to go round to do it, and made his escape, I led the horses to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010010"/>watchhouse door of St. James's, and deposited the paper in the watchhouse; there were eight reams of paper. six of one kind and two of another.</p>

After the paper was delivered at the watchhouse, we were going to take the coach to the Greenyard, going along Piccadilly two coachmen halloed out where are you going with that coach, 177, it belongs to Mrs. Storey. We took the coach to Mrs. Storey, in Coal-yard, Drury-lane; we called Mrs. Storey, she was up and dressed; she said good God, my coach is come home; my man has been here and said he had lost the coach. When we came back to the watchhouse this man had been enquiring for his coach, they told him to come in, and kept him till we came back; then they asked us whether we knew him; I said I thought he was the man. He was very much in liquor.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At half past one o'clock I saw a hackney coach standing at the end of Tyler's court, one end of Tyler's court comes into Wardour-street and the other end into Berwick-street; I did not observe the number; I went my round, the coach was there when I returned; I made a stop opposite of the coach, I saw one or two persons come into the coach; the coachman said is all in, all right, I shall drive to St. Ann's watering house and have some gin; five shillings you say you will give me; I want money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the countenance of the coachman so as to know it was the prisoner at the bar - A Not at that time. I did not observe the number of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not afterwards know it was the same person as you saw before - A. I was not certain it was the same person, his dress was like it; I did not observe his face. The coachman mounted his box, he said five shillings three times; I shall drive to St. Ann's watering house and have some gin; he drove off. About three quarters of an hour afterwards I heard the coach coming up Princess-street the same way it went down it came very gently up; I thought it might be the same coach returning again; I went into the gateway opposite of Tyler's-court; the coach got opposite of the court; he cried wo'ee very softly; he said make haste, look sharp, in a very low tone of voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he appear to be speaking to - A. I could not see any body; I imagined him to be speaking to somebody up the court; I went and took the number of the coach, 177.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your view of the coach and coachman at that time, did it appear to you to be the same coach and coachman that you had seen before in the same place - A. It did, and when he spoke it appeared to me to be the same voice; when I took the number he said to his horses, it is time for us to go home my boy; he drove off then. I went to Calahan, another watchman, I said come out, here is something going on that should not be, on your beat; he went up Wardour-street and I round Berwick-street, to see it we could meet any body in Tyler's-court, I heard a rumbling of a coach by Hopkins-street, we went there, and there was the coach, No. 177, upon a post; we saw the watchman, Fisher, and the lamplighter, and this coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see there that the coachman of No. 177 was the same coachman that you saw before - A. I was not certain that it was the coachman before that time; I had no doubt but it was the same person I had before seen with the coach; I seized the coachman by the collar; I am sure the prisoner Williams is the person I seized by the collar; the lamplighter held up his burner at the time. When I loosened his collar for him to endeavour to get his coach off the post he made his escape unperceived. I am quite sure the prisoner Williams is the man, and whom I had seen on the two former occasions.</p>

Yes; he had been with me nine or ten days; he came to me on the Tuesday as the robbery took place on the Thursday week; the robbery was on the morning of the 7th; he did not sleep in my house. He went off on the evening of the 6th, about seven o'clock, the usual hour; he did not come the next day till about six o'clock in the evening; I asked why he had not attended to his business; he said that he went to Bartholomew fair and drank too much; he stopped there till four o'clock and then he went to the public house, and the reason he did not come to work on the morning of Thursday, he said he was very ill. He told me he lodged with Mrs. Goodman in Water-lane; I sent to Mrs. Goodman, I found that he did not lodge there.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Wilks. I had a letter written by Mr. Wilks to take to Mrs. Goodman; I enquired of Mrs. Goodman for this man, she said he boarded there but did not lodge there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. At the examination I mentioned the circumstance that he had told me a wrong place; the prisoner said it was a mistake, or that he did it in an hurry. And when he came back on the Thursday I openly told him I suspected he had been concerned in stealing the paper; I asked him where he placed the forty reams of paper that came from Fourdrinier's, he said in the long warehouse; I told him to shew it me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010011"/>he unlocked the warehouse door and said there is the paper; he counted it and said there is only twenty one; I said where is the remainder; he said they must have wetted it, that is, used it, while he was absent. I had told him when that paper came in that the work for which that paper was to be used had not come in. We always wet the over night, and then we wet two or three reams; never so many as nineteen.</p>
               <p>MR. DENHAM. I am a printer and stationer. On the 7th of September I purchased twelve reams of royal paper of a stranger, between the hours of one and two o'clock; he left one quire with me; he called on the day following about the same hour, to know whether I would purchase it; he brought the paper on the evening of the 7th in a cart; I agreed to give six guineas for eleven good reams.</p>
               <p>Q. What would eleven good reams be worth - A. Twenty six or twenty seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you think he came honestly by it - A. I did not know the worth of it then.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I gave fifty-five shillings a ream for the paper.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. On that night I lost the coach and horses in Temple bar rank about eleven o'clock at night; in the mean while I went into the wine vaults the coach was taken away. I went in search of the coach all over the city, and at Smithfield, I came there about twelve, and searched there; from there I went up Holborn, then it was going on for one o'clock in the morning, then I went up to my employer, Mrs. Storey; I told her I had lost the coach, that was about one, she said I must find it; another man went out with me to look for it again; we went to St. Giles's, and up Tottenham-court road, up Oxford-road, and made enquiry, and up one of the little streets by Wardour-street; one of the watchmen told me that he heard of a coach being taken to the watchhouse with goods in it; that is the first I heard of it; when I went to the watchhouse the coach was taken home. From eleven o'clock at night I never was in possession of the coach, not have I seen it since. When I went to the watch-house they asked me who I was, I told them I was the coachman; they asked me whether I was the driver of that coach, I said I was; then they detained me; they said they thought I was the coachman by the colour of my coat.</p>

               <p>Bracken's Defence. My lord, the night the paper was taken out when I had done my work in the evening I resigned up the keys at Mr. Wilks's dwelling house into the possession of the servant maid, which I always was in the habit of doing when I was in his house, at dinner time and at night. I delivered my keys that night before the robbery, then I went to Mrs. Goodman's, where I generally have my victuals, and went along with a young man to the fair, the young man is here; we stopped at the fair till nigh four o'clock in the morning, and that young man with me; then I went with a girl in George-alley, she kept me along with her. Mr. Wilks said I denied where I lodged; I did not; I told him I lodged at No. 7. Change-court, in the Strand. I have lodged with Mrs. Goodman many years, but I did not at that time, I did some time before that.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the watch after Welldon gave it you - A. I have got it in my pocket; I had it in my hand two or three minutes, he said it would be better for him to have it to produce before the magistrate, as he was the man who took it from the prisoner. I received the watch from the magistrate; I have it in my possession now.</p>
               <p>Q. It was produced there by Welldon - A. It was. The magistrate sealed the watch up and gave it to me.</p>

            . Q. You are a servant of Mr. Blake - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say respecting the prisoner and this watch - A. I met the prisoner on the day the watch was missed in Spanish place, as I came from prayers</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No, I had no acquaintance with him; I saw him once before; he was acquainted with a servant I knew; I desired the prisoner to call upon me any time that day, as I thought he was in distress, I would give him some meat; he knew where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought he was in distress, you would give him something - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of him after this time - A. My master sent me out to order the curricle to come.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out - A. A little before four; I happened to meet him at the corner of St. James's place as I came back, I desired him to call upon me when he saw my master and mistress were gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master and mistress go out - A. Yes; and that very instant they were gone the prisoner came into the hall to me, he seemed to be rather shivering with the cold, in consequence of that, I knew there was a fine fire in the drawing room, I brought him up to warm himself by the drawing room fire, I desired him to stop there a bit, 'till I brought him up some meat, and put it in paper for him. I left him sitting at the drawing room fire while I went down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the watch hanging there - A. To the best of my knowledge it was there; I had seen it there that morning; I believe it was there at that time, after he was gone I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you down stairs before you missed it - A. Not five minutes; I returned with some meat in paper to him, and the prisoner seemed to be in a great hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. He was sitting by the fire when you returned, was not he - A. No, he was not; I left him sitting by the fire, when I returned he was near the drawing room door almost.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was he appearing to be coming out of the room - A. No; he did not appear to be coming out of the room; I asked him what made him in a hurry; he said he did not like to stop, he was in a hurry, he had four miles to go from Whitechapel somewhere. Then he pulled out one halfpence, he said if he had some more he would give me share of a pot; I told him I would not take it, but I would give him share of a pot. Then I saw him down stairs; as soon as I had put some coals on the fire I went along with him to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose in the neighbourhood - A. Yes; I did not stay with him there more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave him there in the public house - A. No; he came out along with me; we parted at the corner of King-street, in St. James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you parted did you go back again immediately; I went into the drawing room to lay the cloth for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before your master and mistress came home - A. Yes. It occured to me that the watch was there, but I could not swear that it was there; it usually hung there and I did miss it; I did not know but my mistress might have taken it out with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you say it was after the prisoner and you went out together to your returning to the drawing room - A. He was not in the house five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been absent from the house - - A. Not ten minutes all together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about the watch to your master and mistress when they returned - A. Not till they spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you did not know but your mistress might have taken it with her - A. I thought she might have taken it with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was mentioned to you did you tell your master and mistress who had been in the drawing room - A. Not at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You were conscious you had done wrong - A. Yes; I thought so.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought very right - when was it mentioned it first to your master and mistress that the prisoner was brought up by you into the drawing room - A. In a very short time after; I thought it right to acknowledge that I brought such a person up there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again, or the watch after this - A. Not till about nine o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any thing of the prisoner again befor you saw the watch - A. No.</p>

The Sunday before; I asked him if he had got into any place, or any employment, he told me he had not; he had no money about him, I gave him fourpence.

On Monday morning I went to a house in Church-street, St. Giles's, I went up stairs and saw the prisoner in bed, I told the prisoner to come down stairs, I wanted to speak to him; while he was dressing himself I came down and enquired for a constable, and on my bringing Cullom the prisoner was gone; I went to the Black Horse in the neighbourhood, there I found Cullom. The people where the prisoner lodged told me that he followed me out; I stopped about five minutes, the prisoner came to me, I desired him to follow me to the Black Horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cullom with you at that time - A. Yes, he was; we went to the Black Horse. The prisoner, before I mentioned any thing, said he knew what I came about; he gave me the watch and said he was very sorry.</p>

On the 26th of September I left the warehouse to go to tea; my dwelling house is in Cheapside; when I returned to the warehouse it was about eight o'clock in the evening a waggon drew up with five barrels of raisins, I ordered the prisoner to assist in taking them in; he did so; I observed that he was bulky in his belly, his apron was tied loose about him; I stood by him until he had unloaded the waggon, with a lighted candle in my hand, and as he saw I took particular notice of him he ran up one pair of stairs, I ran up after him; he immediately turned about and came down again; I pursued him and desired him to go into the accompting house, I wanted to speak to him; he said, yes, I will, presently; he immediately ran out of the door, I pursued him and cried out stop thief; we run along Maiden-lane, down Garlick-hill, along Queen street; he was stopped in Cloak-lane; I came up to him as soon as he was stopped, I perceived he was not so bulky then. A person of the name of Cousens stopped him; Cousens and I brought him into Queen street; Cousins said he saw him drop a bag of sugar there; we went to the house of Mrs. Lambert, Cousens received the bag of sugar in my presence. The prisoner and the sugar were taken back to my warehouse; the bag was opened, it contained ten pounds weight of sugar; it was the same kind of sugar as that in the hogshead. The prisoner said he begged I would overlook it.</p>

               <p>- THOMAS. On the 30th of September, in the evening, the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy an axletree; I told him I did not know, untill I saw it; he went and fetched it; I examined it, I said it was a good one; he asked half a guinea for it; I told the prisoner the axletree was worth more; if he would call upon me on Monday morning there was not the least doubt I could get him a pound for it; he left it. I made enquiries; Mr. Lane came to my house, he saw the axletree and claimed it. The prisoner came on the Monday morning, he asked me if I had sold it, I told him it was all right; I told him we would go and have something to drink. The constable was behind my counter ready to take him when he went out. On going into the public house the constable took him. I have had the axletree ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The box and the axletree cost fifty shillings, Common boxes are worth fourteen shillings; that is a patent one, I should think they are worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you mean that the axletree in that state cost fifty shillings - A. No; with the boxes. I suppose it is worth forty shillings as it is without the boxes.</p>

            , he is a feather maker. The prisoner brought three bundles of feathers to our house and offered them for sale on the Wednesday after they were lost; I asked the prisoner if she had any more: she said no. I think she asked ten shillings, or ten shillings and sixpence for the three bundles. I took them up to my husband; he ordered me to stop her and to send for an officer. I stopped her and sent for an officer, he came and detained her. I told her I suspected the feathers were stolen; I was ordered to stop the person that brought them; she said she bought them; I asked her how she bought them, as she was able to sell them so cheap; she answered she bought them in a lot of things. I said, good woman, if you leave them with me, and leave your address, you shall have double that, they are worth a great deal more; she said she would; she waited till my husband came down, and, as I said before, the officer came and took her in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she taken in custody at your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that time to this she has been in prison - A. Yes. She told me at last that she found them.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was not Hewitt taken up on a charge of stealing these goods - A. No. There was no other person taken up but this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me there was no other person taken up before the alderman - A. No. There were three bundles of feathers found in the possession of Mr. Hewitt.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hewitt lives no great way off from where you were robbed - he lives in Wilson-street - A. He does. The very next day I found three bundles in Hewitt's possession; Mr. Hewitt told me he gave eight shillings for them, to induce them to leave it; he having nobody in the shop to detain them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was Hewitt before the lord mayor - A. No. I wished to take Hewitt up; I applied at Worship-street office, there was not an officer to be found; then I applied to a city constable, he said he could not take Hewitt up without a warrant, but he could take the feathers. The feathers were returned to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You having found three bundles of feathers at Hewitt's, how came Hewitt not to be taken up - A. On that account, because I could not get an officer; and I was told after the lord mayor gave me back my property I could not take him up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Yes you could.</p>

            . On the morning that the prisoner came into my house I was in bed, my wife came up and told me that the feathers were offered for sale for ten shillings; I bid her go down stairs and keep the woman in conversation while my son went for an officer. When I came down I told her she had no business to attempt to go away, if the goods were come honestly by; she gave a written direction where she lived; she first gave the wrong name, and then she gave the right; the officer took her up in my dining room and searched her. The feathers I have kept, they are here; these are the feathers she offered me.</p>

            . Curiosity led me to St. Paul's church-yard, I had not been there five minutes before I saw two men of suspicious appearance, and from seeing the appearance of these men and their conduct towards me, I watched their motions some considerable time; I saw them attempt some gentlemen's pockets, and told them of; I believed I saved many gentleman's property by that means; I saw the prisoner and another go to several gentlemen and after about a quarter of an hour there was a third joined them; soon after he had joined them they went behind this young man and another gentleman, they pressed them very close. In the course of two or three minutes I saw the prisoner turn round as though he was coming from those persons they were pressing; I saw him draw his hand from the side of one of the others, with the watch in it immediately; as I perceived the string hanging from his hand I seized his hand with the watch in it. The moment I had secured the watch I held it up, and called out, which of you gentlemen have lost a watch. The prosecutor turned round and said it is my watch; instantly upon that I took the prisoner by the collar and secured him; soon after I had secured him there was a bustle among the people, some constables came and wanted me to offer him up; I refused. One of the constables took hold of the other side of him, and we went with the prisoner to Giltspur-street compter. I told them every man was a constable to take a thief; I wanted them to take notice of the people around me than they might not rescue him; I refused to give him up to any man. When we got to the compter I took the watch out and asked the young man whether he was certain it was his; he said he was, his mother gave it him. I gave it to the constable to take care of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to see the procession go to St. Pauls, I stopped by St. Paul's gate; I saw a hustle among a great many people, a man said to me, take this; he put a watch into my hands and made off. There was an outcry about an handkerchief; I said I have no handkerchief, I have got a watch in my hand, I do not know who it belongs to.</p>

I turned round to look for the velvet and when I came back I missed a piece of jean; I looked and saw it under his coat; I should have charged him with it directly, but being alone I was afraid; I rang the bell; my servant came down directly; I followed him to the door, I said you have a piece of jean; then he ran off as fast as he could, the young woman went after him; he ran up Sun-court and down Dunnings-alley. He was brought back in about ten minutes. I am sure he is the same person.</p>

               <p>MR. TAYLOR. I live in Sun-street. On the 25th of October, near my house I heard the cry of stop thief, I observed the prisoner running away from the young woman; observing that he crossed the way to come at the back of the houses in Sun-street I run to my own house, and went through and got out of my back door; the moment I opened the back door I saw the prisoner pass, as hard as he could run; I immediately followed him and knocked him down; the servant came up and said he had robbed her mistress of the jean; I took him back to Mrs. Caldicott; she said he was the man that took her jean.</p>

I got a description of the boy that had left it there. I found out that Mr. Walduck had lost the barrow; and during my absence Mrs. Simonds brought the boy into my house the back way, he took the advantage and run out of the front door. I took the prisoner the next day in Smithfield market, I asked him if he would tell me what he had done with the pots it would be greatly in his favour; he said they were done; he was willing to go to sea.</p>

On the 24th of October, in the evening, the prisoner called upon me, he represented himself as a lieutenant in the navy; he was genteely dressed, apparently as an officer; he said he had lately returned from the coast of France, from a successful voyage; his captain and him had taken lodgings at the Saracen's Head inn, Aldgate, for a few days; his captain was there, and he wanted a gold watch; my young man and myself were in the shop; we shewed him a very good watch; after he looked at the watch he gave it me to wind up; I wound it up and set it, and after winding it up and setting it I put it down on the counter, he took it up and put it into his pocket; my young man was to accompany him to the Saracens Head inn, and there he would pay him for the watch. I did not see him afterwards till I assisted in apprehending of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that afterwards - A. On the Saturday morning following. This was on the 24th and Saturday was the 28th. Immediately after we found the person had defrauded me out of the watch we went to Bow-street, and bills were circulated about the trade. When we took him in custody he said he had injured me most exceedingly, and he lay at my mercy; I made no reply.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was he to give you for the watch - A. Twenty six pound five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver it to him - A. He took it off the counter. I laid the watch down after I had set it and he took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. He talked to you about this captain - A. He said the captain wanted a very good watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the captain to see it - A. We made out a bill of parcels in the name of lieutenant Pierce, that was the name he assumed.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh then you sold it to lieutenant Pierce and not to the captain - A. Yes, to the prisoner, who assumed the name of lieutenant Pierce. He said he and the captain had taken lodgings at the Saracen's Head for three or four days; he said my young man should accompany him to the Saracens Head, He had engaged two rooms prior to this at the Saracens Head.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that - A. From the waiter and master of the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not deliver the watch to him - A. No; I put it on the counter and he took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you put the watch into a leather bag and put it into my hands - A. No; I put it on the counter after having set it; I delivered the bill of parcels into your hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you trusted him with it - A. Yes. The prisoner had possession of the watch, but he went with my young man arm in arm; he was in charge of my young man.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Broad. On the 24th of October the prisoner came into the shop and said he had been recently in the East India service, but now he was removed to the navy, and he wanted a very good gold watch; we shewed him a very good one, which was twenty five guineas; he said him and his governor, which he called him at that time, had taken lodgings at the Saracens Head for three or four days; he liked the watch very well, putting it in his pocket; he had not got money enough to pay for it, but if I would go with him to the Saracen's Head, there I should receive the money for it. Previous to that he said that he had taken the York frigate; going along with him I asked him where he took it; he said off Bolougne. He went in at the back door, went up there very familiar, and called the waiter, told him to light two candles, which were on the table, and then ordered him to bring up two glasses of negus; it was brought, and then he asked me if I had a receipt, I told him I had a stamp and I would write a receipt; he drank one glass of negus, then asked me if I had change for three tens, I told him I had not; he told me he would go and get the exact money, leaving me writing the receipt. Previous to his going out he said his luggage was in the next room, and he had change; he went out, asked me how much, I answered, twenty six pounds five shillings. He had not been gone five minutes when I rang for the waiter, a strange waiter came up; I desired him to send up the waiter that brought up the wine and water. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010017"/>he came up. I said you know that gentleman, that I came up with, a few minutes ago; he replied I know no more of him, than he took these lodgings about a quarter of an hour ago, the mistress of the house came up, and there was some confusion, she reproved the waiter, for not looking after persons that came with no baggage; I ran home and got some hand bills and circulated them at the east end of the town; on Saturday a person came and told us they had seen a watch that was advertised with the name of William Broad, describing it. The prisoner went away with the watch, I never saw him till Saturday morning, I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Saracens Head Inn, Aldgate, on the 24th of August, the young man came to our house and took a sitting room and a bed chamber said he was going to stop three or four days, he came to our house between six and seven in the evening he called me up into his room, he said if a young man a midshipman called upon him to say that he should be back in a few minutes, I asked him what name the gentleman would enquire for, he said lieutenant Pierce; he went out and I suppose in a quarter of an hour he returned with Mr. Broads young man, they both went up into the room, I lighted candles for them.</p>
               <p>Q. He had never laid at your house at all - A. No he called for two glasses of port wine negus. I took it up to him, I came down stairs in about five minutes he came down stairs he was going out of the back door, I told him to go out of the other back door, there are two back doors in the yard; In a few minutes the young man came down and asked whether the prisoner had any baggage.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLAISTOW. I am an officer of the ward of Aldgate. I was applied to by Mr. Broad, I went with him and his young man to a house in Houndsditch. I immediately went through the shop into the parlour and there saw the prisoner sitting by the fire with a watch coat on, endeavouring to hide his face he was buttening himself up, Mr. Broad followed me in, I asked him it this was the person that he wanted, he said yes; how do you do lieutenant Pierce, I am glad to see you you are my prisoner. The prisoner said he hoped Mr. Broad would not do any thing, he would pay him for the watch, and make this gentleman a handsome present, meaning me. He asked to dress himself, he had trowsers on only and this great coat; I said certainly dress yourself, he put his jacket on, he turned into the cupboard, by the fire side; Mr. Broad said we must not lose sight of him. I said I did not intend, we opened the cupboard door, he was not there, I found that cupboard led into the yard we ran out of the front door to the next house he was coming out of that house, we then secured him, as he went along; I put some questions to him, I had very great reason to think that he had the property upon him, I said so he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury I went to the prosecutors shop, and made a purchase of a watch of twenty-six pounds five shillings, it is true for which I offered a thirty pound note, the prosecutor not having change; I told him if he would send a person to the Saracens Head Aldgate, I would get change, the prosecutor gave me the watch his man came to me, at the Saracens Head I could not get change at this place, I went out to get change, I saw a press gang coming, as I had not a protection, I ran from them I mean'd to pay Mr. Broad as soon as I could with safety come to my lodgings.</p>

On Saturday the 14th of October I received information which led me to secrete myself and watch on Sunday morning the 15th between nine and ten, I saw him unlock the door and enter the warehouse, he remained there about six minutes he then came out double locked the door as he found it; opened the street door very cautiously and shut it softly; I communicated what I had seen to my partner, and on the following morning which was the Monday, I locked my partner in this warehouse, I saw him secrete himself, I remained on the stairs as before, and saw him enter, my partner will tell you that he stole velvit that morning, I saw him come out after being there about six minutes, he went out of the street door in a cautious way. I immediately opened the warehouse door my partner told me he had stolen about five or six yards of velveteen; which he put in his breeches; we suffered him to escape with this also; on the next morning I saw him enter the warehouse in the same cautionary way, my partner being situated under the table as before, he came out after being there about five minutes I lost no time, opened the door and asked my partner what he had taken, he said boot legs and straps, I immediately opened the street door and pursued him, I collared him, and said your hour is come at last, and delivered him up to Mr. Atkins, the officer who was waiting with his brother in the neighbourhood, we took him to a public house, and searched him, found the boot legs, and some canvas, in his breeches, and the back straps in his coat pocket, and some candles, which he took out of the accounting house, in his other pocket.</p>

I was alone in the shop, one of the women came to me, and asked me, if I could match the pattern; I told her we had not the colour and if we had I could not match it by candle light, being purple and green, to the best of my knowledge on my reply she kept close to me my, back being to the window,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010018"/>while I was looking at the pattern by the candle, the prisoner went out, and I thought she went out rather suspicious; I cast my eye to the window, I found that a piece of linen cloth was gone, I immediately ran after her, and took her about two yards, from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a piece that you had in your recollection being in the window before. - A. Yes, I dressed the window myself and I knew I had placed it there on which we placed some lustres in the day, to show to the best advantage; I pursued her I took hold of her hand, and she had the piece of cloth in her right hand, she made some remark, pleading for mercy; I took her back to the shop, called my employer down; I told him the affair, and then he sent for a constable and gave her into custody.</p>

No, I felt on the outside, about half after nine; I sent two of my children out to get some pastry when they returned, I opened the handkerchief, the prisoner looked very hard into the bundle; I said will you partake he said he thanked me, and I gave him a rasberry tart, a little time after; the man got up, I felt a something several times, just at my back.</p>

            . I am the check taker. I heard the cry in the pit of stop thief, at the time the prisoner came out of the pit, he said I do not want a check, I do not think I shall return, after the prisoner passed me I thought I heard a voice say I will go by, which proceeded from the pit door, the prisoner was at a pair of green folding doors, I nearer the street; he was endeavouring to open it, he was about five yards from me, I considered that the pit doors were stopped up, by some accomplice; I steped through my door, and took the prisoner by the collar with my right hand, that moment he put his hand up his waistcoat, I put my left hand round his back and pinioned his left arm by the elbow; I told him whatever he had got it should be brought to light; I did it to prevent him chucking it away. I pulled him into a square place adjoining the pit door, that admits the half pay, Mrs. Peterson, the prosecutrix's daughter, came up, she said to the prisoner, you have robbed my mother, and I will have the money or notes. In the act of pulling him he gained his arm of me; it was partly at liberty; he put it farther up his waistcoat and I saw some paper drop from it; the daughter picked it up; the mother came up, and the daughter gave her this roll of paper which dropped. I called Britt the officer, he came and took him in custody; Mr. Beeley came up, they conveyed him into my room; I requested Mrs. Randell to be as correct in the sum as possible, before this roll of paper was opened; Mrs. Randell said it is one hundred and eighty-eight pound, immediately correcting herself, said, it is only one hundred and eighty-six pound; Beebey counted the notes and I took down the sums; they amounted to one hundred and eighty-six pounds. The notes were given to Beeby to take care of. We then went to the Star public house, she there said one note was marked captain Theter for twenty pound, it turned out to be so; a Gravesend note; two pound, and a thirty pound note nearly torn, it turned out to be so.</p>
               <p>MARY PETERSON. I and my husband were with my mother, Mrs. Randell, I sat on her right hand side, on the outside of all; I did not see who sat on her left hand. I saw my mother get up and put her hand to her left hand pocket, she cried out, Mary, I am robbed, and that man that is going out of the pit has robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person going out of the pit - A. I saw the back of a man, I ran out of the pit, and my brother called out stop thief. When I came out Mr. Davis had the prisoner in custody, I ran to him and took hold of each side of his waistcoat; I said you villain, you have robbed my mother, and I will have the money; he said I have got nothing; he put his hand to the waistband of his small clothes, and he threw down a paper parcel; he tried to put his foot upon it, I immediately moved his foot with my knuckles, and picked up the parcel.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010019"/>Q. You are sure you saw it drop from him, are you - A. I am quite sure, and I gave it to my mother; she was then standing within the wicket; I was not present when the notes were examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any interruption in getting out of the pit - A. Somebody struck me; I saw the hand; I said I will go past. I did get out.</p>
               <p>MR. BEEBY. Q. You are the officer that was called upon this occasion - A. Yes. The prisoner was in the custody of Mr. Britt, another officer; I was in the boxes; I ran down and saw the prisoner in custody; Mrs. Randell delivered me up some paper that was in her hand. I searched the prisoner in Mr. Davis's room, I found nothing upon him but a watch in his watch pocket. Mrs. Randell told me there was one hundred and eighty six pound; I counted it, and found it to be the exact amount.</p>

            , we had tea there; we went away together about six o'clock; I went home with him; I went into my parlour, I saw my desk and opened it, the prisoner stood by. I looked at my notes they were just as I had left them; I locked the desk. I went out, leaving the girl in the care of the house. We then went to the Green Dragon in Stepney, we had there some brandy and water, and wine and water; the prisoner said he must leave me, he must go to get his coat and apron, he was going to get a bullock out of the drove, to hunt him; I told him he had better stop where he was; he said he must go, and away he went; he returned to me in half an hour, with his coat and apron, he had them tied up in an handkerchief; then we left the Green Dragon together; he said he was going into the city about particular business. When we got to Whitechapel church he left me; we was to meet again at Stratton's, the corner of Newgate market. I got to Stratton's public house about half after ten at night; the prisoner came to me in a very great heat, and very uneasy, and said he wanted to be off. We both went home from there.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of his apron and great coat - A. He took it with him, and I took it at Whitechapel church; when he parted with me he desired me to carry them till he met me at Stratton's. We got home about half past eleven, I was going into the parlour, he laid hold of my shoulder and said, come up to bed, sir. I was just then by the parlour door, he said you can see nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep in the room with you - A.Yes; in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the servant maid at home when you came home - A. Yes, she had just gone up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A. Rather before eight o'clock; he had just got the shop opened when I came down. I then went into my parlour, I observed the desk broken open, it appeared to have been broken open with a chopper; I found the chopper in my shop; I looked in my desk, and I missed all the notes, and the three guineas, and a gold watch which hung by the desk. I went into the shop and told the prisoner my loss; he shook his head and said, d - n it, you are born to be unlucky; he then said, never mind, I will work for you for nothing; then we went out together out of the house; we walked down Whitechapel; he left me to go to Smithfield, and I went to my brother's to tell him what had happened. In the course of the afternoon I met him in Smithfield market, I spoke to him, but did not tell him I suspected him. In about two hours afterwards I was in the Lock and Key, Smithfield; I told him I thought he was the person that had done it; he denied it; he said he had no objection to be searched, he was, and nothing was found. Then he said I suppose you have done with me, I made no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him again - A. It might be three or four days; he came to my house in about a fortnight afterwards, and saw him once in Smithfield market between that he; he came up to me and said he had been down for his box, and he could not find it, he asked me whether I would let him have it; I said, yes. He came the next day and asked me if he might have the box, I said yes, I should like to see what he had in it. There was a pair of gloves, a waistcoat, and a snuff box in it, they were mine; I had lent him the waistcoat, but not the gloves nor the snuff box; he took the box and went away, leaving my things.</p>
               <p>MARIA CLAFTON. Q. You were a servant on the 10th of September to Mr. Strangeways - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Strangeways and the prisoner going out on the 10th of September - A. Yes, between five and six o'clock, and they came home together about half past six, they did not stay ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten the sash down before they came home - A. No, George came home. I left the sash up on my hearing him knock at the door, he came into the parlour, he asked me to go up stairs for his coat, I asked him where it was, he said he did not know. I must look for it; I fetched it, when I brought him down the coat, he asked me to go up for his apron. I was to bring him the biggest apron I could find; he wrapped his coat in the apron and tied it up in a handkerchief, he said he would go in the shop and see if the block was against the shop door; he said yes it was.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you went up stairs, at either time; or both did you hear any noise in the parlour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010020"/>- A. I heard him walk across the room, and push the bolt of the shutter back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where were you at that time - A. Up stairs over the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you hear any thing else - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had been in the shop, how soon did he go away - A. He staid about five minutes in the shop, he said I must be sure to go to bed, at ten o'clock, he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the parlour after he was gone, A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that you left the sash up; when you went into the parlour after he was gone; was the sash up or down - A. Down, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Untill your master came home during the time that they were out, was there any body else in the house but you - A. No, not till my master and he came home. I went to bed a little after eleven, I was awake when my master came home, I heard them come in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get in - A. My master had the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any watch being in the parlour - A. Yes, I looked at it at six o'clock, to see what o'clock it was, that was between the time that they both went out together, and the time that they came home together, and I saw it again just before George came in by himself; I did not see it afterwards, I never looked for it; I never examined the bolts, till the next morning, and then I observed the middle bolt, was pulled not quite back.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Acton. On the night of the 2nd of October, after crying the hour of twelve, I sat down upon Mr. Pierce's step, a linen draper's shop about fourteen or fifteen yards from Mr. Briggs' house, I heard a rattling of a door; I walked towards Mr. Briggs' door, I saw the prisoner opening his glass door; she said, what, Goss, you are our watchman. She had been a servant there, but was not then. I asked her what made her open the door, and told her I would call Mr. Briggs; I left another watchmen with her. I went down a passage and called him, I did not make him hear; she said she would call master; she called out, she seemed very much in liquor. The housekeeper came down in her shift; she said, for God's sake what is the matter; how came you here. When Mr. Briggs came down, he said, take her about her business; then he said search her; Mr. Briggs put his hand into her pocket and took some tea spoons out; he put in his hand the second time and took out a pepper box; he told me to lock her up in the round house; then he said he would not wish her to go to the round house; he then said, take her to a woman of the name of Clarke, where she had slept before, and when I had taken her to this woman's house, Mr. Briggs came down; he said he had lost more property. I saw something in her bosom; I took out of her bosom a two pound note. Mr. Briggs took the spoons and the pepper box, I have kept the note ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Who lives in the house with you - A. Only a housekeeper and a little boy.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this night the watchman has been speaking of; what time did you go to bed - A. About half past nine; I left my housekeeper to shut my shop door before I went to bed; I followed her up about five minutes afterwards. I saw the back door bolted; the kitchen window was secured with a wooden pin. About twelve o'clock I was alarmed, I heard a noise below in the shop like people quarrelling; it awaked me. I went to the chamber door and called what noise was that; the watchman answered, come down. I put my clothes on, went down, and saw the watchman and the prisoner there; she was scolding, raving, and quarrelling like a person deranged; she is subject to a deranged mind at times. I then asked her what she did there, and how she came there; she said she was going by about ten o'clock, found the street door open, she came to lay there, that was her place, and there she would be; I have great reason to believe that her intention was to be there all night, because she had made up a fire in the kitchen. When I went to bed I saw the fire out myself. We searched her pockets and took out four silver spoons and a pepper box; I have got them. She was taken to Mrs. Clarke's by my directions, where she had slept before; she made so much noise Mrs. Clarke was afraid to sleep in the house with her; she was searched; I think the watchman said he took the two pound note out of her bosom. She was afterwards taken to the round house, after a great deal of trouble and violence made use of to get her out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be in liquor - A. I think she did rather.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had these silver spoons and the pepper box been put on the over night. - A. They were on the tea-board on the dresser in the kitchen, the two pound note was in the cupboard in the parlour, I believe I locked the cupboard when I went to bed, the cupboard had folding doors, there appeared to be two nails drawn from the bottom, that is the way how it was opened, the lock was not hurt, the shutter of the kitchen window was open, and there were two squares of glass broken, on the next day she said she broke them in opening the windows; she had lived with me five or six years and she had only left me about five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Then her account how she got into this house was, that she found the street door open, that she came in to lay there, that was her place and there she would be. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it you say, you supposed her to be deranged. - A. Yes; I supposed her at times to be deranged, her head was disordered, she used to apply to spirituous liquors, and say it would make her head better, and it always made her head worse, and when she was so I turned her away, not for dishonesty, when her head was bad she would drink, that made her quarrelsome, then I turned her away, and when she got into a sound-mind, then I took her again, the last time I sent her away she went to her friends in the country; she was under the doctor's hands, he advised them to put her into the private madhouse; however she got the better of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On that night I came from London in the stage coach to the George at Acton, between nine and ten o'clock at night, and going by Mr. Briggs' door I saw the door was not fast; before I went into the house I saw there was a light in the housekeeper's room, I thought Mr. Briggs was making of candles; I went into the kitchen, and as I came to the back door I thought I heard somebody come in at the street door, then I went up stairs and the light was not in the housekeeper's room. At the same time I heard Mr. Briggs sleeping in his bed; I came down and fastened all the doors; it was very dark in the kitchen, I opened the window to look for the tinder box; I thought there had been somebody in the house by the doors being left open; in opening the window I struck it by accident; I struck a light, and the first thing that I looked after was the plate, and as I found it I put it into my pocket. I looked in the china closet in the parlour, where there was a deal of plate; I saw it all safe; then I went up into my own room, where my own clothes were I found my box as I left it. I then came down stairs made a fire, and made some tea, and drank it. I intended to sit down there till the morning, untill Mr. Briggs got up; I had sat down in the chair some time, and then I thought I heard somebody at the street door; I went to speak to the watchman; when I came to the door it was the watchman; I said, well watchman, what is it you want; he directly took me in custody; he alarmed me very much, saying, I was his prisoner, and that he would take me away; I said I would not go out of the house till Mr. Briggs came; I went to call Mr. Briggs, in my flurry I fell down; Mr. Briggs came down; the watchman said he would have me searched, I told the watchman not to search me, what I had in my pocket Mr. Briggs was very wellcome to take out. The watchman alarmed me, else I should not have left my umbrella, my bonnet, and my bundle in the kitchen, and a fire was in the kitchen as I was going in again.</p>

               <p>Mr. CULLEN. I live at No. 13, Great Arthur-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is near where this robbery took place. A. Yes; I was standing looking out of my window, I saw this Kendrick between two men, towards the bottom of Great Arthur-street, they were holding him by the coat, I saw soon after a watch in the prisoner's right hand, which I saw him put into his right hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him the watch was not in his hand, was it. A. I did not perceive it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with that watch? A. He put it into his right hand waistcoat pocket, I still kept looking at him; I saw Kendrick put his hand down to his breeches, as if to feel for something; I judged then there was something amiss, I opened the front door, I heard Kendrick say he had lost his watch, I supposed they were acquaintances, I said your friend has got your watch in his right hand waistcoat pocket. Then he made his escape and ran away, and I followed after, by my following of him and the alarm of stop thief, he ran into a court in Golden Lane, where there was no thoroughfare; he returned, and I followed him with Mr. Kenrick up Golden Lane, I saw Prince the officer standing in the middle of the street he stopped him and took him into his house and searched him, I said you will find the watch in his right hand waistcoat pocket; I came away and a man a stranger that followed him as well as myself, we went up the court to search for the watch, we could find none, I returned and went home, I heard the watch was found, that is all know of my own knowledge except what I have heard.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010023"/>Q. Did you see the prisoner in Golden-lane on the 22d of October - A. Yes, the prisoner was running up Golden-lane towards Old-street; I saw a great mob, I heard the cry of stop thief, as I was in Golden-lane, I went to stop him, he up with his fist, he said you b - r I will knock you down if you offer to stop me; I collared him with my left hand and seized him with my other hand, we had a bit of a scuffle, I took him into my own house and searched him, I found nothing upon him but his knife. This pocket-book was just at my back door. I stopped him a great way from Arthur-street, where he started. The watch was found by Mr. Walden.</p>
               <p>MR. WALDEN. I am a corn-chandler, 64, Golden-lane; I heard the alarm of stop thief on the 22d of October; I believe, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner running down Turks-head court, he crossed Golden-lane, and went into Bannister-court where there was no thoroughfare, he returned in a very short time. I turned down that court to make a search, there we found nothing in the court; I afterwards went through my own house into my back yard. In Bannister court there is a wall about five feet high, and the paling about three feet; at the top of the wall the paling is not close, a person might put his hand through between the paling and the wall. I looked out of my own yard, and saw the watch lay behind the wall of Bannister-court; I went over my yard into that yard and picked it up, and went through my neighbour's house into the street again. I took the watch to Mr. Prince's house, the prosecutor Kendrick was there, I desired him to explain what kind of a watch it was, before I gave it to the officer; he described the name and the number, and the chain and seal answered to his description</p>
               <p>Q. to Prince. Have you got the watch - A. Yes, and the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew it to the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, and the chain and seal is mine, and the pocket book is mine; I believe it is in the same situation now as when I lost it.</p>

I had seen the watch not ten minutes before she came in; I had placed it over the bed when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday the 10th of October, the prosecutor made application to me, I went in search of the Prisoner, I found her at Wakefield-place Bunhill-row; I had the duplicates of the property in my hand, they were given me by

            , I shewed the Prisoner the duplicates, I asked her if she knew any thing of them? she replied, Yes I do, I asked her how she came to absent herself from the place so long? she replied, I had not got money to get them out, and I did not like to go near the place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she absented herself - A. It is rather better than a month that the things have been pledged, they were pledged on the 7th of September. I never found her till the 10th of October, she throwed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010025"/>herself into great confusion and said, I hope you will not hurt me, I told her I had nothing at all to do with it, I must take her before a magistrate, I examined Mrs. Wolfe's box, I found the hinges were taken off the lid.</p>
               <p>CHARLES TAYLOR. I am a pawnbroker, three gowns on the 8th of September, and a table spoon on the 23d of August were pawned at my shop; I know the prisoner came to the shop, but I cannot say she pawned them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason that I told her she could not go the box she well knew, there were two trunks of Gentlemen's linen upon the box, and that is the reason I gave her at the time. I unfortunately took in a person that had been backwards and forwards for nine months, she came out of the hospital and asked me to let her abide there till she got a place, she was the only person in the place that could have taken them out, there was a pair of candlesticks she took away from me. I gave her the money to take them out. I was away from home three weeks and a day, although they say it was a month.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the officer that you knew about the duplicates. - A.Because she told me that she had pledged the things. She said, she would give me a couple of guineas to replace the things; she did not give it me, and that was the reason of my going away.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. How long had she absconded from the place. - A. About a month.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any other person in the room. - A. No, not when I put my box there. When I went for my things there was another woman there once, she had only come to see her she was not going to stay; she never had any body to lodge with her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the prisoner ever tell you that there was any boxes on the top of your's. - A. There was a box at one time; when I went to look at my box she refused me. I said I would take hold of one side and she of the other, she would not do it; I offered to take it down many times, she would not let me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 29th of September, had you directed the prisoner to take any goods out of the ware-house to serve customers. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the three invoices that you gave him. - A. These are the three invoices that were given to me by the boy who made them out. I gave them to him and read them over to him; I gave the sheet and he laid the sheet. I gave him the goods myself corresponding to that invoice, previous to my giving him the goods. I told him to lay the wrapper or sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he call over the goods together to see that they corresponded to that invoice. - A. I counted over the goods. I gave him the invoice, he looked them over, and said, it was quite right; after he said, the goods were quite right; he looked over the invoice again, he observed, that one part of the goods were for Miss Abraham's, in Holborn; he said, Miss Abraham's did not like to receive her invoice unless it was sealed up. The boy took and sealed it and gave it to the prisoner; upon that the prisoner turned up the ends of the wrapper. And I mentioned to the boy that I should go up stairs. I left him in the act of folding up the wrapper; I then went up stairs to my lunch, leaving this boy, whom I had received a fortnight before from Christ's Hospital, and the prisoner together. I came down I should suppose in two minutes, I usually come down in ten minutes, but, I then came down in two minutes, and when I came down I saw the prisoner confused; from his manner alone, I was convinced that he was in the act of doing something he ought not. I went backwards into the accounting-house, I watched him through a square of glass from that place. Previous to that he had changed the wrapper, and these two pieces he had placed upon a hole in the wrapper. I observed that as I passed to the accompting-house, with respect to the wrapper I observed a hole in the wrapper; I observed it the moment I came down stairs, and I observed goods in the wrapper that ought not to be; that I did not place in the wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked through the pane of glass in the accompting-house. - A. Yes, I observed the man looked confused; I let him tie up the wrapper with the two pieces that ought not to be in; when he had tied it up I went forward and stopped him. I pointed to the hole and said, that he must be going to rob me, and that he must have turned round from the counter to take them down; this was another wrapper to what he had when I went up stairs. I opened it I found two pieces of printed callico in the wrapper, these are the two pieces: they are stamped fifty-six, they are paid for stamp duty fifty-six, and they are of the value of twenty-two-pence a yard; they would be worth 5 l. altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the patterns of the goods in the wrapper that you sent to your customers. - A. These are the precise style of the things that he was to take out; that is the pattern of the furniture; these prints were of scarlet ground; and the others were two pieces the colour of brown holland.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you charged him then, and said he was robbing of you. - A. I did, I took these two pieces out.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not immediately apprehend him. - A. I was hurt at the time because I had no reason to suspect him till that morning. I took these two pieces out. I went into the accompting-house and reflected upon it. He went out of doors, and again he came back I provided an officer and apprehended him.</p>

I said, I must go up. The prisoner said, he would wait for me. I went up leaving the prisoner alone; I came down the minute after Mr. Todd.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIS. I am a constable. These things were given to me by Mr. Todd, they have been in my care ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. To Prosecutors. I ask you whether he had taken it up before you stopped him. - A. I will not swear whether he had or not; I waited till he was in the net of taking it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How far were these things from him, supposing he was at the counter. - A. He must have turned round and taken them from a pile of goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not three feet from the place; nor neither had I the wrapper tied up; nor he never went into his accompting-house from the time he came down until I went out of the place.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not the charge. The charge is, you having taken these pieces of goods from the pile and putting them in the wrapper, in order to take them away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On Monday morning, the 23d of October, the prisoner came into my warehouse, when he saw me disengaged, he said, he had a few pounds to lay out in jewellery. The person that he had hitherto dealt with having offended him, and if I would serve him on the same terms he had been accustomed to buy he would give me the preference. In consequence of this I showed him such articles as he wished to buy; he looked out goods to the amount of 14 l. he then looked up to the clock, and said it is my breakfast hour, but observed, that business must be attended to in preference to eating and drinking. I then told him that my breakfast was ready and much at his service.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it. - A. About eight o'clock in the morning he breakfasted with me; we then returned to business; we had not been at business five minutes together before I observed one corner of this paper parcel under his coat. I immediately laid hold of him, desired him to walk up stairs, which he did; and immediately pulled from his breeches-pocket, the rings and the broach: he fell down upon his knees begging forgiveness; he then told me who he was. I sent for his father; an officer was sent for and he was taken into custody.</p>

I informed Mr. Wilson. I could not do it without an order from a magistrate. I searched him, there was no property on him; the property was taken before I came.</p>

I told him it was a neck-chain; he said, he would send me on board a tender.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the notes consist of. - A. Two two's and three one's, apparently bank of England notes. I put the cash into the notes and wrapped it up together to give to my book-keeper; on the next day I gave them to Mr Skinner, my book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the cash and notes you gave to Mr. Skinner were the same cash and notes you received of the prisoner. - A. I took out two half guineas and gave him a one pound note and a shilling for it. I am sure it was the same money; I am sure the five notes that I took of the prisoner I gave them to Skinner on the next day. I bid him put Taverner upon them, I gave him the five first, I saw him mark the outside one. I gave him the money and the five notes.</p>
               <p>WALTER SKINNER. Q. You are an agent to a salesman in Smithfield market. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the last witness Mr. Job Coles. - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving any notes of him. A. Yes; there were seven pounds put together which Mr. Cole gave me in the name of Taverner; and while I was making the entry he told me that he took two half guineas away from the guineas, he said, here is a one pound note and a shilling. I believe I wrote Mr. Cole's name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the notes that you received of Mr. Cole's independant of that one pound note.</p>
               <p>A. Two two pound notes, and three single one pound notes. I mark the outside of the five with the name of Taverner upon it; this is the outside note, I put twenty-eight upon it because I received it on the 28th; the next day I put nine on it. I marked the other four, upon the front Taverner and the day, the 29th being the day I marked them, these are the identical notes. I doubled them up and put them in a book which I keep for the business of Smithfield Market, which book was put in a small drawer and remained there till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the five notes. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner in Smithfield Market, on the 6th of October. - A. Yes, he came to enquire for Mr. Coles. Mr. Coles was just gone, he went to seek for him at the inn where the coach was going off into the country, he was in great anxiety to see him. He did not see him he came back; he told me he came about these notes which he understood Mr. Cole's had received of him. I recommended him to go to the bank, and told him that the notes were at the bank; he had nothing to apprehend if he could prove who he received them of. I told him they were forged notes; he told me that he had heard it in Smithfield Market; and that the clerks of the bank were after him. He declined going to the bank; he said, he could not say of whom he received them, if he was to die for it. He said, it would hurt his credit in the country; and people would talk a great deal about it in the country to his prejudice. I think he said, he had been arrested three times in a short period, he did not tell me upon what account. He said, he might have received them at Windsor Market, but, he did not know that he did received them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes after you received them. - A. I sent them to a banker's by a young man with other articles that I had received in payment.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you sent no other with the mark of Taverner upon it. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as to take this note in your hand, and tell me whether this is a forged note. - A. It is a forged one: the signatures are forged, it is not upon bank paper, it is a forgery throughout, there is no water mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other two one pound notes. - A. They are from the same plate as the first, they are also forged throughout; they have the same artificial hand-writing. And these two one pound notes are also forged throughout, they are also from one plate, and are fitted up with the same hand-writing as the one pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing wanting to compleat the two two pound notes. - A. Certainly one of the date are wanting in both the two's, the left hand date is left out in both<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010028"/>of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner give you any account in what manner he came by them. - A. He said, he received them at different times, these five notes; he said, he received his money in small sums; and in consequence of a banker failing in town he had hoarded up bank notes to carry to market; he could not give any account of having received them at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you serve that notice to the prisoner. - A. I did, it is a copy of a notice I sent him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I think the prisoner was first of all examined by the magistrate down in the country. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q.He came and surrendered himself to the magistrate did not he. - A. No, he did not, he was taken by Dowsett the officer, at Windsor Market.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated that in these notes there is no watermarks. - Q. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the paper-mark. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving any notes of the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, at the Horseshoe, near Warvil, in Berkshire. It is a month ago last Monday, I received a bank note of him for my master for two sheep I had sold him. I delivered that note to my master.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. I object to this.</p>
               <p>Court. It strikes me it is not admissable. I cannot couple crimes in this way: if the note had been produced and it proved to be of the same fabrication, then it might infer a dealing with the same machine that they were made of then there would have been a circumstance to couple it with this; if there had been any evidence to couple it with this, then I should have suffered it to have.</p>
               <p>PLATT KNIGHT. Q. You are a shoe-maker. - A. Yes, I lived at Alliport, at the time. I sold the horse to the prisoner and an orchard of grass; the poney was sold for four guineas, and the grass for three guineas and a half. He paid me a five pound note and a one pound note down in notes; this was in July, the day of the month I cannot say; I had no other note in my pocket, I carried them to Mr. Bovington, a currier, at Eaton, in Buckingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever apply to the prisoner for the amount of that note. - A. I did for the amount of the five pound note. Mr. Bovington sent to me that it was a bad note, I paid the amount of it. The prisoner went with me to Mr. Bovington; the prisoner said, he did not know where he took it; he promised to make it good, and he did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note shewn him. - A. No, it was stopped at the bank; he was told the note was stopped at the bank.</p>
               <p>MR. BOVINGTON. Q. You are a currier, living at Eaton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a five pound note any time in July last, of the last witness Mr. Knight. - A. I did I made an entry of it in my book, the book is here; 17th of July, No. 1676, taken of Mr. Knight, signed by Budd, drawn on the bank of England, dated August 13, 1808; the sum 5 l. paid to Messrs. Hull and Smith, bankers, Uxbridge Bank, on the 29th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any mark on it. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards say any thing to the prisoner respecting that note. - A. Yes, the prisoner said, he knew nothing at all of whom he took it; it was very hard for him to return the money, every body knew he was poor; when he could return the money he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, do you believe that to be the note that you received. - A. I have no knowledge whatever of the note; it corresponds in all respects with my entry. The person to whom I paid it is a quaker.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. LEE. Look at the five pound note, is that a genuine bank note. - A. It is a forged one. The one pound note real.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of what I am accused; I can only say, I took them in my trade as good notes, and so I passed them.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Great Wild-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 20th of October was your attention drawn to Mr. Davidson's premises - A. Yes; I found the bars of the cellar window were disturbed out of their places. It was about two o'clock in the morning after crying the hour of two, I came round where these bars were disturbed; I saw three men, one made towards me, the other crossed the street, and the other made up Queen-street, I went up Wild Passage into Drury-Lane, and came down Princes Court into Wild-street; I heard them talking and whispering together, with that I went into Drury Lane, where Tooney the watchman was; I gave him the alarm, and we both went together.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got with the watchman did you see any body in the cellar. - A. I heard them talk in the cellar; we sprang our rattles, that alarmed Mr. Davidson and others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the cellar. A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had you seen the cellar opened before you made the alarm. A. I did not see it open, I saw the bars raised about half an hour before I raised an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. By being in that state any one might fall through, it was in a dangerous state. A. It was ready for them to get in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the cellar flap that night. - A. I cannot say that I saw it shut, the flap of the cellar was fastened, I found the three bars wrenched off when I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in your cellar. - A. Yes, a great deal of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the wine been carried off. - A. Yes; there were three bottles they had left just close to the iron bars ready to be taken off; they were in the beer cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they had been removed from the wine cellar to the beer cellar. - A. Yes. There was one bottle the watchman found by the other watchman out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the watchman find it. - A. No; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any others removed. - A. No; this lamp was burning among some straw in my wine cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common burner from somewhere out of the street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These bars, where were they the night before. - A. They were nailed at both ends, they were placed close to the left hand side of the foredoor to let light in the cellar, that is the way they got in the cellar, by wrenching the bars off, the flap was remaining where it ought to be, only these three bars were wrenched up by which means persons could get down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this cellar part of your dwelling house. - A. Yes, made under the parlour of my dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is it in. - A.

               <p>Mr. Gurney. How lately before had you seen these bars secured. - A. I can swear that I had seen them secure at half after nine o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Q. to Tooney. Did you find the bottles; I found them at the door of oneside, one broke, and one sound just at the corner of the door, they had just been handed out of the street, we gave the bottle that was full to Mr. Davison, I saw my partner give it him. I do not know what became of the other that was broke.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the bottle the watchman gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to that bottle being yours. - A. No, I cannot. It is white wine, I have not tasted it, I missed white wine from my cellar, such a bottle as that is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Whether that is wine or vinegar you cannot tell. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Open the bottle and taste it. - A. It is mountain wine. There were four bottles of mountain wine in the cellar, they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence. I was very much intoxicated in liquor, going up Wild-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields, I tumbled through a hole, I fell upon my head which took my senses away, I did not know where I was till a parcel or people came round me, they told me I got into the place to rob it. If there was another man there I did not know it, he must be there before me, he might have broken into the cellar, he made his escape, if I had not known myself innocent I might have made my escape.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>- WALKER. I am a watch cap maker, I live at 39, Noble-street. On last Tuesday week, between eight and nine in the evening I was in Drury Lane; Mr. Squirrel the prosecutor, the prisoner and I were standing hearing a song, and while the woman was singing, Squirrel asked me to go and have something to drink, he asked the prisoner at the same time. I had never seen Squirrel or the prisoner before; we all walked on to Fleet-street; Mr. Squirrel took us to a house up a court, near Fetter-Lane, I do not know the sign, we went in the tap-room, had two pots of beer, sixpenny worth of gin and water, and four pipes of tobacco; Mr. Squirrel paid the reckoning. We all went away from that public house about a quarter after eleven; then we went into another public house in Chancery Lane, we had two glasses of gin each of us at the bar; we then crossed Holborn, and went to the Lamb, in Lamb's Conduit-street; we had a pot of beer there and half a pint of gin between four of us, it was about 12 o'clock when we got to the Lamb, we staid about half an hour there, from there we went towards Russel-Square, the prisoner asked the watchman the way to Somerstown. I said in the first part of the evening, I would see Mr. Squirrel, whom I understood to be a doctor home, he said he lived in Somer's-town. We crossed <placeName id="t18091101-45-crimeloc263">Tavistock-Square</placeName>

Mr. Squirrel said you are joking, after treating you in the evening. I said do not rob him, I want to see you home father. The prisoner struck Squirrel with a stick, when he demanded his money, and he threw the stick into the Duke of Bedford's nursery; Squirrel put his hand into his pocket, and gave him two half crowns and a sixpence. I saw that it was moon light as bright as day; he had the change at the Lamb. After the prisoner had got the money, he ran away, and I was alarmed; I went away, I followed the prisoner, he ran away, and I ran away; Mr. Squirrel followed us both, the prisoner was stopped as he was running, and I stopped by another watchman on the other side of the road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. I believe you are under bail, and were charged as a party in that robbery. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner said these words. - A. I heard somebody say, your life or your money; I then drew near, the old gentleman said, no, no, as you have had the pleasure of drinking all the evening with me, you would hardly do so by me. I saw one of the men rush a stick out of his hand, and he struck him over his hat, he hauled out his money, and gave it to the man. I did not see what money he had in his hand when the money was given, both these young men turned back and ran away together as hard as they could, and the old gentleman ran after them, I said are you robbed, he said you, and he would follow them if they killed him; as soon as I could blow my pistol off, I blew it in the air, and shouted out, stop thief, the patrol stopped him in Russell-Square.</p>

            . I am a patrol, on this Tuesday night I was in Russell-Square, near half past twelve, it was very near the corner of Russell-Square, near Woburn Place, Hoskins came and asked me what Square that was, I told him Russell-Square. I said where do you want to go to, Squirrel answered to Somer's-town. I pointed down Woborn Place, I said, keep strait on there, that is the street road, the prisoner said, I know my way; in about twenty minutes after that, I heard the voice of a man say, follow them, stop them, and I heard the report of a pistol, it was very light, I could see the men run towards me, I saw the prisoner Hoskins. I stood in the middle of the road with my stick in my hand, Hoskins made a strong push to go by me, I catched him by the collar, I said if he offered to move I would cleave him to the ground, he answered, I have not a farthing of money about me, it is not me, the other lad crossed the road, another watchman was there, I said, lay hold of him, he did, Mr. Squirrel and the watchman came up, Squirrel pointed to the prisoner in his face while I held him, and said, that is the man that robbed me, I took him to the watch-house, they were searched, nothing was found on them. The prosecutor was called, and not appearing in Court, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday evening I was returning home from my work, when I came to Drury-Lane, I stopped to hear a song sung, Mr. Squirrel was talking with Walker. Squirrel asked me if I would go to Covent-Garden Theatre, he asked that young man at the same time; I declined going because his intention was to kick up a row in the house, he said if there should be an harm come of it he would give us bail, he insisted upon our going to have something to drink with him. We went into Fleet-Street, he called for gin and beer, he paid for it in Chancery-Lane, we had two glasses each of us, we went to the Lamb, in Lamb's Conduit-street, there we had more gin and beer; what happened afterwards I cannot tell, I was entirely intoxicated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

The prisoner came to my house on the 7th of October, between five and six in the evening; he said he wanted a single room for him and his property. I told him I had no room; I told him I would go out and get him a bed. I went out to the public house, and left him in my parlour with my wife and my sister; I returned, told him I could get no lodging for him. I went out again to get a lodging for him, and when I came back, from information, I seized him and took him to the watchhouse on the charge of stealing my watch. He said in the watchouse that he had not stolen it, he only took it to show it my wife at the door.</p>
               <p>MARY BONISH. While my husband went to get a bed for this man, he sat down in my nursing chair; my servant saw him take the watch down; she is not here, she will not come. I sent the servant to fetch my sister, because I thought this man took too much liberty in siting in my nursing chair. There was a piece of work opposite of my door, the prisoner put his hat on and asked me what was the matter; the servant then said what watch is that you took. I pushed him in, and took the watch out of his right hand waistcoat pocket. I asked him what he took my husbands watch for, he said he was coming to shew me what o'clock it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Few go at that time - A. No, when I went away I left the different articles in the indictment secure; I left a quantity of linen in a drawer. In one of my bed rooms I left a quantity of sheets and table linen; in a closet in the prisoner's room there was a trunk locked up, containing linen of mine, and muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any spotted muslin - A. Yes, I have found two caps since made out of that muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any wine of any particular sort - A. Yes, gooseberry and currant wine in a closet in the breakfast parlour; I left that locked up. I returned from Brighton on the 20th of September. In the evening I found the closet and the side-board broke open; the closet in the parlour where the currant wine was, was broke open, which I had left locked; the brass-work was filed off. I missed a pair of fine sheets marked G. and a Lancashire sheet marked G. Y. I then called the prisoner, and told her I had found the drawers open, and missed the linen; and asked her if she knew any thing of it; she appeared very much confused, and trembled.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this the day you came home - A. No, three days afterwards. She said she knew nothing of it, there had no one been in the house since I left home. I told her I had found the closet open in her her room, and the wine closet open in the parlour; she denied any knowledge of there being open. In the closet in her room, there were three whole pieces of dimity on a shelf; I found they had been cut; I measured them over, thirteen yards were cut from one piece, and six yards from another. I desired her to look every where for the linen, as I had left her in care of the house. Then she said she had her sister and a Captain Hamilton to see her in the house, but they took nothing away with them. I told her that she had wine from the closet; she said that she had one bottle from the closet, but she found the closet open. I let it pass then for a week or more, hoping that she would bring the things. On the second of October she was taken up; she denied any knowledge of the things till the last. After she was gone, I found two caps in her box, made of the muslin which was locked up in the closet in her room; I have had them ever since; these are the caps; I missed half a yard of spotted muslin. I know the muslin, and I know these caps are made out of that spotted muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of that muslin - A. About two shillings. I have not recovered any of my other things, excepting a mattrass.</p>
               <p>JOHN FEW. I am the husband of the last witness. On the 16th of September I went to Brighton; I had all the keys in the house under one key. I missed about a dozen of currant wine, and two dozen of gooseberry; the back rows were cleared, and without getting up in a chair I could not see. It was either taken from the back-row, or from the front, and the back-rows forwarded; a bottle of cherry-bounce was drawed out and filled up with something else. I examined all the locks before I left town, every one was safe. I know no more than my wife has told you.</p>

            . Q. You are a servant to Mr. Few - A. Yes, I was left in the house when they went to Brighton. I know nothing about the wine or the linen. The prisoner's friends were there, there was Mr. Hamilton and her two sisters, and two more men, I do not recollect their names; the men were all seafaring men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any wine - A. I saw wine drank, I do not know where it came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced it - A. The prisoner I believe. I did not see her - I do not know - I never heard where it came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any of the wine - A. Yes; it was currant wine that I drank.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Have you got the caps here - A. Yes, there is some of the prisoner's lace tacked to it; I have no doubt but the muslin is my property; I never gave it to the prisoner or any body else.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence. The muslin that I made them caps of, I bought before my mistress went to Brighton, and I made the caps, while she was there; when my mistress returned from Brighton, every thing appeared to be very comfortable; she was at home eight or nine days before she called me up stairs, and told me that she had missed some linen. I was very much astonished, and frightened, to hear that she had lost any thing. She said, if I would confess if any body had led me astray, she would let me go about my business. I told her I was innocent, and therefore I could not tell her. My mistress had a good character with me.</p>

In consequence of information from the last witness I went into the bale room, I found a coat deposited between two bales, I opened the coat, there were seven banks of silk in it, the same sort of silk as were in the Bengal warehouse. I called the prisoner into the office after the men were discharged; he was searched, nothing was found on him; I went up stairs to where the coat was deposited; I brought the coat down, and asked him if he knew any thing of the contents of Feathers's coat. He said, he did not. I said, do you mean to tell me you did not ask Lloyd for Feathers's coat. He said, it was at the request of Feathers that he should take care of it.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and I live next door to Mr. Taylor's house. About half past twelve, on Sunday the 22d of October, I heard a noise, I looked up, I saw the prisoner upon the house, as I was washing myself on the landing place of the garret; I saw the prisoner opening the garret window of Mr. Taylor's house, he was opening it on the outside, in the gutter. On my seeing him, I was going to rap at him; I recollected what Mr. Taylor said the Friday before, and hearing that Mr. Taylor lost so many things, I did not do it. I pulled off my shoes; I put one leg on the bannister of the stairs, and the other in the chair, and looked through my sky-light; I saw him open the window and get in; he had something in his hand, but what he cannot say. When I saw him get in the window, I ran down stairs and asked a woman in the same house, if her husband was at home; she said not. I said, Mr. Taylor's house is being robbed; she unlocked her garret door, it looks into this gutter. I watched for his coming out as much as ten minutes; then a man of the name of Franks came in. He said, Mr. Hall put your shirt on, you will catch cold; I went to finish washing myself; he holloed out, Mr. Hall, he has a bed on his arm. I directly ran to the window; Franks got out of the window after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see at any place where he was, whether he had any bed with him - A. I could not see; I saw a bed there afterwards lay in the gutter, close by Taylor's window, opposite of my own sky-light. I tried to get out of my door, and my wife cried out, he has got in his brother-in-law's window; the next house in Warwick Square. His brother-in-laws name is Crosley.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person get from Crosley's garret window, to Mr. Taylor's garret window - A. Yes, they communicate to each other by the gutter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010033"/>Q. Did you know the prisoners person before that day - A. Never before that day, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he was the man that you saw in the gutter, and that went into Mr. Taylor's house - A. I am certain that is the man I saw get into Mr. Taylor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he was within your observation - A. About two or three minutes in getting in, and then he looked about him before he went into Mr. Taylor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a view of him two or three minutes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he looked about to see if he was observed - A. Yes, and he looked down into Mr. Taylor's room. When we took him he was undressed, we found him under a dresser in the kitchen below.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he is coat and waistcoat off - A. Quite undressed. It was about two o'clock when we found him; I gave the alarm; they refused opening the door at Crosley's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you break the door open - A. No, they opened the door after some time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the dresser conceal him from you - A. Yes, there is a door that opens underneath; he was concealed entirely under the dresser. His brother-in-law denied him very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his brother-in-law deny him being there in the room where he was - A. Yes; he denied it all through.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you laid hold of him - A. I stopped till he was dressed. I said, my friend you have not got the same clothes on now, as you had before; then he bursted out a crying. I asked him whether he saw me through the the sky-light - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>MR. GLEED. What window is that the prisoner in it - A. That is a casement window; he was trying to open the window for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. This house was under repair - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on Sunday. You do not know of your own knowledge about the fastening of the window - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw him trying to open the window some time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the window was sufficiently closed, to exclude any person from getting in - A. Yes, the window was shut to.</p>

            . Q. Do you live in the house with Mr. Hall - A. Yes I do, it is next door to Mr. Taylor's. On Sunday the 22d of October, I came home about twenty minutes to one; when I came up stairs, my brother's wife informed me there were thieves in Mr. Taylor's house; I got out of the garret window.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from Mr. Taylor's window - A. About eight or ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Taylor's garret window open at that time - A. Yes, I watched out of the window in the same room where Mr. Hall was. I saw a man coming out with a bed; he got the bed entirely out of window; I got of the window as well as I could.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see who the man was that got out with the bed - A. The prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of the bed at the time that you first got sight of him - A. Yes he had, he was pulling it out of the window, there was no other person with him, he was alone. I got out of the window after him; in the time I was getting out, he ran towards me - I was getting out as fast as I could - he run over the houses - I lost sight of him - he left his shoe behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lose sight of him - A. Only just as he turned round the chimney and jumped into a window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him get into the window - A. No I came back again; I lost sight of him; I heard Mr. Hall sing out that the thief had got in at the window; then I turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, that the prisoner is the man that you saw come out of Mr. Taylor's window - A. I am quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him before - A.Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to that window where Mr. Hall told you he get in - A. No, I went down below.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose window was that which Mr. Hall said he went in - A. That is his brother-in-laws, Mr. Crosley's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Crosley's house immediately - A. I did, he refused opening the door; I told him what I wanted; they said they were sure he did not come in there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you got admission to go into Crosby's house - A. I told him I wished to go in then, he did let me in, and I went up to look for the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there - A. No I returned, and when he was found, I was fetched to know whether I knew the prisoner, I was sure at that time, that he was the man, he was the very man, I said so - then he was putting on clean linen; when I saw him he was shifting himself, he was secured, and the bed was carried into Mr. Taylor's house.</p>

            . I am Mr. Taylor's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in this house on the Sunday - A. No I was not, I was in the neighbourhood. A man came and informed me that Mr. Taylor's house had been robbed, I went to Mr. Taylor's house; when I got there I saw Mr. Thrash and Mr. Hall, they shewed me the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what part of the house the bed was in before - A. No; they told me that the man had got in Mr. Crosley's window; I went and fetched Peppercorn the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you fetched Peppercorn, had you made any application at Crosley's to get in the house - A. Yes, they would not admit me, they said there was no man in the house. When I brought the constable then they admitted us.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the man was found - A. I found him under the dresser.</p>
               <p>MR. PEPPERCORN. I am a constable; I applied for admission at Crosley's house, they opened the door for me. After we had searched the house more than an hour, I said, certainly he is here. They said he was not. I was looking at his clothes in the yard, that he had on; Jolm German called out master I have found him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010034"/>Q. Was he charged with having taken the bed - A. Yes; he said he was not the person. He had nothing on when we dragged him out of this place, but a ragged shirt and a blanket wrapped about him. I took him to the counter, and his brother-in-law for secreting him, the bed is here.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have had the bed in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that bed. - A. Yes; I believe it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your bed. - A. Yes it is.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before your house was robbed had you seen the bed. - A. I saw it on Saturday, and locked the door myself and locked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home on the Sunday you found the lock had been forced. - A. Yes, and likewise the garret window, I found the hook broken in two that hooked it close.</p>
               <p>Q. This bed you say was not kept in the garret. - A. No, in the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your bed. - A. Three pound, it is an old bed, I have had it about a year and half, I bought it second hand.</p>
               <p>Q. I am to understand you, that you had not abandoned the house, you meaned to return there as soon as the house had undergone the repair, to make it fit to live in. - A. Yes; It was an external repair, all the goods were in the house, the master carpenter had one key and I the other, and I have returned there again.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to the counsel, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Who has the custody of the key of the cellar. - A. It is always kept by Mrs. Hart or myself; on the second of October I counted the bottles of rum, seventy-four in number; I then locked the cellar door, and locked up the key of the cellar in a cupboard, in my parlour, where it usually had been kept. I placed the key upon the shelf in the closet, with the ring of the key flat on the shelf, and marked the precise spot where the key was with a pen strait line where the ring of the key was, in order to ascertain whether the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010035"/>cellar was opened by a false key, or the closet, I left town on the third, and returned again on the sixth. On my return, I went to the closet and found the key had been removed from the position. It was out of the marks, I put it in, and the ring of the key laid upwards, It had been moved, I was convinced that the access to the cellar was not by a false key; yesterday on examining it, I found the mahogany slab had been wrenched up, and by inserting a hand into the closet, the key might be taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you visit your cellar afterwards. - A. I did, I can speak positively to one bottle of rum being gone.</p>

I then said it was very strange that a young man should be in her bed, she said it was her bed, but not the bed that she slept in, I said, I am satisfied in this bed two people have slept in, I will search all the beds, Wood searched the man, and I the woman, we went down into the kitchen, and on searching the pantry, we found part of a bottle of rum, I asked the woman how she got that rum, she said she purchased it, it was more than an hour before we had done searching, I found a number of keys, we were trying to see if we could unlock any of the locks in the house, and after I had finished the search, I said, Cook, as you purchased the rum, you can tell me the person you bought it of, Oh! no, said she, it was given me. The man and woman was left there, I took the rum away, and went to Mr. Witton's to get a servant to take care of the house, I returned, and the man I took in custody first, the woman afterwards. The man said, he could have made his exit from the house the week before, for Mrs. Hart had told the cook that there were two officers coming to search the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of October I went to Mr. Hart's house, in company with Trott, we went up to the garret, and there Radley was laying in bed, I searched the garret, there were some of his own wearing apparel, there, I searched the drawer in the kitchen, there were two coats, some fiddle strings, and two fiddles laying upon the dresser, which he owned, Mrs. Witton's cook took possession of the house, and was left in care of the woman, the man was taken on that day,

               <p>Q. In consequence of any application made to you, did you attend upon the prisoners - A, I attended upon both the prisoners, in consequence of an application made by the prisoners to Mr. Hart, respecting their clothes; I asked both the prisoners whether I should deliver their clothes to them, or to the person who made application to Mr. Hart for them. Both the prisoners said I was to deliver them to the person that was with me, their friend, he was present at that time; I believe he is here. There were some conversation passed between Radley and me about the two shirts, that were found in the prisoner Smith's box. I asked him if he knew who he had them off. He said that he had them of a gentleman that was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver up to them the property that was found in the prisoner Smith's box - A. Yes, all except the two shirts I delivered to the person they called their friend.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 18th of October, me and Branscomb were coming out of Old Bethlem; I stopped him and asked going down Bishopsgate-street, we met the prisoner him what he had got there; he said some carpeting, he was going to take it to No. 60, Rosemary-lane, to an upholsterer. I told him I did not think there was any upholsterer lived there; I asked him whose it was; he said his master's his master lived in Worship-street; about twenty yards he stopped and said, I might carry it myself; then I said I would take him to the compter; then he said he would carry it. When we got into Worship-street, he wanted to throw it into a place, he would not carry it any further; he would not tell who his master was, he said we might find it out. The next day he told us that he lived along with Mr. Loader; we sent to Mr. Loader, he swore to the property.</p>

I told him it was my property. The prisoner had been at my shop before she went to Mr. Bennett's. One of my young men is not here.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BENNETT. I am a linen draper, No. 6, Cannon-street road. On the 30th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, she bought half a quarter of muslin; she looked at another sort, and bought half a quarter of that; she paid for them, then she looked at a half shawl, and left sixpence on it, and was going out of the shop; in the mean while she was purchasing these goods out, secreted 26 yards of Callico; I stopped her going she gave up the 26 yards that she stole off the counter. I told her she should be searched; she was, in her pockets we found eight yards of book muslin. I went for Mr. Kyle, he came and saw the muslin, and said it was his own.</p>

The prosecutor said he would not go to any house with me, he said he had not much silver about him, what he had he would give me, he gave me the half crown out of his pocket, telling me to give him eighteen pence out of it; I gave him sixpence out of it. I left him and went down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010037"/>In company with several girls after he was with me. This young man, Shaffen, lived in the same house where I was; I had been in company with gentlemen before. I had eight shillings and nine pence in the whole; I gave it to this young man, he said he would take it home for me. The prosecutor went into the wine vaults in Greek street, again to treat me.

               <p>RALPH GARRETT. I live at 60, Clipstone-street, Marylebone. On the 25th of October, as I was going home, I met the prisoner at the corner of York-street, about 12 o'clock at night. She said, Sir, as it is a jubilee night, will you give me a glass of brandy. I told her on that account I had no objection; I give her a glass of brandy, and had a glass of ale myself; when we came out, she entreated me to walk up into her room, No. <placeName id="t18091101-58-crimeloc345">2, York-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18091101-58-crimeloc345" type="placeName" value="2, York-street"/>

                        targets="t18091101-58-off343 t18091101-58-crimeloc345"/>; without hesitation I did walk up, I had no sooner got into the room, than I took my watch in order to wind it up. She took it out of my hand, and said she would wind it up; she went with it into the bed room; I was upon the sofa; she returned in a few minutes; I asked her for my watch, I wished to go home. She said if I made any noise there about my watch, she would bring some people that would settle me. I took the candle in my hand and went down stairs to call the watchman; on my opening the door, a man appeared at the door; I asked him if he was a watchman, he said yes. I told him to take charge of the girl. He said, open the door again, there is a constable behind, let him in, we will do the business more effectually. I opened the door again, and several now came in, and they shoved me out into the street. They were neither of them watchmen. One of them was an hackney coachman, and the other an assistant, or something of the kind; they are on bail for the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch - A. No, I went to Marlborough street office in the morning, and went with an officer to the house; the landlady informed me, that she went out immediately after I was gone, and had never came home since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the woman - A. Yes, I am sure she was the person, I was sober.</p>
               <p>PHENEY PARKER. I keep the house in York-street, where the prisoner lived. I saw this gentleman coming down stairs with the candlestick in his hand. I said, if you please to give me the candlestick I will light you down; he would not give it me. When he called the watch in came four hackney coachmen, I believe they were, two I know were, they pushed him out and shut the door; the prisoner went out soon after. I never saw her again, till I saw her at Marlborough-street; she was taken the night following.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the men - A. They pushed the gentlemen out and then they went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge, I never saw any thing of the watch, nor a farthing of his money; he was not in my premises ten minutes.</p>

On Monday the 30th of October, about eight o'clock at night, I went up to bed, and the prisoner went to bed at the same time; I put my money in the box, and he held the candle, there were two one pound notes, a seven shilling piece, and some silver, I locked my box; the next morning I got up about half past three o'clock; I returned on Tuesday evening about six o'clock; I heard the prisoner was gone; I went up stairs to look at my box, the staple was drawn out, my money, notes, and clothes, were all gone. On Wednesday, I found the prisoner between Hadley and Potters-bar. I laid hold of him, I told him he had robbed me. He said he had. I afterwards found some of my things in a hollow tree, the prisoner shewed me the tree. I have never seen my money or notes since.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the neighbourhood when this took place - A. I was in about the middle of Holborn-row, proceeding towards Great Queen-street, I heard the cry of stop thief; I heard the footsteps of some person running, in the course of a minute I looked to my left hand; near the railing which incloses the garden I distinctly perceived a man running as fast as possible; I kept my eyes on him, I saw him stop and sit down on the curb stone by the rails. I approached him together with five or six others. The prisoner then said, what have I done where is the gentleman that said I robbed him. The prosecutor with several others, were calling out stop thief on the pavement of Holborn-row; they came up to the place where we were standing. I with several others, said here is the man; the prosecutor came and charged the prisoner with picking his pocket of his watch, and laid hold of him by the collar; the prisoner denied it, and said they might search him; the prosecutor took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SNAP. I am a hatter, I live in South Audley-street. Last Friday evening between six and seven o'clock, I was near to the end of Great Queen-street, near to the piazzas, I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran to where the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner; the prosecutor said he had lost his watch, and that the prisoner had stole it. I returned to Queen-street and transacted my business, and when I came out, I went to where the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner; I looked for this watch, I found it close again the railing upon the curb stone, near to where I first saw the prosecutor; I went to Bow-street, and shewed the watch to Mr. Graham. I have kept the watch ever since.</p>

I was coming from Queen-street, close by the rails, when I heard the cry of stop thief. One exclaimed, that is the man that robbed that gentleman. I immediately asked who I had robbed, and what I had stole;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010039"/>the prosecutor immediately came up, and said I had robbed him of his watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Castle-Baynard Ward; I was going down the Old-Change, Mr. Hudson called, watchman, he said, you take charge of this woman, she has robbed me of ten one pound notes, he said he did not know what he had lost, I conveyed her to the watch-house, the constable searched her, he found a one pound note in her hand, 6 s. 6 d. in her pocket, and on searching further, he found five one pound notes on her person.</p>
               <p>Mr. WYAT. I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, the prosecutor said she had robbed him of ten one pound notes, I asked her if she had got them, she said she had not, I saw that she had something in her hand, as if she intended to burn it, I caught hold of her hand and took a one pound note out of it I found 6 s. 6 d. in her pocket. I told her to pull off her gown, she did, and flannel round her middle, there was nothing there, she sat herself down again; she said do you think it was concealed before me. I laid her across my lap, and took five one pound notes from her person, the prosecutor said he was robbed of his watch as well as the money. I said the girl has not the watch, I have made a proper search, he said the number of the notes were from 31 m. 9 to 31 m. 22, the one that she had in her hand was 31 m. 9, and the last of the numbers that I looked at was 31 m. 22.</p>
               <p>Jury Q. to Prosecutor. You stated that where you were robbed was in the Old Jewry, the watchman states that it was in the Old Change. - A. I know no more than what I understood the watchman to say. I was intoxicated, I find I am wrong: I was going into St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was just come out of the Borough, as I was crossing over the way, this gentleman was laying down, he holloed out for me to come over, as I came over I picked up the papers, not knowing what they were. I kept them, as any other person might have done; he was in a very indecent manner, he hollowed out for the watchman. I said, what I have picked up, I will not give you. You may rely on that is the truth, if I was to die this moment.</p>

            , I am a constable. On Wednesday night, the 25th of October, between eleven and twelve, near the top of Cornhill, I heard the prosecutor challenge the prisoner with picking his pocket. I went to his assistance, the prosecutor took from his left hand a dollar. I took the prisoner with the assistance of my brother officer to the Poultry Compter; we searched him and found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no mark on this dollar, I took it of Mr. Lucas, the commodore of the river fencibles, I being a river fencible myself, it was a very bright one. I am certain I lost a dollar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you my Lord, I am a man that has three children, I work very hard to maintain them. I have work of my master's at home upwards of twenty pounds worth of property. I went out that evening to shew my wife and family the sight, I shewed them the India-house and the bank; and on my return I was stopped by this man. I had a hole in my pocket, I lost eight-pence worth of half-pence. I took the dollar out it was snatched out of my hand. A publican gave me two crown pieces, and seven shillings worth of half-pence in change.</p>
               <p>Q. To CUTLER. Did you search him. - A. Yes, we found no hole in his pockets.</p>

            . I told Boucher I was sorry but I had reason to believe he had something that he should not have. I unbuttoned his coat and waistcoat, the frill of his shirt was pinned, when it was unpinned then the nutmegs appeared; I found 2 lb. 9 oz. of nutmegs between his shirt and his skin. He said, he was very sorry; it was the first time. I have had the nutmegs ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nutmegs in the warehouse where he was at work, had you not. - A. We had. I went to No. 12, Off-Alley, in the Strand, I found a woman there, he said it was his wife; she seemed alarmed and fell down as if in a fit behind the door, and there I found a nutmeg bag, and a bag of cloves. These are the nutmegs I found on his person; they are like those that were in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is the first time that ever I was accused of a thing in my life. I sat down behind a chest and fell asleep, when I got up this person followed me, and said you have something that you ought not to have. He opened my bosom and found them there, it was unknown to me, nor was it caused to be done by me; there was an animosity between him and me before. I know nothing of this charge.</p>

               <p>Taylor's Defence. As I was coming along Bishopsgate-street, there was a crowd on the pavement by St. Helen's. I saw the book on the pavement I took it up; this gentleman and two more followed me, and accused me of taking the pocket book, in the flurry I dropped it.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I was going to the West India Dock, I had a newspaper in my hand reading of it, and when I got into the court I was reading of it. I immediately turned round my head, I saw three men lay hold of this young man; I was fifty yards a head, I turned back with the newspaper in my hand, and when I came to the people that had hold of this man, Steven's laid hold of me, and said I was one of them. He snatched the newspaper out of my hand; he asked the gentleman if it was his newspaper, the gentleman said it was not, he gave it me back again.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I did not snatch the newspaper out of his hand, I asked Christian if it was his property. There were three of them together going down St. Helen's, one of them got away.</p>

               <p>Q. I understand there is a benefit society held in your house. - A. Yes, of portable desk makers and cabinet small workers, it is called the Amicable Society: the club box was kept in a room adjoining the club room, the prisoner lodged on the same floor in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys were there to this box. - A.Three, they were kept by the two stewards and the president.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the club held for the last time previous to the loss. - A. October the 4th, the club was held. On Monday morning, about ten o'clock, I heard an alarm of the box being broken open. I went to the room where the box was and found this box broken open at the bottom. I informed the members of the society, they came and made a search. They found the box broken open at the bottom,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010042"/>and twenty-seven pounds, four shillings, and eight-pence half-penny, were taken out, and a quantity of books; upon discovering the loss one of the members had the prisoner taken up. I was present he was taken in his own room. The drawer was found in his room. The prisoner said a man gave him the drawer in the back yard to mend, on Saturday night, and the same man had some books under his arm; and a partition of the box was found in the prisoner's tool chest. On Saturday night I could not get into the room where the club box was, I bursted the door open, about a quarter of an hour after that I went into the room again; I found the key in the door, then nobody else had gone up but one of my maids.</p>
               <p>Q. From the situation of the prisoner's room could he have gone into that room. - A. Yes, his door is not half a yard from the door of that room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not there company in the room on Saturday night. - A. Yes, that was after the key was lost.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PARE. I am one of the stewards of the Amicable Society of small workers and desk makers. The society was held at Mr. Pridley's, our club box was kept there. On Wednesday the 4th of October, I was officiating for my brother steward, I had two keys and Mr. Gaze, had the other, I locked two of the locks, and he or I locked the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing the matter with the box at that time. - A. No to the best of my knowledge there was not, if the bottom had been broken open at the bottom, the drawer would have fallen out. The contents of the box was twenty-one pound bank notes, and there were the books of the society, near forty, the notes were placed in one of the drawers on the Wednesday. On the Monday I was called upon by one of the members, the box was broken at the bottom and all the notes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. The money in that box was the property of all you members. - A. Yes, the stewards and president are answerable for it. When I came there on the Monday, I saw some books and bank notes taken out of the privy, the notes we have recovered as far as sixteen of the number of the notes.</p>

I assisted in finding the books in the necessary; we got sixteen of the notes out of the twenty, the notes were secreted in the books: not knowing the notes were in them they were throwed down the necessary. The hard cash to the amount of seven pound was all gone except the half-pence, these are the sixteen one pound notes.</p>

I fitted it to the box, it corresponded. I took him in custody; he said the man that gave him the box had a number of books in his hand; he said that he would call for the drawer on Monday; the prisoner said he told the man he did not see it wanted any repair. I told him as a workman he must see it wanted repair. I took him to the watch-house and searched him.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury, the evidence that has come before you, I hope you will not think fit to convict a man of felony. On Saturday night, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I went out at the back door to case myself, and on my going up again I met a man, who had a drawer in his hand and some books under his arm; the stair case being so dark I could not see what they were, it is a great misfortune to me gentlemen, as you are not able to see the stair-case; and there are several lodgers in the house as well as me, and the door is always open which makes the stair-case almost public to any one; that person asked me if I was a cabinet maker and lodged in the second floor? I said no, I was a cabinet maker and lodged in the first floor; he asked me to mend the drawer; I took it up in my room and found it did not want mending. My wife informed me on the Monday morning, that the club room box was broken open. They searched my room all over and found nothing there. They took me to the office and searched me, and my wife was at the office, they went and broke open my door and brought out boards, which I am sure were not in the room before</p>

On Sunday the 29th of October, the prisoner expressed a wish to go to bed? as usual, I offered him a candle to go to bed. A quarter before eleven o'clock he did go up stairs, as I supposed, to his own room. About half past eleven he came down stairs; I was sitting in the kitchen; I asked him what brought him down stairs at that time of the night, he said he had occasion to go the necessary. He unbolted the back door of the house; I had fastened it with three strong bolts. He went into the yard and into the privy; he stopped so long I took the candle to examine, and found he was gone; and he had opened the back-door that was bolted with one bolt. I directly suspected all was not right, his getting out in that clandestine manner. I fastened the door, and went up to the room allotted for him.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday morning last, in the county of Surry. I challenged him with stealing two watches and a coat, which he denied; he said the clothes he had on belonged to him. I told him, I thought the coat did not belong to him; he said if it was not his coat, it was one he put on instead of his own; he came away in a ltarry. I had no information of any thing but the coat and the watches. I asked him where he bought the breeches; he said he had not bought them lately, he had them some time. I did not take the breeches nor the stockings away, only the coat. I sent for the prosecutor, he identified the coat, and saw the prisoner with these breeches and stockings on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing of the watches - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gordon. Is that your coat - A. Yes, and the breeches and stockings are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave his own coat behind - A. No; he not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know whether I left my own coat behind or not. I was in liquor when I left the house, and the next morning I found them things <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> went to get a ship to go to sea at the West India Docks, not getting a ship there, I intended to go down to Portsmouth to get one.

            . On the evening before the jubilee I went with Mr. Hancock to Griffiths's house, in Black Boy-alley, and just as we got to Griffiths's door there was something thrown out of the window; Johnson, the evidence, said there is the lamp thrown out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked it up - A. Mr. Hancock, and the wax taper they threw out. I went up stairs, and saw Griffiths and his wife in the room.</p>

            . On the 24th of October, in the evening, from information I received from the prisoner King, when he was brought to the office, I then went and searched Johnson's father's place in Leather-lane. His father told me the most likely place to find him would be in Fox-court. I went there, and after a little while a woman went to fetch me Coleman. I asked Coleman where Johnson was, he told me he saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010044"/>awhile before near Chick-lane. On my way to Chick-lane I met Johnson; Coleman said, that is your man. I took Johnson into custody and searched him, and found upon him near a shillingsworth of halfpence. I took Johnson and Coleman to the Royal Oak, and then I went to Griffiths; he lives in Black Boy alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they both go by the name of Griffiths - A. So far as I know: I fancy they both lived together. It is a dark alley, and the woman was sitting at the window. When I asked Johnson which was the house, Johnson told me that I should find the man with her. I run up stairs, and they were at supper together. I asked her where the lamp was that the lad had sold her. I asked Johnson who was the person, he pointed out the woman; she denied any knowledge of him, she had not bought any thing of him. At that time the man also denied any knowledge of him. After searching the room, I sent the last witness for a large candle. Opposite to the prisoner Griffiths's house there is a large yard that, I believe a slaughter-man keeps, and a number of sheep were there. There is only a small paling parts the house, and the yard and a low paling parts the yard from the alley. On my searching there, I found the lamp I now produce, and this taper-stand; it was opposite the window where this woman sat in this yard. I suppose the lamp falling on the sheep's back broke the fall, because only part of the foot was broken off.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cole. Look at that wax taper-stand - A. I will take upon me to swear that this is Mr. Fontaine's, it is of the value of 2 s. 4 d. The glass lamp has no mark; I must decline swearing to it; we lost such a one; I believe it is his. At six o'clock there were two in the window, I missed one, it is worth 6 d.</p>
               <p>King's Defence. I was coming past the window on Tuesday; Johnson was standing at the stationer's window, next door. I picked the candlestick up; he said, make haste, follow me. When I got to the corner of Middle-row I lost him. The shopman laid hold of me</p>
               <p>Coleman was not put on his defence.</p>
               <p>Griffiths and Buckthorpe left their defence to their counsel; called six witness, who gave them a good character.</p>

On the 13th of October, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to be measured for a pair of shoes; he said he came from Mr. Patterson's, at the corner of St. Martin's Lane, that he wished to look at some shoes, and I had better send him some strong ones, and some light ones, then he could take his choice; I looked out four pair and sent the boy along with him. In about five minutes, he returned and said two pair of the shoes fitted, and Mr. Patterson wished to look at a pair of boots; I gave him one boot and told him if that fitted Mr. Patterson he should have the other in a few minutes; he went away, and I saw no more of him till I saw him in the watch-house; this was on the Friday. On the Saturday week following he was taken to the watch-house on some other business. I am sure he is the man, he sent to me that he would pay me for the value of what I lost if I would not prosecute him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On my going up Back Hill, at Mr. Page's shop, I discovered some shoes for sale, I fetched my father to ascertain whether they were our goods, we went into Mr. Page's shop, and by the advice of Mr. Page we waited a little while, he said the man had been there before, and most likely would come again. On the 14th of October Mr. Page came to me between eight and nine in the evening, he informed me, that the man was at his shop, pledging or selling a pair of shoes; I immediately went with Mr. Page to his house, where I discovered old Shipley. I took him in custody, and by the assistance of a watchman he was taken to the watch-house. On Sunday morning I, accompanied with Mr. Adkins, went to Shipley's lodgings, there I found two pair of my shoes, we took up young Shipley and asked him where he got the shoes, he said he got them from

We went and apprehended Carter at his uncle's at Peckham; we told him we should search his father's lodgings; we asked him if there was any property there, he said there was in his box and some of it had been stolen for two years ago, and that he had been in the habit of stealing from that time through the instigation of old Shipley and young Shipley; they were continually pleading poverty, saying he had got a good opportunity, if he would bring them they would dispose of them. In the evening Furneaux, the other apprentice, came home, we asked him about it; he denied it at first, he afterwards said he had frequently seen Carter give the shoes to the Shipley's, and that he once about three months ago took two or three pair of shoes and gave them Shipleys.</p>

               <p>Mr. PAGE. On Saturday the 14th of October, the elder Shipley came to my shop, and offered to sell this pair of shoes; I saw Mr. Reid before, I had every reason to believe they were Mr. Reid's property, I asked him if he had made them, he said yes, I advised my man to keep in conversation; I went to Mr. Reid, he came; Mr. Reid said they were his shoes.</p>

I was going there to see whether she lived there, she begged me not to take her there, and offered me a crown piece to let her go; this is the crown piece; I told her. I could do no such thing, I took her back to Mr. Wright's shop, and searched her; I found this pocket book, she said it was hers; on my taking her to the watch-house, she offered me the whole of the silver things if I would let her go.</p>

I locked my shop door, and went into one of my work shops; I returned and saw the prisoner run tip-toe along my passage with a large scarlet cloak on; I called out to her, she made no reply. I ran to the pavement, I called her again, she then returned, I saw the furniture under her cloak; I said it is a pity a young girl like you should do these tricks, who sent you, she said a match woman. I sent two of my men to see for the match woman; she gave me the bundle and said no woman sent her in for it.</p>

            . Q. I understand you have the management of the East India company's warehouses at the docks, the two prisoners were employed there. - A. Yes, on the 6th of October the prisoners were loading the caravans from the ship named Winchelsea, my suspicion was excited by seeing both the prisoners go from the caravan several times that day to the privy; suspecting they had something about them I desired they might be brought into the office, they were searched in my presence, upon Carter was found tea in a bag made as a truss to wear between his legs, upon Wood was also found tea concealed in the same way; upon examining the chests in the caravan, one of the lids had been broken open and tea had been taken out. The tea found on the prisoners corresponded with the tea in that chest.</p>

            . I saw the chest weighed No. 1334; it weighed three quarters of an hundred weight; the prisoners took it to the caravan immediately I weighed it, and they were the only loaders; the caravan was locked up under the company's and the King's lock.</p>

On this evening near seven o'clock I saw the boy in Finsbury-Square, seeing he was overloaded I said put your meat on my board and I will help you carry them, I took part on my board, the lad went first he crossed the road rather too soon for me; as soon as ever the prisoner passed the lad, the lad cried out stop thief, I turned round and saw the prisoner in hold, I picked up the beef, the lad charged him with having stolen it.</p>

This young man is my wife's brother, he came to my wife on the night of the jubilee, and said he had got something in the cellar, I took him his clean things on the Sunday morning, and I took the bag that I generally take my work home in, I was let in by that young woman, he put the bundle in the bag with the cheese in it, when I came to the door, that gentleman stopped me, I did not know what the contents of the bag was, no more than he said it was an old coat for me.</p>

On Thursday the 28th of September I missed a five shilling parcel of halfpence, they were tied up in blue paper; suspicion fell on the prisoner, when he returned from breakfast I called him into the warehouse and charged him with taking the money; at first he denied it; I said you naughty boy, here is the money, putting my hand to his breeches pocket; I emptied his breeches pocket, there was three shillings and sevenpence halfpenny and the very blue paper; he had spent one shilling and four pence halfpenny. I sent for an officer, he was taken to Marlborough street office.</p>

Yes, on the 11th of October I was watching a lighter of theirs in the basin in the docks; at nine o'clock, I left the lighter, it was a cold night, I went on shore to warm myself, when I left the lighter all was safe.</p>

I cocked the pistol in his face, I told him I would shoot him if he attempted to get away, I conveyed him on shore, and delivered him to Skuis, I went on board to seek for Goodson, I heard something plunge, I looked over and found something in a sinking state, I stooped down, and catched this bag, I believe this bag to be the same that I had seen before with the coffee running in it, Goodson was not on board that lighter, I found him on board another lighter.</p>

               <p>Goodson's Defence. I was crossing the craft to get over to a ship to see whether the people had come that I might have a run down to Gravesend, I could not get nigh the ship by two or three yards; I said I shall sit down in this craft to see whether the people came there or no; Williams said he should walk about till he saw the mate or somebody in the ship; at that time the skirmish began. It is a rule in the river to go into one craft to go on board of another.</p>

I found the prisoner in bed, much intoxicated; the officer look her after a little time; she said she was very sorry for what she had done, and cried; she said she would take us to a fence; the two officers and the prisoner went to the place where she said she had sold it, in Coventry-court; the prisoner said she had sold it to the woman of the house; the servants were in the house, the mistress was out; the officers asked the servants if they saw that woman on the preceding evening; they said, yes. We waited till the mistress came home; the mistress said she never saw her.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I went with the prosecutor to the house where the prisoner lodged, I found the prisoner there in bed, she was very much in liquor, I told her she must go along with me to Bow-street, she said, what for, I have done nothing; I asked her what she had done with the watch; she told me she did not know any thing about it. In going up to the office she bursted out crying; she said she was sorry she had robbed him; he was such a nice fellow. I went to the office, and when I came back she told me she had sold it so a fence; she did not know the name of the place, but she would shew me; she took me to Coventry-court; when I came there I knew what sort of a house it was; I took her only to see if they knew her, and if she was there last night; the mistress was not at home; the servants said she was there, her mistress and her went into the parlour in private; they did not know what past. I sent the prisoner to the office. When the mistress came home she denied seeing her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I met this gentleman I asked him to take a walk home with me, he said, yes; he sat several minutes on the side of the bed, I asked him what compliment he meaned to give me, as being an unfortunate woman, I did not wish to stay in his company without; he said he had no property about him. I saw somebody come by that I knew, I ran out; I never saw him till the next morning. I was up all night; I was very much intoxicated with liquor; he and two constables took me out of bed. I was very incapable of knowing any thing I was saying, being so intoxicated, till the last examination, they brought a person to me who I had said I had left some property with; I never saw the woman. I am innocent.</p>

On the 23rd of September I called the prisoner up into the parlour, I asked where my things were, she said they were in the clothes bag, I asked her why she said so, she said she could not tell; she seemed very much confused, then said she hoped it was no harm, she had taken them to the washerwoman; she said she would fetch them home in half an hour, if I would allow her to do it.</p>

               <p>Q. How is your yard fenced off - A. With a wall about nine foot high.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these hens must have been taken by some person getting over the wall - Do you know the prisoner - A. No. I saw my poultry again on the morning of the 6th, at the watchhouse; they were dead when I saw them, and the prisoner was in custody. I am quite sure they were mine, they are worth three half crowns.</p>

            . I am a watchman on the morning of the 6th of October, about half past five o'clock, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010053"/>perceived a man standing at the bottom of Cross-street, I perceived that he noticed me and drew himself of one side, I immediately went to him, I saw he had a bag on his back, I asked him what he had got, he said he had a bag of fowls, he brought them from Holloway, he was going to Newgate market with them. I took him to the watchhouse on suspicion. I left him in the care of Stratton, the watchhouse keeper.</p>
               <p>- STRATTON. I am watchhouse keeper. The prisoner was brought in custody by Haydon the watchman; he had a bag with him, and in the bag were nine hens and a cock; they were all in their feathers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking in the fields, my business is so confining, I am a watchmaker; it was near six oc'lock when I fell in conversation with a man, he said where are you going, I said for a walk; he asked me to carry this bag for him. I walked to where the watchman spoke of, and at the end of there I missed the man; he went away from me; the watchman said where are you going; I fell back, so the watchman said what have you got; I let him look in the bag, he said, I do not think you came honestly by them, come along with me; which I did. I am totally innocent of the crime.</p>
               <p>Haydon. I saw but one man as I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this cotton - A. It was hanging by the side of the door post upon an iron rail. I received information and found the cotton gone; I pursued the prisoner and came up to her in the middle of the highway, nearly opposite of the door; she had the cotton concealed in her apron, I took it from her; I know the cotton to be my employers. The prisoner said she did not take it from the door, a woman put into her apron, and she did not know what it was.</p>
