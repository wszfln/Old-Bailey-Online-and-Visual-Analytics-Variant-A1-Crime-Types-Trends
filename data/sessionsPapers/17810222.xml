             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of January, between ten and eleven at night, as I was coming towards London, near the Red Lion, four men met me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any more than those four? - Yes; there were six; but I cannot speak to more of their persons than four; they met me, they got round me and hustled me and put my hat over my face; I endeavoured to turn my head on one side to see what they were going to do to me, upon which Milbourne d - d me and struck me on the small of my back with a cutlass. They afterwards asked me if I had a watch.</p>
               <p>Which of them asked that? - I cannot tell; I said I had not; one of them came on one side of me, another came on the other, and thrust their hands into my pockets I cannot say which of them did that; they took out one shilling and two sixpences, and seven pence in halfpence and a key; they d - d my eyes and gave me the key back again. They took a linen pocket handkerchief, a pair of mitts, and a tobacco box. Milbourne pricked my back twice with the cutlass, not to wound me, but he drew blood; he did it violently; he d - d my eyes and said if I did not stand still he would run me through. My coat and jacket were hanging loose; he stood over me with the hanger while the others went off.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay with you? - I cannot justly say; it was a considerable time before they left me; it might be ten minutes or something less.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen any of the men before? - Two of them I had seen in the field before, but not to know them.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen Milbourne before? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - The next day at Sir John Fielding's office.</p>
               <p>Was it a light or dark night? - It was a dark night.</p>
               <p>What coloured clothes had Milbourne on? - A dark coloured great-coat, I cannot be positive to any other part of his dress.</p>
               <p>With the hat pulled over your eyes in a dark night could you observe a man's face so as to know him? - I saw them before they put the hat over my eyes; two of them passed me before the others came up.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing Milbourne before the hat was drawn over your face? - By his coming up close to the post I saw him by the light of the lamp; it was not above two yards from the lamp; I saw them very plain as they came to me.</p>
               <p>Without the lamp it would not have been light enough to have known them? - Without the lamp I should not have known them it being a dark night.</p>
               <p>How long had you an opportunity of observing them before they put the hat over your eyes? - Two or three minutes; I observed them all before they put the hat over my eyes; they hustled me up to the window-shutter before they put the hat over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath had you an opportunity by the light you then had to know Milbourne's face, so as to swear positively to him again? - I had.</p>
               <p>Do you know him now to be the same man? - I do know him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - No; I have no doubt of his being the man, else I should not have come here.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the other five men who were concerned in the business? - I know these two (pointing out Powell and Russell) I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you know these two men whose names you find to be Russell and Powell? - Yes; I saw them in the fields about three weeks before.</p>
               <p>What led you to observe them three weeks before? - They had robbed a person that evening; I went out that evening with another person to see if I could find them.</p>
               <p>When did you first observe them when the six men first came up? - They were the men that first came up and passed me.</p>
               <p>When they passed you that night did you know them to be the two men you had seen in the field before? - I cannot say I took that particular notice.</p>
               <p>What did they do in this business? - They came up to the post and met the others that were coming.</p>
               <p>Did they do any thing? - They were along with them when they hustled me together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220004"/>Did you see these two men do any thing, or hear them say any thing? - Only Powell saying this is Tom.</p>
               <p>You did not see them do any thing, or hear them say any thing relating to the robbery? - When they spoke they spoke alltogether.</p>
               <p>Did you see these two men come back before the hat was pulled over your face? - Yes; one of them laid hold of my coat before the others came up.</p>
               <p>Are you sure one of those laid hold of your coat? - Yes; and walked with me up to the post.</p>
               <p>How far was that? - Not two yards.</p>
               <p>Are you positive they laid hold of your coat? - I am almost sure.</p>
               <p>Are you positive or not? - I had rather decline it.</p>
               <p>When did you see these men afterwards? - The next day; I saw them all at Sir

               <p>Had you no other opportunity of observing him than while they came and while they were hustling you? - I saw him come through the posts, and then they hustled me to the window shutter.</p>

               <p>The first night you was not positive to them? - Yes; I was as positive the first night as on the Monday; the first night was on Thursday; they were brought up on the Monday after.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the apprehending of the prisoners. found this cutlass (producing it) on Milbourne.</p>
               <p>To Thompson. You cannot I suppose take upon yourself to swear to the cutlass Milbourne had? - No.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. I found this pocket pistol ( producing it) upon Collett. It is loaded.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the first examination on the Thursday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Thompson then take upon him to know my of the prisoners? - He pointed out Powell immediately as the first man that came up to him and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Did he that evening declare his knowledge of any of the other prisoners? - I do not remember that he did on the Thursday evening; he did but just see them I believe that evening.</p>
               <p>What was the reason he did not swear to them that evening? - He said he believed them all to be the people; he spoke to Milbourne as the second man that came up to him, and particularly pointed him out as having the cutlass; he said two came up first and then two more, and took him over to the lamp.</p>
               <p>He said he believed them all to be the men? - Yes; that was by candle light.</p>
               <p>Respecting these two he declared the positive knowledge, or only that he believed they were the men? - He spoke positive to those two, and believed the others to be the men.</p>
               <p>He said he believed all of them that were there were the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Townsend there that night? - They were all there.</p>
               <p>Then he included him in his belief? - He said all of them.</p>
               <p>Did he speak positive to Powell and Milbourne? - Yes; more positive to Powell than to Milbourne.</p>
               <p>When he came up to the examination again on Monday what account did he give? - They were all put up to the bar together; there was another put up that he did not swear to. The justice desired him to touch those he knew; he touched Powell first; then he touched Milbourne, he said he was the man who had the cutlass; that he believed Russell was one; he said Powell and Townsend were the two first who came up, and Milbourne and Russell were the two next.</p>
               <p>What did he say respecting Collett? - He did not speak positively as to him; he believed him to be one of them.</p>
               <p>Did he speak positively to any but Powell and Milbourne? - Not so positive to any of the rest as to them.</p>
               <p>Milbourne. I beg your lordship will ask what Thompson said about the hat.</p>
               <p>Court. What did Thompson say about the hat on Monday or Thursday? - He said the first two came up to him and said this is Tom we will have him; that the other two came up and Milbourne struck him on the back with a cutlass, and then after that they pulled his hat over his eyes.</p>
               <p>RUSSELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say in my defence; only to ask him whether he found any thing upon me.</p>
               <p>POWELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the Queen's Head, the corner of St. John's-Lane, I staid there till ten o'clock, and had such an hoarseness upon me that I could not make any body hear me; I left that place at half after ten o'clock and went home to bed directly. I never robbed a man in my life, I have witnesses to prove where I was.</p>
               <p>What are their names? - I don't know, they are quite strangers to me; the subpoenas were only got this morning, I know them by sight being in the house two or three times; I directed the subpoenas for the people that were in that house in company with me; my brother said he would go to the Queen's Head and ask all their names.</p>

               <p>When did he first speak to you? - A day or two after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Did he make any enquiry who was in the house? - Yes; I told him those two men.</p>

               <p>What day was it Townsend and Powell were in your house? - I cannot say whether it was the 24th of January or not, it was upon the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Do you know when the prisoners were taken up? - No; I heard it was on the Thursday; I heard, about three days after they had been at my house, that they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Was it on the Wednesday before you heard they were taken up that they were at your house? - I believe it was; I cannot be sure to the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Wednesday? - I believe it was on Wednesday; I put it down when I heard they were taken up, but I have not the memorandum here.</p>
               <p>How came you not to bring it? - I looked for it a few days ago but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon your memory to say what day of the week it was they were at your house? - I really believe it was on a Wenesday; I cannot be sure of it.</p>

Then the tall one, who is the prisoner Lamb, came on the other side of the chaise, and said, if I made any noise he would shoot me.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to Lamb? - Yes; it was a very light night, the moon shone on his face, his hat was flapped, but his face was plain to be seen, except his eyes, which were a little concealed by the flapping of his hat. He demanded my money. I gave it to Lamb; then he said, your watch! upon which I gave him my watch, it was a silver one. I usually travelled with pistols, but had not my pistols at that time. I saw a pistol in Lamb's hand. They were with me about two minutes. I cannot swear to Harcup's face, his back being towards me; he held his pistol with his left hand, in a particular way, under his hand, to conceal, as I apprehend, the loss of one of his thumbs. The prisoner was taken last Saturday. When I came to Tothill-fields, where the prisoners were confined, I immediately knew Lamb.</p>
               <p>Lamb. How came you not to challenge me the moment you saw me in Tothill-fields prison? - I said nothing to Lamb when I first saw him in Tothill-fields; I went there again an hour after.</p>

               <p>I live at Kilburn-well. On Sunday evening the 4th of February, I saw the face of a man on the outside of my window, looking in at my house, this was about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening. I went out at the door, upon which the person who had looked in at my rap-room, jumped off the bench upon which he had stood to look in at the window. I asked his business? He ran away. I pursued him and overtook him; in running about an hundred and twenty yards after this man, I passed the two prisoners sat the bar. I cried to them, stop him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220009"/> stop him! but they gave me no assistance. One said, that was not the man I wanted, but it was a man in a light coat. I took the man I had pursued, one Webber; the other two prisoners then came up to his assistance. I insisted they should go along with him. They all pretended not to know each other. My hostler and a soldier came up to my assistance, and we secured them. Harcup behaved in a reprobate manner; he attempted to strike me. I gave them into custody. We then went up the road to see what we could find in the road. We found a pistol loaded. Upon examining the place near where Webber was taken, and where the two prisoners stood at the time Webber passed by them, we found two large sticks; one had the appearance of a bludgeon.</p>

Four men came up to me, the prisoner Webber, was one; Webber presented a pistol to my breast, and bid me stop! I said I had very little money. Then the other three got round me; one took a silk handkerchief off my neck; another put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket and took out a guinea, two half guineas, and nine shillings and six pence in money. Webber stood with a pistol towards me while the other persons took my money. It was a clear moon-light night, and I saw his face very plain, for he had no disguise but a flapped hat. I am positive to his person. They were about two minutes committing the robbery. When they were going off, one struck me on the bur of the ear, and knocked me down; it was a bludgeon I believe, or the but-end of a pistol with which he struck me. I saw the prisoner in Bow-street, on the 5th of February. I said when I first saw him there, that I believed him to be the man to the best of my knowledge in every respect.

On the 31st of October I lost thirteen gold rings, a pair of silver salts, and a great quantity of remnants of muslin worked in aprons, out of my shop window. I likewise lost two remnants of lawn, and a pair of half-boots.</p>
               <p>At what time of the day were they stolen? - I went out to an auction at Esher. I did not come home till ten or eleven at night, then I found my house was robbed, my sister wa gone to London, and she had locked up the house, and no person was left in the house; the house was locked up when I went to the auction.</p>
               <p>Was you the first person who got home? - Yes. This (producing it) is an inventory of the things I lost, which I gave in at the publick office. I found the house as I left it. I imagine the person must have got in at the window.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you leave the window when you went out? - Shut down but not fastened.</p>
               <p>How high is it? - Near six yards from the ground.</p>
               <p>So high that a man could not get up without a ladder? - I believe a man could with a step or some such thing. Mr. Shakespear took the prisoner up and put him in prison as a vagabond; he suspected he had robbed me. That window is in the chamber.</p>
               <p>Is the shop a part of the dwelling-house? - Yes. The clerk at Litchfield-street office desired me to be favourable to the prisoner upon his discovering my things to me, that was the reason of its being charged only a single felony. When he was taken there were pawnbrokers duplicates found upon him of some of my things. I went to one Davies's by St. George's church in the Borough, and enquired if Bullon had been to pawn any rings there since I had spoke to him before of my having been robbed; that was about a fortnight ago. He told me there was a watch which some man had pawned there, and a ring with it. He told me the man was taken to Litchfield-street. I went there the next day, then the prisoner owned where he had pawned the things which the duplicates were for which were found upon him when he was taken.</p>
               <p>When did you see him before the justice? - On the same day I think that I was at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Was he there when you came the first day? - He was in New Prison; he was brought up that day or the next, I am not quite sure which. The duplicates were produced at the office. He told the clerk of the office in my hearing of the different pawnbrokers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220011"/> with whom he had pawned my-things. He was sent to the pawnbrokers with some men to guard him.</p>

               <p>Can you, upon looking at these duplicates, tell who they were given by? - Yes, here is the place of abode upon them, Thames-street, and so on.</p>
               <p>Where is Church-street? - In the Borough.</p>
               <p>Where is Kent-street? - Behind St. George's Church, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Were there any goods found in Middlesex? - Yes; a great many.</p>
               <p>By means of the duplicates? - No; none.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the pawnbroker in Middlesex where any of the goods were found? - One is Laton; I went to Laton's. The prisoner was examined and then we went with him to those places. I went to one pawnbroker in Oxford Road; Dobree I believe his name is; he gave the property up before the magistrate, and so did several other pawnbrokers.</p>

On Friday the 9th of February, while I was conversing with a gentleman in my parlour, I heard somebody in the shop; I went into the shop and found the prisoner there. He asked me if I had a child's great coat to sell? I told him I had not; he had a sack hanging across his arm; I observed he kept moving it as if he was hiding something under it; that caused me to suspect him. I looked round the shop and missed a dark cotton gown and a pair of ruffles from a nail. I had been in the shop about two minutes before and saw them there then. As he was going out of the shop I took hold of his collar and under the sack I found concealed a gown and pair of ruffles; they were worth about fifteen shillings. The prisoner then went down on his knees and begged my pardon, and desired I would let him go.</p>

I went after him, the boys went with me and shewed me the prisoner: he had the whole Cheshire cheese under his arm and had some pieces in a pocket handkerchief; and their lay a Gloucester cheese at his feet. He was standing against a door near a scuffle that there was in Rose-street. When I came up to him he dropped the Cheshire cheese and ran away; I pursued him and called for assistance. I took him to the office in Litchfield-street before Justice Welch; the boys that informed me of it took the cheese back to my shop.</p>

On Monday the 22d, I went out to enquire after her character; I went out about eleven and came home between three and four; the prisoner was gone, and I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). As soon as I came home I missed two table-spoons out of the beauset. Then I went up stairs, and missed all my wearing apparel out of the trunk.</p>
               <p>Was the trunk locked? - I believe it was, I could not open it with the key as usual. I believe the lock had been picked. The prisoner did not return again to my house. I ran directly to Bow-street, and told Justice Fielding's men I had been robbed and that I had been to Kensington to enquire her character. They advised me to go to Kensington again to make further enquiry. She had lived I found seven months with them. I enquired if they knew any poor people she was acquainted with? A gentleman went to see after her, and caught her.</p>

I found the prisoner in the yard, that was on Monday the 22d of January, between five and six in the evening.

While I was taking hold of his arm to help him up, there came two young men, one was Mr. Harrison, nephew to the gentleman where I dined, and one Mr. Harris, who lived within threescore yards of the place; Harris laid hold of one arm, and I the other and helped him up. They went immediately after the person they thought had committed the fact, and left me with the deceased. When I had helped him up, I asked him who did it, or what was the cause of it? He said it was a tall chairman in a blue coat. I asked him what was the reason of it, why he had knocked him down? He told me the man asked him the way to London, and he had shewn him the way, that then he said, You shall light me, you shall shew me the way. Cox said, he said I can't, or won't, or something to that effect, I am on my duty and cannot do it; that then the chairman took from him the halbert or instrument that he carried along with him, and knocked him down, that he got up again, and he knocked him down a second time with it. I gathered up his weapons, his stick and lantern. Cox went with the weapon in his hand, and I took his lantern and hat, and went to the house of Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220015"/> Hewitt. We had a good deal of conversation going along; I argued with him why he did not bring a blunderbuss which I had given for the use of the watch-house. I brought him to the door and sent for a glass of rum, which I gave him: then I sent for a glass of brandy to wash his wounds. When the brandy and a cloth came I was going to take the binding off his head; he would not let me, he said he should catch cold, he had better go home. I found his lantern was full of blood; I was a good deal alarmed; I did not apprehend that he had lost so much blood. I lighted the candle, and said, we had better knock up the people at one of the publick-houses, and get assistance. He said No, I think I shall be able to get home, and then send for my wife, who is at Chelsea, and be taken care of. Upon that he went along the road home, and I followed him at a distance. Mrs. Wright was with me so I could not walk so fast as he could walk; he was quite out of my sight before he got to my house. I thought he might stop and sit down in his watch-box. I went there and found him not in his box. Then I concluded he had only got a cut upon his head and was gone safe home.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his house? - No. This was about half after eleven o'clock. I was in my own house at about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock. On the Monday morning early I was awaked and told that Ned was dead, meaning Cox the watchman. I was a good deal alarmed, as I was afraid I had not taken the care of him that was necessary, for I did not imagine him in danger. I got up and dressed myself. In going along the village I met a man who had been at my house, and had got the end of the bayonet which was knocked off the stick. His name is, I believe, Philips. I went to all the publick-houses; and I sent this Philips, and some others, and bid them go to Chelsea and Kensington, and enquire if there had been any man at the publick-houses like a chairman, and I said I will go to Brompton before I breakfast. The last house I went to was the sign of the King's-Head at Brompton; the master of the house told me there had been no such man there, but he had heard that a chairman had brought one Levy, one of Mr. Hewitt's men, home on Sunday-night about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you in consequence of what was said by the man at the King's-Head make any discovery with regard to the prisoner? - Yes. From the information I had from the man at the King's-Head, I took up the prisoner about eleven o'clock on the Monday morning in a court in St. James's-street, about an hundred yards from the King's-Head. I told the people there not to say a man had been murdered, for I did not know what might happen. Levy said somebody came home with him, but he was so much in liquor that he did not know who brought him home, or how he came home.</p>
               <p>What time did you converse with Levy? - At nine o'clock on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Whether the prisoner said he went out with Levy or not? - I cannot take upon me to say that he did.</p>
               <p>I want to know whether the name of Levy passed at the time, and the prisoner said he went with Levy? - I cannot take upon me to swear to that. I took the prisoner's great coat, it was a blue one, and his hat, and put them into a coa ch and took them to Sir

            's. I went to Brompton with Levy to know who came home with him. While I was there, one Gossett, who is here, told me that he saw a chairman between eleven and twelve, running along the road towards Earl's-court.</p>
               <p>Where is Earl's-court? - It lies west of Brompton. He said his coat was very dirty. I was led by what Gosset said, to observe the prisoner's hat and coat, it was dirty with the road stuff on the right side I think. There was not any blood upon it. The prisoner said that was his hat and coat, and he got up and came away very quietly, and did not make the least resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This weapon which the watchman had as he told you in his hand, had a bayonet fixed upon it? - Something of that kind. I know nothing of it of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>This was the account of the deceased, that this weapon was taken out of his hand? - Yes, he said so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220016"/>When you saw the man he had his head broke? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>There was no apparent wound upon any part of his body of such a kind as evidenced a sharp pointed instrument's having gone into the body? - I heard say so, but I did not see the body.</p>
               <p>But if this bayonet had been made use of for the most deadly purpose it would have been directed to some more fatal part. It was not made use of for the most fatal purpose it was capable of, so far we have from the declaration of the deceased himself? - So I understood.</p>
               <p>Levy was very drunk, and did not know who came home with him? - No, he did not, he could give no account at all, neither before the magistrate nor to me.</p>
               <p>When you found the deceased and brought him down to Hewitt's door, you offered him a glass of rum? - I gave him one.</p>
               <p>He desired he might get home to his wife, his wife would take care of him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He walked away from this place and walked faster than you? - He walked quite out of my sight.</p>
               <p>There were no apprehensions immediately of danger? - I did not see any, or I should have taken more care of him.</p>
               <p>Then you come to another information of the deceased, that when the blow was given him, he called out, O Lord, Sir, I am killed, I am murdered? - He said that before I helped him up.</p>
               <p>You at that time saw no person about him? - No body at all.</p>
               <p>You gave him a blunderbuss, but did not give him this staff and bayonet? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I had been at the Sugar-Loaf at Brompton-green. I was going home that night between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not later than that? - I am certain it was not. I saw a man coming after me; I stopped; the man passed by me. I saw he was a chairman by his coat being turned up. I said, chairman, where are you going this way at this hour of the night. He said he was going to St. James's. I told him he was going quite wrong, for he was going into the country. He stopped and asked me the way to St. James's. I told him to turn back, and go the other way, for he had his back to St. James's. He came up on the foot-way and laid hold of my left-hand and asked me to shew him the way. I told him I could not it was so late. After I directed him the way he went off towards London.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had a chairman's great-coat on.</p>
               <p>Was it a blue coat? - It was a very dark night so that I cannot swear to the colour. He was dressed like a chairman.</p>

               <p>How far did you accompany him? - I did not accompany him an inch.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be sober or otherwise? - He appeared very much disguised with liquor.</p>

               <p>Did you hold her fast? - She shut the door against me and I let her go, but I forced the door open again, and insisted upon securing her; then she took up a poker; I got it from her; then there was another came to her assistance; then I could not keep her. I went down stairs to fetch a constable, no body would come; there were some decent people lived over the way, they said they were afraid they should be knocked on the head if they gave me any assistance.

               <p>Did he tell the story as he had done now? - Yes he did; I went and searched for the girl that night at the lodgings he described, but could not find her. Two days after I was in Earl-street, near Monmouth-street, and saw the prisoner coming along with a new red cloak on. I knew her before by the description; I said you are the very girl I want; I stopped her and took her to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street. I fetched Emms and he swore positively to her person.</p>
               <p>Did you find any money upon her? - Nothing but a few halfpence. She said she would give me a guinea to let her go.</p>

               <p>Are you married or a single man? - A single man. I was coming home from my work on this day sen'night at night between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220019"/> ten and eleven o'clock. I went to a publick-house, the George, at the top of St. John's-street, which is a house I generally use. I left the George a little after ten o'clock. I was coming home, I met the prisoner in the street, near Hicks's-hall; she laid hold of me by the arm and asked me if I would take a walk and see her safe home.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - No; I was a little in liquor; I said I would go and see her safe home. I was rather in liquor, but was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Where did you carry her to? - She carried me to her apartments in <placeName id="t17810222-11-crimeloc57">Moffet's-court, Turnbull-street</placeName>

               <p>Was there a candle lighted? - Yes; there was a candle upon the table in the room when we went in.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - Between three and four minutes. I did nothing to her. I sat down by her side upon the bed; she saw the chain of my watch she gave a pull at it and pulled my watch out and ran down stairs.</p>
               <p>You felt that? - Yes; I ran after her but could not catch her.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the girl? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you particularly observed her face? - Yes I had.</p>
               <p>You was sitting down upon the bed by her? - I was.</p>
               <p>When did you see her again? - Not till she was taken, which was three or four days after. Another girl her partner took my handkerchief off my neck and ran down the court with it; that girl was at the door, and she took off my handkerchief as I was going up with the prisoner; the prisoner said, I know the girl, I will get you your handkerchief again.</p>
               <p>So they robbed you as you was going in of your handkerchief, and when you got in of your watch? - Yes; the prisoner had not been gone above five minutes before a man came up and said he was her husband. He was a drover in Smithfield; he banged me about; I could not get hold of him, if I could I would have secured him. I said to myself, this is very good fun to be beat and lose my watch too.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see the prisoner again? - I took two of Justice Blackborough's runners with me, and we found her in the same apartments. This was the 9th I took her on the 15th.</p>

               <p>To the prosecutor. Did you charge another girl with it? - Only the girl who took my handkerchief; I charged her with taking the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Are you sure you never charged the other girl with taking the watch? - No; only the handkerchief?</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Mile-End Old Town. About three in the morning of the 6th of February some people came to the watch-house and enquired for an officer. I was sent for. They said somebody was stealing hay from a stack. I went down with them to the World's-End Stepney; there I saw the two prisoners, and the son of Stevens, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220020"/> keeps the World's-End, who is now sick in jail, lying upon some hay, in a kind of an hovel; they were asleep; I waked them; they said they had been locked out and that was the reason of their sleeping there. I asked where they got that hay? Stevens said he bought it of two men. Neither of the prisoners said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you know what the prisoners are? - No, I never heard any thing before of them.</p>
               <p>Whose hay was it? - It belongs to the assignees of William Green, a bankrupt at Stepney.</p>

I said, Very well, and went away. I saw the prisoners there; they were putting the hay into the hovel.</p>

               <p>Was he in possession of it at that time? - No, the assignees, the persons mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>What were they doing in the hovel? - They were lying there; the officer put in his hand, and pulled them out by the legs. I gave one in charge to Lloyd.</p>

               <p>Only Wilkins; I promised to come the next morning; then I went to the office in Litchfield-street and told the affair to Grub. Wilkins said I should have the glasses a bargain because he had stolen them. I desired the officer to be in the way in the morning on the morrow; I went and they had been disappointed getting them, and I did not go any more after them. On Monday morning Wilkins's wife came to my house before it was light to fetch me to their house; I went with her; the house stands in a garden beyond Shoreditch church. He went into the garden and opened the ground and took out four glasses, some of them were broken; they were wrapped up in the hammer cloth; there were six glasses in the house besides those upon the drawers or dresser; he asked me four guineas for them all together; I agreed with him for two guineas and an half; he said the other lads were to have part of the money; they were not there at the time. I gave him 10 s. and took the four glasses under my arm; he said I had better take all of them. I said I could not carry them all. I took four in the hammer cloth and one on the outside; I said I was going home for the remainder of the money and would leave my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220023"/> wife till I came back; he asked which way I should go home? he bid me not go near Brick-lane, because they came from thence; nor near Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Did he say they came from thence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say what house? - No; he only mentioned the street.</p>
               <p>Brick-lane and Moorfields? - Near Moorfields. When I came as far as Aldgate I found them heavy, I took a Hackney coach and went up to the office in Litchfield-street; I then went in the coach to M'Donald's house; I got him and Grubb to assist me; we went back together in the coach to where Wilkins lives. When we came in my wife told me, in our language, if we went to the hog-sty we should find somebody there; I told him to go to the hog-sty, and there he found Watts and Dulwich. I did not go myself to the hog-sty at first.</p>

               <p>How many glasses have you got there? - I have no glasses; I had the misfortune to break them when I went in the coach.</p>
               <p>Wilkins. What he has said is not true; he has been many times at my house; he said I owed him eight shillings and wanted to have the glasses - I never was in his house before; he appointed me to meet him at the Nag's-head. I have seen him before but did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Wilkins. He told me he had paid for the glasses before and there were eight shillings owing; that he had been in trouble about these glasses before.</p>

               <p>I went on Monday morning with my husband to Wilkins's house. We went into a little room; my husband and Wilkins went into the garden and brought in some glasses, and he shewed me some more glasses on the drawers; my husband agreed to give him two guineas and a half for them; they asked how much he had about him? He said ten shillings, and he gave them that ten shillings and said he would go and fetch the rest. I sat there while my husband went away; he was telling me it was a very cold night; but he made a very good fire with the frames which he burnt.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what night? - The night before the Sunday night. In the mean time his wife came in; he seemed to be very uneasy and went backwards and forwards two or three times. He came to his wife and said, my dear, the pigs want feed. She said, well, if the pigs want feed they must stay a little longer. Dulwich's wife came in and asked if her husband was there? Wilkins winked and said no, he was not there. She sat down by the fire. He said if the man came to pay the money for the goods, the woman and his wife must go out of the room while he received the money; he seemed very uneasy, and asked me if I knew which way my husband was coming? I said I could not tell. A little while after my husband came in with the officers. I told my husband in Hebrew, that I verily believed there were some folks backwards that Wilkins seemed to be very uneasy about. The officer went immediately to the pig-sty and took the other two men. While he was tying their hands, Wilkins broke all the glasses at one blow with his hand, that nobody should have them. There were about six whole glasses.</p>
               <p>Wilkins. The glasses were left at my house. She and her daughter have been twenty times at my house for them? - I never saw his house in my life before.</p>

I brought them in. Grubb said Wilkins had broke all the glass. His hand was cut. I asked him what he broke the glass for? He said for fun. Simons brought the hammer-cloth to me when he came for me. It has been in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>On the 22d of Jan. between eight and nine o'clock, as I was going along Oxford-road, I saw the prisoner in Mr. Litzter's shop; there were three paper parcels of halfpence in the window behind the counter. I saw the prisoner take them up singly and secrete them; he put them as if putting them in his pocket. There was no person in the shop at the time. I called to the prosecutor's wife, who was in the parlour; that alarmed the prisoner, upon which he laid the three papers down at the farther end of the counter. The prosecutor's wife came into the shop and laid hold of him; I came up to her and told her I had seen him take the three parcels out of the window; the prisoner said he wondered I should stop him, that he came into the shop to purchase some tobacco and was waiting to be served; Justice Welch's man came in, and the prisoner was taken into custody; he was searched to see if he had any thing else.</p>
               <p>To Litzter. Where were the halfpence? - On a ledge behind the counter, so far that no person could reach them over the counter.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming along Oxford-road; I went into the shop to enquire for some tobacco; there was an out-cry at the door; a person went by a short time after, that man came in and said he saw me take the halfpence; they sent for the constable and searched me for the halfpence. While they were searching me, the woman lifted up a brown linen bag and found the halfpence. My friends<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220025"/> were here all day yesterday; I have no friends here now but your worthy lordship and God Almighty.</p>

On the 15th of January in the evening, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) At a quarter before six o'clock my wife and I were at tea in a parlour behind the shop. I looked towards the shop-door, and saw the prisoner. There is a passage all round the shop, I catched hold of him. He had some handkerchiefs in his arms. When I took hold of him; he let them drop at his feet; they were in fifteen different parcels. I asked him what he was going to do with them? He made no answer. I called my wife and we secured him, and got a constable and gave charge of him.</p>

She alarmed me. I went into the room and saw the bed had not been slept in over night; that gave me a suspicion; I searched my bureau which I found open, and missed one pound fifteen shillings out of it. I missed my watch which I had put into one of the pigeon holes in the bureau. I imagined she had taken the keys out of my wife's pocket, and unlocked the bureau. We missed all my wife's things, as mentioned in the indictment. I received a letter, in consequence of which I went to No. 5, in Greville-street, on the Monday following, with a constable. I enquired for the prisoner's sister, as I was informed she was there with her sister. The lady belonging to the house informed me her sister was gone to the play, and would not return till about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you find the prisoner there? - No; I found her at No. 22, in Crown-court, Little Russel-street, Drury-lane, in consequence of an information I had received, about half after two o'clock that night. The constable,

There was no person else in the room at the time. I said to her, you know Mr. Turner, I dare say. She made me no answer. I said, you are my prisoner. I said some of these gowns belong to Mr. Turner. She immediately went and fetched the greatest part of them but not all. I said bring me what you have taken from Mr. Turner. She brought me the greatest part of them.</p>

I found a child's coral in the fore-room and the watch was in her bed-room. There was a set of castors in the fore-room. She had nothing to say for herself. I went up with Mrs. Kirkman and her sister; I thought she would get admittance sooner than I; I desired Mrs. Kirkman to tap at the door; her sister went with me. Then Mrs. Kirkman told her, Sukey, you have brought me into a great deal of trouble, for the constable insisted on taking me into custody if I had not found you. The prisoner said nothing.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was my servant; she came on a Friday, and on the next Friday morning she went away.</p>
               <p>Had you any character with her when you hired her? - Yes; from her aunt, whose name is Yeates; she lives at Knightsbridge. I believe they are people who live upon their fortune. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I saw them at Litchfield-street office, on the Tuesday after she was taken. (They were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) The bureau in which I had put the money was locked; the keys were taken out of my pockets which lay by my bedside; for I remember perfectly well putting them in my pocket. There were likewise a few shillings in silver and a pocket piece taken out of my pocket. I know this pocket piece to be the same I had.</p>

When I returned to the cart I missed one of the flatts; I ran directly towards Newgate; I met a man and boy; the boy said there was a man going along with a flatt on his shoulder. I pursued and overtook the prisoner with the flat; I took it off his shoulder. He said there was a man behind him who was to give him part of a pint of purl to carry it to Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Did he show you the man? - No; as I took the flat off his shoulder he turned to run towards Giltspur-street, I laid hold of the flap of his coat and secured him; I delivered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220027"/> the butter into the possession of a constable; it has since been sold but the flat is here.</p>

The prisoner with another woman on Monday, about five o'clock in the afternoon, came into my master's shop and asked to see some silk handkerchiefs which lay in the window; she asked the price, I told her; she said she wanted better. I then went to the farther end of the shop and brought all we had got, as they laid together in a frame; I showed them to her; she fixed on one piece and asked the price. I told her five shillings and sixpence an handkerchief; she bid four shillings. In a few minutes after that I saw her take a piece containing eight handkerchiefs off the counter with her left hand; she said she would give but four shillings and she went out of the shop. I followed her and took the piece of eight handkerchiefs from her; it was concealed under her cloak. I brought her back to the shop; then she said she was very sorry for what she had done and begged pardon, she said she had never done any thing of the sort before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say if I would tell you of the other woman you would let me go? - I did not; I went out for the constable; Mr. Smith was left in the shop with her.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Crofton. On the 23d of last month, at about half past seven in the evening, the shop was shut in and I was behind the counter at the farther end of it; the shutters belonging to the window were not put up; there was a large pile of flannels; I saw the prisoner inside the door; the door was just too, but I believe the latch was not shut. I did not see him push open the door nor come into the shop, but saw him have his hand upon the stockings very plain.</p>
               <p>How could he get in without your seeing him? - There were about six rolls of flannel upon the end of the counter; they were so high as to conceal him; and as soon as I saw him he had hold of the stockings. I sprang along the shop and asked what he was at; he made no answer but attempted to get out at the door; but before he got out of the shop I laid hold of his coat, and in pulling him very strongly it occasioned his falling.</p>
               <p>Did you reach over the counter or go round? - I was round the counter when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>What became of the stockings? - He pulled them off that pile; there were about three dozen in each pile upon the counter; the counter was exceeding full. He only pulled them off the pile, but did not get them off the counter.</p>
               <p>How far did he move them? - About a quarter of a yard.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself when you pulled him down? - He did not speak at all; I called for assistance and our shopman who was sweeping the door came up and helped to secure him. He said he was a plaisterer and lived in Half-moon alley, Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he was going to do with the stockings, or how he came there? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I the person who entered the shop? - I seised him in the shop, and he never was out of my custody.</p>

               <p>Was it light? - Yes, the moon was at the full the day before. When I had got fifty or sixty yards lower down the wall two of them came forward. Russell was one, and I believe Milbourne was the other, but not seeing his face, I will not swear positively he was the man. The other two staid a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220031"/> behind. I had some suspicion then that I should be attacked. I got as near the ditch side as I could, they were next the wall; when I came even with them, one of them put something out from him and said stop! whether it was a bludgeon or what I cannot say. He then said Your watch and your money! I said, gentlemen, I have no watch and very little money. Then the man who was next the wall, who I take to be Milbourne, seized me by the collar and turned me above half way round and set my face towards the field; then the prisoner took some weapon, or cutlass, out of his bosom; it was very bright, and had a picked point. He said, if your stir, or make the least noise, you are a dead man! and he pointed it to my left breast; then the other man, who I believe to be Milbourne, put his hand into my pocket and pulled out a shilling which I had had returned the day before as a bad one; and out of my right-hand pocket he took a shilling and sixpence more; by this time the other two came up behind me; they pushed my hat over my eyes. One of them asked me, what my shoe-buckles were? I said, plated. One said have them. When they asked me the question about the buckles, I pushed my hat on one side to answer them. I saw the prisoner then standing before me with the weapon as before. As I moved my hat one of the men behind me struck me with his hand, d - d me, and bid me keep my hat as it was. One behind asked what my stock-buckle was? I told him it was silver, and they took it from my stock. Then one of them put his hand into my side pocket, but finding nothing but a letter, he did not take it. One of them then said, d - n his eyes, have his coat; they pulled of my coat by force; as soon as they hat got off my coat, they

             the weapon across my neck, the back of it as I suppose, for it did not cut me; and then they left me. As they went away my hat fell upon the ground; I picked it up and a handbasket which lay about three or four yards from me, which I had before in my hand. I saw the four men going away together; when they were about thirty or forty yards from me, I heard my cane, which they had taken from me, drop; I went after them, and took it up, and then I returned towards home.</p>
               <p>Are you positive the prisoner was one of them? - Yes, I am. He stood right before me, and I looked him full in the face. I had my eye on his face all the time till the other came up.</p>
               <p>Had he any disguise on his face? - None at all. He had a cocked hat; the other man had a flapped hat.</p>
               <p>Could you see him perfectly plain? - Yes; he had a light coloured close-bodied coat and a great coat on. On Monday the 29th, having heard that some footpads were taken up, I went to Bow-street, and was informed they were to be brought up on the Thursday following. I attended on Thursday, and five men were brought up to the bar. I was asked whether any of them were the men who robbed me? I told them I could not be positive to any of the five. Then Russell was brought up; I said immediately, that is the man who robbed me. He had the same light coloured close-bodied coat on then which he had on when he robbed me.</p>

               <p>I lost my watch on the 30th of January, 1780. It was a gold one jewelled; it had to it a gold chain; a seal set in gold; a gold key, and a gold trinket. I was coming from a friend's house at Woodford Wells in Essex, in a post chaise; before I set out it was intimated to me that a number of robberies had been committed on the road a night or two before; therefore when I got into the chaise I hung my watch up by the hook on the lining of the chaise behind me, in order to secure it. I set off about nine o'clock, we came to town over Lea-bridge, through Hackney, and came into town at Shorditch. The chaise broke down in Bishopsgate-street, I suppose then it was near eleven o'clock. There was a gentleman in the chaise with me who is in the West-India trade; he is not here. We got out of the chaise in a hurry and took a Hackney coach to my sister's in Dyers-buildings, Holbourn, where I then resided. As I was going to bed I recollected I had left my watch in the chaise; I was satisfied it was safe as it was at the One Swan, Bishopsgate-street, where I have hired chaises for years. In the morning I went to the counting-house of Mr. Belvedore, in Bishopsgate-street, and sent my servant to enquire after the watch; he came back and said they could not find it. I then went myself, and I then understood that the post boy and the horses I went out of town with and brought me back did not belong to the inn, but were hired. I requested Mr. Sexton, the master of the inn to send for the boy; the prisoner went for him, as I understood; the prisoner was clerk to Mr. Sexton, the master of the One Swan; the post boy came, I threatened to have him taken up; supposing he must have my watch. Mr. Sexton, the post boy, and the prisoner, were in the counting-house when I challenged him with having my watch. He said he had not seen it; that he drove into the yard, took the horses out, and went home with them, as soon as he had told some of the people that there was a glass of the chaise broke, and bid them go down the yard to see that it was broke. I advertised the watch for three months at ten guineas reward, but never heard of it till about the 16th or 20th of December; then a person was taken up on offering it to pawn in the Strand; that was on a Saturday. I was desired to attend at the office in Bow-street on the Tuesday; I went and found the watch in the possession of the pawnbroker, and the chain in the possession of one of the men who attends the office.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Smithfield, at the corner of Chick-lane. On the 12th of December, at about half after eleven o'clock, as I was standing at my box, I saw four men come up Chick-lane; one stopped at the corner; the others went forward and went down Durham-yard. I called another watchman; we both went almost to the bottom of the yard opposite Mr. Laver's house, where I met the prisoner with something on his shoulder. I took him by the collar and asked him what he had got; he d - d me, and said what was that to me, it was his own property. He threw it off his shoulder; they were ten tires of coach wheels done up in a check apron. Another man ran down the yard, some watchmen went after him but he escaped. We took the prisoner and the iron to the watch-house. Mr. Laver came and claimed the iron. The prisoner begged of him to be merciful and let him go and serve his majesty.</p>

               <p>I am porter to Mess. Evans and Martin. I was going with a load into the Borough; I pitched it on London Stone in Cannon-street; it contained ten pieces of check and one of sheeting. There came a man and pitched a hamper by it; he said he had three halfpence if I would be a halfpenny to it we would have a pint of purl, and I might go over the way and order it. I went and ordered it; when I came back the man was sitting down by my load. I went over again to the publick house and told them to make it hot, and I paid for the purl and came away directly; I did not stay for the purl; then my load and knot were gone. I enquired of the two porters, who told me a man with a load had ran up Swithin's-lane. I followed and overtook the prisoner with my load on his back; I laid hold of his coat flap and said he had got my load; upon that he pitched it back and made an attempt to run down Lombard-street, but we both fell down; he got about ten yards from my load; I brought him back to the place where my load lay and his hat fell down, and then he put on a cocked hat and said me have your load, how could I have your load with a cocked hat. I never let him go till I secured him.</p>

               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Askew a plumber; I was at the Post-office having a letter to send to Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire. The prisoner was in the office at the time; that was Tuesday or Wednesday night the 10th or 11th of April.</p>
               <p>Was that in April? - January I mean; I never was in such a thing before and made a mistake. It was about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - I have seen him in Bishopsgate-street and know him by sight; he is a butcher by trade; he was delivering a letter into the Post-office. He spoke to me and said how do you do? we came out of the Post-office together; we came along the corner of Pope's-head-Alley there was a quarrelling or wrangling; the prisoner being a young man ran over the way to see what it was, and I walked after him as fast I could; there was a mob and a lusty man lay down on the ground and another man lay over him. The man that was under pushed the other from him and ran away, and they called out stop thief! the prisoner at the bar pushed against them, or ran between them; however this man catched hold of the prisoner and said he was the man who committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Who was it that laid hold of the prisoner? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Should you know him again if you saw him? - I do not know but I might. (Townsend stands up) it was much such a man as that, but I cannot say it was him, but the person the man had knocked down was lustier than he is a great deal. I stopped there a little while to see what was the matter; this person, I believe, it was looked about and saw a round hat with a knot. The prisoner had a cocked hat when he was with me.</p>
               <p>To Townsend. You hear what this witness says; is it true that the first man you laid hold of got away, and you laid hold of another man afterwards? - It is not true; I laid hold of the prisoner's coat; he had my load on his back. I never let him go till he was at the Compter. The cry stop thief! was never repeated.</p>
               <p>Did you never let him go out of your hands? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see that witness there? - I cannot recollect that I saw him there; it was my knot and load, but the flapped hat was not mine.</p>
               <p>When he threw down the load he had a cocked hat? - He had a round hat on when he was down, and a cocked hat when he got up.</p>
               <p>After he dropped the load, could he have changed his hat? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Copland, an oilman, in Queen-street. As I was going by London-Stone, I heard the porter Townsend, complaining he had lost his load. Two porters told him a man was gone up Sweeting's-alley, with a load. Townsend and I went after the man; I saw the man in Sweeting's-alley; Townsend got the start of me, and took hold of the man's tail; that man was the prisoner. The bundle fell down. I came up and took hold of his collar; presently after a man came up and took up a knot and an hat.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner throw down the load? - Yes, I saw him throw it down.</p>
               <p>Had Townsend hold of him before he threw down the load? - I cannot say; he was close to him; they were down together.</p>
               <p>Did he ever get away from Townsend after he laid hold of him? - No he did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - He is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no other witnesses; a gentleman came to the Compter last Sunday; they said I had no occasion to provide any friends for the prosecutor would not prosecute me.</p>

He said the gentleman ordered him to come at that time. I made the water for him. I said it was hot. He put his fingers in and said it was not hot enough. He put it down again on the trivet and said, by the time I had been up stairs to call the gentleman, it would be hot enough. I went up stairs and came down again immediately. I found the water thrown down in the passage and the street-door open. The spoons were taken off a shelf in the kitchen. At eight o'clock the other hair-dresser came, who I thought was gone away, which surprised me.</p>

               <p>I lodged while I was out of place with Mr. Rocket, in Black Swan-court, opposite St. Paul's church. On the 24th of January I took a coach to go to a place, Mr. Holt's in Chancery-lane, between seven and eight o'clock at night; the prisoner drove the coach. I got out of the coach to rap at the door, to deliver my band-box and hat box. I was not above two minutes before I returned to the coach; when I came to the coach door, the chest was gone. I asked him what he had done with it? He said, What chest? as if he knew nothing about it. Then he said he gave it to a man. My master detained him at the door, and questioned him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220036"/> about it? but what he said to him I do not know. The maid is here who heard what he said.</p>
               <p>Have you ever found the chest again? - No, nor nothing in it. When I went in the prisoner was off the coach-box.</p>
               <p>Did he open the door of the coach for you? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other man there? - Not that I know of; none that belonged to me.</p>

               <p>Did he stand near the coach door when you got out of the coach and went into the house? - I cannot say; he was off the coach-box. When I came out he was standing with his back to the coach-door, and the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Did the coachman assist in lifting the chest into the coach? - Yes, it was so large one person could not lift it in, it was as much as two men could lift.</p>
               <p>Was you in the house when you delivered the band-box and hat-box? - I set down the boxes in the passage; the servant was in the passage; the door was not shut; the servant never left the door.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you was not above two minutes in the passage? - Yes, I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Was any other man there? - When the coach got to Mr. Holt's a man came and opened the coach door and said, is this the house, my dear, you want to go to? I said, yes. Then I got out and rapped at the door myself. My master let him go home then, and he was taken at night. The prisoner said he had given my chest to the man who took my hat-box and band-box out of my hand as I came out of the coach. He was standing with his back to the coach-door. I opened the door, and saw the chest was not there.</p>
               <p>Could one person carry the chest? - One person could not take it out of the coach, I believe, but if it was taken out one person might carry it.</p>

               <p>How long had she been in the passage before she came out to demand the chest? - Not three minutes, the outside. The coachman seemed surprised and said what chest? She said, what have you done with it? He said he had given it to the man who opened the coach door to her. We kept him till a constable was sent for. He was examined. What passed I cannot say; I did not hear; I did not go from the door.</p>

She went in and a man said you must assist me with this on my back; I did and put the cushions right and shut the door and went and demanded the money; when I demanded the money the man and the chest were gone; I thought the man belonged to the house; she asked me for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220037"/> chest; I told her I thought the man had got it she gave the box to.

               <p>I am a coachman; I drove Mr. Justice Gould at the time this happened; I am out of place now. I was at the Hole in the Wall in Chancery-lane; the prisoner came in to ask where Mr. Holt lived; I told him I would show him the door, it was the next door; if my carriage was in the way I would move it. There was a woman with a box in her hand and a man on the off side of the coach, who he was I cannot say; I went in again immediately to the company; in less than three minutes they came in for a constable; I was there present, I had not drank my beer. Mr. Vates who keeps the Hole in Wall was the constable; Vates was gone out with some beer; I believe it might want a quarter of eight o'clock; I was ordered to be at Serjeants-Inn at eight o'clock. When they came in for a constable I went out to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>When you went out what account did the man give of the box? - He gave no account of it at all; he said he did not know what was become of it; that she got out of the coach before he got back, and there was a man standing by her.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought you said something just now of the man being on the other side of the coach? - He stood close to the wall.</p>
               <p>On the same side of the coach with her? - Yes; only at the back part of the coach.</p>
               <p>Was the coach door open or shut at that time? - It was open when we went out.</p>

            . What place did you tell the prisoner to enquire for when he took you to Chancery-lane? - I told him Mr. Holt's, that it was the next door to the Hole in the Wall.</p>
               <p>When you came to Chancery-lane did you tell him to enquire any where for the house? - No; I did not; he stopped in the middle of the street and asked a person going by which was the Hole in the Wall. He had no occasion to ask for the house for I told him it was next door to it; he drove right up to the door and stopped opposite Mr. Holt's door.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the man before who asked you if that was the door you wanted? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any person about the coach when you got in at St. Paul's? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there was one or two persons on the box? - That I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>When he stopped at Mr. Holt's door did you say any thing to him or he to you before he went into the Hole in the Wall? - I called to him and told him this was the door; he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Was the glass down or up? - It was down; I put my head out of the window.</p>
               <p>Was he off the box when you called out? - Yes; I heard him get off the box.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him get off the box after the window was down? - Yes; when the coach stopped I let down the window and called out to him this is the house.</p>
               <p>Was there any noise in the street at that time? - No; there were no coaches passing at that time.</p>

The prisoner applied to me on or about the latter end of May, or the beginning of June, in the last year; she and her husband brought me this administration (producing it). [The letters of administration dated the 26th of February 1780, were read]. They came afterwards and brought a certificate of the parish in which they were inhabitants which is required in the office, and desired me to get the wages due to her brother on that administration; accordingly on the 21st of June 1780, they called on me, and I having received the money for the Grafton. I paid them nine pound eighteen shillings, and this is her receipt (producing it) signed with her mark (it was read). The Boyne was then abroad. When I heard she was come home, in the course of business, I sent that administration down to Plymouth. I received advice of the money to be paid.

             to Mr. Shelley's, in consequence of some information she had given of Mr. Shelley, on the 23d of December; Mrs. Eltoff and two officers belonging to the publick office, likewise went with me. A Mrs. Simpson was likewise with us, but she is not well. The two officers were Carpmeal and M'Manus. When I went in, Mr. Shelley was in the parlour, behind the shop. I said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry I am come upon this disagreeable occasion; here is a woman who has robbed me, and she says she sold the property to you." The hand-bill, giving a list of the pieces of plate was produced. Mr. Shelley said,</p>

               <p>"he was going to dinner and could not be spoken with," and he behaved very abruptly to me.</p>
               <p>Was the hand-bill shewn to him? - Yes; and the day was mentioned to him when the plate was bought, the 5th of October, and that he gave ten pounds fifteen shillings for it. He said</p>
               <p>"he had bought no such plate." I mentioned every article to him. I desired him</p>
               <p>"to look over his books as I thought it was customary to make minutes of what they bought." He replied,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you who buy things but once a year might make minutes of it." He was so angry at my coming he was almost ready to push me out at the door. I went back to Justice Fielding's and begged, if it was not too late, they would grant a search warrant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220043"/> but it being Saturday night, it was past the time. The day after Christmas day, the Tuesday, a search warrant was granted. My brother and I, with the officers

             and M'Manus, who executedthesearch-warrant, went to Mr. Shelley's, they said</p>
               <p>"they had a warrant, and they desired they might look over the plate in the shop."</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Shelley say any thing in particular? - Nothing particular that I recollect; indeed I was so hurried that I could not be very particular in what he did say. My brother looked round the shop and said,</p>
               <p>"Madam, I believe that is your strainer." It hung at the end of the counter, on the right-hand at the corner.</p>
               <p>Was it among the other articles of plate that were there exposed to sale? - I could not see that. I did not see any other strainer or any thing but that. In that place there were candlesticks; it was at the very top of the show-glass. One of Mr. Shelley's shop-men got upon the counter and reached it down,</p>
               <p>You looked at it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you know it? - Yes, I know it to be my husband's or mine.</p>
               <p>Was there any crest, arms, or cypher? - There was no name or arms upon it, but I knew it by a remarkable bruise on one side of the strainer on the bottom.</p>
               <p>Had you observed that bruise particularly before you lost the strainer? - Many years.</p>
               <p>From that mark were you able to be certain it was your strainer? - I was.</p>
               <p>Are you now certain that the strainer which was found there was your property? - I know it to be so; it was one of the pieces of plate which was stolen from me by

               <p>Were there any other of those things found in the prisoner's shop? - There was not.</p>
               <p>What did Shelley say after that? - He refused to let the officers take it away at first, but they said they must have it, then he suffered it to be taken away to the office. Mr. Shelley said, "It did not belong to me, and he would bring people, or could bring somebody to prove it, and he did me be careful of what I said." Then we went to Sir

She said she told him,</p>
               <p>"that she did not understand the value of plate, but begged he would give her the value of it; that as she was going out she said, Sir, you gave me nothing for the glasses.

             say what you have now related, did he make any answer to that? - He said,</p>
               <p>"His shop-man bought the plate." He brought a narrow book under his arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"his man had made minutes of it but he did not know it before." He looked in the book and said,</p>
               <p>"there were minutes of ten pounds fifteen given for this plate."</p>
               <p>This was the sum you mentioned to him before at his shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he then pretend to look at this book? - No; he would not look at the book, although I asked him to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>There was some mark on your plate? - Some of it was marked with a cypher I S.</p>
               <p>What value would you yourself have set upon the plate you have lost? - I cannot pretend to tell the value; I did not buy any of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220044"/>You have never seen any of the plate since but the strainer? - No.</p>
               <p>When you described this strainer at the justice's, I suppose he asked you what marks there were upon it? - It was particularly described in the hand-bills which were printed the day the things were stolen. I told him,</p>
               <p>"There was a very singular mark on it, by which I should know it from any others;" it had had a violent bruise which had raised the reverse side. There are some holes made with something sharp pointed.</p>


               <p>Court. Did you mention that mark particularly to Mr. Shelley? - I did not; I told him</p>
               <p>"there was a mark I should know it by."</p>
               <p>I presume there was no great politeness or civility passed between you and the prisoner at the bar, when you went to his shop on the Saturday, and apprised him that he was suspected of being the person to whom stolen goods had been sold? - I did not tell him any such thing.</p>
               <p>The gentleman at the bar being apprised of your suspicions on the Saturday, you come to his shop on the Tuesday and there you found this strainer in a show-glass in the shop? - Yes; he was apprised of it before Saturday, for I had sent before, but he was not in the way.</p>
               <p>You say that the justice himself seemed angry? - So he was; he thought it not just I suppose.</p>
               <p>However, he said,</p>
               <p>"he was not the person who had bought it, but it was his shopman?" - He did say so.</p>
               <p>And that minutes were taken in a book of it by that shopman, and the book was produced? - He had the book in his own hand.</p>
               <p>Was he asked by the magistrates or any person to shew the book? - I do not recollect that he was.</p>
               <p>Court. You have no reason to suppose that he would not have shewn the book if he was asked? - I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether I did not say I had got the books there and wished Justice Addington to look at them? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect where you bought the strainer? - My husband bought it.</p>
               <p>The girl said she knew the strainer; she came to you on the 4th, and left you on the morning of the 5th and then she sold these goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. When Shelley said his journeyman had bought it, what did the young woman Harris say.</p>

               <p>She said then before the justice,</p>
               <p>"No, sir, you are the person that bought it," - I do not recollect that he made any answer to that.</p>
               <p>After she said, sir, it was you that bought it, the justice said it was odd he should buy the plate so early? - Mr. Shelley replied,</p>
               <p>"sir, if you was at such a rent as I am would not you do the same," or to that effect.</p>
               <p>What time did you find the strainer in the shop? - About three o'clock; we went immediately to the office, but the justices were off the bench.</p>
               <p>When this strainer was found in the shop, did he or the shopman look at it? - I do not recollect whether he did or not; the man took the strainer down; the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"it was not mine."</p>
               <p>When he said that, did he himself look at the strainer? - To the best of my knowledge and recollection he did not.</p>
               <p>Repeat what it was Shelley said to the justice about standing at a high rent? - When Justice Addington said</p>
               <p>"was it proper to buy such plate at that time in the morning and of a servant maid," the girl (Harris) said to Mr. Shelley,</p>

               <p>I am brother to Mrs. Steward's husband. I went with my sister and the officers with the search warrant to Mr. Shelley's house on the Tuesday. We looked round, and on the right hand side of the shop I observed a strainer hanging; I believe it was not in a show glass, it was hanging up with some other things. It was at the farther end of the right hand counter.</p>
               <p>Does the show glass go all the length of that side of the shop or not? - I do not recollect; I do not believe there was any glass at that part of the shop. I said, sister, there is a strainer something like your's; I desired one of Mr. Shelley's men to reach it down, which he did and my sister looked at it. I had often made use of it at my brother's, and had observed that particular mark upon it; as soon as I had looked at it I was certain it was that which my brother had lost.</p>
               <p>Look at it now? - (Inspects it). I am certain to it. As soon as the strainer was given to one of the officers we returned to Bow-street. When my sister claimed the strainer as her's, he said</p>
               <p>"he could bring proof he had had it in his shop many months." The justices were gone from the office, so we met there at six in the evening; then the strainer was produced;

               <p>Should you have heard it if he had said any thing about it? - I do not know whether I should or not, there was such a noise in the court.</p>

               <p>You was I believe likewise robbed by this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220046"/> Harris? - I was; I went with Mrs. Steward to Mr. Shelley's house on the Saturday, on the same errand; but it did not prove to be the same shop where my plate was sold.</p>
               <p>You did not I believe know Mrs. Steward before? - No; I never had the pleasure of seeing her.</p>
               <p>Who was with you? - Mr. Steward, Mrs. Simpson, Mrs. Steward, and myself, and two of the officers of Bow-street; Mrs. Steward went into the shop with Harris and desired to look for the plate that belonged to her; the officer and Mrs. Stewart described the plate, Mr. Shelley looked at Harris and said</p>
               <p>"he knew nothing of any such plate." The officers read the hand bill to him afresh and said they had been there before; Mrs. Steward told him</p>
               <p>"she was come afresh along with the officers of Bow-street to look for that plate, and begged if he had it that he would own it; for the person present insisted she had sold it at his shop." She then insisted on that very confidently; the prisoner Harris said</p>
               <p>"he was the gentleman that bought the plate of her; that she sold it there in the morning as soon as she could get to his shop; his shop being the first she saw open." Mr. Shelley said</p>
               <p>"he knew nothing of it," and he behaved very impertinently to Mrs. Steward. Harris then said</p>
               <p>"when she came to the shop there was only one of his servants in it; she offered the plate for sale; he bid her stop and he would call his master up; that she stopped, Mr. Shelley got up and came down in his morning gown; that Mr. Shelley took the plate of her and weighed it, and paid her ten pounds fifteen shillings for it." Mr. Shelley said</p>
               <p>"he did not recollect any thing of it and he did not choose to be disturbed at that time." Martin or Harris afterwards said</p>
               <p>"Sir, if you will recollect when I was going out of the shop I turned back again and said I am a stranger to the value of plate; I hope you have paid me the full price." Mr. Shelley said</p>
               <p>"he knew nothing at all of it, he could not recollect one circumstance of it; and he could not be kept from his dinner." He told Mrs. Steward again</p>
               <p>"it was a very improper time to come." Harris said I told you</p>
               <p>"I had received nothing for the glass? and you said I shall not get a penny by the glass when I sell the salts, and therefore I cannot give any thing for them."</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing in answer to that? - No; there were some words between Mr. Shelley and Mrs. Steward about her coming; it was an improper time. I thought at first he would have pushed her out of the shop; then we went to Justice Addington.</p>
               <p>Now give an account of what passed when you went before the justice with Mrs. Steward, and Mr. Shelley was present? - He came to Bow-street on the Tuesday afternoon; a warrant was granted to search Mr. Shelley's house. I did not go to Mr. Shelley's then; I was attending the office on my own affair; when I saw Mrs. Steward again they brought a punch strainer which was produced at the office. Mrs. Steward and Mr. Steward both swore the strainer was Mrs. Steward's. Mr. Shelley desired Mrs. Steward</p>
               <p>"not to take a false oath, nor to say too much for he could bring a person who had lived with him who would prove he had had it in his possession eight months." The justices desired

             did. After she had told the justice that Mr. Shelley was the person that bought the plate of her; she said,</p>
               <p>"the reason why she was so particular to Mr. Shelley's person was, he had something of a cast in his eye that she particularized at the time he bought the plate, which she said she could have sworn to."</p>
               <p>Has he a cast in his eye? - Mr. Shelley has a cast with his eye.</p>
               <p>Is it such a one as you should know him again? - I should know Mr. Shelley. Mr. Shelley then said,</p>
               <p>"Pray what did I give you for the plate; did I give you ten pounds thirteen?" She said</p>
               <p>"No, you gave me ten pounds fifteen; and I sold all the plate to you." Justice Addington said, you have it posted I dare say, your have your books;</p>
               <p>"yes," he said,</p>
               <p>"it was under his arm; but he thought it was ten pounds thirteen when he spoke to the prisoner in that manner." He opened his book but I am not clear whether the book was searched or not; he himself I think looked into it; he said "he bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220047"/> goods at a very fair price." A very warm altercation ensued between the justice and Mr. Shelley.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any particular expressions Mr. Shelley made use of? - Mr. Shelley told the Justice that</p>
               <p>"he would have him to know that he was a man of as fair a character as most men; and that he strove to support his character as much as he did." The Justice said,</p>
               <p>"I do not think you do right when you buy silver of people of this cast; for buying such a quantity of plate so early in the morning of a person so dressed, you should have had some suspicions, and enquired who you bought it of; and that when he bought silver to melt, he should not buy plate which was modern and not fit to be melted down." Mr. Shelley said</p>
               <p>"if you was to follow my trade, and live as I do, you would act just in the same manner." Mrs. Steward was bound over by the justice, and Mr. Shelley fetched bail.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The altercation between Mr. Shelley and the Justice was pretty warm? - I thought pretty warm, but warmer on Mr. Shelley's side than on the Justice's; rather bordering, I thought, upon rudeness to a Justice of Peace.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was the Justice soon after this bound Mrs. Steward over to prosecute? - I did not think it was from any resentment, but I think he acted right.</p>

               <p>"he had no such plate." Mr. Addington asked him very particularly about it; he said</p>
               <p>"examine your books;" Mr. Shelley or his man I cannot tell which it was, had a book in their hands; they opened it, but did not shew it to any person. When he persisted in it that he had not bought the plate, Mr. Addington said,</p>

               <p>Do you know how it happened when the book was produced, and Mr. Shelley still denied knowing any thing of the plate, that the Justice did not have the book inspected? - I thought it odd, but he did not. I was there when Mr. Shelley came in in the evening, which was I bel ieve about seven o'clock. The officer produced a silver strainer which Mrs. Steward identified. Mr. Shelley said</p>
               <p>"it was not Mrs. Steward's." He was then asked</p>
               <p>"if he had no such plate as was described in his book?" He then changed his note and said to Martin,</p>
               <p>"aye, but you told me it was ten pounds thirteen and not ten pounds fifteen." She replied " no I never did say so; I told you and every body else that I told it to, that I sold it for ten pounds fifteen shillings, and ten pounds fifteen shillings you paid me for it." Mr. Shelley said</p>
               <p>"how can you say that is the strainer?" She replied,</p>

               <p>Did she say she had sold him a strainer with the rest of the plate, or that strainer? - I am sure she said that strainer; then Mr. Addington called upon Mrs. Steward to identify it upon oath; then Mr. Shelley broke out rather into a passion and said</p>
               <p>"take care, madam, what you say and what you swear;" he repeated it twice over;</p>
               <p>"for I have a man who has lived with me and has cleaned this piece of plate, and knows I have had it in my possession for eight or nine months;" he said</p>

               <p>"Mr. Shelley be particular, she says she is sure that this is the shop where she sold it." He replied,</p>
               <p>"he was sure he had never bought any of her." I asked him,</p>
               <p>"if he did not generally book things he bought of that kind?</p>
               <p>"He said</p>
               <p>"yes always; and for further satisfaction he would look." He took the book and looked; I told him</p>
               <p>"it was the same day the 5th which was described in the bill?</p>
               <p>"He looked in two books; one was a longish book the other a broad one; he said</p>
               <p>"there was no such thing in his books, and he had never bought any thing of the kind." I asked the girl what she received for the plate? She said "ten pounds fifteen shillings; and that gentleman (Mr. Shelley) paid her; that when he bought it he had his morning gown on, and she knew him by the cast in his eye." We then went out of the shop; I served a summons for Mr. Shelley's appearance on the Tuesday noon; he came to the office and brought his book with him, and his man came along with him; the girl again repeated what she had said before. He then looked at his book and said</p>

               <p>"He found he had bought such things, but the girl did not tell him ten pounds fifteen shillings, but ten pounds thirteen shillings." The Justice blamed him and said</p>
               <p>"he ought not to hide such a thing as that; and if it had not been so late on the Saturday night, he would have granted a search warrant then." The Justice immediately granted a search warrant, and Mr. Shelley was not permitted to go out till we went. At the farther end on the right hand side of those show glasses hung this strainer; When Mrs. Steward claimed the strainer, Mr. Shelley said,</p>
               <p>"take care madam, take care, what you say; this strainer I can prove to be my property; I have got a man that can prove it to have been my property these eight or nine months." I was before the Justice in the evening at six o'clock; the strainer was then produced; Mr. Shelley and

               <p>You was a servant likewise to Mrs. Steward? - Yes, I lived with her about a year and a half. I have left the place about a twelvemonth. I had the care of the plate when I was her servant.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the strainer which was lost? - I should know the strainer by three marks like dots of ink. for I have particularly tried to get those spots out. I have generally cleaned it with wet whiting and then put it by the fire, but I never could get these spots out.</p>
               <p>Have you the least doubt about this being the identical strainer? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>A married woman or single? - Single.</p>
               <p>Are you in service? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you see Mrs. Steward last before you saw her here? - I did not see Mrs. Steward till the fast-day.</p>
               <p>It is a twelve month since you have had any possibility of seeing the punch strainer in her house? - Or rather better, Mr. Steward came and said he should be glad to speak to me; he told me of the circumstance of Mrs. Steward having been robbed. I said I knew the strainer and the punch-ladle. I said if I came I should speak what I knew, and that was in regard to these spots; I told him I knew it by three spots, because I have taken pains to endeavour to get them out.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Steward. Were you frequently at your brother's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you often had an opportunity of seeing and knowing all or any of the other articles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220050"/> which are mentioned in this indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you any judge of the matter so as to form any opinion with respect to the value of these articles to be sold as second-hand plate? - I think they could not be of less value than fourteen or fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>What do you think was the value of the silver mug, if sold as old plate? - Three guineas.</p>
               <p>What do you conceive the four silver salt-cellars to be worth? - Three guineas.</p>
               <p>What might the soup-ladle be worth? - A guinea.</p>
               <p>What the punch-ladle? - Half a guinea?</p>
               <p>What sort of table-spoons were they? - They might be worth about half a guinea a piece.</p>
               <p>The tea-spoons what might they be worth? - About five shillings.</p>
               <p>The four ladles for the salts? - Five shillings.</p>
               <p>What the strainer? - One guinea.</p>

               <p>Have you in your book an entry of any things bought on the 5th of October? - I have an entry of ten pounds fifteen shillings paid for old plate.</p>
               <p>This entry was made at the time? - I always make an entry of that sort when I pay the money to the persons who sell the goods.</p>
               <p>You made it? - There is no other person but me who keeps the books in that house.</p>
               <p>What is the other book you are looking at? - It is sort of waste book we use in casting up. We set down the questions we ask, and the people's names and directions.</p>
               <p>Is there any entry in that book as a reference to the entry in the other of the 5th of October? - Yes, here it is:</p>

               <p>Does this entry lead you to a recollection of the person who came with this plate to you? - I remember a person came that day to sell the plate which is recorded there; I weighed it and cast it up.</p>
               <p>Look at that entry and tell me whether it is your hand-writing? - I wrote this myself the morning I bought the plate. I asked a question, and that is the answer, and memorandum of the weight, &amp;c. which I received of the person I bought it of.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what articles this plate consisted of? - I have not the least idea of the particulars.</p>
               <p>Court. There are but two articles entered that day, and this is the first? - Then I should rather suppose it was bought in the fore part of the day. I do not immediately recollect the time.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her any questions about this plate? - I did, and do almost to every person I by any thing of. I weighed it; it weighed forty-three ounces. Mr. Shelley was, I believe, at that time in the parlour. In transactions where it amounts to eight or nine guineas, or so, if Mr. Shelley is in the way, I always wish to have his opinion. I recollect Mr. Shelley came into the shop, whether I sent for him or no I cannot tell. He asked this person a great number of questions. I remember he asked her</p>
               <p>"how she came by that plate?" She said,</p>
               <p>"It was willed to her by an uncle who was lately deceased." Mr. Shelley took up an article and held it away from her and said,</p>
               <p>"pray, madam, what might your uncle's name be?" She told him a name. I do not particularly remember the name. He said,</p>
               <p>"The letters upon the article do not immediately concur to the name you mention." She said,</p>
               <p>"My uncle frequently purchased articles of plate at sales." She then said,</p>
               <p>"I am a servant to Mr. Carrington Bowles, in St. Paul's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220051"/> Church-yard, and if you have any doubt about the plate, you may let it be here and send a servant to enquire." I thought Mr. Shelley was too severe upon her, because she appeared a very genteel young woman. Mr. Shelley said,</p>
               <p>"Pray, madam, why do you part with this plate?" She said, "The money it will fetch will be of much more service to me than the plate." She was a very decent well-looking woman. From the description in the hand bill I had no reason to think she was the woman. From the recollection I have of the person who sold the plate, it was a middle sized, round faced woman, and inclinable to be pretty. She behaved very politely in the shop. She gave Mr. Shelley several answers which seemed to satisfy him. He said, What does it come to? I said, ten pounds fifteen shillings. I unlocked the till and believe I paid her for it, as I usually do in those cases.</p>
               <p>When she came with this plate you weighed it, and there were so many ounces? - Yes. I suppose Mr. Shelley does not pay once in a hundred times; where we buy once we turn away five or six times, for if people do not give a circumstantial account of themselves we tell them" it is not convenient," and they go out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Was the money given for it a fair price? - Upon my oath I verily believe, that if Mr. Shelley's life lay at stake he could not make a single halfpenny an ounce profit upon that plate. As I stood in the body of the court I observed Mrs. Steward to misrepresent this matter. To my knowledge I can contradict the major part of Mrs. Steward's evidence at the justice's and in the shop. In the first place she tells the court, she found this strainer in the very extremity of the shop; that I deny. If the jury please to send, they will find it was in the very first show-glass upon the right hand side of the shop. And I wish further to add, to the best of my knowledge, I believe it has hung there upwards of two years.</p>
               <p>Court. That strainer? - It is out of my power to particularise it, but from an observation I drew it was a very old-fashion thing, and was laid aside on account of that. I believe, if I was going out of the world this instant, that that strainer has hung upon the hook for two years exclusive of the time it was taken down to be cleaned.</p>
               <p>Look at it? - It is out of my power to particularise it; we have not such another strainer in the shop, though I suppose the man that made this made twenty thousand. It is an exceeding old fashioned affair.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any other strainer of that fashion in the shop that could be mistaken for that? - I do not believe there has ever been a strainer of this pattern in our shop since I have been with Mr. Shelley.</p>
               <p>At the time of the search warrant was there then two strainers of this fashion in your shop because one was found there? - There was not, I made a very particular observation upon this strainer which I wish to inform you of. At the time Mrs. Steward challenged this strainer in Mr. Shelley's shop. I handed it down to her; she looked at it longer than any person need to look at a thing they know; and after she had carefully surveyed it round, she said</p>
               <p>"she knew this strainer." I said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you particularise it?" She said,</p>
               <p>"There is a small bruise upon it that was done with a fork." I looked at it and saw a dinge; I said,</p>
               <p>"It appears odd to me; I know the nature of silver, if a for had been jobbed into the strainer there would have been a fracture upon the silver as well as a dinge." Now I observed at the time I took this strainer from her, that there was no fracture in it, now I observe there is one. There was no fracture at the time I looked at it upon my oath.</p>
               <p>When the person, whose name you took down as being 
               <persName id="t17810222-32-person397">
                  Ann
                   Harris

                  </persName>
            , came to the shop the transaction began with you? - It did.</p>
               <p>And ended with you? - I believe it did. I think I weighed it before Mr. Shelley came into the shop.</p>
               <p>When you went to Bow-street with Mr. Shelley did you carry the books with you? - Yes, Mr. Shelley ordered me to take the books with me; I took the books and went; Justice Addington was waiting on the bench. Somebody informed him Mr. Shelley was waiting upon him; he immediately rose out of his seat, and went round to Mrs. Steward<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220052"/> and said in a low voice</p>
               <p>"I have heard Mr. Shelley say he had never during twenty-five years been before a magistrate in his life." He said to Mrs. Steward</p>
               <p>"that Mr. Shelley had been before him before." I said to Mr. Shelley,</p>
               <p>"Sir, he says you have been before him before?" Mr. Shelley said</p>
               <p>"I deny it." Justice Addington seemed in a situation that most people do when detected in telling a falsehood; he rose up and said</p>
               <p>"Madam I will do you all the justice that lies in my power."</p>
               <p>Were these books inspected? - They were not; I had them under my arm. Justice Addington fell into a passion and immediately granted a warrant to search Mr. Shelley's shop.</p>
               <p>After that warrant was executed were yo u before Mr. Addington again? - I was not.</p>
               <p>There was no question asked you whether there was or not an entry in the book? - No; I said to Mr. Shelley</p>
               <p>"I believe there is no necessity for me to stay longer;" he said</p>
               <p>"you may as well stay, these men are going to search my house; it will be as well if they go and search my house before I go home;" and we walked slowly on the opposite side of the way and saw them enter the house before us.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You put it down Ann Harris, servant to Mr. Bowles, in St. Paul's Church-yard; did not you think it odd to buy it of a servant? - Not at all; it did not appear impossible that that servant might be possessed of that plate after the story she told me.</p>
               <p>Did it not strike you as extraordinary her coming from St. Paul's Church-yard to the farther end of the Strand? - I suppose people would carry things where they think they can get the most for them.</p>
               <p>Do you advertise to give the most for plate? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you not think there are other shops as reputable as Mr. Shelley's between St. Paul's Church-yard and your shop? - Yes; but she might have carried it to other shops before for what I know.</p>
               <p>What coloured gown was she dressed in? - I did not take particular notice of her dress.</p>
               <p>You took month notice of her face? - I do not know but I might.</p>
               <p>When you was before the magistrate did you recollect it then? - Just the same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelley told the same story then as he does now? - I was only there once, and instead of Mr. Addington's enquiring into the matter he flew into a violent passion and boasted of his justice.</p>
               <p>Did he not hear the charge against him? - There was no charge against him in my hearing.</p>
               <p>When the strainer was seised did not you go before the justice to prove your property? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go in the afternoon again to clear your master? - I had some business in the city then. In the evening Mr. Shelley went to Bow-street. The porter took the books to him and I minded the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you attend that hearing? - I did not. I believe Mr. Shelley looked upon it that there was no occasion; he rested satisfied that the uprightness of his conduct and his character would satisfy Justice Addington of his uprightness in the transaction.</p>
               <p>When they were first charged in this matter did Mr. Shelley tell the story as you do now? - I do not particularly recollect.</p>
               <p>When the woman came into the house and charged him with buying the goods and giving ten pounds fifteen shillings for them, did he then say he had bought the plate? - I was not at home at that time which I am very sorry for; for I dare say it would have prevented all this disagreeable business.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any time when this woman that sold the plate to your master accused him of having bought it, and described his person? - At the time I saw Mrs. Steward, one of Sir John's men, and the person I supposed to be the thief, she did not accuse Mr. Shelley of any such thing. Mrs. Steward came in and appeared exceedingly warm.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that Harris did not come into the shop at the time when the officers and Mrs. Steward came? - I cannot particularly recollect; I cannot say she did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220053"/> not; she might come into the shop, but I can swear she never challenged Mr. Shelley with buying the plate. She said to Mr. Steward, "I believe this is the shop."</p>
               <p>What day was that? - On the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Mrs. Eltoff there too? - I remember seeing her at the office, and I believe in the shop; but I cannot be certain whether she was in the shop or not. I was only present the day the search warrant was granted how many times the lady might have applied before I cannot say.</p>

               <p>At that time Harris was not there? - I saw a person near the door, I cannot particularly say whether she was in the shop or not; but a person said to Mrs. Steward "this is the house?" Mrs. Steward said, "Is not this a burning shame that you should buy plate to the value of thirty pounds for ten pounds fifteen shillings." Mr. Shelley said he had all the reason in the world to believe that she was wrong, and begged not to be troubled at dinner time; and he went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Then you don't recollect Harris's saying</p>
               <p>"this is the person I sold it to; and I am sure it is you?" - Upon my oath she never challenged Mr. Shelley in any such manner; I never heard any such accusation; I do not believe she ever did.</p>
               <p>Not at the time when the search warrant was there? - She did not come when the search warrant was granted; it was before it was granted. I remember seeing a person outside of the door, who told Mrs. Steward she believed that was the house.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she was not in the shop? - I will not undertake to swear it.</p>
               <p>Why, to see a vulgar maid servant with two ladies is very remarkable? - My chief attention was to be informed of this matter by Mrs. Steward; I begged information of her.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the hand-bill from the office read to him? - I will be upon my oath there was no paper produced nor read at that time.</p>
               <p>When did you see the paper first? - In the court just now.</p>
               <p>You do not remember it before? - I never saw it before; I was there all the time and no such thing was produced or read on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man you bought that strainer of? - I believe it was in Mr. Shelley's house before I entered his service.</p>
               <p>What became of all this plate that you bought? - It might be given to the workmen in lieu of new silver; that is the way we generally dispose of old plate.</p>
               <p>You see there were silver spoons and silver salt-sellars; they were not perhaps very old fashioned? - I do not recollect the fashion of them.</p>
               <p>Table-spoons I believe are sold second hand at most silversmiths' shops? - The sooner old fashioned table-spoons are in the melting pot the better for the purchaser; it is like locking up money and throwing the key away. When our workmen apply to us for metal, we give it them if we have it; if not we give them cash. I look upon it more a transaction of mine than Mr. Shelley's.</p>
               <p>Court. Is five shillings an ounce the usual price for old silver? - Upon my honour -</p>
               <p>You are upon your oath? - If Mr. Shelley's life lay at stake I do not believe he could make a half penny an ounce profit.</p>
               <p>My question is, is it the common and usual price for old silver? - In some respects it is, in some not; the market for silver rises and falls the same as corn and other trades; sometimes we can afford to give five shillings and a penny; sometimes five shillings and two-pence, sometimes five shillings and four-pence; and sometimes five shillings and ten-pence. Five shillings an ounce is a fair price for old silver.</p>
               <p>Is it not very common in your business to buy articles of plate and sell them in the form in which they are as second-hand plate without melting them down? - It is very common where they are serviceable.</p>
               <p>Then you do not of course melt down all that you buy of old plate? - No.</p>
               <p>When you sell it as second-hand plate do you sell it at 5 s. an ounce? - Very seldom; we sell it for more, if we can get it.</p>
               <p>Do you ever? - I do not remember an instance immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220054"/>Do you not if it is tolerable fashionable sell it at six shillings, and up as high as seven shillings an ounce? - Very seldom; that depends entirely upon what articles they are, there are a great number of articles though old fashioned, are very expensive in the making.</p>
               <p>Do you never sell old plate as high as seven shillings or higher? - It is very uncommon.</p>

               <p>As high as six shillings and six-pence? - Yes; very commonly.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the articles that were contained in the plate that was sold you by the girl? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon yourself to say that none of these articles were fit to be sold as second-hand plate? - I cannot; I can swear they were all fit to be sold as second-hand plate.</p>
               <p>You never sell any second-hand plate so low as five shillings? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know any other person? - I have heard of such things; but old candlesticks weighing forty or fifty ounces are only fit to melt.</p>
               <p>But did you ever know it in such articles as these? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to say that if Mr. Shelley's life was at stake he could not make an halfpenny an ounce profit upon this plate? - It makes a particular difference where a man has it in his power and don't mind laying out of his money to keep the plate in his shop, and wait the chance of a customer.</p>
               <p>What could induce you or Mr. Shelley to buy the plate if you could get nothing by it? - Sometimes silver gets as high as five shillings and four-pence, five shillings and sixpence, and even five shillings and ten-pence an ounce; then a man who has old silver has an opportunity to give his workman old silver, and pay him for the making.</p>
               <p>Then at the general price even of old silver he could make a great deal of profit more than an halfpenny an ounce? - I think five shillings an ounce as much as any trader ought to allow for old silver.</p>
               <p>But is it as much as he could make of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to say just now, that if his life was at stake he could not make an halfpenny an ounce profit upon this plate; you now say that old plate is frequently up to five shillings and fourpence, sometimes five shillings and tenpence; that second hand plate is never sold so low as five shillings, and that all these articles were fit to be sold as second-hand plate? - Where a man sells a single article to a customer, he deserves twopence or threepence an ounce profit for his trouble.</p>
               <p>You say you was present when the person who was in custody for robbing Mrs. Steward came to Mr. Shelley's shop? - Yes, that was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>You say you was not at home when they came before on the Saturday? - I was not.</p>
               <p>You said you remembered your master telling her, that she was mistaken when she charged him about the plate and not to disturb him at dinner-time; do you recollect any thing of that? - I do.</p>
               <p>Then you were at home when that passed? - I was.</p>
               <p>You saw the prisoner then who was in custody? - I saw a woman, a mean looking creature, outside the door.</p>
               <p>And saw her again at the office? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was that the same person who sold you the plate? - Upon my word I do believe it was not, from the knowledge I have of the person's face who sold the plate.</p>
               <p>Then you do not believe that the

             who sold you the plate? - I do not; she appeared in a very different light.</p>
               <p>But you were at home when the conversation passed about not disturbing your master at dinner? - Yes, that was I think on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, four if not five witnesses have sworn that conversation passed on Saturday; you was at home at that time? - I was. I think it was Tuesday. If I am not much mistaken it was the day the search warrant was granted. Mr. Shelley said, "I verily believe the plate you enquire for was never in my shop; I am going to dinner, I beg your pardon, I hope you will excuse me, my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220055"/> dinner is waiting for me;" or to that purpose.</p>
               <p>The books had been carried before the search-warrant was granted, and you had found an entry which you supposed corresponded with the plate enquired after? - I had told Mr. Shelley of it.</p>
               <p>Court. What, is this a kind of waste-book? - Yes, and to take down directions of person's place of abode.</p>
               <p>Can you shew any entry like this in the whole book? - No.</p>
               <p>Tell me how this leaf upon which this is written happens to be sewn in with green thread, whereas all the rest of the book is sewed in with white thread? - There are five or six leaves sewed with green thread.</p>
               <p>That book was not originally sewed with that green thread? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>The book is to enter the occurrences of the day in? - We do every thing which happens, put a rough sketch of it into that book.</p>
               <p>And from thence I suppose you transcribe whatever is worth preserving into your books? - Yes, into the journals.</p>
               <p>Such a book as this must be regular as to dates because you go on from day to day; the memorandums of the 5th must naturally follow those made the 4th, and so on? - Yes. - Is this book now as written at first, or has there been any addition to it? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>How came it to be altered? - It was not large enough, I wrote it through and then put some more paper into it. There are about eight, ten, or twelve pages of it sewed in afresh.</p>
               <p>In that which I suppose to be part of the old book there is an article the 29th of August, 1780, Lent Cooper, of Knightbridge, four table spoons; at the distance of four pages after this comes the 11th July, cash 11 l. 19 s. - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happens that? - That was probably the cash I had in the till.</p>
               <p>Four leaves back you were making memorandums in the month of August, how came you when you got four leaves farther to make a memorandum dated the 11th of July? - I cannot account for that; I recollect the fact of lending the spoons.</p>

               <p>There is no day I suppose in which there is only one transaction in your shop? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>There was but one entry of any transaction in this shop on Tuesday? - I do not see there is.</p>
               <p>And but one for Wednesday, and one for Thursday, and yet just now you said you made a minute of all the transactions which happened in your shop, and at the time that they happened? - Not particularly in that book.</p>
               <p>What other book have you? - A day book where we set down what we sell every day.</p>
               <p>What book have you which corresponds with this? - A journal.</p>
               <p>That you make up afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you make entries in at the time but this book? - None.</p>
               <p>Then how happens it there should be but one transaction entered each day for these three days? - Things might happen that were not worth recording.</p>
               <p>To several articles previous to this time you have stated regularly the day not only of the week but sometimes of the month. Saturday the 30th, but one article there; the next article begins Monday, there are three articles. Then comes Tuesday; but for the second article, which you say is Wednesday, there is neither day of the week nor month.</p>
               <p>You began the transaction in your entries with stating the day of the week Monday or Tuesday, and in this case there is no stating that at first. If it is a book regularly kept, the first thing you do in the morning is, you write down the day, because the transactions of that day are to follow; in this instance it is omitted? - We never keep any regular mercantile account in that book. We have another book which we call a day-book. We enter in a regular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220056"/> manner what we receive and pay in that book. There is another book we keep of what we sell; and enter in our books what credit we give.</p>
               <p>I find every thing regular except in that part which is sewn in with green thread. There are some leaves afterwards with part torn out? - Sometimes we set down a memorandum of what a gentleman would have engraved upon his plate or seal. We had a porter who lived with us who did not stand to write it off, but would tear out the place where the direction was. I cautioned him against it. If I had the book here I now keep you would find no such irregularities in it.</p>
               <p>How happened it you insert no name in any other place? - We generally received old plate of customers. I have received of Mr.

             several times old silver when he purchased new, and had no necessity to set his name down in the book, I just set down the weight of it and cast it up.</p>
               <p>I see there are a vast number of entries; do you know of any one instance where you have put down a name besides this? - I do not remember, while I have been with Mr. Shelley, a person of her denomination, a servant, selling plate. I do not believe he would then have bought it, only upon her giving such a circumstantial account of it.</p>
               <p>Did she excite any particular curiosity at the time? - Mr. Shelley asked her a number of questions, and I do not know but Mr. Shelley might order me to make a memorandum of it. It is so long ago I do not recollect; the hand-writing is all my own.</p>
               <p>How happens this to be written in so fine, clean, masterly a hand, all the rest is written down like a man of business? - I take a good deal of pleasure to imitate good writing.</p>
               <p>Why not do it then on other days as well as that? - That is a memorandum.</p>
               <p>So are the others. I see but one article in the book of plate bought, that was on the 28th of June? - All the writing in the book is not mine, much of it is gentlemen's hand-writing; this is an account of goods sent to the refiner's.</p>
               <p>I want to understand the reason of making that addition which is sewed in with green thread? - The additions which are made in that book all succeed one another. The book originally was not of half the thickness it is now.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have been porter to Mr. Shelley nine months. My business is to clean the articles and go of errands.</p>
               <p>Were you in your master's shop at the time when those people came from Bow-street? - I was there the first time they came, but I went out of the shop immediately. I was in the shop when a punch-strainer was taken down.</p>
               <p>You knew that strainer? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had you cleaned it any times? - Several times in the course of the nine months I lived there.</p>
               <p>For how long back do you recollect the strainer in your master's house? - I cannot tell particularly. I had cleaned it a great many times during these nine months.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether it was in your master's house three or four months before December? - It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Did you ever particularly remark the strainer? - Not particularly; there was no other second hand strainer in the shop but this.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the marks of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Is that the strainer as far as you know? - I believe that to be the strainer, but I never noticed the marks particularly. There is a great quantity of plate.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Can you take spots out of Plate? - If we can we do; that is according to what spots they are.</p>
               <p>Do not you suppose that you could get spots out of plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take those spots out? - We do not take the pains with second-hand plate we do with new; when any body comes to purchase a second-hand article we endeavour to make it look as well as we can.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take the spots out of this strainer? - I do not suppose I did.</p>
               <p>You do not know it by any particular mark? - No; if I was to notice every mark upon the goods I should never get through my business.</p>
               <p>This strainer has been out of your custody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220057"/> some time, how do you know it to be the same? - By the pattern.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect it when it was produced to the lady? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her describe the mark? - She said it was her's after she had had it in her hand some time; she said there was something like the prick of a fork that she knew it by.</p>
               <p>Was the shopman there? - He was; I believe he reached it down.</p>
               <p>Did you swear before the justice any thing about this? - I was never asked a question there. I went with the books. I did not stop there two minutes. My master sent me out upon another message.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lived as porter with Mr. Shelley twelve months. I came away from him on the 5th of last May. It was my business when I was there to clean the plate.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect cleaning a punch strainer there? - Very well.</p>
               <p>Should you know the pattern of it? - Very well.</p>
               <p>Did it ever strike you as containing any particular mark? - No; only a bit of a blemish in the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one punch strainer of that pattern in the house? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Of what kind was the blemish? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Have you been in court to-day? - A little while, not long.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any person say any thing about a blemish in the bottom of this? - Yes, I have; but I have no business to say after them.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Do you think you should know the strainer if you was to see it again? - I believe I should know it if I was to see it, but I never have seen it since I left Mr. Shelley. (Looks at it) I believe I have cleaned this strainer times and times, but I would not swear to it without I was positive of it.</p>
               <p>Then that must have been in Mr. Shelley's house near two years? - I lived with Mr. Shelley a twelvemonth; it was in the house when I went and when I came away.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>There is no particular mark you say upon this strainer? - I cannot swear to any particular mark.</p>
               <p>You have seen this strainer produced to all the witnesses? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then you know the question is whether this strainer belonged to your master or not? - I believe, I am almost positive I have cleaned it several times.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. And there were not two of the kind in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first application made to me was the Thursday or Friday before Christmas day; Harris then had her doubts whether it was the shop, and did not remember me at all. They went out of the shop, and came in again. I then produced the books and laid them on the counter. She led me into an error, by saying it was ten pounds thirteen shillings. I only looked down the margin, and did not see ten pounds thirteen shillings. I had not a bed-gown in the world. I never came down in a bed-gown in my life.</p>

               <p>Was her husband with her at that time? - No; he was not; I wanted to see her husband and went with her and the other woman to him to Tothill-street.

               <p>Was the husband present when the wife took the oath? - Undoubtedly he was; she was sworn and took the affidavit.</p>
               <p>After that you and the husband entered into a bond? - I did; I was one of the sureties, not imagining the least imposition.</p>
               <p>Was it at the husband's desire you entered into the bond? - I believe it was both their desires; I cannot say the prisoner desired me; it is the form in that court; I might voluntarily enter into it. Then I went along with them to the Borough, and through the recommendation of a house-keeper an acquaintance of their's, they got the minister and one or two of the overseers of the parish to sign a certificate of their good behaviour while they were in that parish. From thence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220059"/> I went with them to the Navy-office; there was not a return of the man's name at that time, and I gave up the administration.</p>

               <p>How came they to apply to you? - This Mrs. Kelly brought them.</p>
               <p>Who is Kelly? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What was you paid for the trouble you had in this business? - I was paid a guinea, and as I estimate my time I deserved more.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of this man and his wife? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened you to enter into a bond for a person you knew nothing about by the recommendation of a woman you have never seen from that day to this? - I looked upon it as a matter of form in the court.</p>
               <p>What was the penalty of that bond? - I do not know; I will speak the fact and nothing else for all your father and grandfather were worth.</p>
               <p>What had you for signing the bond? - Not a meg; you may ask me what I had for supper last night.</p>

               <p>The husband looked upon her the same? - I don't know but he did.</p>
               <p>She fairly imposed upon you both? - I declare I take it so, I don't look upon it otherwise; I don't know what conversation might pass between her and her husband; it was an imposition of her's.</p>
               <p>From what you observed, she had represented herself as the sister of Wallather? - - Yes; and they both joined in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say, that in your hearing she represented herself as the sister of Wallather and told her husband so? - No, no; she told me so, and he also told me.</p>

               <p>The woman came to you first? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you look upon it as a mere matter of form? - No; I did not consider it as such.</p>
               <p>How came you then to enter into a bond of such a penalty for strangers you know nothing about? - I could have nothing more than the oath of the person, and I thought soul security sufficient.</p>

On Saturday night the 20th of January at about half after eleven o'clock, having been at the Grecian Coffee-house in Devereux-court, I was going to my lodging in Bishopsgate-street; I met the prisoner somewhere near Bishopsgate-street; she asked me to go home with her.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes; I went home with her to her lodging in Gravel-lane; she unlocked the door on the ground floor; there was no light in the room, she struck a light and immediately made a fire. When she had lighted the fire she asked me to give her something to drink? I asked her what she would have? She said a little brandy, half a pint would be enough. I told her I must have change for a guinea; she asked me to give her the guinea and she would go and get the brandy and bri ng my change; I would not give her the guinea till she brought the change; she went out and brought the servant of the house with the brandy and change; I took the change and gave her the guinea; then there came another woman into the room. I asked that woman if she lay there? She said if it was agreeable to me she would.</p>
               <p>Were there two beds in the room? - No; the prisoner immediately made answer, there was room in the bed for three people to lie very well. Soon after the other woman undressed herself and went into bed. After she was in bed the prisoner and I sat by the fire some time. The women drank the brandy; I believe they gave me a glass; I put a little in my mouth, but it was so hot I could not bear it, and therefore put it out again. The prisoner was partly undressed. I took my watch out, wound it up, and hung it on a nail by the fire-place. The inside and outside cases and the hands were gold. I undressed myself and laid my coat and waistcoat on the bed, and my other clothes at the feet of the bed, and went into bed. When I had been in bed about ten minutes, I heard the door open, I looked and saw the prisoner going out, I immediately missed my watch. I got up and dressed myself and found the twenty shillings had been taken out of my breeches. While I was putting my clothes on the other woman slipped out of the room. I went out and called the watch. I was quite a stranger and did not know where I was when I came out. The watchman said he believed he knew the house. He brought me to the door and asked me if that was the house? I said I believed it was. He said, if I could not swear to the house he would take no further trouble about it. I asked the watchman to shew me the way into Bishopsgate-street. I asked him for a bit of chalk. He gave me a piece, and I marked all the way from that house till I came into Bishopsgate-street, that I might be able to find it by day-light. It was between three and four o'clock when I got into Bishopsgate-street. I went several times the next day in search of the prisoner, but could not find her till about eight at night, when I met with her in a publick-house. I got a constable and took her to the watch-house. She was searched and two guineas and nine shillings and sixpence and some halfpence were found upon her. My watch was never found.</p>
               <p>Was there no other person in the room besides the prisoner and you and the woman in bed with you? - No. The watch was hanging by the fire-side. When I was in bed it was gone before the other woman got out of bed.</p>

I put the things into my shop and locked it up and went out about nine o'clock in the morning; I came home about seven or eight at night, and found the shop broken open. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I had a suspicion of the prisoner, but could not find him till last Tuesday. I asked him how he could serve me so? He said, he was sorry for it, that all the things were in pawn, and I should have them again. I found six of the lasts at No. 1, Fox-court, Gray's-Inn-lane, where his wife lodged. He went with me and shewed me where they were.</p>

             was with me. As we were going through the court the other woman shoved us, and the prisoner in the mean time ran off with the carpeting; this is it (producing it). She had it in her apron, she carried it and hid it in Paul's-Head-alley; then she came and beckoned to the other to follow her. We went into the alley and found the carpeting in the passage of a place called the Timber Yard, opposite the meeting-door. The prisoner ran away when she saw us coming after her. We took the carpeting and ran after the prisoner and secured her.</p>

            . I lost a counterpane on the 30th of January, a little before eight o'clock at night; it was hanging on a horse in the yard to dry. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me; he went through the passage into the yard. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220063"/> saw him attempt to take the counterpane off the horse; the horse fell down and broke the window. I had a light in my room; the shutters were not shut, so I could see into the yard, he went back through the passage. I followed him with a candle in my hand and saw the counterpane under his arm in the street. I could not overtake him; he got off with it. About half or three quarters of an hour after I saw him stand talking with his wife at the corner of the street. I sent for a constable. The prisoner said he had not got it. I never found the counterpane again.</p>

               <p>I lodged with the prosecutor.

He walked very smart; the woman came from the back room, and followed him, but he went away. He came back again about an hour after.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be drunk or sober? - Sober. A constable was sent for who took charge of the prisoner.</p>

She said if that was all never mind. I went into my room, and staid a quarter of an hour. Then I was going out for something for supper, and she came and said I had got her counterpane.

On the 29th of January, two looking-glasses stood upon a mahogany bureau in our shop, near a bulk; I lost one of them; that caused me to set a watch. The next night towards the evening the prisoner came on the outside of the shop windows, which were open; he reached over the bulk and took the glass off the bureau. I gave a great scream. He carried it about six yards, and then set it down. I ran about four doors after him; other people pursued him.</p>

My mistress stood behind some bedsteads. She screamed out and presently after cried out stop thief! I ran out immediately; the prisoner laid the glass down gently at a door about six yards distance, and ran on. I pursued him; he was never out of my sight but when he turned the corner to the place where he was taken. I can swear to his face; it was not a dark night, and I stood in a dark corner, therefore I could see him who stood in the light.</p>

I had another customer I was at the same time serving with some muslin. She said if I did not serve her immediately she would go to another shop.</p>
               <p>Is this shop the place where your goods were usually kept? - It was our shop. I immediately took the other customer's money, and fetched the lawns to show the prisoner; I did not fetch them from above two or three yards distance. While I was gone. I saw her catch at a muslin wrapper, which had some muslin in it which I had shown to the other customer and had not wrapped up; the prisoner saw that I observed her and she did not attempt any thing more at the muslin. I brought several pieces of lawn, and shewed her. She looked at several. She asked me the price of one. I told her two shillings and two-pence. She said she would give two shillings. I asked her how much she would have of it? She said half a quarter. I cut her off that; while I was cutting it off I perceived she had something under her cloak. I did not see her take it. I took threepence of her; I gave it my master. I jumped over the counter. She had then got into the court. I cried out, What have you got? She turned round and dropped from under her cloak upon the ground this piece of lawn (producing it). It is my master's property; it has his private mark on it.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She told my master when I took her into the shop, I was a very wicked man for accusing her with it; that I must have brought it out after her and dropped it.</p>
               <p>Was that one of the pieces you shewed her? - It was.</p>
               <p>What is the value of this piece? - It is valued at ten shillings; it cost Mr. Thwaites fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the place dirty or clean where she dropped it? - It was a wet day and the piece has some dirt upon it.</p>

               <p>I went to buy a bit of lawn; I bought it and paid for it. I was coming out of the shop; this man followed me. There were a dozen in the shop at the same time; there was a woman came out when I did. The man brought me back and accused me with having something belonging to the shop. His master asked if I had got any thing? He said he believed it was me. He asked me whether the woman at the door belonged to me? I said no, I knew nothing of her. Then the mistress asked me what family I had, and what I was? I told her. She said if I would tell her she would forgive me. I said I know nothing about it; I am a married woman and have two children, and am now big with child. I have been married twenty-two years and have three children.</p>
               <p>Price. I saw the corner of something white under her cloak while she was at the counter; I thought it was lawn, but did but just see the corner, so I could not be certain what it was.</p>
               <p>What number of people might there be in your shop at the time? - Eight, ten, or a dozen.</p>
               <p>Had you no other people who saw the transaction besides yourself? - Yes, but Mr. Thwaites is so much hurried with business that he could not well spare time to come.</p>
               <p>Did you see her drop it, or did you only find it after she dropped it? - I catched hold round her, and saw her drop it while she was in my arms.</p>

               <p>To Price. How could she take this piece without your seeing her as you suspected her? - I served two or three people at the same time.</p>

               <p>Was it dark? - The moon shone bright. One stopped me; the other came behind the cart and clapped a pistol to me and told me, to deliver my money. Being hard of hearing, I did not hear what he said the first time. He then said very loud, deliver your money! I gave him fourpence or fourpence-halfpenny, in a canvass bag.</p>
               <p>Who was the man you delivered the money to? - The prisoner. I knew him as soon as I saw him again. I had seen him before. He rather endeavoured to hide his face with his hat. As soon as I delivered him the money, they went away. I saw him again on Monday or Tuesday the 8th or 9th of January at Bow-street. I picked. him out and swore positively to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not swear to me at first; he looked very hard at me, and said he did not know me.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw him in Bow-street did you charge him with the robbery? - Yes. I looked hard at him and knew him. I swore to him about ten minutes after. Being hard of hearing, I did not hear any body ask me any questions about him before. I saw him but once before the justice. That was on the Tuesday.</p>

Justice Addington asked if there was any person there who knew the prisoner? The prosecutor said he was deaf and did not know what the justice said. The prosecutor was taken in again and sworn; he immediately swore to the prisoner.</p>

I lost eight linen handkerchiefs out of the shop on the 12th of February, at I believe about four o'clock; they were on the counter. There were several people in the shop; the prisoner came in under pretence of looking at some cotton for a bedgown. I turned about for a piece of muslin; when I turned back I missed the handkerchiefs. I jumped over the counter to shew this other person the muslin. The prisoner said the cotton would not do, and went out. I went after her and took the handkerchiefs from under her arm, under her cloak. I brought her back again. She was taken to the office in Litchfield-street.</p>

There were about fifty loaves of each sort; one marked 1 at bottom the other 2. I thought this had been I, whereas it was marked 2. I am positive they were my property; and there were two lost out of those which stood against the counter.</p>

She said only a little farther, and brought me into Lewkner's-lane; at the lower end of the lane on the right hand side they brought me into a lower room; all three came in with me; they said there is the woman on the bed that wants your help. I went to the woman and asked her how she was? she said she was full of pain all over; I said if she would turn on the other side I would examine her and tell her it she was in labour. She turned round, I examined her, and I then told the woman who fetched me that she was neither in labour nor with child. When I said so they all began to abuse me; then little Jenny said, she had a favour to ask me, that was to rub a spot on the face of the tall one (

After they had thrown me down two of them fell upon me and throttled me; I did once cry out murder! they stopped my mouth with their hands and throttled me. They pulled my shoes off and took my silver buckles out; then they all put their hands into my bosom and up my petticoats and shook me, and untied my top petticoat to see if I had any other pocket on; they got the guinea; they took my housewife and took out of it a pair of gold ear-rings, value 4 s. and an half crown; there was nothing else of value in it. I scrambled up off the floor as well as I could; as I got up one of them laid hold of me by one arm and little Jenny by the other; they pulled off my two gold rings, they were very hard to get off; Jenny swore a sad oath and said, if they could not get it off they would cut my finger off. She got one off and put on her finger; then they pulled the other off and made a scramble for that, but I do not know who got it; then they all three ran out.</p>
               <p>What became of the woman who was in bed? - When I said she was not with child she got up and sat on the side of the bed. When the other three ran out a man and a boy came in and pushed me out.</p>

She said the reason why she knew her so well was because she lived in the same court. We brought her to the office and she was committed. She owned she went to fetch her, but said she had no band in any thing else; that the others did it.

             came to my house and said he had been robbed; in consequence of that I found the person he represented had robbed him, which is the prisoner. I found her at the Castle in Swallow-street; she made to the door to go off as soon as I entered the house; Keeling was with me. I brought her back into the tap-room; she attempted to secrete a nutmeg grater which she took out of her pocket. In trying to get it out of her hand it came open, and some guineas fell about the room; nine guineas were picked up. I searched her pocket and took out two half crown pieces, then I brought her to a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did Keeling charge the prisoner with any thing? - Yes; he charged her to her face with robbing him; he said he had lost fifty guineas but he did not believe this woman had them all. She denied the charge, and said she had had ten guineas from Mr. Balfour, a publican, in Clarges-street, May-Fair.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I had been cast away but a few days before. I was coming home much in liquor, intending to go to my lodging in Thames-street, from an house in what part of the town I cannot tell; I was so much in liquor I had no recollection of any thing that passed after I parted with a gentleman before I found myself in bed in St. Giles's; but how I got there, or whom with, I cannot take upon me to say. When I waked in the morning I put my hand to my breeches, I missed my watch and a pair of metal buckles which I had in my waistcoat pocket. I sat on the bedside, and a child came in and said her mammy would get me my watch; the mistress of the house got me the watch next morning.</p>
               <p>- BRIGGS sworn.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor first complained of missing his watch in the night; he was removed from the prisoner's bed in the next house to a bed in my house; I rent both houses and let lodgings. The prisoner came between nine and ten o'clock and borrowed a plate; she said the a young man was to sup with her who was her school fellow. She asked what it was o'clock? Then she said she need not ask upon recollection. She pulled a watch out of her bosom; I asked where she got it? She said a young man had given it her in the street. I bid her not to bring people into my house drunk to rob them. She said she did not intend to rob him; that if she had a mind to rob him he had plenty of money and a bundle which she might take more easily than his watch. She went away; I then put the man to bed in my house; I saw the prisoner afterwards in her own bed fast asleep and a man with her. I listened and heard the watch tick; upon going near I saw the watch lying upon her bosom; I laid hold of the string, that waked her; I wanted to get the watch from her; she would not part with it; but at last, from the persuasion of the man who was in bed with her, she gave me the watch to carry to the owner of it. I then came back. I asked for his buckles? She at first denied having them; then owned to them, and said if the prosecutor would come she would give them to him. The prosecutor said he would not come; then she went into his room. I sent for an officer, the buckles were searched for and at last were found upon her in her petticoats.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220070"/>(The watch and buckles were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>- HINXMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I had charge of the prisoner; she said he had given her the buckles and the watch.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He was very drunk; he gave me these things to take care of; I was to give him them again in the morning. I had no money of his; I kept the buckles till he gave me something as a satisfaction for my trouble.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into my master's warehouse and begged the favour of me to help him up with the rope. He said my master had weighed it or seen it weighed; that it was bought and he was going to carry it to Lime-house. I helped him up with it in the warehouse, and he took it away. I asked him where the foreman was? He said he was busy. He went out at the back-door. I asked him why he did not go out at the fore-door? He said the back-door would do as well.</p>
               <p>To Davison. Was that rope bought of you by any person, or did you weigh it for any body? - No, I was at home ill.</p>

            . The prisoner has worked for me a year and half. On Saturday the 20th of January, at about a quarter after ten o'clock, my apprentice went down into the cellar to draw some beer; he returned very much frightened, and said there was a person in the house. I took a candle and went down and found the prisoner in the cellar. I brought him up; he appeared to be very much in liquor; he said he had got intoxicated, and fell asleep, and had never been out of the dye-house. I believed so at the time. There are utensils which are used in the dye-house in the cellar. I let him go, but one of my apprentices said he thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220071"/> he had some silk about him, and they went after him and brought him back, and found some silk in the alley, and brought it in; then the prisoner owned the fact. He said it was the first time he had been guilty of such an offence, and begged I would let him go to sea. I told him if he would inform me who was the receiver I would do every thing I could to serve him.</p>
               <p>(The silk was produced in court and deposed by the prosecutor.)</p>

Upon the 7th of this month, about half an hour after nine in the evening, as I was sitting in a room behind my shop, I saw a man's hand take my wife's cloak off the back of a chair, and I saw that it was the prisoner; I shouted out stop thief! and ran after him; I caught him four or five yards from my own door in the street. I charged him with having taken my wife's cloak. He said he had not. The neighbours then said he had thrown it down when he came out at the door. I laid hold of his collar and brought him back, and some of the neighbours brought in the cloak. I sent for a constable. He always persisted in denying that he had it. I am sure the prisoner is the person who took the cloak.</p>

               <p>I was going by the prosecutor's with some oysters. Somebody said there was a person lurking about that house. I and two or three more stopped to watch; I saw the prisoner go into the house and come out again, and drop the cloak just at the door as he came out. I picked it up and carried it in. The prosecutor ran out and secured him.</p>

It is fenced in on every side. I have a pond there, which is about twenty yards long and about ten yards wide, in which I keep gold fish; and there are some tench too. My pond has been robbed divers times from last July to October. I knew nothing of the prisoner till he applied to me to sign a paper to prosecute rogues and villains, who he said were not fit to live. He was to raise them up to me; I knew nothing of them. He asked me if I would prosecute them, and wanted it under my hand. I told him I did not understand what he meant, for he did not care to tell me the names of those rogues and villains. I know nothing about his taking my fish, only I heard him confess it when he was examined before Mr. Townsend, and he offered to make me any restitution.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made at that time in order to induce his confession? - None at all. He said he had robbed me, he had been through my fish pond twice in one night between July and October.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman TOWNSEND sworn.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tulk sent to me on the 14th of November, and desired to speak with me. I went to her house. She told me her fish-pond had been robbed, and that she had a clue to find out the people who had robbed her; that I believe was on the 13th or 14th; that there was one Mitchel, a farmer in the neighbourhood, who had been concerned in it. I sent for Mitchell whilst I staid with Mrs. Tulk. He came, and from him I took down in writing information sufficient for me to grant warrants to apprehend Etherington and Sorrell, and a search-warrant against the prisoner, who was taken up for receiving the fish, but it came out afterwards that he had been guilty of stealing them. The officers found the prisoner; Etherington and Sorrell were not found that day, but they were brought before me the next. There were about twenty or twenty-five gold and silver fish brought, which the officers said they took out of a kind of back in the prisoner's yard; they had particular marks upon them. He was then sent back again that night, which was I believe the 14th or 15th, and brought the next day for further examination. Mrs. Tulk said, These are my fish, but where is my Neptune? a particular fish she called by that name. The next day Sorrell and Etherington were taken, and they were all brought together before me. There then came one Wright as a voluntary witness; he had been concerned in the matter. He charged the prisoner, before me, with being himself in the pond. Etherington and Sorrell were servants to the prisoner. Wright said that himself, Etherington, and Hundsdon came together at the latter end of July into Mrs. Tulk's garden; that the net, in going through the pond, was hung, it being a staked pond, and Hunsdon said to his man Etherington, Will, Will, go into the pond and unbang the net; that Etherington said he would not go in; upon which Hundson himself went into the pond twice. Hunsdon said he was in the pond. A great deal of conversation passed; they were refreshing one another's memory with the facts. Wright charged the prisoner with having bad his own share of the fish, and the prisoner said, No, I had not, I only chose for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220074"/> Etherington. Etherington said, Yes, but you had the fish. No, says Hunsdon, You had them, and carried them as a present to such a person, naming some person in the Sheriff's-office. Etherington replied, No, you had all of them, I had none, I carried them with your compliments to such a person. Towards the close of the examination Hunsdon walked about by the side-board, and said, To be sure it is a sad affair, and we have all been guilty.</p>
               <p>Was the time mentioned when this net was hung in the pond? - None of them could fix the exact day; it was understood to be towards the end of July.</p>
               <p>When was the indictment found? - In December session. Hunsdon then moved to another part of the room, and came near Mrs. Tulk, and said, If the lady will forgive me, I will give her all her fish again, and those I bought at Walthamslow; he said he had bought some at nine shillings a brace, and would make her any other satisfaction that she desired. I told him it was a felony, and could not be compounded. I made out the warrants of commitment for them all, and Hunsdon made his escape. The other two were tried and convicted in December session.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Tulk. There were some live gold fish produced before Mr. Townsend, were there any marks by which you thought them to be your's? - Yes, upon a great many. I had had these fish a great many years. I believe they were mine, I had all the reason in the world to believe so. I used when I walked in the garden to feed them once or twice a day.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the fish you called Neptune produced? - No, that fish never appeared.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Alderman Townsend. When you asked me if I was ever in the pond, did I not say I will reserve that for another occasion? - He said that after what I have mentioned, but what I have mentioned he did say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said I gave nine shillings a brace for the fish? - He said he bought some at Walthamstow; and to the best of my remembrance he said he gave nine shillings a brace for them, and would give them to Mrs. Tulk, as well as her own fish again.</p>

               <p>I live in Moorfields. I am a sheriff's officer. About the latter end of July last, I went with the prisoner into a garden at the back of Tottenham. There were Hunsdon, Etherington, and one James, a gardener; Sorrell was not there then. We had a casting net. The prisoner and we dragged the pond with it, and we took twenty-three or twenty four fish; there were some of them brown.</p>
               <p>At what time was you there? - About twelve or one o'clock; it was a lightish night. The fish were shared when we got to Hunsdon's house. The net was hung once or twice; Hunsdon undressed himself and went in and undid it.</p>
               <p>You are sure this was about the latter end of July last? - Yes, but I cannot recollect the day.</p>

               <p>Did he own several facts from July till the beginning of October? - Yes; and told where he had made presents of some of them. I went and fetched six or seven from Mr. Cater's, in Ely-Place, and restored them to Mrs. Tulk.</p>
