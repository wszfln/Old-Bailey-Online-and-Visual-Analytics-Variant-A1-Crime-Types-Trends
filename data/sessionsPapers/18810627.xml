               <p>concealed ourselves in the house—I went up to Mrs. Lowther's dressing-room and stole the dressing-case—we took it away about half a mile and broke it open and took out a quantity of jewellery—we left the dressing-case in a corner of a field—we then went to Bedford—Taylor's wife's mother lived there; we knocked them up, and they let us in—Taylor remained there, and I took the train back to London close on 3 in the morning—I got to London about 4—Taylor gave me the money to pay my fare—I went to the Pitt's Head, Cumberland Place—on Monday, 6th September, I met Taylor at Hewson's house in Hogarth Road; I did not think of meeting him there—Taylor had possession of the jewellery at Bedford; he brought it to London to Hewson's—Taylor said he had been offered 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said that was not much—Hewson joined in the conversation—this was not at Hewson's house, it was in a public-house close by; I don't know the name of it, about two or three hundred yards from Hewson's house—I then went home with Taylor to 15, Canal Road, Dalston—I believe we left Hewson in the street—I remained there all night—next morning, the 7th, we left the house together about 10 o'clock, and separated—I met him again at 12 o'clock at noon at the Marble Arch with Hewson, as we had arranged—Taylor said he wanted to go into the City to show some person the jewels; it was agreed that he and Hewson should go together—I believe they went, they left me for that purpose—two days after I again went to Hogarth, Road, and saw Hewson there—previous to that I had seen a man named King, a friend of Taylor's—I cannot say whether the jewellery was produced when I went to Hewson's on this occasion—it was in its setting at that time; I assisted in taking out the stones—Taylor had them in his possession for a day or two, and then King, Taylor, and I went together to a man named Anthony in Helmet Bow, Old Street, St. Luke's—the gold and silver setting was sold to Anthony for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a little over, and that was divided between Hewson, myself, and Taylor, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to King for his trouble—I had a few of the loose stones a day or two after, I can't exactly say how many, perhaps 80 or 100; I also had this little brooch and this pendant—Taylor said he did not think some of the stones were any good—I kept the stones five or six days—I then took them to Hewson, the brooch, the pendant, and these two little pieces with diamonds, and another piece which is not here—he said he thought some of them were good, and he would have them made into rings—a short time after that he gave me one stone to sell—two or three days after I saw Hewson again at his house, and asked him to give me the stones back; I said I wanted to sell them—he said he had given them to his daughter—he still continued to keep the brooch, pendant, and diamonds; I never got those from him—Anthony is a melter or refiner—I had not sold property of the same kind to him before; I have since—on 18th April last I was taken into custody for a burglary committed in. Westmoreland—I then made a statement, in consequence of which I was seen by the authorities, and my evidence was taken, and the prisoner was subsequently given into custody on this charge.</p>

I was near Leicester Square, and saw the prisoners loitering near a cab-rank about 8 o'clock—Blundell came out of the shop, and crossed the street—Dorsin whistled, and Lapie came up Wardour Street, and they went to the corner of Mead's Court—on Wednesday 31st I saw Blundell come out and join the prisoners, who then left him, and went to St. Martin's Lane—I had had information from Mr. Rossio, and orders to watch the place—on the same night I saw Blundell in Coventry Street, where the prisoners joined him; they remained in conversation two or three minutes—Blundell handed them something, but I cannot say whether it was a key—I took Dorsin; he dropped the key of Mr. Rossio's shop, and Smith picked it up—I found on Dorsin an iron chisel, a knife, and this bag between his waistcoat and trousers—I acted under the inspector's orders in. not allowing them to get into the shop.</p>

Dorsin stated that the proposal to rob the shop was made by Blundell, who offered to take an impression of the lock, and take the only employee who slept there away and make him drunk and give him some drugged cigars, saying that there never would be a better opportunity, as his master had gone to a concert, and had given him the key to keep, and each was to take his share, and he would go to work just the same next day.</hi>

               <p>Saturday, 7th June, the deceased was brought there with a graze on each wrist—he complained of slight pain in his abdomen; I treated him for that, and let him go home—he came again next morning, suffering from acute pain in the abdomen; I admitted him, and he died next day—I made a post-mortem examination; the cause of death was peri<lb/>tonitis, due to perforation of the intestines—any blow on the stomach would cause that; a wheel passing over the stomach would cause the inflammation, and the perforation arose from the inflammation: that would accrue in that short time even to a person in perfectly good health—when he first came he was perfectly sober; I stripped him, examined him carefully, and found no mark—he did not complain of any local pain, but when he came at 10 on Sunday morning he said he had been very sick all night, and had acute pain in the lower part of his abdomen—he died within 48 hours of the accident.</p>

I had several parcels in the cart; the shaking of the cart shook one of them off, and I should have lost it if one of the passers-by had not called my attention to it. I went on, and was not aware that I had gone over the man till afterwards. My horse had been in harness since 11 a.m., and could not keep up a pace of 12 miles an hour at 10 minutes to 5 in the evening. I admit having had some drink, and as I had taken no food since breakfast it took more effect on me. The horse going his own pace would not go 11 or 12 miles an hour.</p>

I am a carpenter, of 131, Cambridge Road, Kilburn—Briggs rented two rooms of me, and lived there with his father, mother, sister, and brother—his father was away on 5th of June, and the mother and sister occupied one room and the prisoner the other—twenty-three persons slept in the house that night—I occupied rooms under the prisoner—I was going to bed about 1 a.m., and heard a knocking at the door, as I thought; I went up to see what was the matter, and when I got on to the landing by Briggs's room the two prisoners were standing there with their backs to the wall; Briggs in his shirt only, and Ball in his shirt and trowsers—it is a six-feet landing—Briggs's room door was slightly open—I asked what was the matter, and one of them, Briggs I think, said, "The place is on fire," in a laughing manner, making fun of it—I saw smoke coming from the door, and crawled on my hands and knees to see if the window was closed, and found the under part of the bed, the palliasse, was on fire; there were no curtains; the top part of</p>

I am potman and waiter at Mr. Bevan's, the Bull's Head, Wood Street, adjoining the prosecutor's premises—on Saturday, 11th June, about 7.5 p.m., I was talking to a friend outside the prosecutor's premises, and saw the railing outside his shop being pushed back by the prisoner from the inside—I said, "What the devil are you doing down there?"—he said, "Work"—I went to the door and found that the pad<lb/>lock was on—I said, "Do your people allow you to work with the place locked up?"—only the window where he was open, the rest were closed—he fastened the gate, closed the window, and said, "Don't say anything about it; I have only gone down for a book"—I told my master, who communicated with the police, and I stayed there till two constables came, and showed them where the prisoner had come out—they then entered the premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). Webster spoke to me, and I went to 96, Wood Street—I got through a window in the basement, near which I found a T gas-bracket alight, forced under a shelf; one end of the bracket had been tilted up, which-let the other end down alight under the shelf; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of the shelf, it was alight; I turned the jet out and extinguished the shelf; I examined the premises, and at the back of the shop near the lift I found another gas T bracket alight, and forced in the same way under the woodwork, which was alight, the other end being tilted up—there were two fires, both caused by the tilting of those two brackets, and there was also some paper alight—I took the prisoner on Monday morning between 12 and 1 o'clock, and told him I should charge him with breaking out of the warehouse of his master, 96, Wood Street, between 7 and 8 on Saturday evening—he said, "I was not there"—I said, "You will be further charged with setting fire to the warehouse, with forcing a gas bracket under a shelf, and another against a partition"—he said, "I went into the warehouse to get a pocket-book for a mate of mine, who asked me to get him one"—I said, "You will be further charged with stealing 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps, and about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of petty cash from the drawers in the warehouse"—he said, "No; I never stole them"—he then made a statement to me, I reduced it to writing, and he signed it; I offered him no inducement to make it, nor did I threaten him—the gas bracket could not possibly have been in its natural place in the state in which I found it—I did not give him any caution; I should have done so if he had not known who I was; but he had been in custody some time then; this is the statement, it is in my writing: "Moor Lane Police<lb/>station, 13th June, 1881. Statement of Robert Withey, charged with breaking out of a warehouse and setting fire to it at 96, Wood Street: 'I went up to the top of the house after some glue, when I returned from</p>

               <p>the top I went on to the second-floor landing, and was there when the street door was closed; I went up there about 40 minutes after 1 on Saturday last, and came down the lift about 40 minutes past 6; I turned the gas on at the meter, and afterwards lit the gas in the shop and pushed the burner against the shelf; I can't think what made me do it, and I am now very sorry for what I have done. (signed) R. Withey.' Read to the prisoner, who says it is true. J. Foulger."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My name was signed to that at the police-court—the Magistrate's Clerk told me to do so—after I had told the prisoner the charge his mother told him to tell the truth, and he said "I did come out of the basement; I went in to get a pocket-book for a mate of mine"—he made no statement till I told him he would be charged with stealing the stamps—he then said "No, I did not," and made that statement—that was when he was before the Magistrate—nothing is said in this written statement about stealing the stamps; we did not know that there had been any robbery of stamps at first, but I stated it in my evidence—the gas-burner was close under the shelf, pressing up into the hole, and the gas was fully turned on; the wood was actually blazing, and a white flame was curling round the shelf—I went in about 8 o'clock, and if the prisoner came out at 6.55 the gas must have been touching the wood all that time—if the jet was perfectly true and the shelf perfectly true the shelf would have stopped the hole in the jet—I put down the prisoner's statement in pencil, and afterwards in ink—I then read it to him, and asked if he could read it; he said "No"—I destroyed the pencil writing when the prisoner said that the ink writing was correct—it was the ink document which I read to him; I am positive of that—ten minutes might have elapsed before I wrote it out in ink; I went into the office to do so—I made the pencil writing in the prisoner's cell—I had some paper in a pocket-book—I have not got my pocket-book here; I carry it with me when I am on duty—the pencil writing was not so plain as the one in ink, but it could be read—I transcribed it word for word, and I wrote the pencil one word for word as he said it—I did not tear a leaf out of my book; it was a piece of paper which I had in it—I took the prisoner at 10, Ship and Mermaid Court, Bermondsey—he lives there with his widowed mother—my book contained no paper; it is simply a case to carry reports in; it is the inside of a banker's book torn out.</p>

On Monday, 13th January, about 11.30, Cauldry brought me this statement in ink, signed by the prisoner—I sent for the prisoner, showed it to him, asked him if he understood it, and whether he wished it to be understood that it was his voluntary statement—he said "Yes"—I said "Are the contents of it true?" he said "Yes"—I held it to him and said "Is this your sig<lb/>nature?" he said "Yes"—I said "Can you give any reason for com<lb/>mitting such a wicked act?" he said "I cannot; I cannot tell what</p>

               <p>made me do it"—I examined the premises, and saw the two brackets; they were not forced under the shelf then, as the sergeant had put the lights out—the proper height of the arm of the gas-bracket is three or four inches above the shelf; it could not touch the shelf in its natural position—I tried it by lifting one end, which lowered the other, and it then went under the shelf, and the leverage kept it very tight, so that the gas could scarcely escape—as I bent it there was no elastic force; it was rigid—the weight of the arm in pressing? up would move the other end—it moves in a ball and socket joint at the ceiling. (<hi rend="italic">One arm of the gas-bracket was here brought into Court; the burner was not upright, but was inserted at an angle.</hi>)I have been within a few months of 40 years in the City Police, and have risen up to my present position—I-tried the bracket on the Saturday, and it pressed very tightly under the shelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in Court while Cauldry gave his evidence—I was not ordered out—I did not tell the Magistrate as to the position in which I found these things; I was not asked—the constable had not taken down the fittings when I saw them; he only shifted them, and they fell into their proper places—I found that the jet would reach the burning wood—I tilted the burner against the partition, and I know that it touched the same place, because there were marks of fire there—I did not advise Cauldry to "tear up the pencil writing, but I saw the pieces with writing on them—I thought it my duty to ask the prisoner if he understood the statement; if he had altered his mind, and said "No," I should have torn the document up as worth nothing, although the constable was ready to swear that the prisoner signed it—if he had said that he never signed it at all I should have torn it up, and assumed that the officer misled me—if he had said that it was not his wish that it should be understood as his voluntary statement I should not have given it in, but should have torn it up—I did not caution him that it might be used against him; I did not consider it necessary—I did not ask him if he knew the meaning of the word voluntary—I asked him a second time, because I wished to give him an opportunity of answering in what way he pleased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Josiah Firth and Co., woollen manufacturers, at Ackmandyke, in Yorkshire—I am one of the firm—the prisoner was for some years employed by the late firm of Edward Firth and Sons—his connection with the firm ceased about eight years ago—in January this year I received some letters from him in reference to the sale of goods on commission—the first was on 7th January—I received one on 20th January, and I sent three rugs value 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are the letters produced—I sent an invoice with the value oppo<lb/>site—I sent the goods by the Great Northern Railway—I got this letter on 31st January (<hi rend="italic">asking how many of the</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">rugs the firm had, and what was the lowest they would take to clear them</hi>)—I got another from the prisoner saying that McCarthy could do with 200 rugs—in consequence of that I sent him on 7th February, by the Great Northern Railway, 50 rugs value 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., consigned to F. McCarthy, 50, Milton Street, Fore Street—I sent this invoice by post the same day—it came back a few days after endorsed "Not ordered"—on 9th February I received this letter referring to Messrs. Noble and Co.—I had never heard of them before—I believed the goods I sent to McCarthy to be at the Railway Station—I afterwards communicated with Mr. H. Richardson, of 104, Southgate Road—we did not know him—we would not have parted with our goods to him without cash—we communicated with him to that effect—I received this letter on 19th February, from F. McCarthy (<hi rend="italic">asking for a correct invoice</hi>)—we had sent him an invoice for 100 rugs—Richardson did not send any money, consequently we would not deliver to him—we sent samples of rugs to Noble and Co. value about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about that time a communication was received from Messrs. Hewitt and Co., job masters—I was in the meantime in communication with the Great Northern Railway Company—this order was shown to me by the Company—it is the prisoner's writing: "29, Carter Lane, E. Great Northern Railway Goods Department. Be good enough to send bale returned by Mr. McCarthy to Richardson and Co. Josiah Firth and Co., A. C. C." The prisoner had no authority to give such an order, nor to sign for our firm—I had no knowledge that he had done so till afterwards—at this time our firm had no London office—the prisoner was not authorised to pledge the authority of the firm—he had never asked for it in reference to hiring</p>

Mr. McCarthy that the goods were lying at the station at his expense, and I said "I want the advice from McCarthy, also a note transferring the goods back, from the consignor's order"—he said he would go and get that, as he wanted the goods <hi rend="italic">very important</hi>, and he went away—he brought the advice note next morning, and this order was written—in consequence of that I caused the goods to be entered to this, address, H.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 349). I have not been able to find the prosecutor—on the morning of the 24th May I was in Portland Street, when I heard cries—I ran from Portland Street, a little way through Marylebone Street, and I saw the two prisoners walking fast up George Street, followed by two young men—I stopped them, and asked what was the matter, and they said "Nothing"—the two young men behind shouted to me that the prisoners had stolen a watch and chain from a gentleman—I took them back to the young men, and they told me a robbery had been committed in Union Street—I took them back with another constable to see if I could see the man who had lost his watch and chain—the only thing I found was his hat very much battered about—I found the watch on Holmes, which I took from him with the assistance of the other constable—the prosecutor had run away—he saw it the next day, and identified it before the Magistrate—6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver was found on Ross, which was returned to her by order of the Magistrate—when I first saw the prisoners they were walking very fast; Holmes in front of Ross, some 10 or 12 yards—the witness Stevens told me to stop them, and another young man whom I have been unable to find since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw Holmes in George Street, Marylebone Street, perhaps 300 yards from the place of the robbery; Ross was following him 10 or 12 yards behind—Stevens was following them up at about the same distance—Holmes was perfectly sober—he might have been drinking—he had a cane in his hand and a pair of gloves—they were conveyed to the Tottenham Court Road Station—my attention was called to the watch being in the soldier's hand just after I left the place where the robbery was committed—I was told either the soldier or the woman had the watch.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bookmaker, of 6, York Street, Marylebone—on the 24th May I was walking through Union Street, about 2.15 a.m., when I saw the soldier and prosecutor fighting, and the woman came up and asked me to protect her friend—I asked her who was her friend, and she said "The soldier"—I said I should have no hand in it—I tried to part them afterwards, but I found they were fighting desperately, and I should very likely have got the worst off as they were big men—I stopped a few yards from them, and the soldier got the best of the other man, and knocked him down, and picked him up—he either fell up against the shutters or the soldier put him against the shutters, and the woman then came up, and I saw something glitter in the soldier's hand—I could not swear what it was—he picked up his gloves which were on the ground and commenced to run, and my friend said "Follow the soldier, and I will take charge of the woman"—he ran up Richfield Street, and I followed, when a constable stopped him at the bottom of George Street—he was walking then—I gave the soldier in charge; I said I thought he had the watch, and I asked the constable to search him, and he said he could not search him there, but must take him to the police-station—he took him back, and then we met Ross coming up; I saw the watch on the prosecutor when he was fighting—he ran away, and left his hat in Union Street—the woman did not interfere in the fight, nor did she say anything to the soldier or the prosecutor that I know of.</p>

               <p>very drunk; the woman was sober—I did not hear the soldier say "Give me my gloves"—I saw him pick them up—he did not say to the woman" Give me my gloves"—I cannot swear whether she gave him the gloves, but I know he returned for his gloves—I saw them in his hand—my friend said that the soldier picked them up—I saw the soldier return for the gloves, but I did not see him pick them up, or see the woman give them—my friend was not called before the Magistrate; he is not here—it was the corner of Union Street that I saw something glitter in the soldier's hand—directly he picked up the prosecutor—I did not tell the constable Gill that I could not tell which of them had the watch—I said "I suspect he has the man's watch," or words to that effect—I did not look in his hands then—I saw something glitter in his hand, and then he ran away—it was not in his hand when the constable was bringing him back, but in his pocket—I have not said a word about that before—I saw him fumbling about, but I did not know what for—I saw the constable take his gloves at the police-station—he had a cane in his hand, but I cannot recollect whether that was taken from him at the station—I heard the woman say to him "Go," when he commenced to run up Titchfield Street after he came back for his gloves—my friend stayed with the woman; she followed up—I did not see him pick up his cane—I did not see it in his hand when struggling with the prosecutor—I know some canes used by soldiers have a silver top and a bright ferrule.</p>

               <p>stood talking some time, and went along Mortimer Street again towards Great Richfield Street—I took no more notice of them, but proceeded on my beat—I afterwards heard cries of "Stop thief," and met the soldier in company of Constable Gill, who said that the soldier had knocked a man down and taken his watch—I took the woman in custody, and came back along Union Street—I heard them say the soldier had got the watch in his hand, and I said to the constable "Take the watch out of his hand"—it was in his left hand—he had gloves in his hand, I think—the prosecutor identified the watch at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were all together when I first saw them—I understood Stevens to say on the way to the Tottenham Court Station that the soldier had the watch in his hand—there was an officer on each side of him—the watch, I believe, was in the gloves—Holmes was not drunk—the prosecutor was a little that way—I have never seen him since he was at the police-court—I heard him say that he first saw the soldier at Regent Circus—I did not hear him say how long he had been with the woman—he said that he did not know which prisoner had taken the watch—the woman cross-examined him at the police-court; she suggested that the soldier and the prosecutor had been in company all day, and the prosecutor said he had never seen Holmes till he got to Regent Cirous—he did not say how long he had been with the woman, but that he met them at Regent Circus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Ross.</hi> I took you at once when I met you and the soldier—I said I had been watching you previously—I had to take the watch from the soldier's hand—I did not have much scuffle—I do not remember one or the other saying "He has got it up his sleeve"—the prosecutor did not say at the police-court that he was certain the soldier took the watch—he said he did not know which of the prisoners it was. Holmes received an excellent character from his superior officers. Ross, in a long written defence, stated that she met the prosecutor, who was bleeding from the right temple; that she wiped his face, and he gave her a few shillings; that Holmes came by, and seemed friendly with the prosecutor, but when they got to the corner they had a fight, and Holmes ran down the street; that two young men came up, and she said to them "Run after the soldier, he has got the man's watch;" that they then ran after him, and she stood there till they came back, when she was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>money?" I said, "Miss Madeline;" she said nothing more—between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday, 5th May, I was coming from the back of the premises with a piece of paper tied on a stick, for the purpose of lighting the two lamps outside—as I passed out through the door I saw Mr. Martin leaning against the partition—the prisoner was on the inside of the bar talking to him, leaning on the counter; there was nobody else behind the bar; there were two men standing inside the large compartment, where Donovan was sitting down against the side of the wall—I went out to the front of the house and lit the lamps—my atten<lb/>tion was attracted by hearing a bottle smash, and I saw Mrs. Donovan passing in the road, with Martin leaning on her arm—I heard Martin say, "Oh, my God, I am blinded!"—it was about two minutes after I had come out that I saw Martin and Donovan come out of the same door—I went inside with the stick, and saw the prisoner there with her hand on the engine, behind the bar; she said, "There is something the matter with Martin, John," and she told me to run after, him—while I was outside I did not notice any one pass in or out at the door except Mrs. Donovan and Martin—I did not see which compartment they came out of—I did not see them till they were in the road—when I left the place they were in separate compartments—when this was said to me by the prisoner I went to King's College Hospital, after Martin—'there are doors in the compartments, but only two outer doors—before I went out to light the lamps I saw Mrs. McIlvey sitting at the end of the bar parlour, the other side of that door, towards the stairs—Mrs. Donovan and Martin had got to the hospital before I arrived—I saw Martin standing on the mat in the hall—I spoke to him; the house surgeon came down, and I spoke to him again in the house surgeon's presence; he was then taken into the surgery; there were white marks down his face and forehead, and his eyes were closed; his face was dressed, and then I helped to take him to the ward, and stopped with him till the bed was ready—during the time I was at the hospital he made two or three statements to me—when I first saw him on the mat I said to him, "Can you tell me what is the matter with you?" he said, "John, there is something been thrown in my face"—I asked him if he could tell me who had done it, and he said he had not the remotest idea—I repeated that to him when the house surgeon came down, and he made the same answer—when I took him up to bed I said to him again, "Now come, Mr. Martin, if you have any idea who has done it, tell me?" and he said, "If anybody has done it, it was not done intentionally"—he then gave me some papers to take to his wife—when I went back home the prisoner was in the bar with her mother; she asked me what was the matter with Martin—I told her somebody had thrown something into his face, and she said, "Good Lord, I wonder who has done it!"—this little door underneath the flap is generally kept open—they have a large dog in the bar—about eleven that night I saw Mr. Mcllvey and his daughter Madeline come home; they had been to Drury Lane theatre—the prisoner is sometimes called "Polly".</p>

I am the wife of John Donovan, a costermonger, and lived at 9, Gilbert Street, Clare Market—I am a charwoman; I work for Mr. Mcllvey at the Rising Sun—on the evening of 5th May I was there from 8 o'clock; I was in the large compartment reading the newspaper against the partition close to the private bar—there were two gentlemen in the same compartment; the prisoner was behind the bar talking to Mr. Martin, who was in the small compartment; they were chaffing something about his dinner—he said he had some lamb and green peas—they were both laughing about it—I heard no more until I heard him halloa "Oh, my God, I am blinded; take me to the hospital"—I went through the little trap-door in the partition and ran to him, took him by the arm, and led him out immediately—I saw no one but him in that compartment, and no one behind the bar but the prisoner, and nobody in the other compartment but the two gentlemen—the prisoner began to laugh when Martin said "I am blinded"—she ran to wake up her mamma, who was asleep in the bar-parlour—I went out with Mr. Martin; I did not see Higgins; I had seen him come through the bar with a long stick in his hand and go out to light the lamps; that was about ten minutes before Martin called out—I saw no one when I got outside, only people passing by—on the way to the hospital I asked Martin who had done it, how it had happened, and what it was—he said he did not know, to lead him as fast as I could to the hospital, he could not see which way he was going, and to mind that nobody pushed him—nobody assisted me with him to the hospital—just as he halloaed I heard a break of glass; I don't where it was, whether inside or outside, I heard something fall—I left him at the hospital and came back, and I met the prisoner half way going there; she said "Where is Mr. Martin?"—I said "In the hospital; they have kept him in; I believe he is blinded;" she said she should go and see the doctors herself to tell them how it happened—I went back to the hospital with her—she saw the doctors; there were two; one of them asked her if she was his wife; she said no, she was the person who was in the bar at the time, and they walked</p>

I am the wife of George Taylor, of 11, Gilbert Street, Clare Market—I have a stall in the street—on the night of 5th May, about a quarter to 9 o'clock, I was sitting at my stall, opposite the next house to the Rising Sun—the first thing I saw was Mrs. Donovan leading Mr. Martin out of the house—I asked her what was the matter; she made no answer, but went away leading him to the hospital—I heard some glass thrown out at the private entrance two or three minutes after Mrs. Donovan came out, about as near one time as the two gentlemen came out from the big entrance; the glass came out of the small entrance just about the same time—I did not see it, I heard it go into the road—Mrs. Donovan came out two or three minutes before the two gentlemen—I don't think she had got 20 yards, not so much as across this court—I had never seen them before; they walked in the road, towards Glare Market.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at King's College Hospital—on 5th May I was there when Martin was brought in to the surgery—he was suffering from a burnt face, he was quite sensible—I am not sure whether I saw Mrs. Donovan or the prisoner—Martin was put to bed, and I attended to him at once; he was under my care till he died, on 26th May, about a quarter past 7 p.m.—it was a serious case—Mr. Henry Smith, one of the surgeons of the hospital, saw him from time to time—the injuries extended over the whole of the face, with the exception of a little of the chin, up to the hair, the eyes, nose, and part of the lower lip and chin—it was burnt to the depth of the skin—he was blinded at the time, his eyes were closed; if he had recovered from the injuries he would have lost the sight of one eye—I formed the opinion that the injury was caused by sulphuric acid, vitriol—I tried it—I saw his clothes, they were marked by the same acid, and his hat was damaged underneath—he progressed very satisfactorily for a fortnight; on the 19th, the Thursday week before he died, he became delirious and seriously ill, and got gradually worse until his death—I did not speak to him with regard to his dangerous condition—during the last week he was some<lb/>times delirious, and sometimes conscious—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—Mr. Barrow was present—the heart was seriously diseased, the liver slightly—he had erysipelas, the result of the injury; the immediate cause of death was the heart disease—the throwing of the vitriol would undoubtedly tend to shorten his life, and in my judgment it did so—irrespective of being injured, there was nothing to cause his immediate death—a thing of this kind would cause a great shock to the system—he had recovered from the shock, that lasted for a day or two—the erysipelas</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188106270045"/>
               <p>acting on the heart disease killed him—he might hare lived for month or years as far as the heart disease went—the state of the liver had nothing to do with the death; that was not produced by excessive drinking—I should think it was the result of former inflammation—I believe the kidneys were very slightly diseased, that had nothing to do with the cause of death—I think I had one conversation with the man some time in the week following the injury—he told me he did not know who did it; nothing more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said that to the man who brought him in, in my presence when he was admitted—I think it was Higgins—I don't think the prisoner came and offered to describe to me the position in which she was standing—the decided; symptoms of erysipelas only intervened two days before the death—he was delirious a week before his death; he might have lived for months with the heart disease, or he might have dropped down dead at any time—there was a considerable quantity of fluid in the brain and lungs, consequent upon the heart disease; it was a disease of one of the valves—I do not think there was sufficient fluid to react on the heart and stop its action; it might, but, in my opinion, it did not—it might paralyse the nerve centres, and so end in death—I have been house-surgeon some months this year—I have been five years in the hospital; six months as assistant house-surgeon, at other times dresser and student—the aggravation of the heart disease was caused by the erysipelas without doubt, it was of such a severe, nature—there is such a thing such as idiopathic erysipelas without injury, but it is not common—he raved; I did not hear him mention names—a sister and a nurse attended him—I saw him on the morning of his death; he was conscious then—his relations constantly visited him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When there are several parts of the body affected it is a difficult matter to decide which is the principal factor in killing—the disease of the kidneys was very slight; it possibly arose through drink—there was a small quantity of fluid in the lungs, and some serous fluid in the brain—I did not notice a considerable quantity, I should think about two or three ounces; it was not measured; if; might possibly react on the heart; but it is very common to see a much larger collection of fluid in the brain without affecting the heart; it was valvular disease of the heart, and there was also adherent peritoneum, adherent to the surface of the heart.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it was between 2 and 3 in the afternoon that I administered extreme unction—one of his brothers was there, and one of his sisters, and I think his wife, but I am not certain—he did not repeat a part of the prayer after me; he did not make an act of contrition—he was moaning; he was not in a state to speak articulately—I did not see him again before he died—Elizabeth Martin was not one of the sisters who was present by his bedside—the sister was kneeling down by the bedside; I was standing on the other side, close to his face—he did not think he was so bad on the Sunday when I spoke to him—that was my first visit—he did not express any hope of recovery on that day, he merely alluded to the pain he was in; he did not express any opinion one way or the other; he did not appear to think he was going to die.</p>

The deceased was my brother; he was clerk to Mr. Nathan, the Sheriff's officer, of Chancery Lane, and was 41 years of age—I went to the hospital, and saw him on the Thursday that he died; I had seen him once before, on the Saturday previous; it was between one and two on the afternoon of Thursday that I saw him; the last witness was there; I said to him, "Bill, you haven't long for this world; a few moments and you will be before your Almighty; now, tell me who did this?" he hesitated for a minute, and then said, "Polly Mcllvey did it"—the sister of the hospital was standing by, and I said, "What do you think of that, sister? you heard it;" she said, "Yes;" she gave me a nod of the head, a kind of recognition—the nurse came round the bedside and said, "I think he wants the priest; you had better go for him"—I immediately went for Father Denny; he came in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I did not go to the bedside with him; I went afterwards, and I asked him whether he was certain that Polly Mcllvey did this crime, and he said as before that Polly Mcllvey did it; Elizabeth then said to him, "Are you sure Polly Mcllvey did this?" I believe he answered "Yes"—that was all that took place—I then left, and consulted the secretary of the hospital—from what he said, I went and saw Scandrett, the officer, and brought him to the hospital; I took him to the bedside—Elizabeth Martin was there, and I said, "Bill, tell me once again who did this?" and he said, "Polly did it;". or "Polly," I won't be sure—I said to him, to make certain, "Are you certain Polly did it?" and he said "Yes"—he was not quite so strong then as he was the first time he made the statement to me; he was sinking, but he was perfectly conscious—I believe the priest came to administer the last rites of the Church on the 26th, between three and four o'clock—it was about half-past four or five when I took the detective to his bedside, perhaps earlier it may have been as late as six—the detective did not go to his bedside more than once with me—I witnessed the priest administer the last rites, through a little glass door in the corridor—the deceased was conscious—I could see he was praying when I was by his bedside—my first interview with him was about two hours, from between one and two to between three and four—the conversation about seeing the clergy was perhaps half an hour or an hour before he told me who did it—it might have been a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before the priest came—I swear that the deceased was perfectly conscious at the time the priest administered the rites of the Church, because when I went to his bedside after Father Denny left and spoke to him he answered me, and appeared perfectly to understand—I told him the position he was in, and that he had only so-and-so to live—he simply shook his head and said "Yes," or</p>

On 1st June I went with Scandrett to McIlvey's, and saw the prisoner behind the bar—her father, mother, and sinter were there—I had previously asked the father whether he had any objection to the prisoner answering a question—I then said to her, "Will you show me where you were standing, and where Martin was when the vitriol was thrown?"—she moved and placed herself in a position right opposite the partition, and placed one hand on the bar of each compartment, and said, "This is how I was standing; I was looking into this bar," the large one, "and my hand was on this," the small one, "where Martin was; I do not know where he was standing, I could not see him, but I heard him say 'Good night;' I then heard him cry out, and I turned round and saw what was the matter; there were two men in the other bar, and after Martin had cried out they came round into the bar where he was"—I said to Scandrett, "Where are the marks?"—the prisoner said, "Here they are," and pointed out the stains on the counter—the father said, ", There is another stain on the floor outside"—the</p>

I received instructions at the police-station that these premises were attempted the night previous—about 2 o'clock on the 28th I was in Mare Street, Hackney, with other constables—I tried the stable-door and found it was pulled back; I gave it a sudden jerk, and it came open; I saw Smith—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he made a run towards the back premises—I heard another person; I took out my rattle and sprang it; I returned to Mare Street; I saw the prisoners come out of 81, an unoccupied shop, and Police-constable 85 coming to my assistance; he was on the opposite side—I closed with Steed and took him into custody—he threw this jemmy into the road—on the way to the station I was joined by Police-constable Lewis, who took a lamp from Steed's left-hand pocket—Steed said, "Oh, that is nothing, that is only an attempt"—I afterwards examined the shutters of No. 85—I found three marks to correspond with one end of the jemmy and one with the other—it is a rasp turned into a jemmy—I was present when Lewis searched Steed at the station—this large key was found on him—it opened 81, Mare Street—he also had a steel from a woman's stays.</p>

               <p>the 6th May last, between 3 and 4 p.m., I was in Lichfield Street—I was carrying a bag with one arm and a chicken with the other—I had been out shopping—in ray bag I had a large red purse with the change of a sovereign, about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a lace handkerchief—I had been about ten minutes on my journey, and when coming back the prisoner watched me from the opposite side—I should have gone across, but could not do so for a van—there were five men boxing, two were near and the other three farther away; two came over, and one struck me on the chest very hard indeed and nearly knocked me backwards, and he wrenched my bag away—the prisoner went into a passage and I followed him—he went into a house; I waited outside; he came out again in about three minutes; he saw me in the midst of a lot of children; he had his hands in his pockets—I got a policeman to follow him—shortly after three policemen came up and brought me my bag; the purse was missing—next day I was at my own door in St. Martin's Lane and saw the prisoner; he saw me looking about and he ran away—I afterwards saw him in custody at Marlborough Street among seven or eight others, and I picked him out without any difficulty.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 96, Grosvenor Road, Highbury New Park, Islington—on 3rd June I retired to rest about 11 p.m., and left the house safe—a plate-basket, containing plated and silver articles, was left in the breakfast parlour—at about 6.30 next morning my attention was called to the window of the breakfast-parlour, the fastening of which had been pushed out, and the plate was gone—I have since seen it, and identified the whole of it.</p>

On Saturday, 4th June, I was on duty in Golden Lane, at about 10.15 a.m., when I saw the prisoner carrying a paper parcel containing a fork and two dessert spoons—I stopped her as she was coming out of a pawn shop—I examined the parcel, and asked her what she had been in the shop for, and she said, "To pledge them"—I asked her where she had got them from—she said, "From a man in Brushfield Street, by Bishopsgate Street," but she did not know his name—I told her I should charge her with the unlawful possession of them—I took her to the station, and she was searched, and this broken silver was found on her, and all these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found out the owner the same day—I went to the Vintners' Company, the forks having the Vintners' mark on the back, and that is how I traced the owner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in her defence stated that a man stopped her and asked her to take the articles to Barbican and sell them for old silver; that she took them to the refiner's but was too early to see the party; that when she opened the parcel she found it contained broken silver and she would not have taken it if she had known that; that on having the shop she saw a pawnbroker's, and took them in there where they said it did not suit them and as she came out she met the policeman who charged her.</hi>

I am the landlord of the Ship and Lobster public-house, at Denton, below Gravesend—on the Thursday before Good Friday I saw Yelverton Daly about 11 p.m.—the other two prisoners were with him—they all slept at my house—Yelverton Daly said he expected a yacht called the Firefly, and wanted to know whether I had seen her—I said no—my public-house is on the river bank—I saw no yacht that resembled the one described to me—on Wednesday, May 4th, I saw Yelverton Daly, who asked me if anybody had been to make inquiries respecting his sleeping at my house—I said nobody had—he said "Should anybody make those inquiries, you don't know everybody who sleeps at your house"—I said "Of course you cannot remember everybody, some you can and some you cannot"—that was said in the presence of some boatmen.</p>

I live at Strood—I am a water policeman on the Medway—I own several boats—last Good Friday I saw the prisoners on the esplanade at Rochester, about 11 a.m.—Yelverton Daly asked me if he could have a boat at 2 o'clock in the afternoon—he paid a shilling deposit to my father—they returned about two—I had a boat ready called the Violet—I had also a smaller boat lying there, and Yelverton Daly wished to have that one—it had no name—I said it was not for hire, and tried to put him off, but he would have that one, and I let him have the boat without a name—they paid three hours in advance, half-a-crown—they rowed away from Rochester and did not return, nor did the boat—you can get to Shellness and Warden Point by rowing—I inquired for the boat and could hear nothing of her—on Friday, the 13th May, I went with Mr. Greenley to Laisdale, near Sheerness—I there saw my boat in charge of the coastguardsman—she was much better for a dingy than any other boat—I have no doubt about her being the boat—I afterwards went to Newgate and picked the prisoners out—I have no doubt about them—my boat is not much use now.</p>

They hired a boat for a row in the river, and as their own boat was leaky they took it on the launch. He wrote to Mr. Band, asking for his account, but the letter must have been lost. It was not his fault if V. C. Blake was a timid man and disappeared, and therefore could not come and say he had sold him the boat; the vessel was still to be found, about 15 miles from Herne Bay or Whitstable, and Lloyds could search for her, but the prosecution having been begun by some hot-headed member of that body, they knew the effect of a failure to convict, and felt bound to go through with it.</hi>)</p>

I cannot tell how often I repeated the question to Thompson, but I asked him till he heard it—I don't know his handwriting—I asked him a great many questions previous to this—this question terminated the examination—I can't tell you how long he was under examination—I did not take notes, only of assets and liabilities—there was no other proof objected to—there was a suggestion that Thompson's brothers should be objected to, or looked into, but it was not acted on at that meeting—I don't know that Fossett's brother's was objected to—the meeting was as quiet as any meeting I have attended up to the time this was found out—as a rule, a great many questions are asked, sometimes by two or three people at the same time, but that was not the cass at this time—when Thompson was under examination the man was so deaf I had to shout.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, of 9, Old Square, Lincoln's Inn—I have a house at Newton Manor, Bletchley, with shooting, attached—I advertised it last autumn, and received a reply from Blythe Barrington Brown, Dashville Road, Shepherd's Bush—letters passed, and then I saw the prisoner and let him the house and the shooting, at 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, soon after 29th September—he was given pos<lb/>session soon after—he never paid any rent, but since his incarceration</p>

                  </hi> I am a commission agent, of 162, Coventry Road, Birmingham—in October or November last I received some letters from Blythe Barrington Brown, in consequence of which I sent him two guns, one at 6 guineas, in October, and one at 10 guineas, in, I think, November—I received letters acknowledging the receipt—I have never been paid—I took proceedings in the Mayor's Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. That was because both the guns were sent from the City—the solicitor said that he might run the proceedings up to any amount, he should not pay—I had no wish to take proceedings in any Court particularly, I had given it up as a bad debt almost—I did not make an affidavit that I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I tried to get the money by civil proceedings in the Mayor's Court—I am not accessory to the criminal proceedings—I did not receive a letter from the prisoner offering to return the guns when I put him in the Mayor's Court—I do not have business in guns once in five years—I do not think I made an affidavit that the cause of action was in the City, I left that to my solicitor—I sent one of our apprentices to Bletchley, and the prisoner offered to pay the money, but he did not get it—the offer was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if a cheque had been enclosed I should have been delighted to have received it—I always open my business letters—I sent all these letters to my solicitor—the offer was not to return the guns, it was never mentioned—the apprentice told me what the offer was worth—the prisoner's father is a large farmer in that neighbourhood—I have never refused to receive the guns back—I was compelled to come here—he deliberately made a statement at the Lord Mayor's Court so as to run the costs up—the person who went to Bletchley is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Fortunately I have no solicitor, but I consulted one—this prosecution was not commenced by me, but I was required to attend as a witness—I have seen the guns and the ticket of one of them—when the case came on I discovered that they were pledged.</p>

Tredgold—he said "I did not steal it, I bought it of him; he pressed it on me"—I said "You will be taken to London, and charged with obtaining goods of Mr. Greener"—he said "I bought those likewise"—I asked his address—he said "Wheatley," which is a village six miles from Oxford—I said "It will be necessary for me to go there, as I am desirous of finding these goods and the gun"—he said "It is no use you going there, they are not there"—I afterwards went there, and received all these pawntickets from a woman who told me she was Mrs. Brown, and some I found in a drawer with a quantity of letters—among the tickets was one for a gun pledged at Whistler's in the Strand on 5th February, also one for a hunting-glass at Vaughan's, one for a bagatelle table and opera-glass at Gascoigne's, one for billiard balls pledged at Rolls's, of Bedford, on 20th March—one relating to Mr. Jenkinson's saddle, pledged with Mr. Vaughan; one for Mr. Angel's watches, pawned on 5th March for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Skinner's gun was pledged on 24th January for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—here is a ticket from Powell for a double breechloader pledged on 8th January for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found that the prisoner. pledged some harness, and I found all the correspondence from the various tradesmen at his lodgings relating to these articles.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 24th May last I was lodging at 1, Ford Street, Canning Town, in the house of Mrs. Goes—a woman named Elizabeth Maddison lives at No. 2—I saw the prisoner in the house between six and seven o'clock, and also the prosecutor Hart, who was in Elisabeth Maddison's room, and Harriet Grouse and Mrs. Maddison—I went out to fetch some ale and change for a sovereign—when I came back I found the prosecutor and the prisoner and the two women still in the room—they drank the ale—Hart was intoxicated—I got a second half-gallon when the prisoner gave me a two-shilling piece, and I brought him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—he was then standing by the bedstead—when I got back he and Mrs. Maddison left the room—Mrs. Maddison came back imme<lb/>diately after, leaving Hart outside—I saw the prisoner standing by the table with a purse in his hand, counting the money, and he laid out the silver and coppers on the table—I saw the purse contained gold, but I did not see how much—Mrs. Maddison then said to the prisoner that Hart was coming back—at that moment Hart opened the door and came in, and Harriet Grouse picked up the coppers from between the silver, and said to the prisoner, "The coppers belong to you," and she put them in her own pocket, and the prisoner picked up the purse and put the purse and the silver in his pocket—the prisoner and the two women went out and left the prosecutor in the room—I followed them out, and they went into a little room on the next landing—I stayed on the landing—I attempted to open the door, and the prisoner said, "We don't want to have the blot in it"—Harriet Grouse came and shut the door—I stayed outside and heard her say to one of them, I think it was to Maddison, "What will he do when he finds his money cone?" and the prisoner said, "You leave that to me, I will see him all right"—there was no other man in the room besides—the prisoner then came out, and as Mrs. Maddison and the prisoner were going into Mrs. Maddison's room again I said to Mrs. Maddison, "If anything comes to light you know I am chief witness," and she said, "Go down stairs, we are going to try to get him away now"—I afterwards went down, and heard a quarrel upstairs, and Mrs. Maddison went upstairs before me—I saw the prisoner strike Hart in Mrs. Maddison's room—he knocked him across the bedstead, and the second time he knocked him along the washstand, which I believe caused him to cut his head—I said to Mrs. Maddison, "You had better give it back to the prosecutor, and if anything comes to light I shall have to go as witness," and she said, "Wouldn't you like to see it?" I said, "You might well like to see it, when you have got the poor man's earnings"—Hart was then asleep—he was not asleep when</p>

Dick's, value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including those in the cart—I went into the bar of the public-house, and found the prisoner there—I did not speak to him, but asked the landlord in his presence if he knew anything about the stones; the prisoner answered that the landlord did not—I asked the prisoner what he was going to do with the stones; he said that he was very sorry for bringing them there—after we left the tavern he said that if I would not say anything about the stones he would take them back—I told him I had no authority, and went down the tramway; he followed me—I then went to the station and gave him in charges—he said "There is more than one in it; Lovedale gave me permission to take them."</p>

He further stated that when arrested he told the detective the name of the thief and that he would be at the corner of Great Suffolk Street at 12 o'clock, but that they were satisfied with having somebody in custody and did not go there. He contended that a gross injustice would be done by convicting him, and that Taylor would escape; but that if he was set at liberty he would aid Sergeant Harvey in bringing Taylor to justice.</hi>
