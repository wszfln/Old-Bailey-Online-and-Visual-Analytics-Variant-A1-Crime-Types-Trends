                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at No. 6, Adelphi-terrace, facing the river. I know, the defendant—I believe him to, be the occupier of a wharf and premises on the bank of the river, in front of the terrace—it is called, I believe, Western-wharf—be is a dung merchant—the business carried on there is collecting dung from various parts of the town, and col<lb/>lecting it in a barge, or barges, in front of his premises, and sometimes on the wharf—it sometimes remains in the cart before it is dragged down to the barge, and when there the cart remains nearer to our noses—I have known the carts remain on the wharf all night—I have observed this between 1st Jan. and Oct. this year—it is so frequent, that you may see it whenever you choose to look—I observed it last Friday, morning, but have not observed it so much lately, as I have been a great of town—the barges are moored close to the wharf, at varying distances from high to low water mark—sometimes, they are dry, but, generally speaking, they are afloat—the manure remains in the barges until it smells very badly, sometimes for eight or ten days)—it is a large barge, a lighter, and is filled by degrees, in about eight or ten days—the manure is not always taken away in the barge, it is sometimes transhipped—it is sometimes stable manure, sometimes cow dung; in fact, it is an <hi rend="italic">omnium gatherum</hi>—we strongly suspect that there is human ordure, or contents of privies, from the intolerable stench, but I have not seen it—I have observed vegetable matter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170002"/>
               <p>among it—there was an instance of a very large amount of carrots put into the barge, some months ago, which very nearly destroyed us—they were in a state of extreme decomposition—they had been secreted under the Adelphi arches for some time, by somebody else, and I believe Mr. Clewley was employed to remove them—I have not observed cabbages there of late—I used to keep a register of these things some years ago, when we were bringing him up before the parish, but latterly I have left it to my neighbours—the stench latterly has been that of stable manure—it is very bad at times—we have suffered very great inconvenience from it all over the house—as a medical man, I consider it injurious to health, and can prove that it has been particularly so in our neighbourhood—when it is being put from the carts into the barge, or from the large barge into the little barge, the whole buildings, almost to the Strand, are affected by it—Messrs. Coutts's banking house is affected by it just as much as we axe—some few years ago, I was continually speaking to the defendant about it, and have told him, as a neighbour, that there was a duty which he owed to us, to keep his premises more tidy; but he was always very rude—these conversations have been at his wharf, or at his door—I addressed him as the person conducting the business—I have seen him on the barges, directing his men—I believe he very seldom does anything himself but he sees that others do it—the turning takes place at various times of the day, and it becomes worse and worse in proportion as it is turned—it decays in the barge, and then becomes worse—turning it makes it ferment more, but I believe the inten<lb/>sion is to make it a more uniform compost for the market gardeners—there have been general complaints about this wharf and barges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you aware that there are four common sewers within a short distance of your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two at Scotland-yard, one at the Adelphi, and one at the Waterman's Pier; there is one under the east, and another under the west end of the terrace—when the wind is south-west is blows directly on to the terrace—no doubt we smell the sewers sometimes—there is no smell from long litter, which is straw not quite trod<lb/>den into manure, partially used only—I have said that you were very rude to me—I never took up my stick to strike you or anybody else—you did not say, "By God I will pay you if you strike me with that stick"—I never could have forgotten it if it had occurred—the greater part that I have seen lately has been stable manure, as far as my knowledge goes—I have not seen anything else for months, but I only see it when I come to town—I have seen dung standing in the carts in the evening, and in the morning; I cannot say whether the water has been down then, so that you could not get to the barge—the barge reeks—I have not observed more than one cart—I did smoke a cigar there when I was engaged with the parish in putting down this abominable nuisance—it used to be a favourite walk some years ago, until they made it such a filthy place that nobody could go there—a smell undoubtedly arises from the urinal under the Adelphi, which is much frequented—the parish sweepings are not taken down there, they sweep the streets now which they did not formerly—I do not think it is swept into your dock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far is it from high water mark to where the barge is moored? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty or twenty-five yards; but I can only judge from the fact, that when John Gore was here, I had a line struck from my bedroom window to his barge, and it was fifty-one yards off, including the breadth of the terrace.</p>

               <p>official referee under the Metropolitan Buildings Act carries on business there, and has from eighteen to twenty clerks; I have charge of the house, and live in it—the defendant's, barge lies forty or fifty yards westward of No. 6—it is permanently moored there, and contains an accumulation of horse dung principally, and I believe cow dung, but cannot say positively—I cannot say that I have noticed vegetable matter—I have seen carts bring; the stuff down to the barge, and have afterwards seen it transhipped from one barge to another, the effect of which is a very disagreeable stench when the wind is in the south-west—I have not seen the defendant on the barge for the last three or four months, but before that repeatedly, giving direc<lb/>tions to his men apparently, who were emptying the dung out of the cart into the barge—I have not complained to nun about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you aware that there are sewers at Scotland-yard, and, one at West-wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; 1 have repeatedly passed Fleet-ditch in a steamboat, when the water hat been up, but never noticed any smell there; the tide stops the smell from coming down—a smell may possibly arise from the Adelphi arches, the urine place there smells very bad at times, but not, like a cart load of dung—I have not seen your son or any of your men throw up mud out of the river into your barge—I have frequently seen a barge load of long litter put into your barge between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, but there is horse dung among it—when I was getting up this morning, the steam was rising, from your barge in an immense cloud—it was not fog, but steam from the barge—the barge has been nearly full all the week, and steaming all the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a smell from it this morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not notice it; it is when the wind is south-west that we catch it—the soft stuff that I have seen could not be dry litter from the stable—dry litter will smell when the rain comes on it, because it gets decomposed; but if it did not remain there long there would be no smell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you lived there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten years—this busi<lb/>ness has been carried on four of five years, and for the last three or four years by the defendant—I went to the house when the official referee went—I do not think the stench has increased, it is about the same as it has been for the last two or three years, nor has the quantity increased, or the nature of it become more offensive.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house decorator, of No. 2. Villiers-street, Strand, immediately opposite the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> where this business is carried on, so that I get the full benefit—it is underneath the terrace, below one street and above another—I occupy a long arch seventy or eighty feet long—there are three <hi rend="italic">rides</hi> fronting the terrace—this is the west <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>—my arch is ten yards from the defendant's wharf—I have a workshop there, and live in Villiers-street—I sometimes employ three or four workmen, principally in painting sign boards—from Jan. to Oct. I have seen dung of all descrip<lb/>tions brought to the defendant's wharf—it seemed like horse dung, but from the desperate smell I should think there is some pig's dung—the man I had there most frequently is obliged to stay away, as he cannot stand, it—he has complained to me most bitterly about it, and an apprentice I had there was taken with a slow fever two months ago, and was laid up for nearly a month—the stuff was reeking last Thursday—the arch I occupy has only a wooden floor, and the street is underneath where the carts pass along—when we open the windows to get a breath of fresh air, the smell is very fearful—when the tide goes down, there is a slope, and that is called the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>—on account of the construction of our place, we get the stench</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170006"/>
               <p>from the barge from almost every quarter from which the wind blows—it is very offensive, and smells more like night soil than anything else—I have a knowledge of the sort of smell, being a plumber—it smells more like soil from privies than stable dung—the stuff in the carts is sometimes in a decomposed state, but not always—it is let drop all along the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>, and lies there till it festers, and the whole <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> is covered with it, and it is then gathered up, and put into the barge—I have seen the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> covered with it for a week, stinking all the time—it may take a fortnight to fill the barge—I have seen it turned into the barge, and then the smell is increased, and the same when it is put in other barges—Mr. Gore's nuisance is totally removed, so that whatever smell comes now, comes from the defendant's place—our men complain more of this than they did of Gore's even while Gore was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you aware of the sewers there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am not aware of one in Villiers-street—I have refrained from coming to you, because I knew the sort of reception I should meet with—you cannot help old Father Thames washing the stuff up, but you leave it there for him to turn it into manure—I never saw straw thrown overboard from the barges unloading at Hungerford—I have seen it fell out of the carts—I never saw a whole cart load of straw washed up at one tide, nor did I see any on Thursday last—I am sometimes there every day in the week, and sometimes for a whole day at a time—there is a smell from the dark arches, but nothing equal to what comes from your place—I am aware that Milligan and Henderson, hay. and straw salesmen, have stables there—am not aware that their dung hole was done away with last summer—I am not aware that the litter is taken every morning out of Mr. Hender<lb/>son's stable—I came here because I was subpoenaed.</p>

On 9th Jan. last I inspected the defendant's Wharf and barge—I have my original memo<lb/>randum here which I made at the time, for the information of the Board of Health—I went down to inspect Gore's premises, and also to ascertain whether there were any other nuisances of a like nature, and with respect to the defendant's, I state that I saw barges there loading with apparently reeking stable manure, the smell from which was very offensive, and quite perceptible from the terrace and the streets adjoining—that was so—it was in a most offensive state, wet steam was rising from it, and it smelt like stuff from a very badly kept stable—on 24th Jan. I again inspected the defendant's wharf—there was a barge partly laden with the same kind of manure waiting there at the time—it was not quite so bad as before—on the first occasion they were turning it over, on the second the wharf was idle, I think it was dinner time—there was a very perceptible smell, but not so offensive as before—I saw the defendant on the first occasion, and asked him if he was the owner of the wharf—he said he was the occupier of it—I made some remark about the offensiveness of the dung, and he was so Very insolent that I was obliged to leave him—I did not tell him who I came from.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer; I am a superintendent inspec<lb/>tor appointed by Board of Health. I was directed by the president of the Board of Health to visit Olewley's wharf, on 4th Oct last—Gore's was the adjoining wharf, but he had then entirely discontinued his business—I observed a barge on the defendant's wharf, with manure in it—the wharf is what is called a draw-dock, where carts go down to load and unload—it was low tide, and the barge was aground—there were no carts there then—the barge contained stable manure mainly, and a very small quantity of vegeta<lb/>ble matter besides; leaves of cabbages—it had a strong pungent smell, the smell of manure of that kind—it was not very strong that day—the barge was about three parts full; the manure was then undergoing the process of decomposition—I did not go again—I made a report to the President of the Board of Trade—the result of placing the manure in the barge was offensive from the evaporation that took place, the exhalation from the manure in a state of decomposition—I considered it offensive—the stirring up of manure of that kind would of course be offensive; a nuisance of that kind would no doubt be calculated to make the houses of the persons in Adelphi-terrace uncomfortable for their occupation—I considered it a nuisance.</p>

There are three boxes kept at the church, fastened against the wall—two are for the congregation to put in their offerings, and the other is the poor box—on 4th Dec. I saw some marks on the wall of the refectory, which is part of the dwelling house, and in the course of the morning I found half a button on the ground underneath the window</p>

               <p>inside, which I gave to the constable—there is a communication from the refectory to the church by going down the corridor into the narrow corridor, which leads into the church—the boxes were fastened to the wall by screws, which were not fixed very tightly in—I do not know what they contained—the last witness gave me information, but later than he says—it was about half past 3 o'clock, I think—I scarcely believed that what he said was likely to happen, but mentioned it to some of the other Fathers, and we had a man in the house to watch that night, named Nolan—he is not here—he was placed in the corridor—I gave information to Munser, the porter.</p>

I occasionally work in Brompton churchyard—I went to work there on 4th Dec., at about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock; part of it is culti<lb/>vated as a kitchen garden—I found some alms boxes there, which I thought were from the parish church, but did not touch them; I only went within four or five yards of them—I went in a state of consternation to the church, then returned, took one of them up, saw the inscription on it, and knew where it belonged to—about ten minutes afterwards I went to the Oratory, and found one of the Fathers and a constable—I took the constable to the boxes, and he took charge of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Reed; we are stock brokers, in Austin-friars. The prisoner was in our service—he left us about the beginning of Dec, 1854—I dismissed him, for misappropriating a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not give him into custody—about a fortnight after that, I discovered that he had misappropriated 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I spoke to a policeman, and went to Moor-lane, and stated the case, and also to Hamp<lb/>stead, and stated the case there, he living there at that time—I did not see him again till he was apprehended—this is the cheque—it is signed by my partner—it was brought to me by the prisoner, who asked me to mark it for cash, as Mr. Fisher had no banker—I did so, and returned it to him—it was his duty to hand it to Mr. Fisher—I have since paid Mr. Fisher that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., probably within a month—on 28th Oct., here is a sum entered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170014"/>
               <p>of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,. which the prisoner was to pay to Mr. Everett, and he has not paid it—I know the prisoner had it—it is in his writing—he has charged me with the payment of it, and I have had to pay it again—these two trams were discovered after I had dismissed him—I discovered his address at the Eastern Counties Railway—he had given his address there, and I instructed the police to take him on the Friday before the last Session at this Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the Committee were sitting at the Eastern Counties Railway? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I gave instruction at Vine-street station, and to Cole—I did not give instruction to Cole to go to the Eastern Counties, and wait—I did not give instruction to Few—this entry is in the prisoner's handwriting—he was in the habit of getting sums from me to pay various accounts—this was one he would have to pay—I should say he had been with me three or four years—I do not know his age—here are my initials on this cheque—Mr. Reed is not here—I think he has been my partner three years—Mr. Waddington and Mr. Bond have been clients of mine during the whole of the time the prisoner was in my service—here is the cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not charged this in the indict<lb/>ment—I dismissed the prisoner in Dec.—I have never spoken to him about these two items—I have never seen him since I detected these two items—I have never spoken to him with regard to Everett's and Fisher's moneys—I gave information to the police immediately, to a man named Few—I gave information at Hampstead to the inspector, who was there—I do not know his name—I gave orders to apprehend him at Hampstead, and to Few—I gave orders at the Vine-street station only lately—I went there last Friday fortnight, when he was apprehended—I knew he lived at Hampstead, which was why I went there in the first instance—I never got any warrant to apprehend him—my reason for not prosecuting him before is, I have not found him—I have been determined all along to prosecute him the moment I could get him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect sending to his father subsequently to this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that it was not after this—his father called on me, and I had some conversation with him—I think I sent for his father, but to the best of my recollection it was on two other charges—my impression is that it was before I discovered these two items, and with reference to some others, but I will not swear it—I heard that the prisoner had been at Mason's Hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you have not seen the father, and spoken to a gentleman of the name of Kemp, and asked him how he could treat a man there who had robbed you of these sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My impression is, that I have not seen Mr. Kemp since I have heard the prisoner was at that dinner—I do not think I have—my impression is, that I heard he had been about Basinghall-street some mouths after this—I do not know that some rela<lb/>tion of mine was presiding at that dinner—I do not know that my own father in law presided—I never heard so—I heard that the prisoner had been at some place there—we have had a great many dealings with Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were those transactions closed in 1854 or 1853, by. his paying you a large sum of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell how it was settled—the account between us was settled—I have not since made a large demand on Mr. Bond for mining shares—there has been a question with regard to mining shares, involving about 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those are the shares paid for by him, and by his order, put in this young man's name, put</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170015"/>
               <p>in the name of our clerk—Mr. Bond denies that he gave us authority to buy them, and to use any other person's name—I do not know that there has been constantly applications made to the prisoner for payment of calls—I should think, in the ordinary course of business, he would be called on for calls if they knew his address—when I gave information, I do not know what address I gave—probably it would be our own office—I do not know that the address was given at his own private residence—he might probably write the name out himself upon which the shares were given—it would probably not be necessarily known to me at all—I have bought no more shares in his name that I remember—I have some recollection that some years ago a Mr. Smith asked me to put some shares in his name, but what they were I quite forget—it was done for a gentleman that asked me to do it—I believe some shares were put in his name three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you give some evidence before the Eastern Counties Com<lb/>mittee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> gave a repetition of some statement, you cannot call it evidence—I heard Mr. Reed examined, and Mr. Whitehorn's name was mentioned—I heard that they called for me to give my evidence, and I said I was at Guildhall, prosecuting this young man—I did not know at that time that he had been summoned to give evidence before the committee—I know his name was mentioned before the committee on the same Friday that we have talked of—I inquired of the chairman the prisoner's address, and he gave it me, and I immediately put it into the hands of the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear it stated, or did you say yourself, that this young man was very frequently in the matter between you and Mr. Waddingten? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was in Mr. Reed's evidence, I believe—I stated that what Mr. Reed said was true—I mean to swear I have not seen the prisoner since I dismissed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Bond state one set of things, and did you and your partner deny it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is not the general practice for shares to be purchased by clients in the name of other persons—it does occur some<lb/>times—they were bought for Mr. Bond, and by his wish put in the prisoner's name—at the time they were bought he was a client of our house—we had had transactions with him—the prisoner would not, in conse<lb/>quence of that, have any right to appropriate to himself this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd and this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I dismissed him about a 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque—he did not then make any complaint to me about those mining shares, not a word—he did not make any allegation that these mining shares entitled him to take my property.</p>

I have a mast yard there—it is ended on one side by the river, it has a frontage of about thirty feet, which is formed by shutters which are open by day, and shut down at night—there is no other entrance to the yard, only from the street, which is secured by bolts—my dwelling house is over the yard—the yard is the ground floor of my house; I go up stairs from the ground floor—under my room there is a counting house which is approached by stairs out of the yard or ground floor—the door of the counting house was not kept locked—if a person got into the ground floor, they could get to that counting house—on Friday, 16th Nov., I went over my premises a little after 10 o'clock at night—they were all safe—we went to bed at a quarter past 11 o'clock—we heard a noise at a little after 12 o'clock, like one of the shutters falling down, and my dog made a great noise and barked—I lay and listened, and heard another noise—I got out of bed, and looked out of the window—I could not see anything—I went to bed again—I concluded that the noise I heard was at the Salt wharf adjoining—I went to sleep and heard no more about it till the morning—directly the men were let in I came down between 7 and 8 o'clock—I found the door open at the bottom of the stairs, and in the counting house the desk was broken open, and the things all strewed about—I missed the roller comb, and brass roller, and other things; a dress coat, and a pistol which I had never seen—it had been in this case—it was sent to me by the captain of a ship—the case had been locked—I found it forced open, and nothing in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy clerk of the peace for Westminster. Oh Thursday, 13th Sept. last, I was at the adjourned Sessions for Middlesex, holden at Westminster—Mr. Bodkin presided on that occasion—a person, named William Lee was tried—I produce a certificate of the conviction, and also the original indictment found by the Grand Jury—(<hi rend="italic">the indictment was for stealing a pocket book</hi>, 1152., <hi rend="italic">and a cheque for</hi> 122. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">of William Horwell, from his person; and the certificate staled the conviction of the said William Lee, upon his own confession of the said offence, and thai he was sen<lb/>tenced to six years penal servitude</hi>) when Lee was arraigned he, in the first instance, pleaded not guilty; that plea was afterwards withdrawn, and he pleaded guilty—here is an entry in the indictment, which means not guilty, and <hi rend="italic">retracts</hi>, for retracts and confesses—while that plea of guilty was upon the record, an application was made by counsel on Lee's behalf, that certain property found on his person should be given up to one of his rela<lb/>tives—as an inducement, I presume, to the Court to give that request a favourable consideration, Mr. Parry, who was his counsel, stated that he was in a position to show that Lee had borne an irreproachable character, and that this was his first offence—the Judge said that as the prisoner had pleaded guilty, of course he could not entertain the application of giving up any portion of property—then for the purpose of enabling the Judge to inquire into the circumstances, the prisoner was directed to withdraw his plea of guilty, and the plea then remained as it originally stood—it was expressly understood that that was only for the purpose of enabling the Court to inquire into the merits of the case as to whether the property was any portion of the robbery—witnesses to character were then called and examined—the first witness was Michael James Newsham—he was sworn and examined—Samuel Shervill was then called, sworn, and examined—he stated that he had known Lee for about seven years, that he had known him at No. 10, Lucas-street, Commercial-road; that he had had repeated transactions with him, business transactions—when asked what Lee was, he said that he was a general dealer, and that he (Shervill) was a silk and shawl dresser, living at New Inn-yard, Shoreditch.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170020"/>
               <p>but which of the two I am not sure—I am almost satisfied that he said No. 3, Lee-street, Dalston, and that he had known him there for the last two or three years—Shervill was then recalled, and asked the question at which place he had known him last, and he confirmed the evidence of Groves—I am sure he mentioned the same place that Groves had stated—I am perfectly satisfied of that, and I believe it was Lee-street—Groves also gave Lee an exemplary character—we have no short hand writer to our Court—there are reporters attending, but no official short hand writer—I remember the evidence that Newsham gave—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>far my being positive of the fact now, has any bias upon my recollection—there is no alteration in him, only the day I taw him his hair looked exceedingly grey—I do not think there had been any effort made to change his appearance, I thought so at the time—he having told, me that he was the person that gave evidence on 13th Sept., I stated that the inquiries that had been made, had proved that the evidence he had given was not true—he stated that the evidence he had given wag true—I told him that 1 had been instructed to take proceedings against him—I had previously obtained a warrant for his apprehension, and had an officer with me—there was a large quantity of silk on the loom, and he requested that he might be allowed to put that in proper order before, he was taken away, that it might not be spoiled—I think it was silk being dyed, not on the, loom, but on the dresser—while he was removing it, we talked about his knowledge of Lee—he stated that it was very hard that a man's liberty should be invaded in that way when he had only spoken the truth, and he told me that he had had business with Lee seven years previously, and no doubt his books would show his name, that he knew nothing move of him but that Lee's sister had called on him some few days before the trial, and asked him to give him-a character—I said, "If you have not seen him for the last seven years, they might have found some person that might have given better evidence as to character"—he did not give any direct answer to that—he said he had seen him but once, and that was seven years ago—what I took down was this, be only had business with him once, and that was seven years ago, and no doubt Lee's name would appear on his books—he was then taken into custody.</p>

               <p>with them, and I brought him his notes, and he perused them in my heating and presence—he read them over—it was only upon one point that my recollection required any refreshing, and that was, at which of the two resi<lb/>dences Grove said he had known Lee—when this matter first commended I was attending to other business—Sherrill stated that he had known him in Lee-street last—that is my impression—my recollection is, that he said he had known him originally in Lucas-street, and ultimately in Lee-street—I can only pledge my oath to my recollection—it is possible that he might have said he knew him first in Lee-street, but my recollection leads me the other way—he did not say that Lee came to him to dress silks for him—he said he had dressed silks for him—he was examined by the Court as to these facts—something was said about Lee's sister.</p>

"Take this fellow"—I went up<lb/>stairs with a candle, and examined myself, and found I was wounded, and directly went to a doctor.</p>

On The afternoon, of 7th Dec., the prisoner came in a little after 3 o'clock, at the Paternoster-row entrance, for some calico which she had paid a deposit on a few days before—she received the parcel, paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and went away—in about a quarter of an hour she returned and wished to match the calico that she had just had—she looked at some and purchased a remnant, and also some lining, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—she said she would look at some alpaca, a piece was shown to her—she said that she had got a friend outside who was rather shabbily dressed, but would the young man who was serving her mind her coming in—he said, "Certainly not"—the prisoner went out, and we then missed a silk dress length, value five guineas and a half, which had been lying on a table—the prisoner returned in about half an hour, and came in at the Paternoster-row entrance—I then went behind a stand and watched her, without being seen, by looking between some ready made dresses—she was looking at a dress, and I saw her take up two dress lengths and place them tinder her shawl—I then "walked down to the bottom of the shop and told the young man to get a constable—I then asked her to look at some shawls, to detain her, but she would not, and I saw her drop these silks on her lap and then they fell under the table—I picked them up and gave her. in charge.</p>

               <p>of my innocence, and trout to my own arguments, from whence you will draw your own inference; when I left home, I left behind me that which I can scarcely do without, an eye glass, and left the necessary amount of cash which might have been wanted for any expenses; I went to the station, and you heard the question I put about the egress or ingress; You are was that the northern side is for persons going down the line, and the southern side for persons coming up the line, and there are two passages lead down from the front of the building—this occurrence took place in the middle of the day, 5 or 10 minutes before 12 o'clock; there was no throng, nothing to induce a person to commit any robbery; you all hear that I went in and sat down, and a person came in dressed as a traveler, and placed under the table several packages, and a railway wrapper; if I had been dishonestly inclined it would have been sheer madness on my part to take up these things in presence of so many persons—but I expected my friend there, and sat immediately opposite the door watching for him—when this gentle<lb/>man came in with his luggage, I thought I detected my friend in him, and I followed him to look for him; not being able to find him, I came back, and then not being certain, I went out again and came back—I then sud<lb/>denly bethought myself that he might hare gone to the lobby to obtain his ticket, and as my intention was to ask him to take me to Stratford with, him, I thought there was no harm in taking these things to him—now it appears that this was a trap to detect some shabby fellow who stole a clergy-man's portmanteau; when they saw me they could not say I was a shabby fellow, and the very clever man who took me, if he thought I was going to leave these premises, do You think he would have laid hold of me there; no, he would have let me have gone down and get into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed me to my destination; if he had thought for one moment I was a thief, that is the line of conduct he would have pursued; but Mr. Bale knew I did not intend to leave the premises with these things, he saw that I was going towards the pay place, and he knew very well I must have thought if I did not see somebody I was looking after, I should come back to the wait<lb/>ing room again; but a victim was to be caught, and there had been com<lb/>plaints of non-performance of duty in looking after persons in that waiting room, and therefore I was taken; the Rev. Mr. Cheshire says he lost his portmanteau on 23rd Nov., which is the day that this female detector was appointed to watch for thieves; she waited from 10 o'clock in the morning till a quarter before 4 o'clock, and saw a person she declares to be me, get up and leave that room, but before leaving it lift up the portmanteau, and come back, take the portmanteau and leave this room; and I must not Only have left the room, but walked twenty yards, and gone down a flight of steps, and all this in one minute and with a package in my hand weighing forty or fifty pounds; can 'you believe that could be done before a woman, a special detector, appointed there for her acute knowledge of all these things; is it possible that any man could come into a room like that, take a package of forty pounds, and walk away with it; but I have a witness whom I will tender, who will on her oath declare that on that 23rd, I arrived at my own house, which is as near as possible three miles and a half or four miles distant from it, and that I was at home about 6 o'clock, and I was dressed in my usual way; I never leave" my house without being shaved, my clothes and hat well brushed, and my shoes decently polished; I shall prove that on the 28th Nov., which was on Wednesday, that I brought home these identical shoes, and another pair of shoes as well with me, and</p>

                  </hi>, I am a messenger of the Court of Bankruptcy in London. I produce a file of the proceedings of the Court in the bankruptcy of Davidson and Gordon—among them I have the petition of adjudication—it is under the seal of the Court—it is dated 20th June, 1854—the adjudica<lb/>tion is dated the 21st, the following day—there are also on the proceedings the affidavit verifying the petition, and the depositions—I have here the appointment of the official assignee—it is dated 21st June—Isaac Nicholson is the person appointed—here is the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> of 30th June, 1854—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>first time learnt that the printed form was wrong—as nearly as I can remember, I think it was Mr. Linklater who reminded me that I had faltered in my evidence—I saw him at the Bankruptcy Court upon another business and had some conversation with him, and when he called my atten<lb/>tion to the fact, I could scarcely believe what he told me—but when he did, I said, "I am very sorry it should have been stated By me, because it is so opposite to the fact"—it was, of course, very painful to me—I remained in Court until the end of the last trial—I heard objections taken throughout the proceedings, all day long—I do not recollect bearing it stated in Court, that one of the points to be reserved was that only one duplicate of adjudi<lb/>cation had been served—I believe I paid strict attention to everything that was going on during the whole trial, but that did not occur to me—I did not hear the Counsel, as soon as I had given my evidence, object to the Judge that only one duplicate of adjudication had been served—it was not so impressed upon my mind, that is all I can say on the subject, I certainly did not take any notice of it—Mr. Linklater is the attorney for this prose<lb/>cution, he practises very much at the Bankruptcy Court—I cannot recollect when it was that he told me I had faltered in my evidence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon being recalled did you not say, "The document I left on the. 21st was under the seal of the Court, and I believe it to have been a true copy of the adjudication of bankruptcy"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe, as you refresh my recollection, that I referred to the proceedings.</p>

I was clerk to Davidson and Gordon; they earned on business in Mincing-lane, and also had a distillery at West Ham, in Essex—the business they carried on originally in Mincing-lane was that of produce brokers, I mean colonial produce—they received goods, and sold them for other persons—they were also metal agents—they carried on business alto<lb/>gether for three or four years to my knowledge, and at the distillery about nine months—they continued it until the time of their going away—the last day on which I saw them at business was on Saturday, 17th June, 1854—I saw both of them—I saw them up to about 5 o'clock that day—they did not tell me where they were going to—I did not see them leave—they did not intimate to me that they were going to leave—I expected to see them or hear from them on the Monday—they did not come on the Monday, nor did I hear from them—they did not leave any money with me.</p>

Bank of England note, which I gave to Mr. Gordon; that was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th—before spirits can leave the distillery, it is necessary to pay the Excise, either by cheque or by money—I gave a cheque to the Excise on this occasion; I think it was for 2,070<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was for duty—I cannot exactly say whether any duties were owing at that time—I believe that cheque has not been paid.</p>

I was acting professionally for Mr. Gordon, on 17th June, 1854, and also for Mr. Davidson—I saw them on that day, between 4 and 5 o'clock, together—I received a sum of money from one of them—I paid it over to the assignees—I did not pay it all over—I received I think 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I paid over I think 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—T cannot tell the day on which I paid it over, it was within the time limited by the Bankruptcy Act—it may have been 11th Aug.—I do not recollect the date—I handed over the same notes—it was in bank notes—that was after I learned of the adjudication in bankruptcy—I gave it to the official assignee—I did not see the bankrupts after 17th June, until April last, when they came back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">to amend the indictment to meet that state of things, it being a mere point of form, and not of sub<lb/>stance</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRT</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">did not consider it was necessary in this case; but it would be quite sufficient to allege that certain foreign money was embezzled, to wit, money of France or Germany, of the value of so much</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON ALDERSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion this would be an amendment of something material to the merits of the case,' and therefore it could not be made</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

BARON ALDERSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that no offence had been committed in this country; the whole offence was committed abroad; there was no knowing at what time the notes were changed; they might have been changed before the adjudication; and, if so, they would have been lawfully changed, and no offence would be committed; but there was reasonable evidence to show that, if changed at all, they were changed for goods and chattels, that was to say, Belgian, French, or German money; and when that may hate been, there was no evidence before the Court</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of the same opinion; if what was proved to have been done abroad had been done in this country, the crime would have been completed at once, and it would not have been necessary for the prosecution to give any evidence of non-accounting; the case would have been sufficient without that; the accounting would only have tome, on the part of the prisoners, as a defence, to show, co-animo, that the acts were done abroad; independent of that, the acts carried their own intention with them; where an act was incomplete or indifferent in itself, it might be necessary afterwards to complete the case by showing a non-accounting, but where the case was complete in itself, the non-accounting after-wards could make no difference</hi>. Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BARON ALDERSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was further of opinion that it was exceedingly doubtful whether the spending of money from day to day, not amounting in any one turn to</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">could be put together so us to form an aggregate amount: he was strongly of opinion it could not; and there again occurred the same difficulty, viz., that it was done abroad</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Marquis of Granby public house in Cando's-street, in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, at the corner of Bedford bury; I live there. On Tuesday, 13th Nov., I went to bed about half past 10 o'clock at night—I was awoke in the night, I think, between 1 and 2 o'clock by a noise like a window opening—I left my bed and went to the staircase—I listened some minutes, and not hearing any more I thought I must be mistaken—I went back to my bed—I was awoke again in about a quarter of an hour by a cracking and breaking noise—I went again to the door at the top of the stairs and fancied I heard some one on the stairs—I said, "Charles, is that you? who is there?"—Charles is my barman—not hearing any more noise I said, "It is a good thing I have got my gun loaded"—I said that aloud, any one might hear—I heard no answer—I saw that the window had been let down to let the steam or the gas out—I put up that upper part of the window, and directly I heard a quick step in Taylor's buildings—that window looks into Taylor's-buildings—I heard a man singing "Hail, a milling morn!"—I thought I knew the voice—I thought it was Mahoney's—he was going with a quick step, and with thick shoes on—I listened again for about ten minutes—I thought I must be mistaken, and that the noise I heard must have been in the court, and not in my house—I went to sleep again—about 5 o'clock in the morning the policeman rang the bell—I went to the window—the policeman said, "Do you know the door is open?"—I said, "No"—I went down and found the back door open which leads into Taylor's-buildings—that door is two or three yards from the door leading to the bar—that door leading to the bar had been broken open by a</p>

               <p>since—I know that this was 26th Nov. because I had business that way that day—I am positive it was the 26th—I went down to see a young man about a place—I was not before the Magistrate—I heard of it in a public house some few days after he was taken, and I told them that I had part of a pint of beer with him, and that he had a mare, and the young man in the public house said, "Are you sure it was a mare?" and I said, "Yes"—the mare had no saddle or bridle, only a halter—I have never seen the mare since, nor the prisoner till now—the man who was in the public house asked me to come here—I do not know whether he is here now, but I have seen him here to do-day—I told him where I lived, and he found me out—the prisoner was going at a walking pace when I met him.</p>

I recollect something about this trans<lb/>action of Pickford, Johnson, and Co.—I think they were included in Mr. Ewart's bill—since I was examined I have been looking over the accounts—I have not ascertained the actual amount of advances upon the sugars at any one time—to the best of my knowledge this account was made out at the time: I made out this particular portion of it about the sugars, and general securities held by the creditors—there appears to be about 44,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to creditors holding sugars only—I should think the advance to have been to within 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Manchester. Mr. Bennett was an agent of mine in 1854—in consequence of an order I received from him, I supplied some goods to Davidson and Gordon to the amount of about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had never supplied goods to them before, I have never been paid any portion of it—I saw Mr. Gordon on 17th June, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon—he made an appointment with me, because his agreement was to pay half cash</p>

               <p>—Mr. Gordon ordered me to come at 3 o'clock in the afternoon to arrange with his partner for payment—I went at 5 o'clock and saw Mr. Davidson—Mr. Gordon was out, but Mr. Davidson said I should come again in half an hour, and Mr. Gordon would be in—I went again at half past 3 o'clock, and Mr. Walker, their clerk, said that Mr. Gordon had told him to tell me that the cheque would be forwarded on Monday—I did not see the prisoners again until they were in custody—when I saw Mr. Gordon at 1 o'clock, I asked him for the account, because we had arranged upon cash terms—I said so to him, Mr. Bennett was with me at the time—Gordon said he must see his partner about it; that was all that passed between us—when I saw Mr. Davidson, he merely asked if I had made an appointment with Mr. Gordon—I said I had, and he said as he was not in at that time I should call again in half an hour to see him then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">considered that he could not reject the evidence</hi>.)—I had seen Cole previously, and that same evening Gordon came to our count<lb/>ing house—I can give you the substance of what passed between myself and Gordon, but it is extremely difficult—I wish you would ask me the ques<lb/>tions, rather than I should attempt to narrate an interlocutory conversation which took place two years ago—the substance I can tell you directly Gordon was chiefly occupied in satisfying me of the power of the distillery, which I took down from his lips at the time; I have the particulars of it, taken down from his lips at the time—we referred to the securities that we held—my chief object was to see the depth of our involvement with him and Cole together—I cannot remember anything falling from Gordon about the warrants—two hours before I saw Gordon I had received information from Cole to the effect that those warrants were valueless—we had an im<lb/>pression that they were valueless.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the result what you have stated, that there were fifty-three of those warrants that had been deposited by Gordon, that turned out to be of this character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they were, but I know nothing about the detail of it—I ascertained that fact in company with Gordon, certainly; it was an admitted thing in our conversation—we never received any deeds of the distillery from Gordon—on the following day Cole sent us the lease, or some paper of that sort, of the distillery for our perusal, to satisfy us of a fact, namely, that the money he had abstracted from us he had lent to Gordon for the purposes of the distillery; and to satisfy us of that fact he sent us this lease, or something purporting to be a lease, wherein this sum of money was referred to—that was handed over to our solicitors, to report what sort of an instrument it was, and when Cole became a bankrupt it was returned to Cole's assignees.</p>

I received from the last witness a letter—I locked it in an iron chest till the next morning—I then gave it to Mr. Scales, a sorter—I desired him to place it with other letters that the prisoner would have to take to another office—I then went in the letter carriers' office, where it was the prisoner's duty to bring those letters—I saw the prisoner come up and put some letters on the table—he then left the room, and I found that the letter which I had given to Mr. Scales was not amongst them—I came down and called the prisoner into my room—I told him that one letter which was known to have been in his possession was missing—he said he did not know anything about it—I said I was satisfied he had had it, and I asked if he had any objection to be searched—he said, "No"—he was searched in my presence, and this sovereign and two shillings were found in his coat tail pocket—the officer Smee took them—the prisoner was asked whose money that was—he said it was his own.</p>

On Wednesday night, 5th Dec., about half-past 7 or a quarter to 8 o'clock, I was on duty at Bromley-street, Poplar New Town, and saw the prisoner in a marine store shop—I looked through the doorway, and then went in, and asked the marine store dealer what the prisoner had brought in—he produced 25 lbs. of lead, melted in this manner—there were six of these pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked the prisoner his name—he said, "Robert Dickenson"—I asked him how he got it—he said that his master, Mr. Heather, gave him a portion of old lead pipe as a privilege for coming to the City for some new pipe—I told the Magistrate that he gave the name of Robert Dickenson, and so did the marine store dealer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder. The prisoner was in my employ as a bricklayer, at Canning Town, near Barking, putting up some brick work for some new cottages—8 or 9 lbs. of lead were left in a house nearly finished—I saw it safe seven or eight days before the police-man called—it was in the back room of one of the houses, and I think it was in a cupboard, but am not certain—I gave the prisoner no old pipe, this was a new piece, which the plumber had cut off and left—I gave the prisoner no lead whatever—he was not entitled to any as a privilege for going into the City—I paid his railway fare—he did a little job, and I allowed him so much more for doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was not I taken bad with rheumatic fever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and you got a plasterer to work for you, and a bricklayer also for two or three days—you were not bad two or three months this time—you did part of the work yourself—you had the key of the buildings sometimes—I saw the lead there after the plasterer and bricklayer were gone—you took some pipe up to town, to exchange—that was new pipe—I thought it was not strong enough, and ten feet were sent down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

I want you;" and that very instant Francis took to his heels—I ran and kept within a few paces of him—he was stopped by a young man about 300 yards off, and I immediately laid hold of him—he said, "What right have you to stop me, and lay hold of my coat and tear it?"—I said, "I shall detain you till an officer comes up, for these books are part of some property which was stolen, and if you had done nothing, why did you run away?"—an officer came up, and</p>

What does that "366" refer to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the page in the ledger—Blacklock is a customer's name—there were various times when the prisoner did not account at all—he has made a great many payments within three years, but out of all I have only got three written statements—I believe he did not give more than three—he used to say, "I will pay you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day, and to-morrow I will bring you a statement," and would do so—I do not know that he ever paid me more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—it was not immediately on his return from Kent that he brought this statement to me—he paid me about eight or nine days after he returned, and then we had to send after him several times, and when he came he brought this written statement with him—my clerk, Wynn, was present—we were both in the counting house—the prisoner handed this in as a statement of the money he had received in Kent—the goods had been sent to the customers three or four months before—he had been down canvassing, and had obtained the orders, and went down again to collect the money, and get new orders—this cash remitted, 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11 was sent to me by post, on account of these twenty-two orders, amounting to 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10 leaving a balance due to me of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never went out of the house without his commission, after asking me for it—there was always a sort of running account between us as regarded his commission—my books will show payments to him—here is his signature for his commission, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerk can better explain whether that was given to him on account—this is in my clerk's writing—I always paid the prisoner cheques, and sometimes he used to have it in gold—I have never paid him on account more or less than his commission—I have several other travellers—during the whole of my dealings with the prisoner, he was sometimes a week without my seeing him—he also travelled for another house, a brewery, and they have discharged him too—the bills I took from his hand</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>.

'—that is another traveller who paid me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Parkham, his name is Spicer—I am positive that the pri<lb/>soner did not pay me that, because I know my own writing—my writing will not tell me who paid it, but I remember it, and I remember the day well—this "Hipgreen, paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," is included in the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of Merchant Tailors' School, and have been so ten years and a half. It is my duty to reside in the house, south of the school, nearer to Thames-street—the school is on the north of the house, on the east side of Suffolk-lane, which is a narrow, pre<lb/>cipitous lane, leading from Cannon-street to Upper Thames-street; it has only width for one carriage—I know the premises nearly opposite my house perfectly well—till lately I believe it was a warehouse for ordinary goods, packages of various descriptions—since April last the defendants have been in possession of those premises—since then a' business has been carried on which appears to be connected with the mixing of some spirit or other—I have seen the mixing going on in the street—they transfer the spirit from one vessel to another called the tarboy—when they are mixing it, a very noxious effluvia is produced—I perceived on my premises there was a very noxious smell of this naphtha, which is very offensive—of course it is not so bad when they are not mixing it as when they are, but it is very bad then—I have no means of knowing whether any persons sleep on the defendants' premises—I and my wife and family sleep on my premises, and a good many boarders—I have now sixteen—generally, when they are not mixing it, if the weather is at all warm, there is a very sour stale smell, like the escape of naphtha from a lamp—it pervades the lane, and the rooms of my house—my own library, and my kitchen, and the front door of my house are towards the defendant's premises—I have not attempted to use that library lately, I was driven out by the smell—I perceived it in that room very badly indeed—I gave up the room in consequence—when I attempted to use the room in the summer, I found the smell from the lane gave me the headache, and nausea, and falling sickness—I really could not sit in the room—I had not had such symptoms before—I was obliged to have the window open sometimes in the summer, and then of course the whole room was pervaded with this nauseous smell; and on last Sunday I noticed the smell very bad when I came home from church in the morning—it has been so since April last—it is considerably less in cold weather, and it is more when they are mixing than when they are not—the stuff in this phial (<hi rend="italic">smelling it</hi>) has the same smell of which I complain.</p>

I felt I was restored, and I returned to my duty—I have not felt so strong as I did previous to going, but generally speaking my health is very much improved—I have not smelt the smell lately so much as before, except once Mrs. Richards had pasted some papers against my window, and they pulled them down for the windows to be repaired, and I then smelt it very much, but the window has been put in repair a fortnight or three weeks, and now I do not feel any inconvenience from it—the smell was worse in the warm weather, but I did not know whence that proceeded till I had an opportunity of going into the warehouse with Dr. Taylor, and I perceived that the smell there was the same as that that pervaded my own dwelling.</p>

               <p>saw at the wall of the defendant's premises there were four lower windows, imperfectly glazed—they were stopped with newspapers and other things—I then went to Mr. Robinson's, at the corner of Suffolk-lane, which is nearer to the defendant's premises—I perceived the same smelt of naphtha there—I went into the defendant's warehouse—I perceived the smell of naphtha there stronger—I found wood naphtha stored there with other things—the defend<lb/>ants said the wood naphtha amounted to about 5,000 gallons—it was in tins holding, as I was informed, twelve gallons each—there was no mixing going on at that time—all the naphtha was in those tins—there was spirits of wine there—I was not informed what quantity—I then asked to look at the place where the mixing took place, and there were two large vats for mixing this naphtha with spirits of wine, according to the Excise regulations—each vat was capable of holding about 2,000 gallons—they were partly open at top—there was a sliding valve and a hopper in the centre—the top of the vat was not open, only the centre where this hopper was—there was no spirit in at the time I was there—the course of mixing would be to put in the spirits of wine or the naphtha-it would not matter which was put in first—they would mix and blend together—let them stand a little tune, and they would chemically mix—it is taken out, at a tap below, in tarboys or tins—in drawing off it would emit a vapour, it is so very volatile—it would give out its vapour the same as gin does in the street—there is 1-10th of naphtha mixed with 9-10ths of spirit.</p>

I examined the defendant's premises on the 24th Nov.—there were about 800 gallons of naphtha there—they were not then mixing—the naphtha was in tin cans—there was a strong smell of naphtha—the effects of the vapour on persons is first an offensive smell, then nausea, headache, giddiness, and insensibility, and temporary disturbance of vision—it produces the sort of effect that other narcotic vapours produce—if a large quantity of this were stored, no doubt a considerable quantity of vapour would go off—in hot weather especially—it is very volatile, indeed, it is very inflammable—if there were any fire in the neighbour<lb/>hood it would be very dangerous—I watched to see if there was any fire, or candle, on the premises, and I found no lights were used on the premises.</p>

I now and then take young females, or servants out of place, to lodge—on Friday, 19th Oct., the elder prisoner came to me, and said, "I have a daughter that I want a bed for a few nights, or for a week of so; she will go to her aunt's for victuals, but they have no acommo<lb/>dation for sleeping"—I had half a bed to let—he said that that Would do for a short time, and I let it to him at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the other half of the bed was occupied by a young woman named Eliza Durrant—an hour or two, afterwards, about 9 o'clock, a person, representing herself as the aunt, brought the girl—I know now that it is England's brother's wife—the girl remained there three nights—the father paid me—I only saw the son once—he came with the father, on Saturday, when he paid me, but did not stop—the girl slept there on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—she then went away by herself, and I saw no more of her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). On Monday, 3rd Dec., in conse<lb/>quence of information, I went to Joseph Shea, a marine store dealer at Stratford, about a quarter of a mile from St. John's Church—from what Shea told me, I took the prisoner near Stratford Railway station, and told him the charge—he, said, "I did, not take it; a boy named Johnson gave it to me, and I sold it at Mr. Shea's"—he told me where to find Johnson, and I saw him afterwards, but have, not seen him lately—I believe he has ab<lb/>sconded on another robbery—I tried to subpoena him, but his father said that he had turned him out of doors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Kennington. On, Friday night, 30th Nov., I was in Lambeth-walk about 6 o'clock in the evening—it was dark—I noticed a Hansom <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming along, driven by the prisoner—it was going towards Lambeth workhouse—I saw the person who way run over—he was about two yards off the kerb, on the left side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was going to cross the road—when I first noticed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, it was ten or twelve yards from him—I heard the driver call out "Hoy!"—I do not think the man who is dead heard it—I have been, to some extent, accustomed to horses—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was going from eight to nine or ten miles an hour—after the driver called out "Hoy!" he did not pull up or slacken his pace till after he got over the man—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went on, and the pole struck him on the eye, and knocked him down—he fell with his feet toward the road, and his head towards the path—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went over him, and it went about three yards after that, before it stopped—I picked the man up, and he was taken to Guy's Hospital—the driver might have pulled up when he called "Hoy!"—he pulled up in three yards after he ran ever the man—</p>

               <p>but when a wheel comes against anything it soon stops after that—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at twelve yards off—I should think I could have seen it at twice that distance.</p>
