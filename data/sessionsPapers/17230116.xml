The Prosecutor depos'd that as he sat in an Ale-House he saw John Smith take the Boards out of his Work-Shop, and carry them about 600 yards, into another House. That Render was one he had put in Trust to look after his Goods, as his Foreman. John Smith pleaded, That he having Occasion for two Boards, went to Robert Render, and desir'd him to let him have two Boards, and bid him charge them down to his Accompt; he said also, there was an accompt depending of about 40 l. The Prisoner Smith call'd Evidence to prove, there was no clandestine taking the Boards, but having a Job of Work in Hand near that Place, and his Deals falling short, he went and took the Deals on Accompt, rather than to go home for them, which was a great Way off. He appear'd to be a Man of Reputation, and Robert Render a Person whom the Prosecutor employ'd as his <rs id="t17230116-32-deflabel173" type="occupation">Foreman</rs>

One of them depos'd, That the deceased was two or three Times push'd on the Breast by the Prisoner with his Staff, and afterwards knock'd down, and attempted two or three Times to rise, but could not; and that he set him with his Back against a Wall, but did not see any Provocation given by the deceased. Two Surgeons depos'd That the deceased was cut, or wounded, on the Side of the Head, above the Ear, the Length of Six or seven Inches, so that the Skull lay bare, and the Skin and Flesh hung over his Ear; and that, tho' there was no Depresssion of the Skull visible outwardly, yet opening the Head after his decease, they found two Fractures of the Skull, one upon the Temple Bone, and another upon the Bregma, several Inches long, with extravasated Blood, and a Pressure upon the Meninges of the Brain; and, that the Wounds were the cause of his Death. Other Evidences depos'd, That the deceased did charge his Death upon the Prisoner, saying He was murthered by him. The Evidences for the Prisoner depos'd much the same as those for the King had done, as to their being drinking at Mr. Brown's House, and the Occasion of their being sent to the Round House, but with this Difference, That they refus'd to pay the Reckoning, and began to quarrel among themselves, and were very troublesome, and that their Wrestling and Throwing one another down, seem'd rather in earnest than jest; and that the deceased was thrown under the Grate, and two more upon him (tho' one of the Evidences for the King said he was the Person that was undermost, and did not know that the deceased was thrown down there at all) The Landlord added, That in their Quarrelling they had broken a Table, a Mug, and the Windows, and refusing to pay their Reckoning, thereupon he call'd the Watchman.

             depos'd That going up stairs, she saw the Prisoner sitting in a Chair, who told her she was very ill; to which she reply'd, That appear'd by her Countenance, for she look'd as if she was struck with Death: That she ask'd her for some Sack, she gave her some, and she fainted away; that then she endeavoured to recover her, and having done it, got her to Bed; and perceiving a great deal of Blood, she went down and acquainted her Mistress. Her Mistress depos'd That she suspecting her being with Child about a Month before, had tax'd the Prisoner with it, and the Prisoner said, She wondred she had such hard Thoughts of her; and that she had given her Warning about a Fortnight before her Delivery. That being inform'd by Katherine Reader of her being ill, she went up, and having examined her Linnen, and seeing nothing of a Child, thought there had been only a Miscarriage. That the next Day she sent for a Midwife, and upon her examining the Prisoner, and being of Opinion there had been a Child born, they charg'd it very home upon the Prisoner. Mrs. Sims the Midwife depos'd, That she being sent for the Night after, did examine the Prisoner, and finding there had been a Child born, urged her to tell where it was: That after having directed to 2 or 3 Places where it was not, the Prisoner turn'd aside the Pillow, and there was the Child, ty'd up pretty fast in a Cloth. That she own'd it was born alive, and said she did call for help so loud, that had it not been for the Rattling of the Coaches in the Street, and the Crying of Two Children in the Nursery, she must needs have been heard. The Midwife farther depos'd, She did believe the Child was at its full Time, and was born alive; that she did not perceive any Marks of Violence offered to it, but 2 Specks on the Forehead, which she believed happened by its falling from the Prisoner on the Ground. The Prisoner in her Defence deny'd that the Child was born alive, said she had made Provision for it, and that she was a married Woman. And to prove this she call'd several Persons. Her Mistress own'd that she hir'd her as a married Woman. A Master and Mistress with whom she had liv'd before deposed, That a Person had several Times came to demand her away as his Wife, and had been very troublesome; that she had owned she was his Wife, but that he was so great a Rogue to her she could not live with him, he having 2 or 3 other Wives.

Mrs. Dickson, her Mistress, deposed, That the Prisoner having a Day or two before, complain'd that she had hurt her Back by lifting a Washing-Tub, she gave her something and sent her to Bed: That in the Morning she said she was something better, but afterwards complain'd again; that she having laid down on a Bed, on which her Father, who was not well, wanted to lie down, she sent a Lad up to bid her come down: That the Boy came down and told her that Mrs. Steward, a Woman who liv'd in the House, desir'd her to come up immediately, for something was the Matter with the Prisoner. That thereupon she went up, and Mrs. Steward, and her self examining her, did think there had been a Miscarriage. That the Prisoner not owning any Child, she at last sent for some Neighbours, and a Midwife, and being search'd, the Midwife was of Opinion there had been a Child born. She gave no Account of it, but at last it was found under the Stairs in a Chamber-Pot. That the Jaw-Bone of it was broke; and the Side of the Check torn: That having wash'd it in warm Water, it bled at the Wound. That the Child had Hair and Nails, that it was very small and lean. Mrs. Steward confirm'd what the former Witnesses had deposed, adding, That the Occasion of her bidding the Boy bid his Mistress come, was, That he inquiring of her which was the Way to the Prisoner's Chamber, told her there was Blood on the Landing-Place of the Stairs, which she taking notice of, did suspect something more than ordinary. Another Evidence depos'd several Things before depos'd, relating to the Child when found, adding, That the Prisoner said she had done nothing to it, but turned it in the Chamber-Pot. The Midwife-deposed, it was her Opinion that the Child was at its full Time, and that it was born alive; and the rather, (which is usual) because it had a Stool after it came into the World. The Evidences generally were of Opinion, That the Jawbone of the Child might be broken, and the Wound received, by the Child's falling on or into the Chamber-Pot, and that they perceiv'd no other Marks of Violence upon it but those. The Mistress and several others gave the Prisoner the Character of a very silly Creature; that she was a half natural, and that her Mother was so before her; and the Prisoner's Aunt deposed, That the Prisoner herself was born without a Midwife, and the Prisoner's Mother, and, as it was said, Grandmother, in like Manner. The Prisoner in her Defence said, That she knock'd for Help as loud as she could, but no Body came to her, and that she did not murder the Child.
