I think I missed a piece of Irish cloth out of my warehouse about the beginning of August. I had no great reason at that time to suspect the prisoner; but some time after I had. Then I took him into the counting-house, and charged him with robing me of it, mentioning the number of yards, and describing it. He denied it at first. Then he told me if I would give him till night, he would make a confession. I told him I would not give him ten minutes. He then acknowledged he had taken it and pawned it to a pawnbroker in Hounsditch, for thirty shillings. I sent him with my uncle to take it out. What past after, my uncle can inform you.</p>
               <p>M. Waters. I was sent for on the fourteenth of August, by Mr. Smith. I went to his house. The prisoner was asked a great many questions. I put three to him myself. Whether he had pawned it, or given it to any body out of the house, or secreted it. Some time after he fell into tears, and owned he had pawned it. I went with him to a pawnbroker's in Hounsditch. There he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060003"/> asked for it in his own name. It was produced to us. (Produced in Court.)</p>

I called for a pint of beer; after that I had another; after that I had a gill of wine. Then I changed a guinea to pay. I then sat a little while, and walked out at the door into a little yard. Before I could get up into the street, a man came out of that house, and knocked me down by a blow with his hand on the left side my face. Who he was I do not know. Then two women came, one held me down, while the prisoner took my money out of my pocket, it was in a bag, 6 l. and upwards of it. I had seen her in the house: she was in the box where I had been drinking. After she had taken my money, she took my watch. D - n him, said she, he has got more money about him. Then she searched my coat and waistcoat pockets, and took some halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket, and my handkerchief. This was about nine at night, just at the dawning of the evening. I was knocked down within about three yards of the house door, in the passage that leads to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I begged my life. I did not call out, fearing they would cut my throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not return into the house after this, or alarm people in the street?</p>
               <p>Chappel. No. I went to my lodgings as fast as I could.</p>


               <p>Q. How long is that passage?</p>
               <p>Chappel. It is twenty yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the people, that used you thus ill, go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Chappel. They went into the house again.</p>

The house is about fifty yards backwards. He said he should know the woman that robbed him, could he see her. He mentioned two women and a man. I went to that public-house on the Tuesday, the day after. I told the landlord's son, he not being at home, if he did not let me know where the woman was, I would speak to have his licence taken away, as many robberies had been committed in his house. Upon that he went and shewed me where the prisoner lodged in the Almonry: there I found the prisoner. I charged her with taking the prosecutor's watch and money. She denied it. I told her Mr. Chappel was come to that conclusion, that if she would own what she had done with the watch, if pawned, he would redeem it, and say no more about the affair.</p>

               <p>I am a girl of the town. I was going along with another girl. We met this gentleman: he asked us to go in and drink. He took us into the Gentleman and Porter at Charing-Cross, and called for rum and water. He wanted connections with me. I asked him for something: he said he would pay me after I had done. After that I asked him for his present. He said, How can you ask me for any money, when I have been robbed already? He threw down a penny for the servant, and paid his reckoning, and we came out all of us together.</p>

On the 31st of July, about a quarter before one in the morning, I stopt the prisoner in Turnmill-street, with these things in two handkerchiefs, ( producing the things laid in the indictment ); he said he had them of his mother over night. My partner went to his father in Charterhouse-lane, who came to the watch-house, and declared the things did not belong to him nor his wife. We took the prisoner to Clerkenwell Bridewell. After that, hearing Mr. Cann's house had been robbed, we let him know of the things, and his wife came and owned them. We took the prisoner before Justice Girdler: he there owned there were four others concerned with him in taking the things.</p>

We had been in the country, and came home by Red Lion-street; Stapleton got over the iron rails, lifted up the sash, went in, and handed to me a basket of gauze and lace, and came over the rails again. Then David Price went over, and Stapleton followed him: they both went in at the window, and looked about a great while. They found a clock, and Stapleton handed it out to me over the rails. I took and carried it home: they all came with me. Then I gave Stapleton a halfpenny to buy a candle: we then went up stairs and looked at the clock. We sent Stapleton for Dailey; this was in a lodging in Dailey's house; Caton and Stapleton rent the room: Dailey came up and looked at it a great while: he said he had a clock of his own, and he did not chuse to buy it; but he would think of it by the morning. I told him it would not do to keep it in our lodging, for the chimes would strike, and we should be found out; he told me I might take it to his dwelling-house. I took it under my coat, and carried it to his house, which was but the next door; I carried it up stairs, and left it in a fore-room. We were taken up that night, about twelve o'clock, as disorderly persons: I and Stapleton got clear of that, and about twelve the next day, Dailey went and discovered the clock to the gentleman, as he found Caton could not get off. (The clock produced in Court, and deposed to by the servant maids, as their master's property.)

               <p>Caton's Defence.</p>
               <p>I got up one morning to go to see my father. I called at an ale-house, the Running-horse, and had a pint of beer. I had drank more beer than ordinary. I got into that house to lie, and they came and took me. I am as innocent of the charge as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Stapleton's Defence.</p>
               <p>I lodged at the Running-horse, and used to play at shuffle board. M'Mahon said, As I had no money, if I would go with him, he would shew me where to get some. I went with him to this house that night.</p>
               <p>Court. You are not called upon to accuse yourself.</p>
               <p>Stapleton. I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was standing at the corner of Red Lion passage, and this M'Mahon and two others came by: he had a clock under his arm. He asked me to go along with them. We went to the Running-horse, and drank a pot of beer till it was twelve o'clock. I was afraid my father would lock me out, so M'Mahon took me to a house where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Dailey's Defence.</p>
               <p>M'Mahon never lay in my house, he called me up, and asked me whether I would buy a bargain. I said, No; I'll have nothing at all to do with it. I went down stairs, then up into my own room, and went to bed; he followed me up and left the clock in my kitchen. I know no more of its being there than the child unborn, till I got up: then I went to the constable, and told him there was such a thing left in my house. I have got a very good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clay. What time did you first see the clock?</p>
               <p>Mr. Clay. It was not brought till about twelve o'clock. Galaway Dailey came and told me of it between eleven and twelve. The boys were taken up long before.</p>

He sat down, and wanted change for a guinea. The landlord could not give it him. He said he was belated, and would give any thing to lie down till morning.

I said I was very sick, and wanted a dram: he desired I would not go yet. I had taken two guineas and a half out of his breeches pocket, and had it in my hand: the breeches lay in a chair. Immediately up came Murry, and the two prisoners. The prosecutor was then going to get up. They rushed in, and took the money out of my hand, and his watch out of his breeches, and broke the string in getting it out. The man said, For God's sake don't use me ill. They went off, and bid me come along. Murry sold the watch.</p>

            . I, the prisoner, and another (not taken) went out on the 9th of August, between two and three in the afternoon, to take a walk. The prisoner went into a shop in Bond-street, there she brought out three muslin handkerchiefs, and a silk and cotton one. After that she went into the prosecutor's shop in Oxford-road, and asked me to go in with her. She brought out six yards of cloth in six pieces, tied up with a piece of packthread, under her apron; I think it was Irish. Then we went to Mrs. Flyn's shop; we sold her them, and five yards of cloth, for 10 s. 6 d. for the whole. We had the money between us; after she had bought them, she said they should not be known, for she would put them in water, and wash them directly. I saw five yards of them afterwards at the Justice's; the other yard was lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She carried the cloth in herself, and took the money for it. I was in the street at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of the cloth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Had it been in the piece, it might have been worth 18 d. a yard; but as it was cut in pieces, it was not worth half the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Coming from my mother's, I happened to meet this Jones in the street, she asked me to go and drink a pint of beer; I went in with her and drank; after that she asked me to go with her to Monmouth-street; I asked her what for; she said she was going to a house to do a little business. She went in at Mrs. Flyn's house, at a back door, and pulled this cloth out of her pocket. I had none of the money.</p>

We found the handkerchief in his bosom, which the prosecutor owned as soon as he came up, and he swore to it afterwards before the sitting Alderman. The prisoner begged to be sent to sea.</p>

About twelve at night, on the 18th of last month, a man came to me at the watch-house, and said a man had got some things, offering them for sale at the Bridge-foot, and he apprehended they were stolen. At that time there was a fire at Bridewell precinct. I went and met the prisoner; they had stopped him in Tooley-street. There were a copper pottage-pot, and a copper saucepan, but the tea-kettle was not there. I found that the next day. I examined him in the watch-house; he was quite different in his story. I put him in the Borough Counter, and the next day he was examined at St. Margaret's hill. After this Mr. Sharpe's cook came, and claimed them to be her master's property.</p>

He said he had been accused of stealing a silver watch. I asked this Levi if he was acquainted with the prisoner, and from what motive he could charge the prisoner. He said, He is an intimate acquaintance, and he is very ungrateful in not giving me something, as he has got money. I know Mr. Harris can do nothing without me; he can find no bill without me: money is now very acceptable. I do declare upon my oath, if I had given him a couple of guineas, he would not have concerned himself about it. Mr. Harris told Sir John he was a tall, thin young fellow in white clothes, that he prated like a magpye all the way, and that he was a little in liquor, but thought he should know the man's voice.</p>

               <p>Israel Lyons. On the night of the 18th of August, about eleven o'clock, I was in Fleet-street, when the prisoner picked me up near Ludgate-hill; she is a common woman. I went into a tavern with her, and after having been some time with her, I told her I was rather too late to go to my inn, so I went with her to a friend of hers in <placeName id="t17690906-19-crimeloc102">Bridges-Street</placeName>

I had a guinea, two half guineas, and three quarter guineas in my pocket. What silver I had, I cannot tell. I put my breeches under my head, and being extremely tired, I fell to sleep immediately. I had wound my watch up, and laid it on the table. After some time I was awaked by the master of the house, who told me the woman wanted to go out, but that he would not let her till he had seen me. I took up my breeches and found all my gold gone; there having been no other person in the room but the prisoner, I was sure she must have it. I offered to let her go, if she would give me my money again, but she would not, so I charged a constable with her. He carried her to Covent-Garden round-house. I was present there when he took the very number of pieces from her, and five shillings that I had given her. I took her before Sir

               <p>This man met with me upon Ludgate-hill; he treated me with a bottle of wine at the King's Arms, and told me if I would go with him to the Ship Tavern without Temple-Bar, he would give me a couple of shillings: after that he told me, if I would go and lie with him, he would give me more money. He made me a present of it. I went with him, he gave me that money, and he bruised me and used me very ill: afterwards he said if I would not deliver it again, he would send for a constable. I never picked his pocket, or intended to use him ill.</p>

The prisoner came to me on a Monday in July; I think he had been at my house on the Wednesday night before: he knocked at my door and spoke bad English. I said, Speak German. He pulled out one of my cards, and said, Is this yours? I said, Yes. Said he, I came out of the city from a merchant who sent me to you. I said, What gentleman? He mentioned one. I said I did not know this gentleman. He said the gentleman gave his compliments to me, and would take it as a favour if I would get him a place, or employ him till I got him one. I told him I could not take a man in where there was such a great trust till I knew something of him, and I had not the honour of knowing the gentleman he mentioned. I told him, if he would bring me a letter, with some account of his character and behaviour, I would employ him, if I found he would do for me. He said it would be charity to employ him. He looked very pitiful. He told me he could not bring a letter that night, for the gentleman was at Hackney, at his country seat; but he could bring it the next day. I told him I had business that required me to be out of town; but he might leave it with my wife, and call on me on the Wednesday, and I would give him an answer. A note came, and my wife gave it me. I think it was with the name of Cousmaker, or some such name. I believe he came again on the Wednesday, when I told him I would employ him. He seemed to be exceeding thankful, and said it was very good of me. I asked him where his things were; he said they were at the gentleman's country house, and it would be very late before he could come. He came in late that night with a box, it was quite dark; it must be nine o'clock or more. I saw him come, and asked him what made him come so late, he was all in a sweat. He said it was so far, he could not come before. He pitched the box in the court; I told him to carry it up stairs. I meant to lay him with the cook, but the cook made an objection, gave him up his bed, and went home to lie with his wife. The prisoner was shewed up, and he carried his box into the cook's room. It appeared that the box was full of something, but after the robbery I went and looked in the box, and there was nothing in it. There was a trunk carried up stairs, and a silver hilted sword lay upon the outside of it, with a bag of things, in which was a green waistcoat trimmed with gold, which I shall give some account of hereafter. On the Sunday I had some company, when the prisoner came to me and complained of my servants, that they were very lazy, and gave away my victuals. I did not like him, and told him that on the morrow he should go about his business. I then went to walk in the Park, and when I came home there was a silver spoon missing: having lost one before, I said I would not lose another, without making a through search. I looked about my house, but I could not find my spoon. About a quarter after nine, I asked where the prisoner was; I was told he had not been seen since dinner.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060014"/> Presently I heard my wife call out, Here he is! Here he is! I said, Where is he? She said, He is gone into such a parlour. Then he said, Do you want me? As soon as I came to him, I replied, What do you want here, you rascal? He appeared to me as though his breeches were down. I pushed him out; got him towards the kitchen, and said, Why do you run about my house in this manner? Pull your breeches up. I then said, What have you got there? seeing some shifts. He replied, These are my sister's. I answered, Why did you not make a bundle of them, and go off like an honest man. I am a very honest man, said he. I then took him into my kitchen, and told my cook to take care of him. I said, Come, and make him strip. My cook said, I cannot, I am frighted out of my wits to see such a rogue. He had nine shirts on, besides several shifts. We were obliged to pull them over his head, and the green waistcoat laced with gold, which I had before mentioned. He endeavoured to throw out what he could from his pockets. I said to the people by, Take a pen and ink, and we will make a proper inventory, which I have here, (producing a long list of rich things) of the things which were found upon him. He begged for God's sake I would let him go, as I had got all the things. I said I should look upon myself to be as great a villain as you to let you go. The things were kept in a garret, and the key locked in a bureau. I found the door broke open, and the lock of the Duke D'Eon's trunk broke. The silver hilt of the sword I found broke from the blade in the lining of the prisoner's coat, and the silver hook of the scabbard. The waistcoat and sword are the property of the Duke D'Eon's secretary, which were left at my house under my care. When I came to look in my store room, I found some crimson silk damask missing. The gold fringe, with several other things which I found in the prisoner's breeches, was my property: he had crammed them so full, that he could not keep them up. Here are four witnesses in court that saw me take the things from him. I took him to the watch-house, with the assistance of a constable.</p>

               <p>I had not a shirt to my back, and the master of the house was for turning me out of the house the next day. There was a servant that was well known in the house; he went up with me to my room, and gave me these things to take care of them. I did not know what, or how much there was. He was what they called a foreigner. I did not know his name, nor where to find him. He used to frequent the house. I was drunk, and the man told me to put the shirts and shifts on. I did not know what the fringe was till the master of the house took it out of my breeches.</p>

I was in a one horse chaise. It was a fine moonlight night; one of them shewed me a pistol and demanded my money. That was the prisoner Litchfield, for he came first. I observed, before they came up, they walked about fifteen yards from each other. When he bid me stop, I did not understand him. I said, What do you say? He replied, Your money, your money. Then I immediately stopped. I saw his pistol. Then Stackhouse came up to the head of my horse: he presented a pistol, and took hold of my horse. Then the other that was behind came and jumped upon the shafts of my carriage. I had my hands down, with my reins and whip. He said, What do you hold your hands down for? Hold them up. He said, Your watch as well as your money. He took my watch and my money, and gave them to Litchfield, on my left hand. I was some time pulling off my gloves. Stackhouse said, Blast his eyes, if he is not quick, clap a pistol to his head, and blow his brains out. I said, Gentlemen, have a little patience, and I'll give you my watch and money. After they had got my watch and my money, which was about seven or eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060015"/> shillings, they clapped their hands on the cut-side of my breeches; then they jumped from my carriage, and I came about my business. They went towards Harrow, and I came on to town. As I came along, I gave intelligence to all I met. When I came to the back of the Foundling Hospital I met a coach, I said to the coachman, Are you going upon the Harrow road? I told him three men had just robbed me. I found they were some of Sir

I took the watch to the window to examine it; then in came Temple and Litchfield, to ask the price of a pair of breeches, that lay in the window. I never saw either of them before, to my knowledge, I told him, I had no breeches that would suit him. They went out, and came in again a second time: they said, if I would shew them the breeches, they were sure they would do. I said I had none that would do. They went out again, and I observed then to loiter about the door. I went then to Stackhouse, and desired he would write his name upon a ticket. He wrote upon it the name,

I asked him whose watch it was, that he offered to pledge; he said it was his property. I had observed it answered the bill. I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it of a milkman, or a slopman. I asked him whether he knew where the person was to be found; he mentioned first Litchfield-street, then Titchfield-street; then he mentioned another; and he said, if I would go along with him, he would shew me.

On the sixth of August I was coming home to my lodging in Red-Lion Square, betwixt twelve and one in the morning, when I met this girl in the street, to the best of my knowledge, at the top of Drury-Lane. She asked me where I was going; I replied to my lodging. Said she, I have a very good lodging, you may go along with me. She took hold of me, and said I should. I asked her what I must give her for the night, and offered her half a crown. She would not take it at first, so I was going away. Then she said, Come, I will take your money, rather than part with you. I then said, If you are an honest girl, I will give you a little more. She then replied, she had a good room, and no person should come to meddle with me. I went with her, but do not know the name of the street. She locked the door. I put my breeches under my head, when I went to bed, and soon fell asleep. The next thing I heard was her calling to some of her acquaintance at the window. It awaked me, and I immediately sought for my breeches, and found them much in the same place where I had placed them; but my money was gone, which was half a guinea, twelve shillings, and three half crowns. I had put it in a purse in my right hand breeches pocket. I then said, Young woman, you told me you would be very honest. Do you miss any thing? said she. I said, I miss all my money, and if you do not give it me, I will go for a constable. Said she, I do not care for what you or a constable can do. I immediately went, and met with a young man, who directed me to a constable, while he watched at the door. The constable and I came, but she was gone to another house. We went there, and found her in bed with another woman. She had tied a handkerchief about her face, that she might appear like a man. Said the constable, Let us take the things from about this head, and see whether it is a man or a woman. We did so, and found it to be the woman. She then abused the constable in such a manner, as nothing could be like it. I was just come from Tunbridge-Wells, and was as sober as I am this minute. I have lost my place by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money when you went into the room?</p>
               <p>Ross. I am sure I had.</p>

After we discovered her, by undressing her head, she was in a terrible passion, and swore and made a great noise. She said she had got the money, and she would take care and keep it.

He then searched his purse, and found half a crown in it, and then said, if I would make it up half a guinea, he would let me go: I replied, if I had it, I would spend it.

I suspected the prisoner, as she came up and down to a prisoner in my house. I went about among the pawnbrokers on the 20th of August, and met with some of the things. She came to our house, and was going up stairs to speak with a person, so I told her I wanted to speak with her. I got her into the parlour, and accused her with taking these things: at first she denied it, but she soon owned she had taken the petticoat and gown, and had pawned them; and said, that she would go with me and fetch them, as they were in her own name. We took her before the justice the next morning; there she confessed she had taken the things. She went with me, and we had the gown delivered to us.</p>

A man, I know not who, neither do I know where, offered me a part of a bed. I went with him to a house. I remember I pulled my coat and waistcoat off, and he knocked me down, and took my watch from me. I called after him, and said I would not lose it so. I ran out after him, and fell down in the mud. Then I went for my coat and waistcoat, but could not get in, as the door was fast. Being thus naked, I became cool upon it. I went and knocked up an acquaintance of mine in Wapping, and lay down there. I told him I had lost my coat, waistcoat, and watch. In the morning a gentleman came to me, and said he had got scent of my things. He took me to a public house, the Three Crowns, where was the prisoner. The prisoner said he was not the person who knocked me down, but he could send for the things. He sent a woman out, and she brought my coat and waistcoat. The next day we took him before the justice, who committed him; and the day after he was taken before the bench of justices in Whitechapel; from thence he was committed to Newgate. I have no recollection of the man that knocked me down.</p>

            . Last Tursday morning this witness came with a card of mine to my house, and asked me whether I knew a short, thin young man, with such clothes, and his hair clubbed. I asked her her business with him; she said she wanted to see him. I asked if any accident had happened to him; then she told me he was in liquor one night, and she met him in Fenchurch-street, and took him down to Nightingale-lane, to a public-house; there they drank, and he being sleepy, a man told him, if he would go home with him, he should have a bed; that she followed, and as soon as he had pulled his coat and waistcoat off, and hung them on the back of a chair, that the man gave him a clout, took his watch out of his fob, and went out at the door with it: then he said he would not lose his watch so, that he went out after him, and tumbled down: then they shut the door upon him, and shut him out, with his coat and waistcoat in the inside, and he having lost the man, went to an acquaintance's house in a yard in Nightingale-lane. I sent to the prosecutor's office, and found he had not been there; then I went up into Leicester-fields to his landlord, but finding he had not been at home all night, I went with the woman. When I came there, she shewed me the door. I found a padlock upon it. The prisoner came down the alley at the time. She said, That is the man that knocked the gentleman down, and took his watch out of his pocket; and she would swear it. Upon that the prisoner turned back, and when he got to the corner of the alley, he ran. I pursued him up into Ratcliff-highway, where I was told he was gone up Saltpetre-bank. I ran, and then saw him straight before me, about two hundred yards from me. When I got near him, he turned round, and said, Is it me you mean? I replyed, Yes, my friend, the woman says you are the man. He said he was not. I took him to the Three Crowns in Ratcliff-highway, where I got assistance, and went to the house where the prosecutor was in bed. I told him, I understood he had been used ill; that I had my intelligence of it from a woman, and had got the man in hold. He then got up and went with me to give the prisoner in charge. The prisoner said, if he would forgive him, he would produce the coat, waistcoat, and watch, and begged for mercy. He sent a woman of his acquaintance out, and she brought the coat and waistcoat. We went after the watch, but that was handed away.</p>

               <p>Coming along I heard some disturbance about these clothes. I heard it mentioned where they were sold; they said there had been a robbery committed, but where and how I could not tell. Then this gentleman came, and asked me, and I told him the coat and waistcoat were brought. They told me if I would give them three guineas, they would make the affair up.</p>

             M'Donald. On the fifteenth of July I employed the prisoner to carry a box, in which were the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) from Portland-street to Wapping. I picked him up in Tyburn-road, and asked him if he was a porter; he said, Yes. When he took it up, he said, You must pay me, for you will not meet me at Wapping. I gave him a direction, when by St. Anne's church, to carry it to Hore's wharf, Wapping, and ask for the first Inverness smack I said, You must not deliver the box to any body. Upon reflection, I did not think it safe to leave him. This gave me an opportunity of looking at him. When we came to <placeName id="t17690906-37-crimeloc194">Fish-street hill</placeName>

I and my friend walked on, and when we were got a few yards into Thames-street, I looked back, but could not see him; then we concluded he was gone the nearest way to Tower-hill, but we could not find him. I went to the wharf, but he had not been there with the box. I had the box and goods described in an advertisement on the Monday. On the 17th of August I met the prisoner in Watling-street, at the corner of Bread-street. I seized him, charged a constable with him, and sent him that night to Wood-street Compter. I asked him what he had done with my box; he said he did not know any thing of my box, but turned as pale as death. The next day I carried him before my Lord Mayor, where he was examined. He would not own to the fact. There was his master, whom he worked for. My lord said to the prisoner, If you will not tell where your lodgings are, here is one that will; so the prisoner told us. My lord granted a warrant to search his lodgings. I went with the constable. There I found some of the gold lace, and the oil cloth that covered the box, with my hand writing upon it, and some buttons and thread, silk, buckram, and lining. These were furniture for a riding habit: they were all rolled up in the buckram. (The oil cloth and lace produced. Upon the oil cloth was the letter M. and a number wrote by the prosecutor.) I asked the prisoner what he had done with the rest of the things; he said part of the goods he had left with a wheelwright in Swan-alley for a debt; the silk he told me he had sent to Leeds in Yorkshire, to one

On Tuesday, the 29th of August, the prisoner came into my shop, under pretence of buying some muslin for neckcloths; before I had an opportunity of shewing her some, she put her cloak on the counter upon a piece of cloth, and got it into her possession. I did not attempt to detect her till she got to the door. I privately told my man what she had got. When she went out, he followed her. She was not got above thirty-yards before he brought her back. As soon as she got to the shop door, I threw back her cloak, and took the piece of lawn from under her arm; then I charged her with stealing it. She asked me what I meant by charging her; but she soon acknowledged she had taken it, and begged I would take no notice of it. (The price produced and deposed to.)</p>

            , brought this metal watch, and wanted some money upon it; from his appearance I was scrupulous about lending him any thing upon it. He said it was left him by an aunt with many other things, besides 30 l. a year. I looked in a book, in which we enter every watch that is advertised, with name and number, and not finding such advertised, I lent him 27 s. upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Curtois. I had seen him once before about twelve months ago. On the Friday following he brought me a gold watch; then I thought it looked very suspicious. He told me that was left him by the same person. I looked in my book, and found such a one advertised as stolen from Mr. Slater. The seal was likewise described. I went round the counter and seized him. He looked very much confused. Then he declared he had it of a man that was waiting just by for the money. I said he must find that man, or I should have him before a magistrate. I got a constable. Then the prisoner went with us to a public-house, where he said the man was drinking, in Bishopsgate church yard. I bid him go up to the man, when we got near the house; he accordingly went up to the prisoner, who was sitting drinking at the door. I asked Backwell if that was the man; he said it was. We took them both into a little room in the house, where the constable searched them. Upon Backwell was found a pair of paste sleeve-buttons, as mentioned in the indictment, and some other trifling things, and we found a few odd trifles on the prisoner; but the prosecutor did not own any of the things found upon the prisoner. I got them into the coach, and sent them to the Compter, and the next morning to the Mansion-house before my Lord mayor. There the prisoner acknowledged giving the watches to Backwell to make money of: he likewise told my Lord-mayor the same story that Backwell had told me, that they were left him (the prisoner)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060025"/> by an aunt, in the same manner. My Lord committed the prisoner to Newgate, and took bail for Backwell, in order to give evidence against the prisoner here. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Backwell was not examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Backwell had the watches of me to pawn, I being out of money I had the watches of a captain near the Tower, who said he was going over to Germany, to his family, and he would sell them to me cheap: this was about the middle of July. I looked at them. I had an old silver watch of my own, that was my father's; he said he would take that in exchange, which he did, and I gave him three guineas and a half; he gave me in two or three trifling things, as a pair of sleeve buttons, and a ring. I never saw him in my life before.</p>

He used to go to breakfast into King's Head Court, where a butcher's boy found some iron, new and old, in a hole as he went thorough the court, and carried it to a smith in Tower Street for sale. He was stopped, and then told where he got it. The smith, whose name is Wells, came and told me of it. I then took a piece of the iron, and went into a shop opposite to the hole which was in the court; where I staid till dinner time: then the prisoner came and put his arm into the hole, to feel for the iron. I went over to him with the iron in my hand, and said, Here, sir, this is the iron you are looking for. He fell into a great passion, and said he never put any iron there. I took him by the collar, and brought him to my shop; he wanted to go into the cellar to ease himself, but I refused him. We had then a struggle, and he got out of my hands. I discovered some iron he had upon him, about four pounds and a half. He was but a very poor workman, but I was obliged to keep him, on account of his being a freeman, as he would not let me take another, and I had never an apprentice. (The iron produced in two parcels, that found in the hole, and that upon him.) This found upon him, I took from him; it was stuck in his breeches, with his apron over it. The prisoner begged for mercy, and confessed he took all that iron out of my shop. I can swear to the greatest part of the iron.</p>

When the prisoner was gone to dinner, a little after one o'clock, on the 20th of July, I saw him return, and my master with him, holding him by the flap of his coat. My master said, Fetch a constable. My master then asked him how he could be such a villain as to rob him of that iron; he said he had not robbed him of any more; he wanted to go down into the cellar to ease himself, but my master would not let him. I saw my master take two pieces of iron; they were tied together, and put down in his breeches; about four pounds and a half of it.

            . I am a pawnbroker in Bird-Street, Oxford Road. The prisoner came to my shop, and offered this spoon to sale on the 21st of August, in the morning. I told him the arms or name had been scratched out, and asked him how he came by it; he said he found it upon a dust-hill, in Mary-le-bone, near the place where I live. I asked him who had erased the mark out; he said that was done by a man that belongs to one Mr. Ward. I said I would go to that man; he did not agree to that, but said he would go and bring the owner. I asked him who he lived with; he said his master's name was Quin, and that he lived in Piccadilly. I took him to Sir John Fielding's, but Sir John was not at home; then the prisoner told me Mr. Burgell was the owner of the spoon. We sent for Mrs. Brooks, and she said it was her master's property. The prisoner is about seventeen or eighteen year old.</p>

The prisoner at the bar brought these tools to me to sell, on the 24th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, and declared he lived in Clerkenwell.

There he confessed he had them from a building at <placeName id="t17690906-47-crimeloc246">Hoxton</placeName>

About four o'clock he came into the yard again, when he saw a mare, and said, That is a very pretty mare. Said he, Can you tell me what mine is worth? The horse was brought out. I said, He is put up to be sold to the best bidder. He was put up at 4 l. I looked round, but did not see the prisoner. I said, Will any man give nine guineas for him? After that a gentleman came to me, and said, Book the young man's horse (meaning the prisoner) to me, I have bought him. I said, What did you buy him for? He said he bought him for 4 l. I said, I will not book him, for I think he is stolen: he is worth double the money. The prisoner turned pale. I took him before the Justice, and he was committed to the New Gaol.

               <p>F. Turner. I have seen him beat her. On Sunday the 30th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise, and I went out to his door, and saw him knock her down in the passage with his hand: I cannot say whether it was open or not. I went home, and in about five minutes after she came out in a very bloody condition, and sat under my window. The blood issued out from under her left eye, and she cryed.

               <p>Q. What sort of a wound was it?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. The wound was not very large. I cannot say what it seemed to be given with. The blow was under her eye, and her eye was black presently. We put a piece of raw beef to it, to prevent the blackness. She staid no longer than she had the beef put to it, and her maid bound it on. She then went out of my place. I saw her no more till about half an hour past twelve. Then her maid came and desired I would go to her mistress's house, to see what money she had in her pocket. I went, and her husband bid her give Mrs. Turner what money she had. She said she would, but he should not see it. He bid her give it me immediately, but she did not. He knocked her down by a blow on the left side of her head, and she fell on her right side. This was with his fist. Her fall knocked my child, which followed me, into the fire-place. When she was down, he kicked her in the face, and several parts of her body, and called her b - h and w - e, and a great many names. I saw him kick her in the belly, but I do not know how many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. She was sober, to the best of my knowledge. He then swore he would see her heart. She said, Jemmy, you will kill, or have killed me, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she given him any other provocation, besides that of refusing to give you the money?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. She had not given him any other, nor no ill language. I was frighted at my child's falling, so I took her up and got away. I never saw her afterwards, till I saw her dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she subject to fits?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. I never knew that she was. What he did, was with his feet and fist.</p>

I went immediately to her window, there was none but those two in the house, where I saw he had her by the hair, beating her head against the ground, or bedstead, I know not which. I said, Have you a mind to kill your wife? Then he loosed her. She came out immediately, and sat under Mrs. Turner's window, all of a gore blood. I held a bason, while Mrs. Turner washed her face. I observed a wound under her left eye. After she was washed, she went in again; then I went out, and never saw her till after she was dead.</p>

            . I am husband to the last evidence. I lodged in the prisoner's house, and am a lathrender. When they were sober, they lived well enough, but when she was drunk, they did not; and they might be both drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they use to fight?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which do you think had the best of it?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. I believe the man had of the two. On the 30th of July I lay in bed till almost ten o'clock, and when I came down they were quarreling and making a noise. They were not fighting, but I suppose he had been beating her. I went through the passage, and went out about my business. I saw nothing more that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he generally beat her with?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. He generally beat her with his hands. I never saw him use any thing but his hands. When they were both sober, they lived tolerably civil together. I never saw her strike, only struggle.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what do you mean by fighting?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. He struck her. She might strike him for what I know. The woman was a very industrious woman, and always at work, either drunk or sober.</p>

            . I live in Berwick-court. On Sunday the 30th of July, I think between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come in with his hands on his wife's shoulders, at the upper end of the Court, to suppor her, she having the yoak and pails on her shoulders with milk in them. It appeared she could not very well walk, and she seemed like in a dying condition. They were going to Mrs. Jones's, where I live. He brought her in at the door, and he laid her down on the bed in the fore-parlour. She said, Mrs. Bliss, come and speak to me. I went to her. She said, Put your hand into my bosom. I did, and found her of a cold sweat. I said, Mary, has your husband beat you to-day? because I knew he used to beat her. She said, He has beat me, has stamped upon me, and he has killed me to-day. The prisoner said, Mary, shall I sell the milk? She said, Yes. He went out; then I called him back, and said, You have killed your wife to-day, and you shall not go, for she is dying. He came back; then he went for an apothecary, but was stopt, and I sent a boy. She did not lie above a quarter of an hour. I said to Mrs. Jones, Mary is dying; do not let her die upon the bed. She was taken from the bed, and set on a chair near the door. Her husband brought her in his arms. An apothecary came, who bled her at the door, and I pulled the ribbon from my head to tie her arm up. I believe she might live an hour and a half, or two hours, after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak after?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. I heard her say, after she was bleeding, Let me go home and die. The prisoner took her up in his arms and carried her two or three doors farther in the court. She was set upon a chair, and there she died. I saw a great many bruises. I saw a place under her throat, that seemed to have been nipped; it was black and blue, and as big as a five-shilling piece. I saw also another near her left temple. There was likewise a little hole where a little singer might be put in, and the blood ran out of it. The prisoner fetched a pennyworth of beer, and went to give her some, but she could not take it. There was a coach came, then the beadle and another man took her out of the court. The prisoner staid by her till after she was dead, when they took him to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her in liquor lately?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. I have seen her in liquor, but not lately; for the last fortnight or three weeks she came home at her time to a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060031"/>Q. Did you say before the coroner, you saw her child move in her belly?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. I saw a working and heaving in her belly, so I thought she was with child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor the day she died?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. No, she was not. She did not smell of liquor.</p>

            . I lived servant with the prisoner. On Sunday, the 30th of July, his wife desired I would send him to meet her, to help her home with her milk. He said he could not go. She came home in a very great passion, and aggravated him to strike her; that began the first fray. It being a usual thing, I took no notice of it. That was the time she got the blow on her temple. I did not see it given, because I had the child. I tied up her head with a handkerchief at Mrs. Turner's window. She came in again, and my master was then out. She went to her chest and took out the money; he was afraid she would spend it, so he came in, and insisted on seeing it, when blows began again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any blows?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She would if she could. I said, Will you trust me to see the money? she said, No. Then I went and called Mrs. Turner to be a witness. She fell down, when Mrs. Turner's child was at the fire-place; but I cannot say whether he knocked her down or not: he kicked her on her side two or three times, and beat her over her head.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was she down, receiving those kicks?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. It might be a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes. The whole beating continued about that time. She might be that time, or more, upon the ground. He got the money from her about ten minutes after she was upon the ground. She endeavoured to prevent him from getting the money, by keeping her hands close.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let him beat her?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I could not help it. If I had happened to get a blow, it would have knocked my old carcase to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she attempt to fight again?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She had no strength; she fell over the chairs, or something or other, a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say, upon your oath, she attempted to strike her husband that day?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I believe she did, as near as I remember, after the kicking and beating on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. During the first beating did she?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. No, she did not attempt to strike at all then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She was pretty well. She could go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Turner in the house at the time of his kicking and beating?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear such an expression as this, That he would see the heart of her?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I do not remember that. God help me, it might be said, and I not mind it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say, Jemmy, you have killed me, or you will kill me?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I have heard her say so, but do not remember I heard it then.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was sent for the 2d of August, to see the body of the deceased. Upon examining the body, I found several external marks of violence; one on the right side of her belly, another on her right arm, and another on her left. The body was putrid, and the face quite black. I imagine the blackness of the face was owing to her having been so long dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you imagine the mark on the right side might proceed from?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. It might proceed from blows, or the putridness of the body. There was a small puncture on the right groin, through the skin and fat, above half an inch deep. I opened the body, and found in the cavity of the belly a large quantity of extravasated blood; some in a coagulated state, and some in a fluid state; which must proceed from some external violence, or from the rupture of some vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it proceed from blows or kicks on the out-side?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. Undoubtedly it might. The rest of the viscera was all in a sound state. The whole contents of the belly appeared to be in a sound state. We then proceeded to open the head, which was quite found.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, what in your opinion was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. Upon the whole, my opinion is, that her death was owing to the extravasation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060032"/> of blood, which might happen by some external violence. The body seemed to be exceedingly in health.</p>
               <p>Q. As she had been three days dead, might not her agonies and struggling in her last moments break some of the vessels, and occasion that extravasation?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. It is possible, but not probable.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgment whether this was occasioned by a fall, or a violent blow?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. I have no criterion to judge, whether the breaking the vessel was occasioned by a fall, or a violent blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the deceased was with child or not?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. She was not with child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spence. I was with Mr. Foot in inspecting the body of the deceased. There were many parts of the body where I suspected there had been bruises, but I could hardly distinguish them, from the body being putrid. There was a place on the right side, that I am satisfied proceeded from the external violence of a blow or a fall. The extravasation I imagine to be the cause of her death, which might be by a fall against any hard substance, as well as by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she with child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Spence. She was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went out, and met my wife coming home that day about eleven o'clock; I had the child in my arms. She asked me, why I did not follow her and help her home with the milk; My dear, I said, the child is cross, and I thought you would scold me among the customers, and I did not choose to be scolded. When she came up to me at the door, Give me the child, said she. I said, Perhaps you will hurt the child. She said, What is that to you? it is none of your child. Mary, said I, if you was sober, you would not say so. I do not care, drunk or sober, said she, I have got somebody to go to, besides you. I delivered the child to her, and then she tore the shirt off my back. Mary, I said, I will go to prayers; here is half a guinea for you to make you quiet and easy; and, if you do not be quiet, the lodgers will not pay me any money to-day. They most commonly paid every Sunday. She took the child, and went to a public-house, but she got no liquor there, because she was drunk; then she went to another, and had a glass of gin there; and she then made towards home. I was afraid she would drop the child. (She had once before dropped it in the street, and I picked it up.) When she came to Hanover Yard, she laid the child down by an apple woman; I followed her, and took care of the child, which was all I minded. I took the child up, and carried it home. Where did you get that child? said she. I said, from an applewoman. She said, It was not my child. I have taken all the money out of the box, said she, and shall not come home till next week. Then we had words. She would have the child. I said, Perhaps you will drop the child, and kill it. She said, I don't care, it is none of your's. (This was between twelve and one o'clock.) She struck me on one side of my head. It vexed me, to be sure. Then she told me to give her the child. I said, To make every thing easy, I will give you the child. What do you strike me for, Mary? I gave her the child, went out, and advised her to go to bed, and get sober. She told me she would do as she pleased. She would go out and spend five pounds before she came home. About two months before, she took seven pounds from me, all in silver, and staid out three days and three nights. I never could find her till she came home in a coach. I was obliged to give the coachman two shillings. She has been drunk three weeks together before that. She told me she would bring a broker, and sell all the things in the house, and put the money in her pocket to spend; adding, she had others to go to besides me.</p>

When I would not serve her, she went to the Two Brewers, in the same street, and had a quartern of gin. She had her baby under her arms, and I was afraid she would drop it. I never heard of any misbehaviour in regard to the prisoner in my life; he was always good-natur'd, and quite tender of her, when she has been in liquor; but she was always for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060033"/> gin way.

            . I have known the deceased thirteen years. She came to my house very much in liquor the same day, between ten and eleven o'clock; she had her child upon her arm. She said she had been at her sister-in-laws, and said, if Jemmy calls for twenty pots of beer, they will draw it for him, but they will not let me have any. My daughter gave her a dram of gin. I said, Mary, sit down, and have some tea. No, said she, I will have no tea. I replied, Do, Mary, my dear, have some tea, and go and lie down on my bed, for you are in liquor, and perhaps, by so doing, Jemmy will not discover it. No, said she, I will not, for I have an old woman at home, perhaps she will sell my milk. I wanted to take the child, but she would not let me. She went away, and I followed her as far as Mr. Murphy's door; there she fell to scolding Mrs. Murphy, and calling her names. She went away, and I saw no more of her till about five o'clock, when I was inform'd she was dead. I ran to her house, and saw her sitting in a chair dead.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phipps, woollen draper on Ludgate Hill. On the 16th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was backwards in the kitchen, (we can see from thence to the shop) and I saw the end of a man's coat going out at the shop door. I pursued as fast as possible; he crossed the way opposite the Old Bailey; he made off as fast as ever he could walk, and when he got about two hundred yards, I stopped him. He had this piece of superfine crimson cloth under his arm, with a bag thrown over the end of it. I charged him with stealing it: he pointed to the other side the way, and said, That man gave it him. There were a great many people where he pointed. I brought him back to my master. ( Produced in court and deposed to.) All he said, when I brought him back, was, that another man gave it him. There was no opportunity to shift it. I saw him immediately, and I took him in about a quarter of a minute after he was out of the shop.</p>

            . On the 19th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I met with two girls, standing at a door in <placeName id="t17690906-54-crimeloc293">Great Earl-street</placeName>

I went up into her room, and agreed to give her two shillings to lie with her. I gave her a shilling to get a pot of beer before we went to bed. The other girl fetched it. There was no body but the two girls and I when we drank it. After I was gone to sleep, the prisoner got up, and was gone, I suppose, to Elwood's room. Elwood and another person came in, and he had the complaisance to take me by the collar, and draw me out of bed: then he held me by the collar, and gave me a blow on the cheek. I desired to have my breeches, which I had put under the feather bed; but I found them at the foot of the bed. I put them on, but found there was no money.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060035"/> I had the money, mentioned in the indictment, sewed up in a purse, in my fob, when I went to bed. Elwood said, Go along, French bugger. Then the prisoner came into the room with them. There was some silver saved, which was in my waistcoat pocket. I went down stairs, and met the watch; then we took the two prisoners, and carried them to the round-house. They were searched, but none of the money was found. This was about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. Neither one nor the other. I had been to make water in the yard, and then I felt, and know I had my purse and money. This was before I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take your money from, when you sent for the beer?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. I took it out of my right-hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. from Elwood. Whether you did not draw three-pence from your master, when you had earned six-pence?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. No, never. I brought this money with me from France. I changed some of my French money in the packet with a gentleman that was going over.</p>
               <p>Q. from Elwood. Whether you did not offer to make this up, provided I would give you ten guineas?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. No, never.</p>

I was even obliged to call murder. Then he wanted his money again, but I would not give it him. He then put on his clothes, and we both came down together. After that it was a full half hour before he brought the watchman and constable.</p>

I used to lie in the lodge when the family was in town, but that night I locked both the lodges up, about nine or ten at night, and went and lay with my wife. In the morning I found the window wrenched open, and the things mentioned were gone. There were workmen paving the yard. They were all willing to be searched. The prisoner had worked there, but had been discharged about a week before. We had a suspicion of him, so I went to inquire about at the pawnbrokers, and found the livery frock at Mr. Jenkinson's, a pawnbroker in Great Poultney Street, with two other waistcoats, and other things.</p>

            . On the second of September, about nine at night, the prisoner came to my house and wanted to pledge a thickset frock and waistcoat, and two other waistcoats: he wanted two guineas upon them. Mr. Barker had been at my house and described the things he had lost. I stopped the prisoner. He had upon him all these things. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here are all the things, except the clasps, razor and shoes. The prisoner had my pumps on, and the shoes were found at his lodgings.</p>

               <p>I was coming to work at Durham-yard, when I met a young man in St. James's Square, who said he was in great distress, and asked me if I would buy these things. I did not know the consequence of buying them, not having been from Ireland above eight or nine weeks. I bought them for 17 s. and turned back and left them in my lodgings till six o'clock, when I went to pledge them.</p>

All the rings that Mrs. Gibson had in the back parlour were gone, and a gold watch case, all my plate, and two five-guinea pieces, with several medals, and a great many other things were gone. All the things mentioned in the indictment were taken away. I never saw any of the things again, but the two five-guinea pieces; they were found where the prisoners used day and night, as I am informed.</p>

             myself. I cannot tell the time, it was about a month ago, and I gave this information, upon which the prisoners were taken up, which was the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give the information?</p>
               <p>Graham. They had got some money, and I had not what I should have of it, so I went and gave the information. I was in the street at the time this robbery was done, to see if any body came.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plate?</p>
               <p>Graham. I do not know. I never disposed of any of it. I only saw the gold watch case, and three or four rings. I saw some of the money. There was a quantity of gold, seventeen guineas, and two large pieces; I heard say they were two five-guinea pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with them?</p>
               <p>Graham. Not above a month of six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do they follow?</p>
               <p>Graham. I do not know what either of them follow.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Graham. I am a cabinet maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What share had you of the money of this robbery?</p>
               <p>Graham. I believe I had not above nine guineas of it. My quarrel was not about this robbery, it was about another.</p>

There were five more along with the prisoner. They held me down. I struggled as hard as I could. They took my shoes, metal buckles, and three pennyworth of half-pence out of my pocket, and my hat from my head. They left me a pair of old slippers and an old hat, and said, Change was no robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Spencer. It was a star light night, and I knew the prisoner right well; he was in the same dress as now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call for assistance?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I durst not speak a word. They gave me a lick. When they had taken all from me, they went away, and I followed them. I went into Smithfield, and saw the prisoner sitting at the Ram door; the lamp was over the door. The watch was coming crying the hour; I charged the watch with him. He got away, but was taken the next day, by the tokens I had given of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the tokens you gave of him?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I described him in a gentleman-servant's dress, and a brown coat. The constable has my shoes.</p>

               <p>J. Williams. The prosecutor described a man something like a footman. I remembered I saw such a man going my round. I did not catch him that night, but I did the next day at the One Tun in Field-lane, and the woman that turned evidence swore the prisoner was the man that robbed the prosecutor. The next day, when the prosecutor saw the shoes, he directed me to her, but she was not to be found. He owned the fact<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060043"/> before my Lord Mayor and me. He said another man persuaded him to do it, and helped to hold the prosecutor while he robbed him. He owned he was the man that took the shoes from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the shoes?</p>
               <p>J. Williams. I am a shoemaker. The prosecutor told me they had taken his shoes from him. I went to enquire about Field-lane, and found them at one Elson's, where the prisoner had sold them. (The shoes produced in Court.)</p>

            . I bought these shoes of the prisoner at the bar, on the 10th of July. ( Holding them in his hand.) I did not know him before, but I knew him again when I saw him before my Lord Mayor. I changed another pair for them, with giving him a shilling to boot; these I value at two shillings and nine-pence. I was informed I should be all the money out of pocket, so I persuaded him to give me mine again; this was when he was going to gaol; when he came to me, he had the shoes on his feet, and said he gave six shillings and six-pence for them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These shoes are my property, there are two rows of nails round the heels.</p>

               <p>On a Monday morning, about ten o'clock, my father gave me four shillings to buy a pair of shoes; going down Snow-hill, I saw a Jew coming along, with those shoes in his hand; he said he would sell them worth the money, if I would buy them. He asked three shillings for them; I bid him half a crown; at last I bought them for three shillings: I carried them home to my father, but they were too big for my father; my father lives in Grub-street; he is a shoemaker; I am a porter for him. He had not time to make them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. Did the prosecutor always give the same account as now?</p>
               <p>Williams. He always did, only in a blundering way.</p>

            . Last Wednesday was a week, between nine and ten at night, my master sent me with some sugar in a handkerchief to carry on board our ship, the Enterpize, a collier; she lay at Cole-stairs. As I was going with it three men passed me; when I was got not ten yards from the door of the public-house where my master was, the hindmost of the three, which was Murphy, took hold of me, but I would not let go the handkerchief of sugar; then he gave me a knock with his hand on my arm, and I was obliged to let it go; my fellow-servant was with me, he catched hold of him. (He is a boy.) Then Murphy knocked him down, but my fellow-servant got up again, and catched hold of him; the prisoner gave the sugar to another man that was with him, who ran away with it. Then the prisoner Murphy came back to the public house. My master told him he had no business to knock me down, and shoved him away; then my master sent me to the boat. I never saw Murphy before he laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Murphy come back of his own accord, or was he brought back?</p>
               <p>Bond. There were several people along with him.</p>

            . I am fellow-servant to Bond. I was sent with him on board the ship, between nine and ten that night; he had some sugar; and in going we met three men; Murphy was one of them; he was the hindermost; he laid hold of Bond, and took the sugar away. Then I took hold of him, and he knocked me down; I got up and laid hold of him again; then I cried out Stop thief! when some people came out and laid hold of him; he was then carried back to my master at the public-house. Mr. Willson keeps it. I told my master what he had done. My master bid him go about his business; he went away directly, came back again, and abused us, and said he was not the man.</p>

The boy had hold of his jacket. He made a blow at the boy, but whether he struck him or not, I know not. The man was like Murphy. I took him to Mr. Willson's. There was a croud about.

            . I was the officer of the night. I was sent for by Captain Taylor to take the prisoners to the watch-house. I found the two prisoners at the public-house, the Plume of Feathers. The captain told me the prisoners had robbed his boys of a handkerchief of sugar. I asked them why they were guilty of such a crime; they said they had not robbed them. They said they would give the captain the value of the handkerchief and sugar. I asked the captain the value of them; he said four or five shillings. Murphy told the captain he would give him that money, if he would let him go clear. The captain was not willing they should go, so they were taken before the justice the next morning. There Murphy confessed he took the sugar from the boy, and that Miller sold it for two shillings and six-pence; and Miller said he had sold it, but he said he found the sugar lying by a post. Murphy said he delivered the sugar into Miller's right hand.</p>

            . I keep the Plume of Feathers, a public-house, at Cole-stairs, Shadwell. Captain Taylor was at my house. I heard him bid these boys take the handkerchief and carry it to the boat. The boys had not been long out before I heard one of them call Stop thief! The people ran out of my house and brought Murphy in. The boy said, as soon as he was brought in, he was the man that took the handkerchief out of his hand. The captain said, Are not you a rogue to go to rob my boy in this manner? Murphy denied it. Upon that the captain bid him go about his business, like a villain as he was. After that the captain said, It is a bad thing I should be robbed in this manner at your door. I replied, I was very sorry for it, but throught he was to blame to let the man go, without bringing him to justice. I went out, and said I would see for him. I found him at the George, that is better than two hundred yards from my house. I brought him to the captain. I said to him, You had better return the sugar to the captain, and the captain will let you go about your business. Upon this he said he would get it, and give the captain it again. His wife came in, he sent her about to look for Miller, and to desire him to bring that handkerchief again. A little time after, Miller came to my house; but he denied that he knew any thing at all about it. Then I told the captain it was proper to charge them both, so he charged them both. When they were before the justice, Miller owned he had sold some sugar, which he picked up in a handkerchief behind a post.</p>

               <p>I am as innocent as your lordship. I was coming from work, and called at my master's, at Bell-wharf. I get my bread at sea. I had been out at day work, and that night, coming along by Mr. Willson's, this boy got up and got hold of me, and said, I had got a handkerchief of sugar from him. I turned about and said, Well, if I have it, I must have it; so upon that his master came up, and searched me, and desired me to go about my business, saying to his boy, You d - g, now you see he has not got it. I went to the Three Cups, and sat and drank a pot of beer. I know no more. I was mortal drunk. My scull was fractured on board the Royal George. I know not what I do, or what I say. I am quite innocent of every thing upon earth.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she come by her death?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. By an ax. The prisoner used to beat and abuse her several times. (I have seen him.) She had a cut on one side of her temple; it was a great hole. I think the prisoner did it by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think he did it?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. Because he ran away, and the ax was found bloody. That day I was with my mother in her room; she said, Peggy you may go out, I shall go to sleep. I went out, and never went into the room any more before I found her dead. This was about eight o'clock, when I went to breakfast in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>M. Phipps. There is a long passage between.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her cry out?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. No, I did not. After she was dead, the prisoner went out, and went to an alehouse, about a mile and a half off. He was brought back, and charged with having killed my mother. He said he knew nothing about it. He was brought back by the ostler.</p>

            . I was out of the room, so I heard nothing. We did imagine my mistress was killed with an ax. (An ax produced in court, the pole end bloody.) It is my mistress's ax. I did not know, till this happened, but that the prisoner was my master. They lived as man and wife. He hired me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060046"/> I had been but eleven weeks there. The ax was found in a cellar adjoining to the room where my mistress was killed. The wound was on her temple. We thought it was by the back part of the ax. On the Sunday before this he struck her with an iron poker, with much violence, over the crown of her head. I came in and prevented him, or he would have struck her again. The blood ran down very much: upon the account of that, and his going away, we suspected he was the man that had killed her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Banyard. I am a surgeon. On the 30th of July, between eight and nine in the evening, I was desired to go to the Lamb inn, to Mrs. Phipps. I found her all over bloody about her head and bosom. I asked her what was the matter; she told me that Taunton had beat her with a poker. I asked in what manner; she said they had been at supper, and having a cucumber in her hand, she asked him whether he would have it peeled, or eat it with the rhind on: he made no answer, but went to the fire place, took up the poker, held it to her, and bid her lay hold of it. She said, What for? He said, Lay hold of it. She said, If I must, give me the clean end, and not the smutty end; but what must I lay hold of it for? He answered, To knock my brains out. No, said she, Taunton, I will not hurt a hair of your head. Then, said he, If you will not knock my brains out, I will knock your brains out, and immediately struck her with the poker. The first blow was on the top of the crown of her head; it laid the scull quite bare: the second blow was upon the forehead; it cut her, I suppose, an inch and a half, quite to the scull. I attended her; she went on very well till the Friday, when the prisoner came in while I was dressing the wound. I said, Look here, Taunton, what a sad accident has happened! If you had killed her, you would certainly have been hanged. He said he knew very well he should be hanged, and was very sorry for it, hoped she would get well, and desired I would take all the care of her I could. Then I apprehended no danger from the wound: but on the Friday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went down to visit her again, when the daughter came out, and called a couple of men. I think I heard murder called. I asked what was the matter; they said they believed Taunton had killed Mrs. Phipps. Immediately I went into the room, and found the body lying on the left side, the head upon the arm, seemingly asleep, with the right arm hanging over out of the bed. I observed a bruise on the right temple, the size of the palm of my hand; the scull seemed to be beat in: it seemed to be done with the head of this ax, or a hammer. I am in no doubt but that that wound was the immediate cause of her death. The bed-clothes were not disturbed. I believe she could not have power to stir after that. There was a large quantity of blood about. When I came out, I said to the ostler, Why do you not pursue him? Then this man and another followed, and brought the prisoner back into the parlour. I asked him how he came to do it: he said he could not tell. I said, you will certainly be hanged; you have killed the woman. I know it, said he, for I did it with the poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he did it?</p>
               <p>Banyard. No, he did not. I do not believe he had seen the body then. The ax was found bloody the next morning, in the cellar, when they went to take an inventory of the goods.</p>

            . I keep the George inn on Snow-hill. I have known the prisoner a great many years. He sent for me to come to him to Clerkenwell New-prison, I believe five weeks ago to-day. He said his money was taken from him. I imagine he wanted me to help him to some. I asked him several questions in regard to this murder, and told him I was afraid he was guilty of it; he said he was, and it could not be helped now; but he was sorry for it. He killed the woman (this he said.) I asked him his reason for doing it; he said, because she told lies of him. I asked him what those lies were; he said she said he was not a man sufficient for a woman, and that made the women laugh at him; upon which account he was determined to kill her.

               <p>Banyard. I do. I think it was the 18th of June. I was sent for by the clergyman of Colebrook to go to Taunton; it was reported he had attempted to hang himself. I blistered him, and gave him some physic, and in about seven days he was as well as ever I knew him, and has continued so since, as far as I know. I asked him the reason why he attempted to hang himself; he said he had been in the country to receive upwards of an hundred pounds of a master waggoner, and his being disappointed of it, Mrs. Phipps said she thought was the occasion of his attempting that rash action.</p>

            . I am constable. On the 19th of July the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, for breaking his house. This was about one in the night, at the watch-house. We took him before justice Welch: there he confessed every thing that he had done; that he broke in at the back part of the house, and broke a square of glass, after he had wrenched the window shutter up, and got into the house. Then I was ordered to examine his pockets, and in the lining of his coat I found four cups and four saucers, gold weights and scales, a pair of stockings, and a hood. The prisoner confessed he had taken them all. The prosecutor is not here.</p>

               <p>Huston. He was a baker, but he has enough to live upon, and he has laid down business. I think the prisoner is his brother-in-law.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the parish of St. Ann's, Soho. I was sitting in my watchbox in Chapel-street, about one o'clock, and I heard a noise. I saw two men together; one called watch, and said, This man has a looking-glass under his arm. I went and asked him (it was the prisoner) where he was going with it. He said into a street near Hanover-square. I followed him. Then he brought me back to Carnaby market, where I saw another watchman. I said, I am out of my bounds, so I charged him with the prisoner. After we got him to the watch-house, he desired us to send for Mr. Lister. In the morning Mr. Lister came to the watch-house, who owned the glass, and said the prisoner had robbed him now three times. The prisoner owned he wrenched open the window, got in, and took it.</p>

I looked and saw his pocket was cut. The prisoner sat on his right side, and it was his right side pocket that was cut. I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found four shillings upon him, as also the bottom of Mr. Holt's pocket. Mr. Holt had said he lost four shillings. (The bottom of the pocket produced.) Mr. Holt turned out his pocket, and the piece matched exactly. We found this clasp knife in his pocket. (Produced in Court.)</p>

I said I had no watch. He said he was sure I had more money. I said I had no more, and desired they would not use me ill. I gave him then my halfpence; but he said, D - n the halfpence, and gave me them again. He that did not hold the pistol took my silver buckles out of my shoes. They then bid me go about my business. I went on. It was so dark, that I cannot particularly swear to the men. One was in a surtout coat, and one of them was taller than the other. The tallest is the evidence: the short one took my buckles.</p>

We were coming from London, and stood at a gate till the prosecutor came by us; we let him pass a little way, then we followed, and I bid him stop. I had a pistol. I asked him for his money, he told me he had but very little; he gave it me. There was a nine-shilling piece, a half-crown, there shillings and six-pence, all bad money; there was none good; we could not pass any of it. The prisoner took his buckles out of his shoes. We went into a public-house, and had but one shilling, which was my own, that would go. I was taken this day six weeks, and the prisoner about three days after, by the information of a girl. I had given information of him before, but did not know where he was.</p>

I never offered to put them off.</p>

I set Noaks to watch, and we soon saw her again. Then she told me the prisoner was lying on the grass under a lamp. I went with her. About twenty yards before she came to him, she said, There he is, lying as before. I bid her go on, and if she was sure he was the person, to give me a touch on the arm; which she did, and I secured him: as the evidence, Troy, had told us he had a pocket pistol, I secured his hands, and found this pistol in his pocket, and a pocket-book. (Both produced in Court.) We took him in a coach, and brought him to town.</p>

               <p>Mr. Harding. I keep a public-house at Edmonton, and a team of three horses.

I had a little suspicion he did not come honestly by her. I thought she was worth more money. I gave him a guinea earnest, and I was to give him nine more at three weeks or a month after; but if I did not like her in that time, I was to give him four shillings a week for her work, and he was to return my money, and take her again. He said he was going to keep a shop in Stoney-Stratford, in Buckinghamshire. He told me he had swapt away another mare for her about two miles on the other side Hounslow, and said he lived by the Pewter-platter in St. John's-street. I went about three or four days after we had agreed, and enquired by the Pewter-platter, but could not hear any thing of him. He had wrote his name

I went after him, and found him standing at the end of a ditch by a stile. As soon as he saw me, he up with his stick, and said, Stand clear, I do not choose to be taken alive. I said, Mr. Watson, here is some suspicion against you, perhaps you may get clear. Said he, Do not take me, for I will not be taken alive. I said, There are many people in the corn field I shall call to, and you cannot help being taken. He made a blow at me, but missed me; then he ran. There was a boy before him with a large stick, and I said to the lad, Knock him down, split his scull if you can. He immediately came back, threw his stick down, and said, Gentlemen, take me and welcome, do not use me ill. I am guilty, I own; my life is not worth a farthing.

            . He desired to be carried to Mr. Harding's. I said he should go to the King's Head. I took him there, and got a cart, and brought him to the Brown Bear in Bow-street. Mr. Bond ordered us to carry him to New-prison for that night. We took him there. When we had him before Sir John, and after I had given an account that the prisoner was the person that sold the mare to Mr. Harding, the prisoner said he was the man. Sir John asked him if he knew any thing of a grey mare that was left at such a place; he said he knew nothing of one or the other. I told the justice I heard the prisoner say he changed another for her two miles on the other side Hounslow. He said I was a very false man, for he bought her two miles on the other side Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alford. I am a farmer. The prisoner was at my house, at Sutton Coldfield, in Staffordshire, on the 17th of July: he came about two in the afternoon, dined, and had some wine and water. He asked me whether I had any keeping to keep a mare. Some time after that he called to the ostler to bring his saddle and bridle. I asked him what countryman he was; he said he lived with Mr. Wiber and Mr. Carron, of Thickbroom. He left a grey mare, and made no agreement, only to turn her out to grass. This was the Monday before Mr. Collins's mare was missing. Mr. Collins lives about four miles from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas. I am a farmer, and live about four miles from the prosecutor. I know the mare very well; I used to see her almost every day. I have seen her since at Mr. Harding's at Edmonton. She is Mr. Collins's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I left my grey mare at Mr. Alford's house on a Monday, about eight or nine weeks ago. I had some dinner there, and I thought she was very weak, and not able to carry me to London, so I brought the saddle away, but not the bridle. I came into the London road about two miles on this side the gentleman's house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060052"/> then I came on the machine. On the Friday following I bought a little thing in Smithfield for three guineas and a half. I had a bed at the Swan and Two Necks. There was an acquaintance of mine, which I had not seen for two or three years; he went to Oxford races. I heard he was almost killed, when I was at Maidenhead; then I went through to see him, and found there was nothing in it. Coming along, we stopped at a public-house, I think the Coach and Horses, on the heath, where was a man in company with me, that was upon this mare; we were talking about changing, we stopt at that alehouse, and we agreed to change. I gave him five guineas to boot. He went over the bridge on this side Brentford. The mare was very thin, so I took her to a farmer's in a Green lane; I think his name is Willes or Wilmot, or some such name. I left her there a fortnight at grass. When I was riding down the road, going to Hodsdon, I called at Mr. Harding's house; he said I might light, and he would give my mare a bit of hay. He asked me whether she was for sale. I asked eleven pounds, or eleven guineas. We agreed upon the conditions he has mentioned, and I left her. I believe I was there again about three weeks after. Mrs. Harding said he was gone to some fair. I had three pennyworth of rum and water. I went to the Two Brewers at Ponder's End, to see a friend that worked at some mill; he was not there; then in coming over the field I met this man. I was going to Winchmore-hill. It rained very hard. I stood under a tree just by a stile, and was putting my leg over the stile when I saw him; he asked somebody that was meeting me to stop me. I could not tell what he meant. I did not know but he might come to arrest me for money. They threatened to knock me down. I told them I would surrender myself, and threw my stick down. I never said such words as he says I did.</p>

Mackaway did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060053"/> once rent the loft where the pigeons were taken from.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fryer. On the 27th or 28th of May, in the morning, the two prisoners and another came to my house. Mackaway said he had a mind to part with all his pigeons. (I knew him before, and that he did keep pigeons.) He produced five. He is a cooper by trade, and lives in Whitecross street. I gave him five shillings for them. Then the other lad and Fenton went and fetched eleven more. I gave them nine-pence a-piece for them. When they were gone, I asked Mackaway how long they would be gone; he said, Not a long while; they were only gone into Whitecross-street. They came again in about three quarters of an hour. (The pigeons produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor, pointing out which he bred, and which he bought.)</p>

On the 26th of last June, Pugh and Underwood came into our shop, about ten in the morning, and asked to see some printed linens. We shewed them great variety, among which was a piece which I folded up, and laid on the counter. There was only one woman in the shop at the time, and I am positive she could not take it, for I saw it after she was gone. They were a long time in buying, and at last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060054"/> they did buy two yards of coloured linen. There was not a creature in the shop for half an hour after they were gone, but within ten minutes, after they were gone, I missed this piece, which I had folded up. I went out, but could see nothing of them. The same day I got handbills and distributed about, particularly in Field and Chick-lane. The neighbours described them, and desired me to come again in the evening. I went, but did not meet with them. The neighbours desired me to come again in the morning. I went, and then I saw them both go into the Magpye and Horseshoe, at Holborn-bridge. I got a constable on Snow-hill. I knew them extremely well, they having been in our shop twice before. When we went to them, they owned they bought two yards of linen of me, and seemed surprized I should suspect them. We took them to the Mansion house, and they were committed to the Poultry Compter, but were discharged after three days. During which time we advertised the cloth in all the papers, but could not hear any thing of it; then we gave up the search entirely. On the 17th of July Mr. Ramsden, a linen-draper at the corner of Field-lane, whom I had told of our loss, and described the pattern, sent to me. I came. He told me he thought he had got the linen. He shewed it me; they had cut the sag end off where we had put our name; but there was another mark which wholesale drapers would have known it by. The pattern, and the quality of the cloth and my mark was the same as we lost, with the length of yards. My mark was on the outside. (Produced in Court; he points to the mark he made.) I bought the piece myself, and I made this mark on it. It is the letter B, which I always make with red chalk. I know it to be Mr. Blackwell's property.</p>

On the 23d of August, I had been gone out of the shop not above ten minutes, when my wife came and said I must come in a minute. I went in. Mrs. Ravenhill said two women had stole a piece of muslin, and described them: one in a brown gown, and a green hat, and the other in a linen gown, pinned back, and a long red cloak, with a black hat. We ran two or three of us, but could see nothing of them. We were told there had been a companion of theirs (a man) waiting in a passage, and he had nothing when there, and after that was met with something under his arm. We by describing them, and enquiring, found one went by the name of Darlin, and the other Haycock. We were told to wait at the Cock in the corner, and there we might see them all three together. I went and waited there, and I followed

             and the man, Underwood, into the Old Bailey. When I went to take him, he gave me a smack on the face, and the woman said she would throw me in the kennel if I stopped her. I took her in at the Bishop's-Head near the Session Gate, and secured her. I promised a crown to a runner at Bridewell to take the other prisoner, and he took her the next day. They were taken by the description Mrs. Ravenhill and my sister gave of them. I never found the goods again. I had put that piece in a wrapper, had wrapped it up that morning, and had not been gone out ten minutes before it was gone.</p>

            . I am wife to Charles. I was in the shop when the two women at the bar came in, on the 23d of August. They asked to look at some printed linen; one had a long red cloak on, and a linen gown, red and white, in flowers, and a black hat; the other had a brown camblet gown, a red silk handkerchief, spotted, and a green hat, lined with red. I showed them several patterns; they fixed upon one, and asked the price; I said two shillings a yard; they bid me twenty-pence. Haycock went out of the shop, and stood under the window; the other stayed in the shop, and asked to look at some muslins to make a cap. I shewed her some; then she called the other in to look at it. The other came in. I was on one side the counter, and they on the other. I shewed them some muslin handkerchiefs. Darlin bought a handkerchief for twenty-two-pence. There was a window behind me, and Haycock asked what was in that. When I turned round, Darlin was stooping, pretending to put her garter on. I said, Do you not want muslin or check; No. they said, they did not: they paid for the handkerchief, and away they went. Immediately after I missed the muslin in a bundle before they were out of sight. I ran over immediately to my husband's partner, and described the two women. We went three ways, but missed them. Darlin was taken the next day, about three o'clock. I am sure the prisoners are the women, and there was not a living soul in the shop but them and me at the time. I am sure they must take it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Darlin. Were not you and another woman drinking a dram together in the shop when we were there?</p>

            . I was washing my brother's house, opposite the shop. I saw the prisoners go into the shop, and saw them come out. When they came out, they stood very near together, hussling their petticoats. Just after they were gone, Mrs. Ravenhill came out and said she was frighted; she had lost some muslin. The first time I saw Darlin after was in the Compter, I knew her directly, and the other I saw in Bridewell; also I knew her as soon as I saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a man with them?</p>

            . I am going into eleven year of age. My mother takes in washing, she lives in Bolton-street. She sent me for this linen, and Mr. Palmer delivered the bundle to me in St. Paul's church-yard. I believe it is about a week ago. About eleven, or half an hour after, in the morning, I brought it as far as Middle-row, Holborn I was standing to look at an image, about as tall as myself, at a mug shop, and the prisoner asked me whether that was not a pretty image. She went on a little farther, and said she would give me a pear: she took one out, and gave it me. I went a little farther, and she was going to give me a penny, but she gave me but a halfpenny. When I came a little farther, she took hold of my bundle, and said, I'll carry your bundle a little way for you. I gave it to her. She carried it as far as Great Turnstile. She went through it, and said her father lived at that painted house. As she went on, she asked whether my mother took in washing. I said, Yes. She said my mother did not wash her linen well enough to please her, because she starched the things. She got as far as <placeName id="t17690906-87-crimeloc464">Lincoln's-Inn</placeName>

Then she gave me a penny, and sent me up to No. 10, to ask for Mr. Range. I went up and asked for Mr. Range. There was no such man there. When I came back again, she and the bundle was gone: I fell a crying, and people asked what I cried for; then they brought me home to my mother. I saw the prisoner after this in Bridewell. I knew her very well again.</p>

            . I was sent for by Mr. Clay, the high constable, and was told there was a person in his house taken upon suspicion of taking these things from a child. I took her to Bridewell. It was the prisoner. The bundle was delivered to me. (He mentioned the particulars, as in the indictment. Produced in court.) As soon as the mittimus was made out, the washer woman came and owned the bundle.</p>

I told her. Said she, Can't you go another way? I said Yes. I am going to another of my aunts in Westminster. Said she, I am going that way. Then she said, Go to the Golden Cross, and I shall be at your heels as soon as you. She desired me to carry this bundle. I was going with it, and facing the new church in the Strand, the woman was close to me, when a man came up and said, Whose bundle is this? I said, It is my own. He said, He believed it was not. Said I, There is the woman that gave it to me. She was gone away. The man said, If he had got hold of her first, I should have been cleared. He said, I do not care if the d - I gave them to you, I'll have it. He then took the bundle away, had me to Red-Lion-square, and called at many houses. Then he took me to Justice Girdler's, and he committed me.</p>

            . I am a whipmaker. As I was coming down the street, about six o'clock, or a little after, in the morning, I saw three people stand at a post almost opposite the prosecutor's door. Rowlins and Horton stood there, and another stood at the corner of the stationer's shop. I know the prisoners by sight, by passing by my master's door. My master is named Brown; he lives in Brackley-street. I passed them, and heard one say, Go it. I turned about, and saw Rowlins go down into the area. I was then at the cabinetmaker's door. He chucked up two bundles to Horton; then they all three went away. I came to the door after they were gone, and knocked, and the man stopped me, and took me to a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not pursue?</p>

Two shirts and four pair of stockings, the things lost, I had to wash. We have got no more of the things again. I was told it was Rowlins's mother that brought these again.</p>

               <p>I was coming along Princes-street, about half an hour after five, and overtook Horton: he was going into Long-lane, he said, for purl. We saw two bundles in the area: there were two rails out: Horton bid me go down and get them. Just as he spoke these words that Evidence came by, and asked what we were about. I said, there is something in the area, but I do not know what it is: I got down, and gave it up to Horton.</p>

I heard something give a great snap: I thought the spring had broke. While I was looking at the spring, the prisoner was upon my fore-wheel, before I was aware of him. He was on horseback, on the right side. He cried, Holo! I raised up my head; then he put up his hand and said stop! I thought he wanted to know something concerning the races. He said, Your money, Sir! He spoke so low, I leaned over towards him, and said, What is that you say, Sir? Then I saw the muzzle of a pistol to my breast. I thought it not a time to dispute the point, so I told him what little I had he should be welcome to. I then saw three gentlemen and a lady coming on horseback. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out two half crowns. There happened to be half a guinea between them. He accepted of it, but seemed to dispute whether that was all. I believe he heard some gold drop from my hand in my pocket: he said, Is that all? I said, Yes. He turned off, and went away; with his hand to his mouth, between the three gentlemen and me. I did not chuse to speak very loud. I beckoned to them with my hand, meaning for them to stop him. He went off a foot pace till he got past them; then he set into a gallop. When they came up, I told them that man had robbed me. They turned and rode after him; they turned him several times, but I went on, and was off the ground before he was taken. I did not know that night that he was taken. He had been taken before the Justice before I saw him. The first of my seeing him after this, was on the Wednesday sevennight following. I was a little struck at first seeing him, and was very sorry to see him. I was very sure he was the man, and so I am now.</p>

               <p>Snape. When before Justice Fielding, I was asked if the prisoner was like the man. I said I believed he was the man, but I did not chuse then to swear to him. I reserved that to myself then.</p>

            . I was returning from Barnet races. I came very softly all the way, till I came to Finchley-common. I turned out upon the summer road, and I saw a parcel of people riding towards me. As they came just opposite me, I heard a gentleman call out, Stop the highwayman! Stop the highwayman! Will nobody help to take this man? He was in strong pursuit after him. I joined him. The highwayman rode past me. I left the turnpike road on the right hand, and the man came between me and a gate. He was dressed in a brown coat and a black waistcoat. I looked at him, and thought the gentleman that had called out might be in a joke at first. They all rode as fast as they could. The man turned rather to the right, and went down under a hedge. He galloped a good way, (the hedge ran pretty long) till he came to a turning, where he turned very short. There were two gentlemen near him. In turning short, they and their horses fell. I took more room in turning, and galloped by; and in about a quarter of a mile farther the prisoner fell from his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his horse fall with him?</p>
               <p>Markes. If his horse had fell with him, I must have been up with him before his horse could rise again. His horse ran away. The prisoner was stunned by the fall. I got off my horse, and was going up to him. There I picked up a pistol. (Produced in Court.) I was willing to see if it was charged. I found it loaded with a brace of balls, and some powder, but the priming was out. There a couple of young men came up: one of them said, What have you got there? I shewed them the pistol. They got off their horses and searched him, and found another pistol and a powder horn upon him; and bringing him along, they took a gardener's knife from him. We tied his hands and brought him away to town to Justice Girdler's. The Justice was not at home. Then we took him to a public-house, and sent for a constable, who took him away to goal. We went with him to Justice Girdler the next morning. There was

               <p>Bateman Saddington. I was coming from Barnet races in company with two gentlemen and a lady. About fifty yards before me on the left hand, coming from Barnet, I saw a Phaeton stand still, and a man at it. I was in conversation with the lady, and took bu little notice. The man left the Phaeton and came forward, rather between a walk and a trot. The gentleman beckoned with his hand. I thought he was beckoning to some of his acquaintance. After the man got past me, the gentleman said, That man has robbed me, Sir. I said, Robbed you, Sir! How do you mean? I could hardly believe that a man would commit a robbery at such a public time as that. Said he, He is a highwayman, he has clapped a pistol to me, and robbed me. I asked him who he was; he told me his name, and said he lived in Grosvenor Mews. I turned my horse and pursued. Said Mr. Smith, who was with me, I will bring him back presently. He rode after him as hard as he could, and got ground of me. They went up the road. I found I had no chance, so I partly stopped my horse. I looked after them, and found they turned back again. I went a-cross and met them. Then I had a full view of them, and had some time for reflection. Then I thought to ride up to the man, and knock him down, as I had a cane in my hand; but he presented a pistol to me. I got from the direction of the pistol, and came behind him; but not being able to get up to him, I left the pursuit. He was in a brown coat, had on a very remarkable bushy wig, and was pitted with the small pox, with black breeches, but no boots on. I believe the prisoner is the man; he is like him. I came back to the lady, who was sitting on her horse by the road-side crying, so was not on the spot when he was taken. Mr. Smith came to us, and said, We have got him. Then it was almost dark.</p>

            . As I was coming from Barnet with this gentleman and a lady, I saw a Phaeton about fifty yards before me stop. After the man had left it, the prosecutor pointed out his hand, when I found it was a highwayman. I said, I will fetch him back, and if he goes for Whetstone, I will have him at the turnpike. He turned his horse round towards Coney-hatch, and I turned after him. I saw his hand go towards his pocket. I came up with him; he pulled a pistol out of his pocket and held it at me for the space of about two hundred yards. One of the gentlemen in company crossed behind him, and struck him on the right side his head with a stick; but I believe the man saved the blow with his hand. Upon which the gentleman called to me, and said, For God's sake keep farther off him, or he will shoot you. I replied, I am not afraid of that. Soon after this, another young fellow crossed upon him, and said, You shall see me knock him down; and I believe before the words were well out of his mouth, his horse fell, and I saw his four feet all up in the air. After that the prisoner's horse fell, and he was taken.</p>

On the 20th of May, my master turned the maid out, and said she should not lie there that night; my mistress said she should; upon which some words arose, and they went up stairs. After I had shut the shop up, I went up, and saw master and mistress quarrelling. They were both together scuffling. They pushed one another from each other; that continued two or three minutes. I heard mistress say, If you point at me, I'll bite you. I think they held one another from them then. Master pointed at her, and I think he said, You are mad. Then I saw her bite his finger. They then both went down into the shop; he went down with his finger bleeding, and said she has bit me: then mistress took up a knife, where she got it I cannot tell, and what became of it I can't tell. It was a small knife. I got it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing when she had got it?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I did not hear her say any thing. Master's hand bled a great deal. Then they went up stairs again, and I think they went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing done to it that night?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I think there was only a glove put on it then. I think there was nothing done that night, any farther than words.</p>
               <p>Q. What words?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I cannot say particularly what words; they were words of anger. I think master went to one bed, and mistress to another, in different rooms. On the Sunday morning I fetched some salve for master's hand, and on the Monday morning, I think, he went to Mr. Thompson. Master lived till the 2d of August, and then died.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound ever cured?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I believe it was never cured. It was attended all the time, either by the surgeon or his apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose knife was that your mistress had in her hand?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I do not know. I took it away very easily.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the whole of what you saw?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I think it is. I was in and out of the room several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blows struck?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I saw no blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of a loaf?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mistress hurt any where?</p>
               <p>Stevens. There was a scratch upon her eye, but I did not see how it came. I heard her say master scratched her there, after the quarrel was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take hold of his finger, before you saw the scratch, or after?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I had not observed that before. I saw her take hold of his finger.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Weston. I had been there three or four days. I was in the house when this happened. The beginning of the quarrel was, the maid was shut out at the door, Mrs. Anson had sent her on an errand, and when she came back, Mr. Anson shut the door, and would not let her come in. Mrs. Anson desired me to go down, and tell her she wanted the things she had been for and the change. He went to the door, and opened it, and let me take the things and change, but he told her she should not come in that night. Mrs. Anson went to the dining-room, opened the sash, and bid her go home to her father, at Limehouse. It rained. She said she would not go without a coach. Mrs. Anson flung eighteen-pence out to her, bid her take a coach, and go home. Mr. Anson came up, took the loaf up and a knife, and was going to take a bit of butter. Mrs. Anson took the butter, set it by the side of her, and said he should have no butter till he let the maid in. Then he took the loaf up, and beat it about her head. It was about a third part of a quartern loaf. The loaf broke, and fell upon the ground. Then Mrs. Anson got up, and was angry with him. He slew at her, and she at him. He threw her down three times. There was a great scuffle between them. Then the young man came up (meaning Stevens.) They still scuffled together. The young man went between them, and parted them two or three times. I got between them also. Then Mr. Anson spit in her face, and she bit his finger. I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060066"/> him call out and say, D - n you, you have bit my finger. I heard Mrs. Anson say, Let go my eye, and I'll let go your finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she hold of his finger then?</p>
               <p>E. Weston. I really believe she had.</p>
               <p>Court. That is impossible; she could not speak and bite his finger at the same time.</p>
               <p>E. Weston. Yes, she could.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing?</p>
               <p>E. Weston. He clawed her eye. Her face was scratched in several places. There was one on the corner of her eye. Then they parted, and Mr. Anson went down stairs first. I followed him down, and would have had him let me done something to his hand, but he would not. He put on a new glove. It was but a little place seemingly. After I came up stairs, Mrs. Anson went down, and I followed her, fearing they would quarrel again. I saw her have a little knife in her hand. She saw I was frighted. She said I need not be frighted, she was not going to hurt him. Then the young man took the knife from her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any blows given?</p>
               <p>Weston. I saw no blows, no farther than that of the loaf, only shoving her down. I thought once, by shoving her down, he would have dashed her brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the last shove before the bite on the finger.</p>
               <p>Weston. That I cannot say. It was all up stairs, in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she was scratched in the face?</p>
               <p>Weston. I am sure she was, and in more places than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they given before the finger was it, or after?</p>
               <p>Weston. I believe they were all given before; but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that violent throwing down at the beginning of the scuffle, or when?</p>
               <p>Weston. That I believe was the last time of her being thrown down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing said about pointing at her?</p>
               <p>Weston. I don't remember any thing said about pointing at her.</p>
               <p>Jeffery Thompson. I am an apprentice to Mr. Thompson, a relation of mine, a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been an apprentice?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Upwards of three years. I attended Mr. Anson great part of the time during his illness. I did not see him the first day. Mr. Thompson say's the first day he came to the deceased was the 27th of May, which was on a Saturday. I saw him the Tuesday following, which was the 30th. There was a small lacerated wound upon the joint of the little finger nearest his hand; it afforded a very disagreeable discharge, and was beginning to slough. It was a disagreeable thin discharge. The tendon which bends the finger was beginning to slough, and there was a great inflammation over the hand. Had he been lucky enough to apply to Mr. Thompson immediately, it would not have been attended with such bad consequences.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for that?</p>
               <p>Thompson. The bite then began to be very bad; but had it been taken proper care of at first, it would have been nothing. The wound was given on a Saturday, and Mr. Thompson came to attend it the Saturday following. It did not appear to be very dangerous when I first saw it. I asked him how the accident happened; which he was very cautious of saying. Upon my pressing him, he said it was a bite. I asked him, by a dog or cat, or any animal. At last he said Mrs. Anson had bit it. We made use of what application we thought best. It c ame sloughing on a-pace. The palm of the hand and the arm grew more and more inflamed; then Mr. Thompson took off the finger at the joint, in hopes that would prevent its spreading any farther. But he was of so bad a habit of body, that his breath was so nauseous, every time we went to dress him, we were obliged to desire him to turn his head on one side, he was so extremely nauseous. After the finger had been amputated, and had not the good success, as his arm kept inflaming, Mr. Thompson opened places, in order to discharge the matter. His arm kept sloughing on, and there came an internal mortification, which killed him. That came on in about a fortnight after his finger was taken off, as near as I can recollect. There had been openings before that was taken off, in order to save it. The mortification came on up his arm to his elbow. He was not in a state to admit of the arm being taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I believe he died the 2d of August.</p>
               <p>Q. What in your opinion did he die of?</p>
               <p>Thompson. He died of that mortification.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060067"/>Q. In your judgement, what did that mortification proceed from?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I do not think that the wound was the immediate cause of his death. I am not of opinion that the wound was originally mortal. We have the greatest reason to suppose he might have died by the scratch of a pin, as he was in so bad a habit of body.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you can take upon you to say, that the bite on the finger was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Thompson. It was an accessary cause. His hand and arm were so excessively nauseous, we were obliged to have vinegar in the room to take off the effluvia, a little before the finger was taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stevens. You have heard what Mrs. Weston has said, that your mistress said, Let go my eye, and I'll let go your finger?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I did not hear any thing at all of that.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first observe the scratch on your mistress's face?</p>
               <p>Stephens. That was after my master was gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take hold of his hand?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I was between them both when the finger was bit; he was pointing at her, and she caught hold of my hand, and then bit it.</p>

            . I was coming down Ludgate-hill, on the 26th of May, when the prisoner overtook me, and said, How do you do, countryman? I said, How do you do? Said he, I think I know something of you face. I said, I do not know you. You are a bargeman, are you not? said he. I said, Yes. He said, From where do you come? I said, From Newbury. He said he had a brother lived in that country, and he wanted to hear from him, and if I would go with him while he wrote a letter to carry into the country, he would give me a couple of shillings, and treat me with what I would drink. I went along with him to a public-house in <placeName id="t17690906-103-crimeloc544">Cloth-fair</placeName>

Presently came in another man: I have heard since his name is Hoxley; he challenged the prisoner to play with him for six-pennyworth of brandy and water, at hiding under a bowl. I said to the prisoner I was in a hurry, and should be glad if he would write the letter. They played: they hid twice. It was to be the best two in three. The prisoner won. They drank the liquor, and went out. Then he took me to the Glovers Arms, in Beech-lane, saying he would write the letter there. We went there through the kitchen, into a private room. He called to the woman to bring him six-pennyworth of punch. Presently in came this

             again. He said he would play with the prisoner at hiding under the bowl for six or twelve pennyworth of brandy and water, and half a guinea dry money. Then the prisoner asked me to give him two half guineas for a guinea. I took my bag out of my pocket, and put my money out upon the table. There were forty-six guineas, one thirty-six-shilling piece, and two half guineas. I never saw his guinea. He swept all my money off the table into his hat. I asked him what he was going to do with my money; he said to play with that sailor: he has got a bag of money of seventy pounds, and we can win it as easily as any thing. I told him I would not play, for the money was not my own. I saved my two half guineas, having just taken them up when he took the other. Hoxley had a bag in his hand, but what was in it I know not. I endeavoured to get my money again. The prisoner played with Hoxley. It was all in five minutes. Hoxley won, and the prisoner gave him my money directly. Hoxley put it in his pocket. I laid hold of his collar, and said, You shall not carry my money out of the house; I do not know but you two may be concerned together. Then the prisoner came between us, and said, What are you going at? It is I that lost the money. Do not go to use the man ill. I have got a fifty pound Bank note in my pocket, I will go and change that, and give you the money again. Then Hoxley went out. I strove all I could to prevent his going out with my money, but he got out.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not take the Bank note?</p>
               <p>Croxson. I cannot read, and I did not understand notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any note?</p>
               <p>Croxson. No, he shewed me no note. Then the prisoner took me from thence into Golden-lane. He went in at the Black Koren and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060068"/> Crown; the man is named Lumlin; and bid me stand at the door, saying he would come to me in a little time, and give me my money. I staid at the door a very little while, and then went in, and called for a pint of beer, and asked the woman if there had been a man there to change a note. She said no; but that there had been a man that had had a dram at the bar, and went out at the other door directly. It was three months after that that I found the prisoner. I had left a description of him with Mr. Melvil. I was to give him two guineas if he found him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the prisoner's name?</p>
               <p>Croxson. I heard that at a public-house where I went. The people at the Black Raven told me, if I went to the Bell on Windmill-hill, Moorfields, very likely I might hear of him. I immediately went there. There was a man that came from Reading, and knew me. I told him how I had been served. He told me the two men had been there parting the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend the prisoner your money?</p>
               <p>Croxson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you consented he should play with your money?</p>
               <p>Croxson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing Hill had won Hoxley's money, what then?</p>
               <p>Croxson. He told me I should have half the money; but I said I would not play. I should have desired nothing but my own money?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell my Lord Mayor, that you had lent the prisoner the money?</p>
               <p>Croxson. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Truss. He said he put his money on the table, to take out two half guineas, and the prisoner swept the money into his hat, and Croxson asked him what he was going to do with his money.</p>

            . I am the constable. The prosecutor applied to me to take up the prisoner. The prosecutor was very desirous to have his money again; so I said, If you are desirous, you may have it, I suppose. They came to proposals in the Mansion-house. I was there. The prisoner said he could raise ten guineas, and there were ten guineas more lodged in a person's hand, which made twenty-one pounds. When he was before my Lord Mayor, my Lord asked how the money was lost; and the prosecutor said he lent the prisoner the money, upon condition he would return him the money; and if he lost, he would change the note. It plainly appeared to my Lord, that the prosecutor and the others were acquainted; for my part, I cannot say whether they were or not. They were going to employ an attorney. I happening to be up at Sir John Fielding's, I said, If you have money to employ an attorney and counsel, you had better give it to the poor fellow that is a sufferer, who labours under the difficulty to pay the money to his master at a guinea a month (as I was told.) The prosecutor agreed to take the money, and a receipt was drawn for twenty-one pounds, and the expences. He asked me to witness it. He said he would take their word for the expences. I said to him, You shall not take the money, till I have asked advice. I went and asked three gentlemen's opinion. It was their opinion for him to take the money, and apply to the Grand Jury, and say he had received satisfaction. I had the money, and the receipt, but he not coming, I returned the money to the prisoner's brother.</p>

Said he, Will not you pay my expences? Said I, What is that? Said he, Fifteen shillings.

When I had done, I was going right across the market: there the prisoner was standing, who asked me if I had any stockings: he said he wanted strong ones to wear under his boots. I told him I had stockings to sell, and would sell him as cheap as I could. Said he, I never buy any thing in the market, so please to come in, and take a pint of beer along with me, and I will buy of you, if we can agree. I went with him to the house of William Bray, the <placeName id="t17690906-104-crimeloc550">Golden-ball in Cow lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17690906-104-crimeloc550" type="placeName"

Soon after we sat down: though they appeared to be all strangers, they fell to talking to one another. One asked what countrymen the others were. One said he was a merchant at Bristol, that he dealt in linen there, and kept a shop: another said he had been on board a man of war, and had received a great deal of money a while ago, and should soon receive a great deal more, and did not care which way he flung his money away. He said he was once an officer on board an Indiaman. The prisoner said he was a farmer's son. They talked thus some time. I thought them the civilest men I ever came near. I thought I should get some of my stockings off among them. The officer would have some brandy, and make me drink a glass. I said I had not been used to drink such strong stuff. I drank a glass. Then they fell to gambling on the table, tossing things about. The officer pulled out a great green purse; there seemed to be guineas in it. At last the others pulled their purses out. They would have me pull mine out. I pulled mine out, and laid it on the table. I had five guineas in mine. They showed their money to one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060070"/>Q. What did you pull yours out for?</p>
               <p>Coney. Because I was crazy. The men were civil and good, so I thought there was no danger. The officer and prisoner were employing themselves with knocking halfpence about. I do not know that the merchant did play any. All the while they pretended to be strangers to each other.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they playing at?</p>
               <p>Coney. They were knocking halfpence up and down. I do not know the sense of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ask you to play?</p>
               <p>Coney. They did not. I think once the officer did ask me to lay my hand upon a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your money then?</p>
               <p>Coney. My money was then upon the table. The merchant called me out at the door. I went out with him, and walked down the street. I began to think a little of my money. I came in again, and I caught the prisoner with my pack in his hand at the door. Said he, The sailor has run away with your money, and he would have had your pack if I had not taken care of it. There were sixteen yards of Irish linen, and two dozen pair of stockings in my bag. I gave thirteen pence a yard for the cloth, and about eighteen pence a pair for the stockings, some more, some less. I laid hold of him, and held him fast.</p>
               <p>Q. What room were you in?</p>
               <p>Coney. We were in a lower room, on the other side the bar. He had brought my bag through two rooms. There was a strange man, who I understand since is one of the gang. He abused me very much, and wanted to take me back into the room, saying, Why do you abuse the gentleman? The prisoner said he would get me my money again, if I would let him go. So I did. Then he said he would put me in the way to a place where I should get it again, so he and the strange man went with me. I walked down the street. They took me into a very dark, ugly, dirty lane, where there came out a mob, and got the prisoner out of my hands, and the strange man held me till he got out of my sight. I had kept hold of him by the shoulder going along. This was on a Monday, and on the Wednesday following a man was going to be hanged. Walking up among the people to Tyburn-road, I saw the officer sitting at a public-house door: he went into the house. I walked up and down the front windows: I went to the other corner, where I looked in, and saw the prisoner and the officer together. The officer got sight of me before the prisoner did, and he got away; he beckoned to the prisoner to come, but he did not see him. I went in, took hold of him and said, Have you got my money now? He pulled out two guineas and a half, and offered me them, and said, That is all the money I have; but go with me, and I will get you the rest. I held him, and said, I would not go home with him for all the money in London. The people in the house desired me not to take the money. I believe they were honest people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you play with them at any game?</p>
               <p>Coney. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend either of them your purse?</p>
               <p>Coney. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>When I saw this man, I was going to Smithfield market. He was by the top of the market selling stockings and handkerchiefs. I told him I wanted a pair of stockings, a good strong pair; he told me he would sell me as good a pair as any person in London. I said, I will buy a pair or two or three of you. We went into a public-house to drink a pint or a pot of beer, where came in two men; one a sailor, I do not know what the other was. They began tossing up, and hiding a halfpenny under a pot. One said he had lost some money before with somebody, and he would lay he won, let who will hide it. He would lay six-pennyworth of brandy and water, or a pot of beer. I laid a pot of beer he did not know, let me hide it. The man put it under. I happened to win. Then the sailor would lay a shilling. I said, Then let me hide it. He said, No, this man shall. I then lost the shilling. After that he would lay two shillings, but said I shall not hide it myself, he would. I won the two shillings. Then the prosecutor said, I will go your halves. After that he would play for four shillings. The prosecutor and I won that. After that the sailor would not play under forty or fifty pounds. I said I have not so much money in my pocket; I have about fourteen pounds. The prosecutor said, I have got four or five guineas. Another man said, I believe I have got six, seven, or eight pounds. I will go along with you, as you are two countrymen. This man laid his pack: he laid that and all the money we could make against the sailor's money, and we hid for fifty-four pounds; I happened to lose. The sailor was going to take the bag away. I said No, you shall not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060071"/> go, because we will play with you again, and I stopped the bag, though he had won the money and the pack. I could not stop the man, he was as big as two of me.</p>

I told him I was a stranger there, and that I knew no such person. He said, It should be near Cavendish-square. I was going that way, so he desired I would direct him the way.

I believe this is the house; but seemed not to be sure. We went in, and called for a pint of beer. He drank once, and went out, and then came in again. He said he had seen the man's wife. Presently came in two men; he asked them what they would drink; said they, We will have some grog. He went out of the room, and brought in some grog in a bason. Then the prisoner proposed hiding under a pint pot with another for six-pennyworth of punch. I said, If you are not going, I'll go and leave you. I pulled out my watch to see what o'clock it was. He asked me if I would sell her. I mentioned five guineas. They all looked at her, and said she is a very pretty watch. Then the prisoner said, She is a very pretty watch, I'll buy her of you; and if you will go along with me a little way, I'll pay you for her. He kept the watch in his hand. We went on till we came to the sign of the city of Hereford. He delivered it to one of the others, and they delivered it about to one another. They made a shift to get away from me with it, and I never got it again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you deliver it to the prisoner for?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. For him to look at it. He at first went by the name of Pinwyre. I took him some time after, at the foot of Westminster-bridge, and charged him with my watch. He denied ever seeing me before, and after that he said my watch was pawned.</p>

Soon after we put our horses up at the Horse and Groom, in the Borough, a man came by me, who appeared like a farmer; said he, It is very fine harvest weather. He kept directing his discourse, and said, We are just come out of the country, from a place called Tworton, between Bath and Bristol. He had dirty-coloured boots on. He walked with me a considerable way, till we came near the Boar's-head tavern, just by London-bridge. He said a friend of his keeps that house; and coming from Bristol, he would be glad, as I was a countryman, if I would go in and drink with him. I said I never drank before dinner, because it made me sick. He over and above persuaded me. He said, I am not used to drink myself before dinner, but a little wine or some liquor, with a bit of sugar and lemon, will not hurt any body. He went in, and called for six-pennyworth. Then I said after that, You are a stranger to me, I do not desire a stranger should treat, so I called for another. Then in came the prisoner with another young fellow. He appeared like a rakish young gentleman. He had on a green waistcoat, a brown coat, and a large ring on his finger. He strutted about. The other six-pennyworth was not brought in. The prisoner and the young gentleman came up to the bar, and called for a glass of brandy. I said to the farmer, It is very odd to drink brandy such a day as this. So it is, said he, but the custom is to drink brandy when you are hot. The young gentleman being out, the prisoner said, I have just picked this gentleman up, he was with some butchers here. I thought he would have been murdered. They were at so silly a thing as hiding under a hat, and that he persuaded him to go home. He said he was a Captain's clerk just come from sea, and had received three hundred pounds. That he had put two whores into a coach, and was going to a bawdy-house, and that he would play with any body. Then he left the farmer and me, and goes up to the young gentleman. (I can describe them no other way than by the prisoner, the farmer, and the young gentleman.) The young gentleman then pulled out a bag from his pocket, and shook it, and said he did not care for any body; for he should receive three hundred pounds more the week following, and that he had then three hundred in the bag. The farmer said, As you would not let me treat you, here is a house at the corner of Cannon-street, the George, I'll treat you there. The young gentleman and farmer went in first, and the prisoner and I followed them. Going in, the prisoner said to me, I would not have you pay any thing, for this young gentleman, as he is just come from sea, do you save your money, let him treat. We went into a little room on the right hand, as the house was newly painted. They got half a pint or a pint of brandy, and would insist upon my drinking. I begged to be excused, and would not drink. With a great deal of persuasion, they made me drink a very large glass full, which made me stupified. Upon that the young gentleman said he would bet any money that us three could not produce twenty pounds, and threw out upon the table a thirty-six-shilling piece, a moidore, and a nine-shilling piece. Then he quitted the room, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060073"/> left the prisoner and the farmer with me (I found afterwards) to back me on. Then he came in again, and said we were a parcel of land-lubbers. I am sure you can't produce twenty pounds among you all. Then he said he would bet two guineas out of that quantity of money to one guinea, that we did not. Upon that the prisoner said he had just been paying away a great deal of money, and he had not hardly any about him. The farmer said to me, How much have you? Then the young gentleman went out of the room again, and left them to talk to me. After they had talked to me a great deal, the farmer asked me how much money I could make, if I went home. I said, I must dress my master, and could not come out again soon. He asked me if I could not get into the house, without my master seeing of me. I said, No. (As he said if I could raise fourteen or fifteen guineas, he would make up the rest, and it would be a great service to me if we won to keep me in the country, as this gentleman has so much money. The young gentleman went in and out seven or eight times.) They made me drink another glass of brandy, and with a great deal of persuasion I went home, and brought fifteen guineas and a great deal of silver, five crown pieces among it. When I came in, the young gentleman goes out of the room again. Then they would go to the King's Arms tavern, in Cornhill. When I came out, they were at the corner of Change-Alley. I followed them in. There was a bottle of port, and four or five glasses on the table. They asked for a pen and ink to be brought into the room. They took a glass of wine each, and made me drink one. Said the farmer, I'll convince you that you are wrong (to the young gentleman) to guess three times out of four what a halfpenny shall be, heads or tails, to hide it myself under my own hat. Upon that the young gentleman and the farmer played for a shilling. The farmer put the halfpenny under himself. The young gentleman went to the farther end of the room and guessed. The farmer won seven or eight times. Upon that they played for half a guinea a time; he won again. Then the young gentleman quitted the room. The prisoner and farmer fell to persuading me to play. I told them I never gamed so high as a six-pence in my life, at cards or any thing else. They kept trying to persuade me. The prisoner said, If you don't get his money, somebody else will. The whores will, for he will spend it. Perhaps all this money will not last him above a month. Then he will go to sea again; and you may as well have it as the whores. I still stood in it I would not play. The farmer and the young gentleman played again. The farmer won again. Then they made me drink again. The young gentleman went out of the room again. Then with over and above persuasion, the farmer saying he had won so often, I might be convinced I should win, and the farmer would go partners with me. Then I consented to play, but would go no more than half a guinea. They wanted me to go ten or twelve guineas at once, the farmer was to go half; he stood at my right hand; we won the first half guinea, but the farmer would not let me have mine that I won. We went half a guinea each against the young gentleman's guinea. He said he would pay me before I went. Said the prisoner, You have no room to doubt the gentleman. You may as well go farther. Said the prisoner, How much can you go farther? Sir, You may as well go as much more. You see this man has won so much. You may as well go for ten or twenty guineas at once, as well as such a trifle. Then the young gentleman was out of the room. Upon that I shewed what I had got. With a great deal of persuasion I went for ten guineas at once. I took out ten guineas, and counted them in my hand, and the farmer took them out of my hand. I made a resistance. Said the prisoner, You can't suppose you will be cheated of your money; you are safe enough; you are in the room. As he was my partner, I could not suspect but he was an honest man. He threw my ten guineas into a hat upon the table, and the farmer threw ten guineas into the hat out of his pocket, but he would not let me look at them, and the young gentleman threw his great green purse into the hat, saying, If you win, you will be sure of your money; for there is five hundred guineas. Said the prisoner to me, You may be sure, for there is plenty to pay you. I took a halfpenny, and put it under my hat. When I put the hat down, the farmer always made that a rule to lift the hat up and see what the halfpenny was, and call to the young gentleman. He would not let me call once. His method was, What will you have?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060074"/> or, What will you have now? * I made resistance, and said I think I have a right to call myself. Said the prisoner, You can't suppose your partner will do wrong, that loses his money as well as you. The young gentleman won the ten guineas; he called right all the three times. Upon that the prisoner said, Gentlemen, you seem to have very bad luck, be in spirits, you will win all his money before he has done. With a great deal of persuasion, I went two guineas more; and the farmer he put in two guineas. We lost that time. Then I went a moidore. The prisoner said, So you seem to be rather out of spirits; why don't you go all at once? You will either get a great deal, or lose. You are sure of winning. He wanted me to put in all my crown pieces, and all my silver I had. After I lost my moidore, I seemed to be rather vexed, and out of spirits. I thought these must be a set of false fellows, that knew one another. The prisoner said, I have a friend, a woollen-draper, that lives in the Poultry; I can have seven or eight guineas there, and I will try my luck with him, and you shall see what we can do with him. Then the prisoner, as well as me, gave the farmer a strict charge to keep the young gentleman in the room till we came back, as he had won so much money. Then we went to go to the Poultry, but the prisoner said, We will go in here; at the King's Head tavern, by the Mansion-house. We will have half a pint of wine, and I will pay for the wine: it is but half a dozen doors higher. You need not go there, I will go myself. There he left me. I did not stay to drink the wine. I went back to the King's Arms in Cornhill again, but the young gentleman and the farmer were gone, and had taken my cane; there came the waiter, who said, I hope them gamblers have not taken you in? I thought they had been breaking you in as one of their gang. When I told him the circumstances, said he, I knew them to be a set of rogues in many places where I have lived. I applied to my Lord Mayor, and got a warrant, made special for Whitechapel way and for the Borough, and employed Justice Fielding's men. It has cost me above fourteen guineas to take these people. Also I walked up and down myself to see for them. I took the prisoner myself half a year after in the Strand. I was with the chariot coming to town with my master. I knew him as soon as I saw him. I carried him to my master's house in Lombard-street. When he came there, he desired to go to the necessary: he looked round him when there, and said, There is no place to get out; you need not stand by me. I said, I will not leave you. He took this purse out of his pocket, and dropped it down the water closet. I thought I heard some noise, so as soon as he got off the necessary, I took it out. (Produced a net-work purse with a large quantity of yellow counters in it, fastened in with net-work above, so that if a good guinea was above, those would not come out with it.) Then master desired I would take care of him. Master went with me to the Mansion-House. There were six or seven such gilt pieces taken out of each of the prisoner's shoes: there was also a powder-horn found upon him. He made interest to get bail, and neither he nor his bail appeared to have his trial, so they have forfeited their recognizance. I took him since at the end of Tooley-street, with two other people with him. He made the greatest resistance, and said I might take the bail, he would not go with me. I insisted on his coming with me, and brought him the second time to my master's house, where Sir

I keep a little cart, and used to do jobs, I wanted a horse, so I went to Smithfield on the third of March to buy one. I went up to the rails, and saw a strong bay mare. I looked at her head, and asked the price of her. They asked nine guineas for her. I said she is blind of one eye. I looked about the market some time, and observed some gentlemen were looking at her as a man was riding her about. There came up a man in company with the prisoner at the bar, who said, Are you buying her? I said, Yes. He said she is a strong mare, but will not do for you: she is blind of one eye, and almost blind of the other, and has got a touch of the scurf upon her heel. I said, There are some gentlemen about her; I shall see if she stumbles. I concluded what the man said to be true, as she stumbled. He told me there were two very good ones, that were a little worked down, but the man would not sell one without the other. The one was for riding and drawing, the other for only riding. I told him I should be obliged to him to see them. He said he should be glad that I would. He said it is almost four o'clock, and the man would be here with them soon. He went about Smithfield with me, and seemed not to know the place where the house was. He carried me to the

             in Cloth-Fair, and said to the landlord, Has the man been here with the two horses that I was with last night? The landlord said, No, Sir, he is not come yet. The man said he was to come at four o'clock, and as it is almost four, he will be here soon, according to promise. He asked me what I chose to drink; I said, what he liked, I liked. He bid the landlord bring six-penny worth of brandy and water. There was a little room where a curtain was. He said, We will go in here, if there is no company. We went in. There sat the prisoner on one side the fire-place, and a man that they called a breeches-maker with something in a handkerchief, which seemed like a pair of breeches. He sat by the other corner. The prisoner had a bowl of punch before him. The man said as we went in, I hope you are not about business. The prisoner d - ning said, No, we are not; you may sit down if you will. We sat down and drank our liquor out. The prisoner was swearing many oaths; he passed for the captain of the Hawke Indiaman, and the breeches-maker called him Captain. The Captain said to me and the man that picked me up; You can't eat lobs couse; that we were poor farmers. Presently he takes a purse out of his pocket with something that looked like guineas, and threw them upon the table: then he snatched it up again. After that he took some real money out of his pocket, and went out at the door, and came in presently after. This man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060076"/> went in with me said, Our liquor is out, let us play for six-penny worth. I said with all my heart, that will not hurt us. The Captain came in again: then the man with me said, I'll do you over for six-penny worth. The other said, Aye. Then he pulled out with his six-pence some guineas and some half guineas. We won six-pence at hiding under the hat. I put the halfpenny under, and my partner lifted up the hat and looked at the halfpenny. Then he said to the Captain, What do you cry, a man's head, or a woman's head? The other said a woman's head. It was not what he cried. Then we won. The Captain then made a great talking about whores, that it was a great expence, and he did not mind money, saying, he had been among a parcel of butchers and had lost 50 l. The breeches-maker said, Sir, if I had not been there, you would have been almost killed. Then the Captain kept swearing and talking to him, and said, Here, you was a good fellow, here is a guinea for you, and laid a guinea into the breeches-maker's hand. The breeches-maker said, Sir, I don't desire it. Said the Captain, You was a good fellow, when the butchers won my money, take and keep it. Then the man put it into his pocket. After that, the Captain went out: he had got his pocket filled with liquor and came in with it, and we took share of it. Then he said, Have you a mind to play for forty, or fifty, or one hundred pounds? Said my partner, Do you think you can do him over? No, said I; I have not got any such money to play. I have but seven guineas, and that I intend to lay out for this horse that I wait for. Said he, Let us have a stroke at him for about a five-and-three-pence or half a guinea; that will not hurt us. The horse will be worth the money. So I did. We put the halfpenny as before under the hat, and my partner lifted it up, and looked at it, and said, Captain, what do you cry, a man's head or a woman's head? Then the Captain with an oath cried one of them. The Captain lost. This was for half a guinea. After we drank up our liquor, the Captain went out and brought in half a pint of brandy, and sat down on his chair again. The man that was my partner takes the pot, and pours his liquor into our bowl, and said, Drink heartily. I took it and drank, and he drank after me, and gave it to me, and I drank again. I then found myself quite intoxicated. I said the horse will not come, and I should lose my market, as it grew tish. He said, No, no, the horse will soon be here; you have no occasion to be in a hurry. Then he said to me, How much money have you got? I said, I have got but seven guineas. Then he said, What do you think of this fellow? (meaning the prisoner.) I said, I think he is a foolish fellow. The prisoner kept swearing and damning, that he did not value money; for what was money to him, he could go on board a ship and get money. Then he threw his purse upon the table again, and his guineas scattered about. He said, There, you may take some if you will. I said, I do not want your money. My partner said, He does not mind his money; you and I may as well win twenty or thirty of him. I said I have no such money to play. Then my partner pulled out a pocket-book, and took out a note drawn upon some banker for twenty-nine pounds, odd money. They looked at it, and called it a banker's cheque. Said he, You fool, if you lose, you shall not want for money; I will go and change this note, and get cash for it. He said, It is all nonsense to be afraid; we are sure to win. I said, If I should lose, I should not be able to get the horse. He said, No, no, do not fear, for I will get cash for this note, and let us play for twenty. I said, No, I can't. Said he, You have got seven guineas, and your watch value at three pounds, that is ten: let us drink again, and have better heart. So I drank, and being confused, I laid my watch and money down: the prisoner pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket, laid his purse in the handkerchief, took my watch and money, and wrapped all up in the handkerchief, and laid it on the table: then my partner said, Do not be dishearented, take a halfpenny out of your pocket. I did, Said he, Lay it under your hat. Then he took up the hat every time, and looked at the halfpenny, and said to the prisoner, What do you cry now, a man's head, or a woman's head? The prisoner, with an oath, said as it happened to be. He was to guess three times out of four for the whole money and watch. He guessed three times right. Then he takes and sweeps the watch, money, and purse and all, into his pocket. I then said to my partner, You will change your note. He said, Stay a bit, and I will. (I had tied my horse to the rails in Smithfield.) I said I will go and see if my horse is safe. I hope you will be honourable enough to stay till I come. I went, and when I returned they were all made off. I said to the landlord of the house, Where are the gentlemen that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060077"/> was with? Said he, They have paid their reckoning and are gone. I said, Do you know them? No, said he. There was a man with a whip in his hand, and a pair of boots on, said, They are gone into Smithfield after you. I rode into Smithfield as hard as I could, and came back again. There were two or three men said, they believed I had lit of a parcel of sharpers, and said they were gone the other way. There were several people came out and said it was a house of bad fame, and that bad people used it, but they said they would endeavour to remedy me. They told me to go my Lord Mayor, and acquaint him about it. (Since that the man of the house has left it.) I have been after the prisoner several times, but never could find him. I happened to be at Blackheath fair, and there I saw the prisoner standing close by me, dressed very grand, with ruffles on. I took hold of him, and charged him. The people said, I was going to rob a gentleman. I said, If I do wrong I must suffer; but I will tell no body till I come to a justice of peace. I got him by the collar, when two men came up and offered to strike at me with sticks, upon which the prisoner got from me, and ran in at the Green-Man. I ran in, and caught him by the collar again. Some people were for me, and some against me; but with assistance I took him before Justice Russel. The man that rescued him walked by me several times. When the prisoner owned before the justice, that he parted with my watch, and had had my money, one of the gentlemen that seemed to take my part, and the officer, were sent in pursuit of the men that cleared him from me, but they could not find them. As Mr. Nightingale's servant had found false money upon his man, I desired the justice to give me leave to search him. I pulled off his shoes, but found nothing upon him, but a pocket-book. Then the justice told me, as the fact was done in the city, I must take him before my Lord Mayor. I sent my horse and cart home, and brought the prisoner up by water. I brought him to this Session-house, the day the Sessions ended, the Sessions before last; he was committed to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Did you not ask me to play?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As I was sitting in the room, there came in the prosecutor and another man, they asked for a person; the landlord said he had not been there yet, but he expected him. I pulled out a guinea to pay my reckoning. The landlord returned it, and said it was too light. I pulled out seven or eight, and said he might take which he liked. These men were for playing a game at whist; the prosecutor said he did not mind three pence; he went out and called for brandy and water, and a pack of cards. The landlord said he allowed no cards: then it was agreed to toss up. The prosecutor said, That was all one, the landlord would hear us, and come in and prevent us. He was for hiding under his hat. They were to guess the best two in three. I won six-pence of the prosecutor, and when I went out at the door, he came after me and said, The gentleman has got a good ten or twenty pounds. I said, I never would play for ten or twenty pounds. Said he, Do not be afraid, you are winning. I said, What shall I do? I shall be ruined for ever. Said he, Do not be afraid, if you lose, I will make it up to you. Then I said, If you will be as good as your word, I will. He did not play with me at all, the other man and I played for seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether you did not come out of the room to persuade me to play?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never went out of the room till I had lost all my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His partner struck me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My partner was quite complaisant with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They both talked together, as if they had been acquainted seven years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was just come out of the country: I never saw one of them before. I lived with my mother. She gave me twenty-nine guineas, when I came up from her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw him shake the bag, a little money came out, not all. I imagine the false money was fastened in.</p>
