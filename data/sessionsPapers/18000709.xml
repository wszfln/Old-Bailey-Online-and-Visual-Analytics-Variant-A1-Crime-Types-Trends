             sworn. - I am inspector of the Excise watch: On the 7th of June last, about seven o'clock in the evening, John Yorke, one of Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman's men, called upon me at my lodgings, and required my preference; I went down to the quays and there were four or five sticks of liquorice brought to me; the prisoner was present; I asked what he had been about, and the prisoner said there was no harm intended; I asked him if he had any about him, and he said, no; and upon searching him I found one stick in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What is it worth-five pounds? - A. I am not a grocer, and I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it worth five shillings? - A. No, nor five-pence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner is a married man? - A. I do not know; he has got three children.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to that stick? - A. No, but I can swear that I saw him take three sticks out of the chest.(The constable produced the Spanish liquorice.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character; a great number attended, but the Jury thought it unnecessary to hear them.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Where was it? - A. In my parlour; I read an anonymous letter to him, I told I had found that a son of a Mr. Davis had got a blue coat made with my cloth; and likewise a coat and waistcoat for one Griffiths, a butcher, made of my cloth; and a black coat for Mr. Stafford; I told him there was likewise a coat, waistcoat, and small clothes, for the servant girl's father.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise of forgiveness? - A. No; he said, the cloth that the coat was made at for Mr. Davis's son, he had had by him for twelve years; then he wished to speak to me alone; he asked forgiveness, and confest he had taken silks, and velvets, and trimmings, to a great amount; I told him I could not forgive him, the law must take its course; I then went with him to his lodgings in Market-lane, St. James's, where we found nintey-nine duplicates of coats, waistcoats, and cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Davis, or Mr. Griffiths, before? - A. No; I saw the coats at Bow-street; I have no doubt but they were coats made out of cloth taken from my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of the cloth for Davis's coat? - A. A guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.What was Griffiths's cloth worth? - A.Thirty-six shillings, and the other worth two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What would the cloth cost you that Davis's coat was made of? - A. Sixteen shillings a yard: I suppose there was about a yard and a half; the black coat would take two yards, at sixteen shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090006"/>a yard, and the other, two yards, at sixteen shillings a yard; the buttons cost about six shillings; I pat it rather under than over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These coats were made for different persons, and, of course, the cloth must have been taken at different times? - A.I should think they were taken at different times.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know any thing about it? - A. No; I missed the cloth very fast, and I missed the ticket; the prisoner said, he dare to say it was unstaid, and he should find it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you any partner in your business? - A. No.</p>

The prisoner at the bar made it for my son, somewhere about April last; he solicited my son for an order to make some clothes for him; I gave him the order to make a blue coat, it was brought home by Pursey, and I paid him two pounds ten shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaughan. (Produces a piece of cloth). I brought this from the same piece of cloth that this coat was made from; I have no doubt but it is the cloth that came out of my warehouse; and here is the same pattern button exactly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. (Produces a blue coat). I had this coat from the prisoner at the bar the latter end of March, or the begining of April, I cannot say which; I served the prisoner with meat, he owed me some money, and offered to make me a coat and waistcoat; I had a waistcoat of him, which he charged me one pound four shilling for, here it is; then I ordered a coat of him, and he said I must give him a guinea towards buying the cloth, he could not make it without; I gave him a guinea, and he made me the coat.</p>
               <p>Vaughan. I can positively swear to the waistcaoat, for it is my own quilting; but that is not in the indictment; I believe this coat to be made of the same cloth; it is the same colour, and the same quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. At the time that he made that confession, did he not tell you he had bills and receipts for cloth from Mr. Hardisty? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Is Lord Berwick a customer of your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DAVIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a tailor, I was employed by the prisoner to make this coat for Lord Berwick; I am sure this is the coat; I have worked for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000709-5-person82">Vaughan</persName>
             these four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at what time you made that coat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As to Davis's coat, I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000709-5-person83">Vaughan</persName>
             I had had the cloth by me for twelve months, not twelve years; it was a remnant of cloth that I had left from a coat that I made for my brother, who belonged to a guineaman; the cloth of Mr. Stafford's coat I purchased of Mr. Hardisty, and likewise I had a guinea from him towards buying it; I never made any collection to Mr. Vaughan at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HARDISTY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Beville. Q. Look at that bill? - A. This is the handwriting of one of my clerks; I recollect two or three times that he has bought cloths within six or twelve months, I cannot say particularly to the time; mine is a very extensive trade; I remember seeing him there but I cannot say when.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at that blue cloth? - A. It is impossible for any draper to know his own cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that coat, and look at the piece of cloth, and tell us if they are the same cloth? - A. I think it is not the same cloth; I think that which is made up is a stouter cloth; the colour is nearly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the other coat; are those two coats, do you think, made of the same cloth? - A. I think they are nearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the piece of cloth, with that coat that you last took up? - A. The colour is not the same; but that may be occasioned by the one having a gloss on, and the other off; and it appears to me to be stouter, but that may be occasioned by the gloss being taken off, damping may have made that difference; it is possible they may be of the same cloth.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not you told him it would be better for him? - A. No, nor threatened him; it was a voluntary confession on his part; we asked him how he came by the verdigrease; he said it was given him by a soldier; I told him it was very hard he could not work for us, without stealing, as we paid them liberally; and he said he had not stole it, a soldier had given it him upon Golden-hart-wharf; he said the man's name that gave it him was Murphy; that Murphy and two soldiers came out with their aprons full of verdigrease; Murphy said he might as well take two as one; he said Murphy called him a green-horn because he would take but one: a crow was found upon the prisoner about two feet long, which he said was given him by one of the soldiers; and that one of them said he had got the keys now, and he could do what he liked; there are the impressions of the crow upon the door now; he had wrenched off the lock.</p>
               <p>JOHN WAINEWRIGHT sworn. - I am constable of Dowgate-ward: On the 3d of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner at the bar, and two more soldiers; they had all something in their aprons; they were walking pretty quick; I suspected they had been robbing; the prisoner was the first man of the three; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had got; he hesitated a little, and would not give me a direct answer; the other two passed me, and I called out stop thieves; they got clear away; I secured the prisoner, and saw it was verdigrease; we had a scuffle, and then he said it was given to him by a soldier; I then took him to the Compter; he made a little resistance, but was no way rude; when I got him to the Compter I perceived something under his coat, on the right hand side; I discovered it to be a crow, which I took from him; (produces it;) he said it was given to him by one of his comrades, to carry away; I then went to the Bullporters' warehouse, to enquire; I met with Mr. Pearson, I went with him to the warehouses, and we compared the wood of the door, and it corresponded with the point of the crow; I saw the verdigrease in the warehouse, and it seemed to be of the same sort, and the same quality.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up that verdigrease and the crow with it, in Joiners'-hall-buildings; I went from there into Thames-street, up Collegehill, and there the constable stopped me.</p>

               <p>Q.How do you know it was his lodgings? - A.Only from the information of others: I found there a shirt, a handkerchief, and a pocket-book of mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He left your house on the Friday? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he left your house voluntarily? - A. No, he was taken from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not leave your house till he was compelled by law to leave it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do I understand you right that his boxes were at your house? - A. No; I meant to say, at his lodgings, there was one left behind.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What do you mean by one being left behind? - A.The other was taken away while I was endeavouring to get a search-warrant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did you yourself ever see two boxes in that room? - A. No, I only know of one.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why do you talk of two - there is something that strikes me a little extraordinary: you now charge him with stealing two shirts, a handkerchief, a pocket-book, and a pair of stockings; he was committed last Friday, was he not? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p> Upon your oath, even on last Saturday did you ever charge him with stealing more than one shirt? - A. I did not at that time, because the box was not searched.</p>

             you had only found one shirt and a neckcloth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the Alderman charge him with stealing that handkerchief which you had found before he was committed? - A. A handkerchief and shirt were in his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you charge him with stealing a handkerchief? - A. He was charged with stealing a handkerchief and a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. My question to you is this, and you cannot mistake it - did you before the Alderman charge him with stealing a handkerchief which was then found? - A. I certainly charged him with stealing a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the Alderman only committed him for stealing a shirt; I will read you the commitment: Mr. Kirby produces the commitment; Mr. Knowlys reads it)? - A. That is one linen shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you or not charge him before the Alderman with stealing a handkerchief? - A. The handkerchief was in his lodgings certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a direct answer to a direct ques--; my question is - as you had found the handkerchief before he was committed, did you or not charge him with stealing that handkerchief? - A.I certainly known the shirt to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will try you for the fourth time-upon the solemn oath under which you now stand to give evidence, did you before the Alderman charge him with stealing the handkerchief, aye or no? - A. The witness that is with me spoke to the handkerchief; I did not charge the handkerchief because that handkerchief I had not seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so good as have recourse back again to your memory; did you not tell me that you had, before the Alderman committed him, found a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. The handkerchief I have a witness to prove was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state, but a little while ago, upon your oath, that you had, before the Alderman committed him, found both a shirt and a handkerchief? - There certainly was only a shirt produced before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, but a little while ago, tell the gentleman of the Jury that you had found a shirt and a handkerchief, before the Alderman committed him? - A. The prisoner was committed under two witnesses, one that was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Hear the question again - did you not, a little while ago, tell the gentlemen of the Jury that you had found the shirt and the handkerchief before the Alderman committed him? - A. I can only speak to the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Jury that you had found a shirt and a handkerchief before he was committed? - A. I did, in consequence of the witness that is with me; the Alderman certainly committed him for a shirt and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Jury that before the Alderman committed this man, you had found a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. I certainly found the shirt; the witness can speak to the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. If you will not answer me I shall certainly apply for a very serious proceeding against you, and have you committed - I ask you again, did you not say to the Jury -</p>
               <p>Court. It does not at all follow that a Magistrate may not make a mistake; I have the deposition in my hand, in which he says exactly as he does now, and that the witness spoke to the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If your Lordship looks back to your notes, you will find that he has said that he found the handkerchief and shirt before the man was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to that Jury that you had found, before the Alderman committed him, a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. I certainly swore to a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. I will state the question again, and see if you understand it - have you not already sworn here, that before the Alderman committed this man, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090014"/>had found a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. I cannot swear to that which is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. Is what you said before then not true? - A.I swore to the shirt, and the witness to the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not say to this Jury, that before the Alderman committed the prisoner, you had found the shirt and the handkerchief; and I will have an answer if I am here till twelve o'clock at night? - </p>
               <p>One of the Jury. We heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Q.As that is the case, how came you to give my Lord the last answer, that you had not seen it? - There were two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to put but one in the indictment? - A. I did not wish to put more in.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You found this shirt in the box that was left behind? - A. No; it was in the lodgings, but not in the box at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the handkerchief? - A. The handkerchief was in the lodgings; the shirt, silk stockings, and pocket-book were all found after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke of two boxes - at first every body supposed they were at your house, and then at the lodgings, and then you knew only of one box; did you find any thing in that box that you charge the prisoner with? - A.Nothing.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of Farringdon ward within: Mr. Macklin sent for me on Friday evening last, to his house in Cheapside; I took the prisoner to the Compter, and the next day he was committed; I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How do you know they were his lodgings? - A.The woman of the house told me so, Mrs. Colton; I found there two pair of silk stockings, a shirt, and this pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You left the prisoner in gaol, and did not take him to this house to hear what he might say to any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Macklin.) Who took away the shirt that was produced before the commitment? - A. I did; the constable was with me.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH COLTON sworn. - My husband is a bricklayer; I live in Crane-court, Foster-lane; the prisoner has lodged with me about a month or six weeks; he lodged in the garret with another young man; my husband has worked for Mr. Macklin once or twice; I saw the shirt in the room; with J M upon it, Mr. Macklin's initials; he told me his master had given it him; he was taken up on the Friday evening; in the course of the afternoon he had been at our house; he had two boxes at our house; he came to our house to dine, and brought a knot with him to take away one of his boxes, which he did, loaded; the other remained at our house; Mr. Macklin came in the evening, after he was taken up; the shirt was hanging upon my line, which Mr. Macklin looked at, and there was a cambric pocket handkerchief which I had not hung up; Mr. Macklin came in again, and asked if I had one, and he claimed that; the handkerchief was in my own room; I had been washing, and had not hung it up; I had been washing a shirt also for him; I delivered the shirt to Mr. Macklin, and the handkerchief; but I cannot exactly say when I gave him the handkerchief; I went before Sir 
               <persName id="t18000709-19-person193">John</persName>
             the next day; Mr. Macklin produced a shirt, and a handkerchief was spoke of, but I believe not produced; but I was very much flurried, and cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.You have washed these things for him some considerable time? - A. Yes; and he said his master had made him a present of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The young man took one box away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not make the shirt away, but left it with you to wash? - A. Yes; I had given him notice to quit our lodgings, and he was going away.(The property was deposed to by Mr. Macklin.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Macklin.) Was that handkerchief produced before the Alderman, or not? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time received it from the witness? - A. I cannot say whether I had or not; there were two handkerchiefs, one of them a muslin one, one that was spoke of before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Calton.) Do you know any thing of two handkerchiefs? - A. Yes; there was a beautiful worked muslin handkerchief which Mr. Macklin said was his.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Macklin.) Was the cambric handkerchief your's? - A. No, I had borrowed it of a young lady; the mark has been taken out.</p>

             sworn. - I never saw the prisoner before last Saturday; he came and asked me for a job, and I told him I could not, another time I would give him a job.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave when you took him? - A. He said his accomplice took the copper, and sold the copper; I have heard since, that they call him foolish Johnny, and that he has committed a great many robberies in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is he? - A. I should suppose about twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. From his conduct, did you collect whether has was foolish or not? - A. He is certainly none of the wisest; when we were going back from fetching the copper, he said he was dry, and we asked him if he would have a pint of beer; he said, yes; when we came out of the house, he said, I have saved my neck this time; I should suppose he meant by impeaching his-accomplice; after I had detected him, I enquired into his character; I learned that he was a notorious thief; he is generally considered as half foolish.</p>
               <p>Q.When you charged him with taking the copper, did he appear to be a man capable of knowing right from wrong? - A. Yes; he told me it was not him that broke open the door, it was Goodyer that broke it open, and sold the copper; I caught him in the yard upon my premises; Goodyer was taken up, and brought before the Magistrate, and there the woman swore it was him that sold the copper himself: and upon that, Goodyer was discharged.</p>

               <p>Q.It was after he had been before the Justice that he said I have saved my neck? - A. Yes</p>

             sworn. - Magrath brought the prisoner to me at Shadwell: I asked him if he did this himself; he said, no, he held the door while another man took it out; he was with me a long time before I could get that out of him; he said, the other man put it in a bag, took it along Poplar-fields, and cut it in three pieces; if I speak loud, and call to him, he understands every word; he said the other man took it to Mr. Talbot's, a coppersmith, in Back-lane, and sold it, on a Sunday morning; I then took him before the Magistrate, and what he told me he repeated to the Magistrate; the copper was cut in three pieces, exactly as he described it; I went to Talbot's and found the copper, with the two cocks, and the bag that it was in; Mrs. Talbot told me she was a relation of his, but she would tell the truth, he was the man that sold the copper himself, and nobody with him; the other man proved an alibi before the Magistrate, and he was discharged; after we had found the copper, we gave him the bag to carry to the office; he said, on the way, I have saved my neck this time, but he did not mention for what.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, you are here sworn. on the part of the Crown, to inquire whether the prisoner at the bar is of sound mind or not; by which oath, I understand, that you are to pronounce whether you think the prisoner knows right from wrong; the rule laid down in our law books is this, that if a person has the same sort of understanding that a child of fourteen years of age has, he is then answerable to the laws of his country; now, by that rule, I understand, if he is a person that knows right from wrong as well as an ordinary child of fourteen years of age does. This is not a question of sanity or insanity, whether this man is afflicted with a temporary visitation from Providence at times to have his understanding, and at other times not to have it, but simply whether this man, by his natural endowments, has that kind of understanding, as to know when he is doing wrong; if he has that kind of understanding, then he ought to be made answerable for this act; for nothing can be more mischievous than that sort of character which one of the witness represents this half-witted man, going by the name of foolish Johnny, should be suffered to go about, and committing depredations of this sort; and, therefore, however the neighbourhood may be inclined to indulge him, or soften his actions, by calling him foolish Johnny, if he is of that kind of understanding as to know when he is doing wrong, he ought to be amenable to the law; it will be for the Court, if he should be found guilty by-and-by, to say what punishment shall be inflicted upon such a half-witted man; but it is for you to say, whether he has that understanding which enables you to say he knew whether he was doing right or wrong when he committed these depredations upon the property of others; it may be, that a man may be very frantic when they were putting an iron on him; and yet, it does not follow that this lad, when he was going about committing depredations through the village, did not know what he was doing; now, under all the circumstances this case, it will be for you to say, whether you think the man, at the time he is charged to have committed this act, knew that he was doing wrong or not; now, here is a concealment, you see he denies having done it; at first, he lays the charge upon another man, uses a degree of cunning, so as to shew that he knew he had done a wrong thing; he describes all that had been done with the copper, and they find it to answer; and as to the other man that he charged, it appeared that he was innocent, so satisfactorily, that the Justice discharged him; and you hear from Rogers, that if you speak slowly, and loud, he can understand you: Mr. Kirby himself, and these people not knowing how to manage this man, may account for the incoherency of his answers; it is the duty of the parish, where they have idiots, to lock them up; but the Jury and Court have a duty to discharge, without partiality on one side or the other; and the simple question you have to decide is, whether he knew the difference of right and wrong as an ordinary child of fourteen years of age does; if you think he did, you will find that he is of sound memory and understanding; if on the other hand you think he does not know right from wrong, you will find that he is not of sound memory and understanding. In a case of this sort, there cannot be any leaning one way or the other; for the public have a right to be protected from such depredations, as much as an idiot has who is not responsible to the law for his acts; and, therefore, there must be no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090017"/>leaning one way or the other, it will be for you to say whether you think he is in a fit state to proceed to trial; it is not so much the question how he was at the time he committed the fact as how he is now; and you will now say what you think of him at this moment, whether he ought to be put upon his trial; if you think he ought, you will say he is of sound mind and understanding; and if you think he ought not, you will say he is not of sound mind and understanding.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. We think he is, of sound mind, and ought to be put upon his trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton, after having again read the indictment to the prisoner, put the question - "Are you guilty, or not guilty?" - After some hesitation, and being instructed by Mr. Kirby, he said - "not guilty;" - upon being asked - "How will you be tried?" - with the same hesitation, and instruction from Mr. Kirby, he said, - "by God and my country."</p>
               <p>The Jury were then sworn, to try the question of-"Guilty, or Not Guilty."</p>

             sworn. - Last Sunday morning I went to my premises, about five or six minutes after five, and found the door of the outhouse broke open; I observed a chalk-chopper lying by the door; I thought it had been some of the chalk people; I had not been there five minutes when I saw the prisoner come into the yard; I then hid myself a little while, but not seeing him go, I came out, and asked him what he was doing upon my premises; he said he was doing nothing there, he only went ot buy a pennyworth of milk; there is a piece of ground belonging to the premises let out to a cow-man; I told him I suspected he had broke open that place; I told him to get from the place immediately; he told me it was not him that broke the place open, he told me it was Goodyer; then the officer came up, and we went in search of Goodyer; and found him at home; he is a lad about eighteen or nineteen years of age; we took him, and on Monday morning they were both taken before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Was what the prisoner said taken down in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The Court asked if the examinations were returned, Mr. Sherton said they were not; when the Court expressed in very strong terms, their disapprobation of the conduct of Magistrates, in not returning the examinations.</p>
               <p>HANNAH TALBOT sworn. - I live in Cable-Street, Whitechapel: On Sunday morning, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came to my house; I was called up; when I came down, the prisoner was there with a bag, and I asked him what he had got there, he said a little copper that his father had sent him, and would be obliged to me to let him have some money upon it; I let him have sixteen shillings; I did not buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his father? - A. He works in a rope-ground; I have known his father many years; he is related to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come with him? - A. No.(The copper produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let this boy have sixteen shillings upon the copper; he did not deal in copper? - A. No; but I desired him to send his father to me in the morning, and then I should have examined him about it.</p>

             sworn. - I took charge of the prisoner from Mr. Magrath; I asked him to tell me truly who was with him when he took the copper; I did not make him any promise, or use any threat; I asked him repeatedly, and at length he said it was another lad of the name of Goodyer that broke the house; that he flood by while he was breaking it with a chalk-chopper; he said Goodyer brought the copper into Poplar-fields, and there cut it into three pieces; he said he was following him and saw him do it; I then asked him where did they go then; he said they went up by the Cape to Good Hope, and across the fields to Mr. Talbot's, copper-smith, in Back-lane; he said the other went in and fold the copper; that he staid at the door till the other came out, and then went to a public-house with the money; I went to Talbot's with Mr. Magrath, and found this copper lying in the shop, it was not concealed at all; Mrs. Talbot immediately acknowledged she had bought it of the prisoner; I asked her if there was any other boy, and she said, no; that though he was a relation she would tell the truth; there was nobody but him.</p>
               <p>Magrath. This is my copper; it was whole when I lost it, full of brass-cocks and plates, as much as two men could lift into a cart; they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not do it; another boy began at first, and then he ran away; I will never touch any thing again.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has she been a customer of your father's? - A. She never bought any bread; she has come with pies and puddings to bake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I said to Mrs. Dean, I have a great desire for a new loaf, and I took it; I was with child, and miscarried at Clerkenwell prison; I told her I should take it.</p>
               <p>Dean. I was within hearing all the while, and she said no such thing; she was talking to my mother about the expence of a gooseberry pie while she was taking the loaf; my mother was in the bake-house at the time.</p>

I believe he is the man, there was another man with him, they passed me, I followed them directly and overtook the prisoner with this box upon his back, and some meat; I asked him where he was going, he said, he was carrying it for his brother; I told him he could not go that way; and the other man said, Jack, I told you we could not go that way; then the prisoner came behind me, and just as we got to Mr. Drummond's door, he put the box down, and a quarter of lamb and some beef upon it, and away he ran; this box was locked, I then took the property to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such an opportunity of seeing him as, to be able to say the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes, I am positive of it; I took it to the watch-house, and found it belonged to Mr. Brookes, there was some halfpence and books in it; while I was looking over the things, the prisoner was brought in by another watchman, I knew the man again directly.</p>

             sworn. - At half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 4th of June, I saw the prisoner going along Chandos-street, with a large bundle under his left arm; I asked him what he had got in that bundle; he said, what he had got there, was no business of mine; I told him it was, and insisted upon seeing what he had got; upon that, says he, I will shew you what I have got, he laid his bundle down and broke from me; he got away from me about one hundred and fifty steps, I called out stop thief, he made use of very bad expressions, he would knock my bl - y brains out, and he would not have been taken if I had been by myself; he was stopped directly, and we took him to the watch-house; when we got there, the other watchman knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he in the bundle? - A. A forequarter of lamb, and the best end of a neck of mutton.</p>

             sworn. - I am a tailor, at No. 16, Clare-court; about half-past two on the 4th of June, I was coming through Chandos-street, I heard the rattles spring; I came up, and saw the watchman had hold of the prisoner, he seemed quite resolute, and would not go to the watch-house; I took him by the collar, and said, you shall go; upon that, the watchman desired me to take up the bundle, which laid upon the pavment, I took it to the watch-house; when we got to the watch-house, he was challenged by Dorrington.</p>
               <p>Brookes. I live in the Haymarket, at a distance from my shop; I was called up by Dorrington, I went to the watch-house and saw my property; here are two aprons in the desk, which do not belong to me; I left the desk, the mutton was my own killing; I missed the same quantity of meat from the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of it, I had no bundle, I heard the watchmen's rattles spring, I asked what was the matter, the watchman said, he would swear to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. On the 15th of March, the prisoner was discharged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first apprehend him? - A. The 9th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the prisoner from the 15th of March to the 9th of June? - A.I believe he was employed on the docks, but not on my works.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him constantly during that time? - A. I have seen him during the time; I had met him on the road.</p>
               <p>Q.Many times? - A. I cannot say, I never saw him walking.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you never any dispute with the prisoner at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mr. Thatcher? - A. I have had none; I cannot say what Mr. Thatcher has done.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, do not you know that he had a dispute with him, and that the consequence was a summons to the Court of Conscience? - A. Not to my knowledge, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that a person of the name of Stint summoned you to the Court of Conscience? - A. He did, for ten shillings, I attended there.</p>
               <p>Q.How long ago? - A. I should suppose a month or six weeks back.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you apprehended the prisoner? - A. Not far from that time, but I cannot say exactly, it might be before or after, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. In what month was it that you went to the Court of Conscience? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the month of June? - A. I believe it might be.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there not an account between you and the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor between Mr. Thatcher and the prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What work was he engaged in? - A. The excavation.</p>
               <p>Q. That excavation would require a pick-axe? - A. Certainly, we supply the men with these kind of implements.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You were summoned by Stint, not by the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though the prisoner was not apprehended till the 9th of June, did you go as soon as you received the information? - A. Yes, the same day; we missed this and a considerable deal more property about that time; we have lost from time to time, upwards of two hundred pounds.</p>

             sworn. - I lodge at the sign of the Two Chairmen, in Warwick-street, Cockspur-Street: On Sunday morning, after I returned from my work, there were two men asked me to have a glass of liquor; I was rather in liquor, I had been after drinking a little gin and milk, and it took rather an effect upon me; the prisoner was one of those two men; when I had drank it, I called for a quartern more, that I should not be under any compliments to them, as they were strangers; I was in the box facing them, waiting for my breakfast; I was going up to Air-street to wait upon a gentleman; the other man said he would give me some more liquor in the Haymarket, and when I had had my breakfast, they took me to a house in the Haymarket, the Cock, where I never was before; they called for liquor, and treated me with it, I drank with them.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you were very drunk, I suppose? - A. Very much so; then I went to <placeName id="t18000709-31-crimeloc160">James-Street, Golden-Square</placeName>

               <p>Q. How do you know that the prisoner was with you? - A. As I have been told; while I was in at the Two Chairmen, I had a silver watch, with a ribbon and key; I did not miss it till next morning, I had been taken home and put to bed; I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DELIGHT sworn. - I am a constable of the parish of St. James's: I met with the prisoner and Mr. Wall, on Sunday last, about twelve o'clock at noon, at the corner of Golden-Square; I had occasion to go into a public-house; they were both intoxicated very much, and wanted more liquor, but the landlord would not draw any more; they both fell together into the middle of the street, the prosecutor was undermost, with his face to the stones, and the prisoner upon him; the prosecutor cut his nose very much; I got a bason and water to wash his face; I asked the prisoner for a pocket-handkerchief to wipe his friend's face, and he pulled out this watch-string, it fell at my feet, which I took hold of; he said it was his, and took it out of my hand, and put it into his pocket; as soon as the prosecutor came to, almost the first words he said were, somebody has robbed me of my watch; I then looked round, and missed the prisoner; I said to the prosecutor, where is your friend gone; he made answer, he had no friend; I then went in pursuit of the prisoner, and overtook him the other side of Golden-Square; says I, are not you the person who was with the young man in liquor just now; he said no, he had been with nobody; says I, how can you tell me such a lie, there is the mud upon your coat now where you have been tumbling in the kennel; he refused to go back with me; however, after some words, I brought him back, and the watch was found in his pocket. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Wall. This is my watch, and this ribbon, and this key, are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I come here defenceless, without Counsel. I was in company with the prosecutor, and we were drinking till near twelve o'clock, till we were very much intoxicated; he could not keep his breeches buttoned, his watch was in great danger several times, and I told him of it; we went to another house, but I cannot tell where, for I was as intoxicated as himself; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090023"/>watch fell out of his pocket into the kennel; I was going to get a coach to take him home.

             sworn - I am an officer belonging to the Marine Police-office, Wapping: On Thursday, the 3d of July, I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; the serjeant gave me charge of him, for robbing him of his watch; (produces the watch;) I received it from the serjeant.</p>
               <p>Baughan. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The serjeant pulled out his watch, and said he had bought it that day or the day before, and he was handing it about to shew what a cheap watch he had bought; but I never had it in my hand at all; he went out backwards, and when he came back he said I had got his watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Simmons, No. 95, in the Strand, On Saturday last I saw the desk taken from Mr. Hanford's window, about nine o'clock in the evening; I had my hands full of boots; I was just by Mr. Hanford's door; it was an open window, the fash was out for shewing the goods; the prisoner is the man, he took it with both hands, and walked away very gently; two gentlemen stopped him before I could give the alarm; I cannot swear to the desk. (The desk produced.)</p>
               <p>Hanford. This desk was in the window; there might be three or four or five upon it; it was marked five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it; what would it cost you making? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it cost forty shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lowest priced desk in that window? - A.Fifteen shillings and sixpence; I never make any with brasses at the corners under two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hearne.) Do you think it was as large a desk as that? - A. Yes, full.</p>
               <p>Hanford. There was only one more desk of this size in the window, and that was marked four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that desk which you marked four guineas and a half stand you in more than forty shillings making? - A. Yes, it must.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The boy said, at the Justice's, that he saw me go into the shop.</p>
               <p>Hearne. I did not say so; I said I saw him take it from the window.</p>

               <p>- HENLEY sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Easterby: I was on board the Hope when Barnes was discharged; I saw him cut some canvas off the top-gallant-sail; the top-gallant-sail was in the forecastle; there was about five yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an old sail? - A. No, I saw him put it in his breast, and he went ashore with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it? - A. Three or four months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not your master correct you when he found the canvas cut out of the sail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Your master thought you did it then? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he correct you for? - A.Because I did not tell the captain.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Easterby.) Did you correct the boy upon the supposition that he had done it? - A. No, I corrected him for not telling the captain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. We were very short of canvas on board in coming from Shields, and the mate cut a piece of an old fad to put round the cable to keep it from chasing; afterwards when I came to London I was discharged and received my wages; and if I had had the canvas in my bosom, then Mr. Easterby must have seen it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q.But in point of fact he did not endorse it? - A. No, he said he could not write; and he made his mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he could not read also? - A. I do not recollect that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him again as you suppose, till last Saturday? - A. No.</p>

They are worth above ten pounds, without the table-cloth and white handkerchiefs; I left her in the room between nine and ten in the morning; when I came home, I found the door locked, the prisoner was gone out, and had taken the key with her; I did not see her again, till I saw her at her lodgings in Peter-street, Westminster, on the 8th of June; she was taken with the gown upon her, and I swore to my gown upon her back, at Queen-square office, and she had my bonnet upon her head; she would not tell me what she had done with any of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090032"/>things, she left her own bed-gown, and her own bonnet in my room; the gown that I lost was down stairs, under the counter.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the shirts new? - A. There were two belonging to a gentleman at Kensington, and one of the petticoats was new; those shirts were worth a guinea and a half a shirt, the shirts were new, the woman's dress was bran new, it cost two guineas; the cloak cost me two guineas just before, and was not the worse for wear; the stockings, I cannot say what they were worth, there were two pair cost seven shillings a pair; one of the petticoats was worth fourteen shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. How was she dressed, when you saw her that second time? - A. In an old bed-gown, and an old black hat; I then went out, I was gone about a quarter of an hour; when I returned, Mrs. Williams was come home, and the door broke open, there did not appear to be so many clothes in the room as there were before.</p>

I am a comb-maker, in St. Martin's-lane; I have known the prisoner from a child; I knew the prosecutor about nine months ago, the prisoner brought goods from Mr. Wright for me to sell; Wright repeatedly came with him afterwards; I have often heard Wright say, in conversation, that Bell was indebted to him; some altercation took place now and then between them, but I never heard Wright challenge Bell with robbing him, but that he owed him money, and desired him to pay it; about three months ago, Wright called upon me, and requested me to go and see Bell, who had inlisted for a soldier; I went with him to the King's-arms, in Holborn, and there Wright asked Bell for the money, that as he was become a soldier, he might then pay him out of his bounty-money; he said, he had not received it, yet, as soon as he got it, he would let him have some; I heard little more of it till after the prisoner was in custody; I sent for Wright; Bell's father asked him, respecting this business, how he could attempt to take his son up for robbing him; Wright replied, he should not have done any such thing, but he owed him some money; he asked him how much it was, and he pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said, it was about eight pounds; he told Mr. Bell at the same time, that if he could get the order to receive this money from his commanding officer, he would let this matter drop.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was by at this time? - A.Nobody particular; Mrs. Bell was by, and my wife, and Bell the father; I never heard any thing but that he was a very honest young fellow up to the present time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Beville. I am an iron-founder, at Lambeth: I know the prosecutor, Wright; I was present at the conversation on the morning of the day that my son was apprehended; Jones sent for Wright, I said, good God, how could you be so serve, surely he has not robbed you; I should not have done so, says he, if he had paid the money he had agreed to pay me; I asked him how that debt arose; he said, he had frequently lent him money, and he had had his German-flute; surely, says I, he did not steal it; why yes, he said, he had taken it out of his room, and some other things, that he would take care to prove; but upon going a little farther he flew out of the room; I was angry, a little alteration took place, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the day your son was apprehended? - A. It was the day of the last examination, when he was committed; Mrs. Bell was present, and Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the bounty-money? - A. I understand so; I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Wright say, that he had employed your son to pawn things for him? - A. I cannot speak with any certainty to that.</p>

Yes; here is the frock and skirt; I went before the Alderman, and I walked by the side of her after the examination on Tuesday, as she went to the Compter, and she told me she had pledged them at Mr. Strangeways's, over Blackfriars-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A.No; She asked me to forgive her for taking the child; I told her I could not forgive her; she said she was in liquor at the time; I asked her if she had put them in her own name; she said, no, she had put them in her sister's name; I asked her if she had got the tickets; she said, no, she had lost them; she said her sister's name was Tibbet; when I came there, they were not in that name, they were in the name of Davis; they are my child's clothes; I have a piece of a skirt which the child has on now, there was no particular mark upon it; the frock is the same, I made them both myself.</p>

            : On Wednesday evening last, about half past seven o'clock, I was at the farther end of the room, by the window, I turned my head round and saw the prisoner come into the room by the side-board; I saw her reach her hand over the sideboard; then I walked up to her, and she had got the mug in her hand, she had got it about one inch off the side-board; I asked her what her pleasure was; she said she came to take a glass of water; I immediately walked out of the room, and shut the door to, I called one of the servants, and desired her to call Mr. Meare; he sent for a constable, and she was detained.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090036"/>Q.What part of the house in this room in? - A. Up one pair of stairs; the side board is within one spot of the door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.What age are you? - A. Fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the nature of an oath? - A. I shall answer to my conscience.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe you must answer to God? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you hear it in your memory that you were examined before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes, twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the nature of an oath when you were before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whenever you were examined before the Lord-Mayor you were examined upon oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, when you were before the Lord-Mayor the first time, did you not say, that she put her hand upon the mug, and that that was all she did? - I said she hoisted it one inch from the side-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, the first time that you were before the Lord-Mayor, that she had put her hand upon the top of the mug, and that that was all she did? - A. I said she hoisted it one inch from the side-board.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect, I am speaking of the first time; and I will tell you this, that there was a person by at the time you were examined, and I warn you of that-did you always give the same account before the Lord-Mayor? - A. He asked me but one question the second time, which was, if I was certain she moved the mug, and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your account before the Lord-Mayor was always consistant? - A. As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the Lord-Mayor reprimand you, and tell you you had been very wicked in giving him different accounts? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not reprimand you at all? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.You must know; it is now Saturday; was it yesterday, or the day before, that you gave your account before the Lord-Mayor? - A. The day before yesterday, and yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have a recollection of what passed? - A. He told me to speak louder; that is the only thing that I remarked.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he never reprimanded you for giving different accounts? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you never say, that all she did was, to put her hand upon the mug? - A. No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Meare.) Q. Did this witness charge the prisoner in your presence? - A. Yes; he told me that the woman came softly into the room; got between him and the door, and put her hand across the side-board towards the silver mug, and moved it; that is, as near as I can possibly recollect, what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the examination before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the account that he gave there? - A. At the first examination he was asked particularly as to whether the girl had moved the mug; I particularly desired him to recollect himself; and as well as I can recollect, he said, she moved the mug; at the second examination, the Lord-Mayor asked him again, particularly, whether she moved the mug, and he said, she had moved the mug.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How came you to desire the boy to recollect himself? - A. I desired him to remember to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth; I desired him to recollect the facts as they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Lord-Mayor reprimanding him? - A. No; I was, myself, rather dubious about it, for I did not distinctly hear him; and, at the second examination, I desired him to be particular, and he said, she had moved it, but I did not hear him distinctly say that, at the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q.Surely, it was only yesterday, you must recollect whether the Lord-Mayor said any thing particular to the boy? - A. I do not want to keep back any thing, but I do not remember any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively, that the Lord-Mayor did not reprimand him? - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not? - A. I can only swear to what I really heard, I did not hear him reprimand the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As soon as I entered the room the young man locked me in; he told his master I was going to take the mug; at the first examination he said I was going to take it; and at the second, he said he took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>HENRY HIGGINS sworn. - I am a smith and bell-hanger, I live in Houghton-street, Clare-market; I was attending before the Lord-Mayor, when the prisoner was examined, but was not at the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the second? - A. Yes, the day before yesterday, Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed? - A. The boy came forward, and said, that the mug that was there, was not moved from off the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there at any other time than Thursday? - A. Yes, Friday.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be at the second? - A. I attended as her friend; the boy said, the mug was not moved, but her hand was upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090037"/>Q.Did he say any thing afterwards? - A.Nothing that I took notice of.</p>
               <p>Q.On the Friday, did the Lord-Mayor say, any thing to him? - A. On the Friday, he did say, this is two different stories.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say on the Friday? - A. He said it was taken from the side-board.</p>
               <p>Q. The Lord-Mayor observed to him this was two different stories? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a married woman? - A. Yes; I have known her six or seven years, her husband kept a broker's shop in Stanhope-street, and after that a green-grocer's; I never knew any harm of either of them, in my life; she bears a very good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman at Shadwell: On the Friday before the robbery, at eleven o'clock at night, I saw a cart standing at the bottom of Shadwell-market, which gave me some suspicion; on Sunday morning, about four o'clock, I was locking my box up, and saw the prisoner with a cart, just by Mr. Morgan's place but he stopped at a little distance off; I then called my brother watchman, Strutt, and he came; when we went up to the cart, there were two trusses of hay in it, and the carman bringing the third; the prisoner was in the stables; I then turned my back to him, that he should not see me, then he moved the cart a little farther off; then I saw Mr. Morgan' horse-keeper, the prisoner at the bar; I stood by the corner of the wall, and saw the same carman take a sack of mixture from the stable, and some words passed between them, but I was too far off to hear what it was; my fellow-servant followed him and when I met with them they were coming back again, as he said, to shew where he got it from I observed the carman run away as hard as he could and my partner went after him; after that, I saw the prisoner knock at his own door; after the carman ran away, he came towards the stable, and was catched by the watchman, and we took him to the watch-house; I have got a sample of the mixture and a sample of the hay, (produces it ); the mixture is pollard, split beans, and clover; I suppose that might be between three and four bushels of it.</p>
               <p>STRUTT sworn. - I am a watchman, Shadwell: the last witness called me a little after four o'clock on Sunday morning the 1st of June I went away to Mr. Morgan's premises, and the I saw the track of a small cart round the corner out of sight the stables; I went up to the man that belonged to the horse and cart, and asked him where he had got that hay and corn; there we three trusses of hay in the cart, he was going on a direction from the stables; I asked him where he was going, and told him I should not leave him and when he came to the market, he turned down into the market, and the other watchman desired me to mind them while he called an officer; soon as he was gone, the man that belonged to the cart ran away, I ran after him, he ran past Mr. Morgan's stables, and made his escape; the other watchman then took me to the place where gentleman lives, and knocked at the door; the prisoner opened the door, upon which Thomas hold of him, and I likewise, and took him to the watch- house.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Morgan. I was called up; I saw in the cart three trusses of hay, and this sack of mixture; I can swear to the clover, it is remarkable clover, such as I never saw before nor since; it is singularly green, clover in general is brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any? - A. I have missed twenty times that quantity; I have missed a great quantity of hay, and the horses have been starved.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of it; the watchman laid hold of me, and charged me with this, when I was going to buy a pair of shoes; I Know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mildred himself at home? - A. Yes, and a lodger up in the garret; just as I entered the room-door, my wife was entering it too; upon inquiring of Mildred, we entertained a suspicion of the prisoner; we went to the pawnbrokers to give information, and then we were going to Rosemary-lane, and in our way there, we met with the prisoner at the bar, in Chiswell-street; my wife accosted her, and asked her if she was going to our apartments, she was then buying fruit at a greengrocer's; she said, yes, in half an hour, will that do; we walked with her to the end of Grub-Street, and when she had turned the corner she ran away; I ran after her, laid hold of her, and brought her to our own apartments; I fetched Cartwright, the constable, who insisted that my wife should search her, I did not see her searched; after the search, my wife brought two duplicates into the room, one of them led to the gown-tail and the silk; she confessed where the muslin gown was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On the 29th of June, on the Sunday morning, I took the prisoners into custody, about six o'clock; I went to the prisoner Collett's house, No. 7, Two Swan Yard, Bishopsgate-street, and on a copper, close by where the prisoner stood, I found this piece of cambric muslin; I asked him where he bought those things; and he said, d-n me, I would buy any thing; I then took Collett to the Compter; I then returned, and searched the house; in his box I found a piece of black silk mode; I also found a piece of lace, while I was searching the house; I took the key out of Collett's pocket with which I unlocked the box; I then went to a house, No. 17, Old Bethlem-court, where there lived one Elizabeth Day; I took her into custody, and took her to Collett's house; I searched her, and found two pieces of silk handkerchief in her right-hand pocket; I apprehended Baldwin at the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he had told you any thing, did you make him any promises, or use any threats? - A.I told him I would do what I could, with his master, if he would confess what he knew.</p>

               <p>ROBERT READ sworn. Examined by Mr. Knpp. I accused the prisoner, Baldwin, of having robbed us of a piece of mode, a piece of cambric muslin, and eighteen yards, or a piece, of lace; he denied it; I mentioned the articles over again; he said they were at Sapwell's, the constable's house; he said, the cambric muslin is not your's; I then said, what are the other things, you have robbed us of them; he said, yes, and wished he had gone for a sailor before he took them; I asked him what could induce him to do it; he said, that Collett was continually after him, telling him to do it; he said it was his first offence, he never robbed us before, nor since, and he had received no money for the things; I told him if it was so, I Would not prosecute him. This silk mode is our property, it is worth forty shillings, it has not been sold by us; also the eighteen yards of lace, which is worth about forty shillings, that was found in Collett's box; the other things I believe to be our property, but will not swear to them; the handkerchiefs I am certain of, but the marks being picked out I will not swear to them; the cambric muslin, the mark being torn, I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner did not abscond from your service? - A. No; I sent for him, and he came to me without force.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to take upon yourself to say, that that black silk mode had never been sold? - A. If it had, it would have been entered in the book; on the lace there are figures made.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the figures always torn off the lace when it is sold? - A. Not always.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know any thing of Collett? - A. No; I never saw him till I saw him before the Lord-Mayor.(The confession of Baldwin was produced, and read).</p>
               <p>The Prisoners left their defence to their Counsel, and called six witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a servant to Messrs. Wells and Company: On the 9th of June, the prisoners at the bar came into our back shop; I saw Palmer, the last witness, serving the prisoners with some thread; he had occasion to go into the front shop; I then saw Mary Johnson cross from the west to the east counter, to look at some artificial flowers which were hanging over the counter, where there were some muslins lying; I saw her take some muslins, and put them under her cloak; but upon looking round, and observing that I was looking that way, she put them down again; she then came across to the left-hand counter, where I was standing, she staid there some time looking at the threads, and then Palmer returned; Mary Robson stood before

             between me and the counter; then I saw Mary Johnson cross a second time to the right-hand counter, and take the muslin off the counter, and conceal it under her cloak; she then came over with Mary Johnson to the left-hand counter; I went round the counter and told Mr. Jones of it; I then challenged her with the theft; Mary Robson was close to her when I challenged her with it; she moved about, and I saw the muslin lying close by where she was standing; I sent up to my master; a constable was sent for, and they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the two prisoners conversing together? - A. Yes: they were talking together just before I challenged Marry Johnson; I picked up the muslin, put my mark upon it, and gave it to the constable; there were nineteen yards of it in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Four pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Was her back towards you then? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. I had put them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there had not been muslins there? - A. There had; Mr. Palmer had been serving there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of her when you came to the other counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came round, you found the muslin on the ground? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a cheesemonger, I live at No. 51, Rosomond-street, Clerkenwell: On Wednesday, the 2d of April, I remember selling a cheese, when Mr. Amphlet was in the shop, but do not like to swear to the person; I believe that to be the man, but I won't go the length to swear; the person gave me a ten-pound Bank of England note, it was then candle-light, (the note produced); I know this is the note, because I wrote on the back of it directly after I took it; I wrote"clerk, at Evans's," on it; I knew Mr. Amphlet, who was in the shop, was clerk to a meeting, and Evan's was where he lodged; I cannot tell whether Amphlet and the person were acquainted, only by appearance, as they spoke together; Mr. Amphlet came in first, and the prisoner a few minutes after; the cheese came to two pounds two shillings and nine-pence; I gave him five one-pound notes, (I don't mean to swear to the amount of the change I gave him) two guineas and a half in gold, and I believe four and sixpence in silver, and three penny-pieces; I mark all the notes I take, and if they were among five thousand, I would pick them out, (five one-pound notes shewn the witness;) I can speak to them all, I can swear they were in my possession on the 2d of April, at night, after we lit a candle, when the prisoner came in; I knew Mr. Amphlet, and took him to be a friend of his that made me give change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner was a stranger to you? - A. Yes; but I knew Mr. Amphlet, who is clerk to a meeting, and, I believe, a tailor by trade, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken more than one batch of one-pound notes, or you had more than five in the house? - A. I don't know that I had; I gave him all I had, though I will not swear that I had no more.</p>

               <p>Q.Neither can you swear, that if you had any more, you did not put your mark on them? - A. I mark all the notes; I had fifty six notes, but no ten-pound notes to the best of my recollection; I gave no five-pound note in change; I did not receive any other ten-pound note that day, I am sure; I have a book in which I put down the notes I take, this note is down; I can recollect the transaction perfectly from memory, but having the book as well, it is stronger.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He was apprentice to a japanner, I believe? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q.He has been employed in japanning glasses and frames? - A. I don't know that; I saw the back of the note, but I cannot say whether it was a Bank-note, or any other note.</p>

             sworn. - I am a clerk in the house of Messrs. Winter and Kay, Solicitors to the Bank; On the 4th of April last in consequence of some information, I went to a house in Bowling-green-lane, Clerkenwell where I understood the prisoner lodged, and forced him in a two pair of stairs room, and a young woman with him; the officers searched them, and their boxes, and found some money and Bank-notes; I then told him my business, that we had a five-pound note, forged, which had been traced to him, and asked him where he had got it; he said he got it at a pawnbroker's-shop, in Fleet-market; he said he wanted a five-pound note to send his father, at Birmingham; and thinking a pawnbroker's a likely place to get a note, they wanting cash, he gave them five pounds in cash for it. I took them with me to the pawnbroker's, and saw the servant who had given the change, and he said he perfectly recollected the prisoner, and his giving him the five-pound note; so that the circumstance related by the prisoner was correct. I asked whether that was the note; he said they never marked the notes, but it might be the note, or it might not. I then took them to Mr. Winter's office, and he there gave an account where he lived, and how he got his living, and got the money in his box, which he said he had got by his business he said he had lived with the young woman for twelve months, that they had lodged at four different lodgings during that time; he mentioned first; a lodging in Portpool-lane, Gray's-Inn-lane; the second, in Bayne's-row; the third I have not got; the fourth was in Bowling-green-lane I asked him where he had lodged beside; I am sure the third was not at Islington; he said, some notes found upon him were received in change for a ten-pound note at the Bank; I asked him where he got the ten-pound note; he said it was, part of the change of a twenty-pound note he took a little while before, at a hosier's shop in Holborn. It was then late, and the account he gave of the note being corroborated by the pawnbroker, induced me to let him go, on his promising to be in the way the next morning, at nine o'clock, at his lodgings in Bowling-green-lane; I called at nine o'clock and he was not at home, he had been gone out about an hour; at that time I knew nothing of Mr. Benson's note. I then made it my business to go to the Bank, to see what notes of this description had been paid there, and I found a great number; I did not see any thing of him till the 28th. Mr. Benson came to Mr. Winter's office, on the 9th of April, with one of the Inspectors of notes, who had traced it to him, and related the manner in which he took it. On the 5th, I went to the house of Mr. Painter, who keeps an oil-shop, in White Lion-street, Islington; I was shewn up to a two pair of stairs back room, there was bed in it; I found a cup with a composition in it, a camel-hair brush, and a table with Indian-ink spread on it as if it had be spread on purpose. On the 28th, in consequence of information, I went and apprehended him in Banner-street, Whitecross-street, at a little cheese monger's shop; I went directly up stairs, without asking any questions, and looked into the front room, but saw nobody there; I then went to the back room door, which was fastened and the key outside; I unlocked it, and went in, and he came out from behind the bed-curtains; the person, in whose house he was concealed, told me they had concealed him there on purpose, as they knew he was in danger, from the information he had given them, of being apprehended for forgery, or something of that sort; when he came from behind the curtains, he said he did not know; I then said you must go with me; he did not deny having a lodging at White Lion-street.</p>

Mr. Gibbs, in Banner-street, is indebted to me six pounds, money that my brother sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090056"/>out of the country, that you shall have; my sister, she has money enough to let me have it, but my time is so short, and I cannot tell where to write to her; don't be fearful about the payment of it, you shall be sure of it again; don't be fearful of doing it, as my life is in danger When you have got this letter, the person will call soon after for an answer; don't be fearful, all is safe; you may give him a note wherein you may tell your intentions, he will bring it safe to me; and if you can do it, you will spare no time, and come to the House of Correction, and ask for me; and if they will not let me see you, you can tell them you have some money for me, and that you should like to see me yourself; but if you cannot see me, write a note, and give it them, and the money with it, I shall have it safe. I hope you will understand me, for I have no time to write what I wish. You can think of the best method to let me have it.

Mr. Holt said, I did not know, Mrs. Painter, that you sold brushes, for I use a good many in my business. I remember Mr. Loaring coming to my house, it was the prisoner's apartment he saw, he paid five shillings a week; I shewed Mr. Loaring the apartment, there was a cup in it, and a piece of paper, that gentleman found in the room, and a table with Indian-ink on it. When I taxed Mr. Holt with not being at home regularly at night, he said, Mrs. Painter, you are regular people, don't fet up for me; for any time, I can sleep any where for a shilling. When he came to my lodging, he had an excellent character; I was informed he was a landscape painter, and brushes are used by them.(
