                  </hi>. I am the widow of Mr. Pittendreigh, who was a solicitor's clerk—he died a year ago last May—the prisoner is my sister—she married Mr. Studholme—they separated in July, 1873—she left him twice, the last time was in July—at that time he had a large house in Myddleton Square—he gave that up—at Christmas time I took a house at 26, Cadogan Terrace—I have lived for many years on the same estate—Mr. Studholme came into the house at the same time I did, and he is lodging there still—he does not pay me so much a week now, because he is a ruined man—he will pay me ultimately, I hope—he agreed to pay me so much a week—two nights after I went into the house the prisoner came there with a mob of about 300 persons, and told them that I was living with her husband, and that I was the cause of his leaving her and she threatened that she would not stop till she had put me in the workhouse and that I and my daughter, aged 16, got our living by immorality—shortly after that I received a number of letters from her, sometimes two a day for. months—this the one of 31st December—it is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed "Mrs. Pittrendreigh, living with J. Studholme, the Tichborns forger</hi>, 26, <hi rend="italic">Cadogan Place, South Hackney, near French Hospital." It commenced</hi> "<hi rend="italic">You vile wretch" and accused the witness of perjury, forgery, and adultery.</hi>) This is a letter of 7th January, received by my landlady—none of the letters are signed or dated—this is the prisoner's writing—there is not the slightest truth in the statement there made—it is a most atrocious falsehood.</p>

               <p>affairs for him when his wife left him—the boy did not come into his father's room one morning and find me in bed with his father, and mistake me for his mother and say how glad he was to see his mother back again; this is the first I have heard of it—Studholme did not swear and send him from the house—I was not receiving relief from the Hackney Union before the separation of the prisoner and Studholme; I was, at the death of my husband; he had been ill for four years, and I had six children, and I had no one gaining a shilling for me, and our doctor, seeing us suffering in silent poverty, sent the parochial authorities—when I went to Myddleton Square, I took my children—we went there on 7th August, and he let the house and left it on New Year's Day this year—I was there the whole time, and managed the house very well for him—I removed from there to Cadogan Terrace, where I now am with Mr. Studholme; we are all living in one house, my son, aged twenty, my daughter, seventeen, down to my little girl, three years old—Mr. Studholme was a clerk to Messrs. Routledge—he left and was ill for two months and I nursed him, and he has not been to a situation since—I did not throw dirty water over the prisoner, nor did her husband in my presence, or rotten eggs—I never saw him use any violence to her—I applied to a Magistrate at Worship Street for a summons, on these libels; I also summoned her when she came and broke my window, but I withdrew that summons and wrote to my father to keep her quiet, as I did not wish to punish her—I have been summoned there myself once by her friend, Mrs. Pearce; that was after I had applied for these summonses, and they knew I should prosecute—I have not been a defendant at Worship Street on any other occasion—the Magistrate did not refuse to grant me a summons for these letters, he granted it; he did not go into the inquiry—he was to appoint a day to hear it and send to let me know—I did not hear, and I went to the Court, and the Chief Clerk advised me to proceed by indictment, as that would be quicker and cheaper, and I took his advice, and they returned me the money I had paid for the summons—I was not the only person who went before the Grand Jury; there was the lady who she wrote the second letter to—Mr. Stud<lb/>holme was not with me when I was preferring the indictment—he did not know that I was going to do it; he begged me not to it—I did not subpoena him to prove his wife's handwriting—I subpœnaed him as an important witness against Pearce, who is here on another charge of libel—I did not subpoena him here last sessions; he was not in the building with me before I went before <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Grand Jury—I met him here; we did not come together—I subpœnaed him because I would not trust to his coming, for all through he wanted not to appear in the case; he was broken down about my prosecuting his wife—he did not come down to Court with me to-day—my daughter and I came by train; he was here before us—I don't know how he came; he has been married to my sister eleven years—I have known him off and on the whole of that time, but for seven years previous to my going into the house I had not spoken to him.—my sister and I were brought up together, and after I was married I went back and lived with my family for years in Granville Square, where they now live, and she has lived with, me at different times—we have been on friendly terms up to the time she and her husband separated and after—he was by deed to allow her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—there have been many orders made against him for payment; he paid up to the time he fell ill and did not earn any more—the furniture was not seized and claimed by me: it</p>

               <p>Office I made up, on the 19th August, this letter addressed to Mr. W. Watts, 3, Elliott's Row, Much Adam, Ware, Hertfordshire (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I enclosed in it a sovereign and a ten franc piece—I marked those coins, and having enclosed them, fastened the envelope and took the letter to the Post Office in Chancery Lane—I registered it in the ordinary way at 6.45 in the evening—it would be collected at Chancery Lane that evening and would be taken to the Western Central Office where it would lay till the following morning and be despatched and received at the Head Office about 5 o'clock—the prisoner was on duty at the Head Office Registered Letter Branch he was employed there on the 25th August—after the letter was received at the Head Office a receipt would be sent from the Head Office with the letter and that receipt would be sorted instead of the letter—the tab would be torn off the receipt and it would be the prisoner's duty to present that tab to the officer who held the letter, and upon the production of that tab the letter would be handed over to him. and finally despatched in the letter bag for Ware—the receipt and tab are made out at the Western Central Office, and sent on with the letter to the General Office—the letter is retained by the head officer there and the slip is sent in to be sorted by the ordinary sorters and the prisoner would bring it to the head officer who has possession of the letter, and gives up this tab as the receipt for it—the would then enter it on the letter bill for Ware and he should enclose the letter with others in the registered letter bag for Ware—it would be his duty to see the bag properly tied and sealed, and take it to the Inland Branch—it would be the prisoner's duty to make up the bag. that morning—about 7.30 that morning I went to the Inland Branch of the General Office, and examined the Ware registered letter bag—it had been made up and sealed at that time—I opened it and found this letter torn in the way it is now, with the exception of being cut open at the top—there was an opening in the side the same as there is now, which was large enough for a coin to come through—I opened the letter in order to ascertain what was in it—the ten franc piece was still in the letter, and the sovereign was missing—I went into the Registered Letter Office where I shortly afterwards saw the prisoner come in—I took him into a private room and said "Did you make up the registered letter bag for Ware?"—he replied "Yes"—I said "I wish to speak to you about a letter," at the same time producing this letter—"I said, "Did you make up this for Ware this morning?'—he said "It looks like the one I had"—I said "This letter is mine, I enclosed a sovereign and another coin in the letter before it was registered and upon examining the bag and taking the letter out I find the sovereign has been abstracted from this letter, do you know anything about it?"—he said "<hi rend="italic">No"</hi>—he was then searched by Police Constable Moore—I saw him take the sovereign from one of his pockets—it was loose—he also took other monies which were in a purse from another pocket—I then said to the prisoner "Where did you get that sovereign?"—he said "I brought it from home this morning to pay 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for which I have been summoned at Guildhall"—I said "How long have you had the sovereign?"—he replied "Three or four days"—I then took the sovereign from the desk where it had been lying, and examined it and said "This is the sovereign which I identify as the one which I enclosed in the letter which I have spoken to you about, it bears my private marks—he replied "I know nothing about any marks, as I do not examine coin when I receive it"—the prisoner was then given into custody—he said "I hope you don't think I stole the sovereign,</p>

The barmaid picked it up with her right hand and went in the parlour, where she was with the other barmaid four or five minutes. She came back, went to a cupboard in front of the bar and opened it with her right hand, then put her left hand in, shuffled some money, and shut the door again with her right hand; then she came to me and said 'This is a bad two-shilling piece young man,' I said 'Why didn't you tell me so in the first place? She made no answer. I said 'If I have taken it it was in a mistake either out of half-a-sovereign or half-a-crown, you must not think I get my living at it;' she said 'I don't say you do.' Upon this I took out my pocket-book and showed her pawn tickets for my watch and rings which I had pawned to keep myself while out of employment. Then she went to the parlour door again and sent for a police constable, and I remained in the bar ten or twelve minutes before he came."</p>

                     <hi rend="smallCaps">WEBBER</hi>.</hi> A man named Robert Holmes was the first one that got me to do this; he always went to Mr. Watson's first and prepared everything. I got acquainted with this man Holmes through a builder that I did work for at Hackney, who used to know him, and he was great friends with him. Through my getting acquainted with a man named Lawrence I got acquainted' with this fellow Mr. Holmes. 'We were in a public house one night doing business and talking about money matters with Lawrence, and he said to me "You have got some money coming to you, have you not?" I said "Possibly I might have some day," he said "Where is it?" and I told him I did not think of anything at that time. He said "Why don't you sell some of it out? I could give you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "I said I had no idea of it. He said "You can by getting a man and woman to forge the name; I can guarantee it shall be paid back again; I could give you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "He knew. old Mr. Watson, he goes to him and makes it all right for us. Whether he went and got this lady, or whether any one else did I don't know. I think I had an interview with the man first, to ask him whether he would be persuaded to leave some little out or not. It was not done intentionally to rob the Bank. He said "If you think you can do any good with it I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210018"/>
               <p>should not mind having a try." I went and told this man what I had done, and he tries and persuades me to sell some of it out, and he or somebody else goes and asks this lady, and gets her to come and pass as Mrs. Croucher; then they go to old Mr. Watson and sell out two lots before I saw this gentleman at all. The money was sold out. I said to him "What have we got to give this lady and the other man?" He made a proposition what they were to have. I really could not say what they had the first time. When it was sold I said "Now what have we to give you, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will suit you, won't it?" He said "No, I have done most of it, and I want most of it; I want 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "He used to do the writing, and I used to carry the cheque book, and if I wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I used to get him to write out the cheque and I signed my name, and if I wanted 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would put a I down before it and make. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, and rob me that way. Several times he did this. On one occasion he said to the other man "I don't see what we want with Webber; if we go to a fresh broker and get another man we can sell out the stock and have it ourselves, and let Webber down. "They worried me so I was like a madman, but I did not like to upset him, because I was frightened if I did, that I should get nothing at all. Then, in order to try and satisfy me after he found it was very nearly all gone, he comes to me when the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sold out, and says "Mr. Webber, I have had bad luck with the money I have had of you, but a friend of mine has money coming to him; I will take you to Doctor's Commons and show you the will. The two trustees are dead and they want to get two more trustees; you seem poor, and you can have your money back if you can only find money to do it." He took me up to Doctor's Commons and showed me the will. I have no question to ask the witness. We had this money certainly, but not with the intention of robbing the Bank. It was done by this man persuading me to do it; it was to be paid back again. I never went to this lady's house at all; the old gentleman went and fetched her out.</p>

"I can't understand why they should have issued a warrant against me, as my mother-in-law won't prosecute—I asked him what he meant by "we"—he said they were persons that went with him and they used to live at Bow, but he did not know their names or addresses—I arrested Woolfe—I told her I should charge her with being concerned with Charles Webber in forging and uttering a certain share in stock in the Bank of England, in the names of Richard and Elizabeth Croucher on 22nd May last—she said "I went with them, a friend of mine came for me and I went to the Bank of England; I met them at the Royal Exchange; we went to the Bank of England, I-signed the name of Elizabeth Croucher five or six times; I did not know that I was doing any wrong"—she gave the name of Jackson—I addressed her as Jackson—she subsequently called herself Woolfe—I believe she is living with a man at Hackney—I don't think. they are married—he is a man occasionally employed as a broker.</p>

               <p>sufferer, and a great loser in health and pocket, and in my delay of Government works, all occasioned by this man—I have said that Mr. Pugin has treated me badly, and I believe he has—I am not aware that I have in many places expressed myself strongly with regard to what Mr. Pugin has done—I don't remember particularly that I have spoken of him to his dispraise and discredit—I have said that his claim was a most unjust one which would be settled if he liked to bring the action—I don't remember particularly that I have expressed myself to that effect to more than one person and in more than one place—he has written and sent me telegrams of insult and letters also, before the late trial—he made attacks on me before I pleaded to the action—I had received letters of insult before, and he had attacked me in various directions among my friends, calling me a liar, and expressions of that kind—these letters in the supplement were written since his return from America—I was present at the previous trial—I believe this letter headed "The Eve of the Fight," came into ray hands on the day previous to that trial—the trial, I think, was on the 14th July—I am unable to say whether that letter was here then—I believe it was not among those letters which formed part of that enquiry—I am not sure where it was at that moment, but I believe it was not among those letters which were put in as containing the libels—I have gone through the letters in the supplemen t—I have been so inundated with letters from this man that it is extremely difficult for me to recognise a particular letter—I am not perfectly certain whether or not the letter of 10th April, 1874, was produced at the former trial—I don't know—I should be sorry to say one way or the other my memory might deceive me—I can't say that after I had put the pleas of fraud on the record I noticed that his manner was altered, because I had received insults before any letters were written: I don't mean insults with regard to the dispute about the house, but things said of me to my friends—I had heard of stinging things said of me before there was a thought of an action arising out of the architect's claim in connection with the house at Kilburn—I only made one affidavit—that was with reference to his going to America, and I conclude it was that he' referred to when he called me perjurer. (<hi rend="italic">The affidavit was here put in and read; it</hi> was <hi rend="italic">dated 6th October</hi>, 1873, <hi rend="italic">and stated that he had been informed that Mr. Pugin intended to go to America for two years; that he was without means, and had to be supported by his friends while he was absent in America.</hi>) I have stated that the imputations of perjury refer to my affidavit—it is impossible to know to what he does point in these letters—I suppose he is partly referring to the affidavit and partly to the extraordinary statements which he has made, for I declare upon my oath that there is scarcely a sentence in the whole of these letters which is true—I had not made any affidavit but this one, which he could impeach, therefore it is natural to refer his charge of perjury to this affidavit: now I understand you—I knew that I had not made a false oath, but I partly understood him, in his dreamy way of putting it, to allude to that—I understood the various imputations contained in that letter to refer to a desire on my part to avoid payment in relation to the claim made by him, and to nothing else—I don't know that ho ever charged me with wronging anybody else—I beg your pardon, there are letters in which he does accuse me of not paying other persons—there is a letter there with regard to a Mrs. Thornton, in which he says that I had refused to pay a sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or some such sum, to a lady—I can't say that I found any difference in him after I made</p>

               <p>this affidavit; he has always been excited—I don't know that these pleas of fraud were the common talk in the profession to which we belong—I did not find it so—Mr. Pugin's claims upon me, from the beginning to the end, I have heard, but not this affair of the affidavit—if Mr. Pugin will bring his action the question of fraud will be made quite clear—I did not try to sell my house, nor did I ever give him permission to do so—I did not put it on an agent's books—I was not willing to take an adequate offer for it—I did not want to sell my house to him: what right had he to buy my house?—at Bow Street he desired to refer all disputes between us—there was something said about it before then—I did not break it off—it is so long since that I do not remember these things well—there was a proposition, and it is one which Mr. Pugin has always been making everywhere, throwing the house into measuring value; these propositions have only been made to put off the trial—I do not remember instructing my solicitor to agree to the proposition—I did not afterwards refuse to refer—it fell through in this way, Mr. Pugin became bankrupt and there were difficulties in the way of anything, and what was done I am unable to say—I don't know that Mr. Pugin was a sufferer in pocket by these disputes as well as me—I have of course suffered in pocket with regard to the house which he built—if his claim is well founded he has not got his due, but it is not Well founded—I say that owing to his misconduct I have paid more than I ought to have done—by his neglect he was dismissed—I should not think that the put-ing the two pleas of fraud on the record had injured him in his profession, I believe not: but with regard to the house I want to say that I do not owe that man a farthing; the house is paid for, and the receipts are there—it is not my fault that he is indicted before the case is <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>—I believe the Magistrate suggested to Mr. Pugin that he ought not to write to me any more, and he pledged his honour that he would not—there was-somethin to that effect said, I believe—I have received no letter from him since he gave me that pledge, but letters about me have been written to my friends.</p>

I did not say of the defendant at the Stafford Clab and elsewhere that I had evidence against him that would send him to the hulks—I know Mr. Wallis—I did not state that to him—I gave the opinion of my lawyer, who said that the affair of the bond would be, in his opinion, sufficient to send them to prison, or something like that—it was there believed that he was in partnership with a builder and that he gave to the builder a bond for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over the cost of my house—before the contract was signed he told me that the builder would build it for 2,403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that he bad given him a bond for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over that, so I said to him "I have done with the transaction, I will have nothing whatever to do with that, and it dropped—I conceived that I should have to pay that sum when the bond was presented—some days afterwards he came to me and said "I have seen the builder and have abandoned the bond, and he will build it for the sum named"—that being the case I thought the matter was fair and clear, and I said I would sign the contract, and the builder signed it, and the sum to be paid was 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed that the bond was destroyed—towards the close of the year, when the house had got a good way up, the builder came to me and said "I must ask you to give me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a bond I hold against you"—I said "From whom?"—he said "From Mr. Pugin"—he told me that Mr. Pugin was my agent—I immediately wrote down to Mr. Pugin and said "I am astounded at what has happened, the builder has been to me with a bond for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he tells me you have given on my part"—Mr. Pugin wrote to me by the same date, and I believe before he had my letter, "Hodgson has applied to me for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I have had no choice but. to pay 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it"—Mr. Hodgson writes to me declaring that he had not paid him a farthing of that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have Mr. Pugin's letter stating that he had given this bond—the three letters are in Court—I had no idea what the bond was for, I did not ask what it was for—it was a year and a half ago that I said to Mr. Wallis I had evidence which Mr. Field was of opinion was sufficient to send Mr. Pugin to prison—I am not aware that I repeated that to other gentlemen—I know Mr. De Beauville—I did not tell him at another time and in another place, that I had evidence that could send Mr. Pugin to prison—I don't remember that I said anything of the kind—I say no, I did not—I did not use language to him to the effect that I had evidence that could bring him within the criminal law; I undertake to say that I did not—it is a year and a half ago that I had the conversa<lb/>tion</p>

Have I. to go further than this year's Exhibition at the Royal Academy? Go look on those walls. Go, behold the daubs of yourself and your son, placed on the line, to the exclusion of talent and honest efforts. Reflect on the number of men your injustice must have driven to despair. Why, I am told that even your fellow hangers shuddered with disgust at your imperturbable impudence. Will you deny this? You may do so, for you will do anything. But, on the other hand, I will tell you that it is the last time that you will have the opportunity of so thoroughly disgracing yourself, or of insulting the nation. It may seem hard to say it to a father that a picture which bears his son's name, and that is on the line, is not only the worst picture in the Exhibition, but is the worst picture ever publicly exhibited. I observe on the frame the mystic star denoting that it has been disposed of. Excuse, I beg you, my doubting that it has found a purchaser, and forgive me for adding that, if such is the fact, the question which all beholders will ask themselves will be whether the picture or the purchaser has been the most sold.—E. Welby Pugin. Mr. J. Rogers Herbert. I. P. S.—I will add this letter to the collection which will shortly appear. 2 P.S.—The whole of my nieces will be in Court to confront their detractor, and to tell you that you are a liar and a perjurer to your face.

Believe me, Sir, that is utterly impossible; for not even among the worst criminals would it be possible to find another man who had sunk to your depth of degradation. No doubt you have done your utmost by your slanders, your plea of fraud, and your libels, to induce others to join you in your nefarious schemes; and bad as some may be, none can be found to sacrifice, as you have done, every sense of honour at the shrine of sordid aims.

I was on duty on" 27th August in Seymour Street, Somers Town—I saw the prosecutrix there and the two prisoners—I came up the corner of Chapel Street, and heard the prose<lb/>cutrix say "As soon as I see a police-constable I will give you in custody"—I went and asked what was the matter—she said "I give these two in your custody for knocking me down and robbing me of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "How did they knock you down?"—she said "The male prisoner struck me in the chest"—there was mud on the back of her waterproof—I told them they would have to come to the station along with me—the prosecutrix was sober, but very much excited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I searched them, and found 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Batcher, and I was found on Clarke by the female searcher after we got to the station—a third party, a woman, was between 500 and 600 yards away, and the money might have been passed—I saw nothing of the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clarke's Defence.</hi> On 26th August I met the prosecutrix. We have walked the streets together and shared our money together. She sent word to me that she was sorry to place me in this position, and knew I knew nothing about it. I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take her mother brandy and grapes in the Hospital, and I have been living with her some time and she is a prostitute. I cannot say why she gave me into custody. We had been drinking from 9.30 till 12 at the George public-house; I spent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with her there. She was drinking with a man who keeps a coffee-house, a brothel keeper. I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and spent it with her, and she denied having a halfpenny in her pocket. She treats me and I treat her; in fact, we never leave one another. I stopped a fortnight with her, three weeks before she gave me into custody. She has been convicted several times; six months for stealing,' and two years for robbing a woman of her shawl, and some time previous to my being taken into custody she was to be apprehended for beating another woman, and even her mother has been convicted of felony. It is nothing but malice her doing this. Is it likely I should call a youth and ask him to pick her pocket. She was intoxicated, and he pushed her and she fell down.</p>

I am House Surgeon at the University Hospital—John Gregory was brought there on 11th August—I did not see him at that time—I took charge of the wards on the 17th—he had a contused wound on the outer side of the left knee, and a great deal of brusing, with profuse suppuration of the leg; and I had to make two incisions to allow the escape of pus—he had congestion of both bases of his lungs, and we found upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that he had fatty degeneration of the heart and gangrene—I think the cause of death was some injury he had received to the left leg—I think a younger man, with a sounder constitution, would have recovered.</p>

She was only a four year old mare, and gets hold of the bit; she was in the habit of stopping at a place, and has not been properly broken in.

I shall be twelve next March—I have been at St. Mary's School about six months—I have known Dabbs ever since I have been there—I was in the same class with him—on this day I was sitting next the wall, and there were three or four boys between me and Dabbs—I remember Dabbs having a cut on his hand with the cane, from Howard—after that Howard came to examine the copy books, and he hit Dabbs across the left side of his head with his left fist—he bad nothing in his right hand.—Dabb went back against the wall, and his head went just under the rail</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210044"/>
               <p>and struck against the wall—Howard then went on looking at the other boys' copies, and then went in front of the class—he has no desk, he stands there—Dabbs kept against the wall about five or ten minutes—he sat down, and when he went back to his place, Howard called out that he was to go more towards the right, to close up, and he did so, and that made two classes into one—Dabbs then put up his hand to go out; that was five minutes after the blow; and the second time he did so Howard asked him what was the matter—he said that he felt ill—I did not hear Howard tell him to go to the street door—he told him to go to the yard, and he did so; that was about 11.30—he was sick on the stairs before he went into the yard; and at 12.30, when I went out of school, I saw him on a bus in the yard, and he seemed very ill and white—he had never come back into the schoolroom—the prisoner did not send to inquire after him that I know of—it is a rule that before we break up at 12.30, every boy shall be in his place in the class, but Howard did not send out for Dabbs to take his place in the class before breaking up—before I saw Dabbs on the box in the yard, I saw him in the closet—I left him on the box, and went straight home at about 12.35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard Dabbs complain many times of headaches—he looked very white when he complained—when he was playing he often got tired, and had to leave off; he felt giddy, and then he would look white and complain of his head—I said before the Magistrate "He fell back gently, and not with force."</p>

I am a master bricklayer—I was at work at the Holly Tree, which is a little over three-quarters of a mile from Leytonstone—between 2 and 3 o'clock I saw Stuart come out, and in consequence of something I heard I followed him, and saw King and Harris (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>) in a ditch about twenty or thirty yards from the house—they could see the house from where they were—I followed Stuart about a quarter of a mile towards Forest Gate—I afterwards returned towards the Holly Tree and met the other two walking together on the road towards Forest Gate—they were 200 or 300 yards behind Stuart—I fetched Mr. Heath who keeps the Holly Tree, and we went with a policeman after the prisoners towards Forest Gate—we came in sight of the three in about a quarter of an hour standing together in Upton Lane, West Ham—we did not go towards them—we went towards the Lodge Gate and as we did so King and Harris jumped the fence into the park—the constable secured King and I ran after Harris—Stuart was brought back by another constable—they were all taken in custody, and I afterwards went back to the place where I had seen them jump the fence and found thirteen florins and six half crowns, wrapped separately in tissue paper, some were in a bag and some outside—I handed them to the sergeant at the station—I have been to the spot with the constable since.</p>

I was in the prisoner's service on 27th August last at Church Street, Camberwell; it is a coffee and cook's shop—I had been in his service about five weeks—on the morning of the 27th I first saw my mistress a little before 10 o'clock—she came into the kitchen—she had on a light cotton dress and a bonnet and shawl, dressed to go out she did not remain in the kitchen many seconds, she went towards the shop to go out—I heard her cry out that she was stabbed; that was not many minutes after she had left the kitchen—the prisoner's sister was in the kitchen with me, she went in the direction the voice came from—I did not go—Mrs. Coppin ran out into the yard and I went out after her—the prisoner's sister was, with her before that—I did not see what she did—Mrs. Coppin had gone into the yard, and then I heard her cry that she was stabbed; the voice came from the yard—I and the sister were in the kitchen—the sister went into the shop to send some one for a doctor—I went to where Mrs. Coppin was—I found her in the yard—that was after I heard the scream—she told" me she was stabbed—I saw that she was bleeding—she went up stairs; she was able to walk up—I and the prisoner's sister went up with her—we put her on a sofa and partly undressed her—we could not undress her quite—I did not notice where the prisoner was at that time—he came up a few minutes afterwards—the deceased said she was sorry it was him, and that she had aggravated him to do it—the doctor was sent for and came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner always behaved with great kindness to his wife while I lived with them—they kept a coffee-shop and sold meat 'pies—he used to get up about 5 o'clock in the morning—it was her duty to make the paste for the pies—on this morning she did not get up, and he was left without anyone to make the paste—it was his habit every morning to out the meat for the pies—it was a very short time between the time she came down and the time I heard the scream, not so long as you have been talking to me—she would have to go through the kitchen into the shop to go out of the house—the prisoner was cutting up the meat in the kitchen—on coming down stairs to go out, she would have to pass through the kitchen where he was engaged with the knife cutting up the meat—I don't know what made her go into the yard; she ran right through the kitchen into the yard—that was after she was stabbed—she was stabbed at the bottom of the stairs before she came into the kitchen—I saw her run through, and I went after her—I heard the scream, and that brought me to where she was—I first saw her in the kitchen after hearing the screams—it is a very short distance from the kitchen to the foot of the stairs, 2 or 3 yards—I did not notice where the prisoner was, at the time I saw her—I saw him soon after, about ten minutes after—he came up stairs—he appeared to be terribly distressed at seeing her bleeding—he called for brandy and kissed her—I did not hear him call out for somebody to go for a doctor—his sister sent for the doctor—she came up immediately.</p>

I am a butcher, and live at 38, Church Street Cam<lb/>berwell—I know the prisoner—on 27th August, a little before 10 o'clock, he came over and asked me if I could lend him a knife, as he had broken his own—I lent him the one produced—he asked me to touch it up, he said he wanted it to cut bread and butter—I sharpened it and gave it to him—he was in the habit of buying meat from me—I did not notice any difference in his manner at the time, he might have been a little excited, that was all.</p>

I could not recollect what <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> I checked on 22nd July, and that applies to every day—I distinguish the <hi rend="italic">busses</hi> by the letters, I mean by the letters P.

(<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out</hi>), the 5 has not been written over some thing, that I am quite sure of—the "Oh" at the end of the word "Borough" has not been touched up with a pencil afterwards after the other letters had been written; that is where I wetted my pencil, as it marked dull.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective P</hi>). On the night of 3rd August, I was with Nash in the Station Road, Newington, about 9.30, and saw the prisoner standing outside the Elephant and Castle Railway Bar Tavern—he said "Good evening"—I said "Good evening."—he-said "I was just looking after a policeman, we want to get a prostitute from this room"—I said "All right"—he went into a little room, I followed him, and saw a female sitting quietly at one of the tables with a small glass in front of her—he said "This is her," or "Now, will you come out"—an old gentleman (the deceased) was sitting behind her—it is a wide seat serving for two tables—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210062"/>
               <p>two young men were sitting at the other side of the table and one other female—the prisoner caught hold of the first woman's hand when he spoke, and she said that she would go out as soon as she had drank her wine—he then caught hold of her arm—she had the glass in her hand—he pulled her out of the seat, caught hold of her hand and smashed the glass up in it—he then swung her round in his arms, carried her to the door and dropped her on her legs on the pavement—they are folding doors and she caught hold of them, but I loosed her hand—I then stepped outside and said to her "Now you had better go away, if you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> locked up it will be serious"—I had not said the words half-a-minute when I heard a rustling in the little passage which leads into the room—the folding doors are the outside doors into the street, they have embossed glass half way down, and one of them was half way open—I looked through them and saw the prisoner with his arms round the old gentleman who I had seen sitting on the seat, and saw him swing him round to the folding doors, and shove him very violently, and he came out backwards with his head about two feet from where I was standing—his head fell about two feet from my feet, right on the pavement and it went off in a crack like a cocoa-nut, you could hear it at some distance—I stood and looked at him for a moment; I went to his left side, but could not see that he fetched any breath—I then felt for his pulse, but found he had only a wooden stump for his left arm—I raised his head up on my knees but could not find that he breathed—my brother officer and I then <hi rend="italic">slewed</hi> him round with his back to the house, and sent for a doctor—we got a glass of water and a chair from the house, and while bathing his head I saw blood running from his left ear—Dr. Hogg came and examined him and sent him to the hospital—he was then insensible all the time—I stayed at the hospital till 11.40 or 11.45 and saw the contents of his stomach pumped off—the women were both sitting quietly in the public-house when I went in—I did not notice that either of them was in an indecent position or had her dress disordered—when I got back from the hospital, the prisoner was just closing his house—he said "Stop a minute, I want to speak to you"—I said "I have taken that gentleman to the hospital, he is senseless and has not spoken since"—he said "It is a bad job."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said that he was very sorry for it—this is a ground plan of the premises—Mrs. Smith sat by the deceased's side, and Argent is the woman who was sitting at the other table side by side with him, and who was turned out—(<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out the potions on the plan</hi>)—the house is in front of the railway station, and the doors in question are just opposite the booking-office—this photograph shows both the doors pulled back, the counter is then shown to anybody standing on the pavement—these doors are, I dare say, about 2 feet 6 inches each, and the doorway would then be 5 feet wide—I should say that the distance from the cill of the door on the foot pavement to the counter is 3 feet 11 inches, within an inch 'or so—the door which swings back against the passage was open, and the front door being closed you could pass with facility to the sitting-room—the doors give inwards, not outwards—the left hand door was open, and you might then hardly pass into the sitting-room, there would not be much room—this other photograph represent the doors when they are closed—the sill at the threshold of the door is three-quarters of an inch above the flooring of the bar, and I would not say that it is not an inch—to get out of the house persons have to raise their steps to get over this little sill—the pavement</p>

I am the wife of William Smith, a carpenter, of 27, Edward's Place, Aldersgate Street—on the evening of 3rd August, I met the old man who is now dead, outside the public-house—I had seen him before at Chichester Market as a cattle dealer—he invited me to have something to drink and we went into this' public-house—nobody was there then but ourselves—two glasses of wine were ordered, and we remained there fifteen or twenty minutes—I then went out, leaving the deceased in the waiting-room—no impropriety took place between us and no complaint was made by the barmaid or the prisoner of any immorality, nobody spoke to me—I saw Argent outside the public-house, something passed between us—I went back into the waiting room and she followed me—two young men were there then, sitting at a table, and Argent went and sat at the same table Argent and I and the deceased had three glasses of wine between us—a young woman who was called for the prisoner at the police court, served us and Argent paid for the whole—she was the young woman who had served us at first—she made no complaint—about five minutes after the three glasses were brought, the prisoner came into the waiting-room and told Mrs. Argent to go out, as he did not want prostitutes in the house—she said "I will as soon as I have drank my wine"—the prisoner then took' hold of her and pulled her out of her seat and broke the glass in her hand—he did not say anything, he lifted her out very roughly to the door—she had made no disturbance and had only been in a minute or two—as the prisoner came back, to the parlour the deceased and I were going towards the door and the deceased said "I suppose you would serve me the same if you thought you could"—the deceased had a wooden left arm—I went on and went out at the outer door, and after I got out I heard a scuffle and saw the prisoner into he passage with his arms round the old gentleman, trying to force him out very violently—he had got his wooden arm in his pocket at that time—the prisoner pushed him out at the front door, and he came down on the back of his head on the pavement very heavily indeed—Nash and Berry, who</p>

I told the Magistrate that the prisoner had his arms round the deceased—he was a very stout man—I am not separated from my husband, but he is in Millbank Prison for deserting his regiment—I was in the New Kent Road, about 100 yards from this public-house when the deceased came up, and he spoke to me first—I had seen him at Chichester about six years ago, but did not know his name, I only knew him as a cattle dealer—he said "I have seen your face before," and I said "Not in London, it must have been in Chichester," and he said "In the market"—I had started for a walk with Argent at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but was not with her long, because she left me about 8 o'clock; we walked together from Aldersgate to the Elephant and Castle—we were in the public streets all that time—I think we went into two public-houses—I did not perceive that the deceased had too much to drink—I sat at the furthest table from the waiting-room—I know the counter from which we were supplied with the sherry—I did not unfasten the bosom of my dress while I was sitting at that table, nor did I take the old gentleman's hand and put it into my bosom—I did not go out with the intention of finding Argent—before I left, the deceased gave me a shilling to pay for the wine—I did say before the Magistrate "When I went out to look for Argent I met her"—that was a mistake; I did not go out to look for her, but I met her in the same street, and told her I was at that public-house with a friend—she said that she would be in in a minute, and she came in about a minute after me, and the deceased said to her "This little girl I knew at Chichester," and she directly sat down with her back to us—I did not" see the prisoner's wife or the barmaid call him, and nothing was said to the deceased in my presence about behaving improperly—I was absent from him five minutes—it is true that the prisoner asked Argent two or three times to go out, before Beny came in—I don't think I told the Magistrate that he was about five minutes asking her to go out—I did say "I did not see him put her out," and to-day I say that he carried her out—I have no explanation to offer of that—I was standing up; I had passed the doorway of the waiting room, and the deceased followed me; my back was to him—I did not hear a voice say "Take care, Mr. Brisco's head will be pushed through the glass"—I did not pay attention to what was said—I did not hear any one say that they would smash his b——y nose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Argent, a printer, of Edmund's Place, Aldersgate—on the-evening of 3rd August. I went alone to the bar of the Railway public-house by the Elephant and Castle—Mr. Massey was there and Mrs. Smith—I went to the bar, called for a glass of sherry, and sat down—I had not sat there three or four minutes before the prisoner came in and said "How dare you be here? you are a prostitute"—I said "How dare you say that to me? you had better mind what you are saying"—he said "Well, go out"—I said "I will, certainly, when I have drank my wine, but not before"—he went to the door, came back with Mr. Berry, and then said "Now, will you go?"—I said "Yes, when I have drank my wine"—there had not been the slightest impropriety; I had done nothing and had seen nothing done—I took up my glass to drink my wine, and he seized my arm and smashed the glass in my hand, and threw me out in the street—of course, I tried to prevent it, but I could not—I then turned to Mr. Berry, and said "Sir, you see the way in which he has served me, and I am neither drunk nor insulting"—I had hardly got the words out of my mouth, when I turned round and saw the prisoner with the deceased—I was between three and four yards from the door—they were struggling, but the deceased could not do much because he had only one arm; the prisoner had his arms round him, and the barman, I think it was, just opened the doors for him—perhaps nobody else saw the barman, but I did—he only opened one door, the left-hand door as you come out of the little waiting-room; the outer door—as they came out they faced each other—the prisoner seemed to have turned him round, he seemed to then push him with two hands, and he fell and lay there three-quarters of an hour—Mrs. Smith bathed his face, and Mr. Berry held his head—a little blood came from his ear—the prisoner did not come out—I said "You cowardly villain, look what you have done"—I can't say exactly what I said, but I called him a coward—he did not say anything, but went back into the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the Magistrate that I did not leave home till 4 o'clock—my husband lives with me—he was not out with me, he was at work—I have been drinking at the bar of this public-house six or seven times—I have friends in the neighbourhood—I have lived in the neighbourhood and often go there—I may have been in the house half a dozen times with Mrs. Smith during the last month and with other friends—I left Mrs. Smith at 8.30 and met her again at 8.45—I have not said "I met Mrs. Smith first at 8.30," they have it quite wrong; I said that I was at the Elephant and Castle at 8.30—I did not notice that it was wrong when it Was read over to me—I told the Magistrate I had gone down there simply for a walk—I told the Magistrate that I was married at St. George's Church—I did not say what St. George's—I left the gentleman to put that himself—I will not answer where I was married—I am not married at all—the prisoner did not tell me to go away or I should get into trouble—the deceased's hand was on the bar to prevent his being thrown out, and the barman moved it—I was looking through the embossed glass—I was not at fill excited when I was put out, but I called him a villain after he had thrown the old gentleman out—I saw the chair sent for, some minutes after the deceased had lain on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I was House Surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on the night of 3rd August Charles Maffey was brought there insensible—his age appeared to be 53 or 54—he was a very heavy man, about 18 stone—the house physician saw him first, there was a history about his being in a public-house, and it was considered that he was drunk, but when they pumped his stomach and found there was not much alcohol they sent for me and I examined the back of his head and found a very serious bruise—I thought the insensibility was due to that, and so I took him in—he continued under my treatment till he died on 12th August—he had never recovered his sensibility, he used to ramble in his talk—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination on the afternoon of the 12th and found the brain very much bruised and partly lacesrated, and in the centre of the brain there was a</p>

               <p>sat down by the man's side and Argent sat on the same seat, with her back to him, or rather sideways—I noticed them speak together—when Argent came in a glass of wine' was called for, and then three more glasses of wine—I then saw the deceased's hand under the table rubbing the woman Smith about, and I could see that there was some indecency going on under the table—I shook my head and said "That is not allowed"—I went away and waited to call Mrs. Briscoe's attention to it, but she was up dress<lb/>ing—she came into the bar in about seven minutes when I was serving. Somebody—she then came to me and said "Do you see what is going on?'—I said "That is what I want to speak to you about"—I made a complaint to her, and she fetched her husband from the other side of the bar—he went to them and said "Here, you are not going on in that way; you know you are not allowed to go on in that way in this room"—he requested them all three to go out several times—he said "I wish you to leave this room"—I heard Argent say "I shan't"—she also said "You dare not," or "You can't"—Mr. Briscoe then went to the door and fetched in the detective Berry—he then took hold of the woman by her shoulders and led her towards the door—she resisted and was very abusive, so he lifted her up and put her outside the door—she had had ample time to go out before Berry came in, and afterwards too—Mr. Briscoe then turned round to go into the room again, and the man and woman had risen and were standing between the fireplace and the door—he tried to persuade them to go out quietly, but the deceased said "I suppose you will try to serve me the same"—he said "I wish to do nothing of the sort, I wish you to leave my house quietly"—the deceased said "If you press me I will smash your b——y nose," and backed a little towards the door which leads out of the waiting-room, which is generally kept open—he then turned round, and somehow he got into the lobby where Mr. Briscoe was—he was still abusing Mr. Briscoe, and repeated twice that he would smash his nose—the two folding doors were open—the man was nearest to the waiting-room, and Mr. Briscoe was nearest to the door which was open—he had his back against the glass door, which was open—both the glass doors into the street were open—there was sufficient room for a person to pass through because it swings a little—one was on the strap and the furthest from the room was bolted back—the left one as you go in is kept on the leather, and the other swings if the bolt is up, but both doors were open wide—when Mr. Briscoe was in the lobby I saw the man pushing him, and I called out two or three times "Mind, Mr. Briscoe's head will go through the glass"—he was the nearest to the door which was furthest from the waiting-room—the deceased got hold of him and was trying to struggle, and I said "Mind Mr. Briscoe's head, for heaven's sake, will go through the glass"—Mr. Briscoe then put his hand on the man's coat and I saw the mango backwards—when he was falling I saw his feet inside the sill of the door—Mr. Briscoe never had him round the body with both arms from first to last, nor did he strike or push him in any way: had he done so I must have seen it—he had not put his hand on the deceased till the deceased laid" hold of him in front with one hand—there was no unbolting of the door by my husband: that is not true—he was behind them in the waiting-room near the fireplace—he could not have touched the door without my seeing him—when Mr. Briscoe found that the man was insensible, he gave directions that everything that could be done should be done, and I went out and bo did my husband, and a chair was taken in and come water—he asked my husband to go and see what could be done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, of South Street, West Square—on the Bank holiday night I was outside the Railway public-house, and saw the short woman come out first by herself, and Berry walk across the road talking to her, and he was talking to her against the railway door on the opposite side of the street, about ten yards off—I was about two yards from the door of the public-house, and heard high words passing inside the room, I could not distinctly understand what they were—I saw a big man coming from the waiting room, backing himself out, and,' as he did so, his heels caught the raised step and he fell with his head on the gravel and tar pavement——it is not true that the prisoner put his arms round him and threw him out, because I was close to him—I picked him up and took him to the hospital.</p>

I am an ironmonger, of Vassal Road, North Brixton—I was in the Railway Bar on the Bank holiday—I did not know the prisoner before that—I was not in the waiting room, but in the refreshment bar, the lobby—I saw the woman put out—when I first saw the deceased he was standing with his back to me and his face to the sitting room—Briscoe was just inside—I heard some conversation, but could only hear the words "Turn me out"—that was from the deceased to Briscoe—it was only part of a sentence—the deceased began to walk back, and then I saw that Briscoe had his hands up to the front part of the deceased, who immediately took a step back, and he had no sooner done so than I could see that his heels caught against the sill; it was only the work of a second—Briscoe did not take the deceased round his body with either one or both arms.</p>
