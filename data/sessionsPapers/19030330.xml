                  </hi>. I live at 10, Graham Road, Chiswick, and am secretary to J. A. Preece and Sons, Limited—on November 14th 1902, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a secretary to syndicate, with a salary of £250—I answered, stating my qualifications—I received a reply requesting me to call at 11 Quenington Mansions—I called there; it appeared to be a private house; I saw the prisoner there; he said he was the principal of the Anglo-American Syndicate which he explained was for producing and managing stage plays—he, said he required a commercial manager for the syndicate: that he had been carrying on business for about three years in a similar capacity, and that his financial partner was the Duke of Rovigo—he did not give me his address then—he said that owing to the fact of my having to deal with the cash which would pass through the syndicate, he and his financial partner desired £250 cash security from me, to be deposited on account with the syndicate's bankers—he did not then say who the bankers were—I called on him again, and I asked him with regard to the financial standing of the syndicate—he explained that they had about £3,000 at the bank, and that their last venture, which had extended over about seven months, had yielded a net profit of over £3,600; that although my qualifications seemed likely, he could not give me a decision that day, as there were several other applicants, but that he would write again—I expressed my willingness to deposit the £250 with him—on December 2nd I received a letter from him enclosing a rough draft of the agreement, which, if satisfactory, I was to return to him and he would have it made out—I was appointed about November 24th by letter—when I received the draft I put it into shape and had it typed in duplicate—I said that I did not think I should be in a position to deposit the whole of the £250, so I paid £150, and agreed to pay the other £100 within twelve months—the agreement was signed afterwards—on December 8th when I took up my duties I asked the prisoner to submit the syndicate's books to me; he made various excuses, saying that the cash book was in the auditor's hands, and that he could not obtain it for a few days: that was before I signed the contract—I saw this cash book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on the day before I signed—it appeared to be in proper order; it was supposed</p>

               <p>be audited in red ink and signed—on December 18th I signed this agree<lb/>ment (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it appears to be signed "Rovigo" and by myself and the prisoner; "Rovigo" was there when I signed, but the Duke "as not present at the time—the prisoner signed it in my presence, and was also witnessed in my presence—when I signed it I believed the signature "Rovigo" to be that of the Duke of Rovigo—I had parted with the money at the time I signed; I paid it on December 18th, partly cheque and partly in money—I then believed that the "Duke of Rovigo as a sleeping partner, that the syndicate had £3,000 at the bank, id that the cash book was a genuine one—I received a letter from the prisoner dated December 13th, saying that the Duke was fairly mad with him for not having had the agreement signed, and that the Duke id signed it that night—on Sunday, December 21st, I went to East<lb/>bourne to join the syndicate's company which was to appear there—I saw prisoner there—I heard some rumours—I communicated with the bank on December 22nd, requesting information as to what had been done with my cheque and money; I received a reply, and in consequence railed the prisoner into my room and asked him what he had done with money; he replied, "It is all right, it is at the bank"—I replied, have information to the contrary, I have a telegram from the bank; have paid my money to your personal account"—after some excuses stated that that was so, but that he could repay me—I said, "Whose nature is that on the contract, is the Duke of Rovigo really you partner?"—he said. "No'" and he asked me to save him for the sake of wife and mother—I did not charge him then—he said he would repay—I left him towards the end of the month, but about January 19th ailed at the police station where I found him in custody on another charge—I then charged him.</p>

I am clerk to Lusby and Co., of 22, Minories, manufacturers of cigars and cigarettes—on March 7th, Stillwell, who I knew, showed me this order, "Supply bearer with 500 Garcia Barita cigars"—our firm knew the writer as a customer, but, as we had not got those particular cigars, I told Stillwell that we had only get Garcia Seletos—he said, "I will take 500 of those," and signed this receipt and went away—he returned that day and said, "Will you let us return this 500, and have these, pointing to the list, as I have an order from the Carlton Club"—I gave them to him, and he said, "I will keep the others 500 in stock," so that he had over 1,000 cigars, price £18—he signed exhibit D for the second lot—I saw the prisoner Stillwell alone four or five days afterwards, and have not the least doubt he is the man.</p>

If you and your friend wish to deal it must be all settled to-morrow," and so on—I saw him on the 21st at his office—I told him I had a friend who was going abroad the following Saturday, who would deal in these securities—he said, "Get him to stop for another week, as he can do a very big business to the extent of thousands of pounds worth of securities"—he gave me a further list in writing of securities which he had the control of—I returned it to him and he tore it up—I asked him to intro<lb/>duce me to his principal—he said that was impossible; he would not be identified in the matter for a thousand pounds—at that interview he a-asked me what money my friend had at his disposal, and I said he could always find £500 or £600—I asked him for a sample of the bonds to show my friend—he gave me one of the Mediterranean bonds No. 13,500—he said he could only part with it against cash or security, so I left a certificate for 100 £1 shares with him—I took the bond away and handed it to Inspector Phillips on the 21st—on the 23rd I got another letter from the prisoner also on the Grand Hotel paper, making an appoint<lb/>ment at Cannon Street Station, and stating that he had had a long interview with his people, and that £225 would be accepted for the ten bonds and the twenty-five, provided the matter was settled by 11.30—£225 had been agreed upon the previous afternoon—in answer to the letter I met him at Cannon Street Station—he said he had the eleven bonds with him, and also some other bonds—he wanted the matter settled at once, otherwise the business would be off, his people had other channels for disposing of them—I told him I would meet him at his office at 11.30 and bring the £60, the first amount—I met him at his office—he asked me whether my friend was ready to complete the deal—I said, "Yes"—he asked me where he banked—I told him—he said that would be the best place, to meet him at the bank and to settle there—we went into the bank—Inspector Phillips was near by—the prisoner said, "Where is your friend, I have the bonds here with me"—and he placed them on the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was introduced to prisoner by a mutual friend for the purpose of discounting a bill for £5,000—I had never dealt in foreign bonds before—the prisoner told me they were gilt-edged securities and I could deal in them—he shortly after told me there was" opposition,' that is, they appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin Official des Oppositions</hi>, so I said I could not in that case deal in them—he asked me whether I could not get a friend to do so without <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to a bank, so I took the matter up again—I am an undischarged bankrupt.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) On March 9th, shortly before noon, I was with Detective-Sergeant Lyon in Upper Thames Street, and saw the prisoner Goldby come out of 205, Upper Thames Street, Messrs. Skilbeck's the drysalters, carrying a parcel—we followed him to an oilshop, 5, Huggin Lane, a short distance from Messrs. Skilbeck's—I believe the name of F. Foster was over the door—Goldby came out and went back to Messrs. Skilbeck's—we watched the premises, and at 6 o'clock Goldby came out with this large parcel (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I followed him over Southwark Bridge—another man joined him at the north end of Southwark Bridge, and then left him—Goldby carried the parcel on his back—when he got over the bridge he went to 2, Chatham Street, an oil shop with the name of Foster over the door—he went in and handed the parcel to a woman, who I now know as Mrs. Foster—he exchanged a few words with her which I did not hear, and then left the shop—I followed him down Chatham Street, and when he got almost to the bottom I took him in custody—we met Sergeant Lyon, and we three went back to 2, Chatham Street—the prisoner Foster was standing outside the door—Sergeant Lyon asked him for the parcel which had just been left there—I do not remember his reply, but Mrs. Foster produced the parcel—I took Goldby in custody—both prisoners were taken to the same station separately—Goldby made a statement to me going to the station.</p>

Skilbeck's, he had a largish parcel—he went to 5, Huggin Lane, remained a few minutes, and then came out without <hi rend="italic">it</hi>—I went away—I saw Lawrence in the New Kent Road about 6.30—he went to 2, Chatham Street—Foster was outside the premises—I said to him, "We are police officers, I want to speak to you"—I brought Goldby into the shop and then said to Foster. "I want the return of the parcel this man left here about a quarter of an hour ago"—he said. "He left no parcel here"—I said, "Yes, he did, he is here to speak for himself"—he then said something to his wife which I could not hear and she went into the kitchen and brought out this parcel—I told him</p>

               <p>to consider himself in custody for receiving, as we were going to search the place—he made no reply—he accompanied us to the cellar as I proposed, and found several parcels similar to this, and we opened them and found they were similar parcels of glue—this wax was also found in the cellar—one parcel weighed about 40 lbs.—going to the station Foster said to me, "Don't make it too hard for me, I will see that you are properly recompensed when it is all over," that was before we got into the cab—he was then taken in a cab to the station and charged before the Inspector, with stealing and receiving—about 10 cwt. Of property was brought to the station in a van and placed in the charge room, and I said to Foster, "I brought all this from your place, is there anything which you can account for?"—he said, "You have done quite right, I don't think you have left much"—there was also some ultra<lb/>marine blue and two boxes of shellac, of which this is a specimen (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Messrs. Skilbeck's clerk saw them the next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is not one of these things which I should not expect to find in an oil and colourman's shop—I heard Lawrence say at the police Court that Foster said that his wife took the parcel—Foster did not seem flurried or excited—I believe stolen property has been found at his house before—he has been in that line eighteen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Skilbeck Brothers, drysalters—Goldby has been in their employ about twenty-eight years as working porter at 27s. a week—Messrs. Skilbeck deal in glue—this parcel of glue weighs about 28 lbs., it may weigh 40 lbs., and then if it was sold it would be worth 10s.—Goldby had no authority to take any glue out of the premises—on March 10th I saw the goods at the station, and some beeswax which had been taken from our stock—here is another piece of beeswax, which is of a very special character, and I identify it—and here is another parcel which I can positively identify as having been taken out of our stock—here is some shellac—the value of what is our property is from £18 to £20—none of these goods were ever sent to Mr. Foster—he had two or three transactions only with us, but we never sent him these goods—I cannot say how this £18 worth of goods left our premises, but we ascertained on our stocktaking that there was a deficiency which we could not account for—I cannot say about bees<lb/>wax, but there was a deficiency in ultramarine blue, which is worth about 8d. or 9d. lb.—that deficiency has arisen since January 1st this year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I identify this beeswax by the initials stamped on each bar, and as far as I know we are the only people who deal with that kind—shellac is very common—all these materials are commonly used.</p>

I know nothing at all about it"—Henry said, "You have made a mistake"—I remained in the shop and about 7.20 Hatton came in carrying this parcel exactly as it is now—Henry said to him. "Do you want to leave that till the morning?"—Hatton said "Yes." handing him the parcel, which he put on the chair behind the counter, and then made a motion with his right hand as if meaning Hatton should go out of the shop—Hatton then left the shop, and I said to the two prisoners "Who is that man?"—they both replied, "I do not know"—I said, "Do you know where he is employed?"—they both said, "No"—I said, "Is it usual for you to take a parcel from a man you have never heard anything at all about?"—neither of them made any reply to that—I then went out of the shop and stopped Hatton in a court a short distance off, and took him back to the shop, and into the presence of the two other prisoners and asked his name and address—he said, "Francis Phillips, 78, Drummond Road, Bermondsey," which was false—I asked him where he was employed—he said, "I may as well tell you the truth, I stole the stuff from Sir W. A. Rose, where I work"—neither of the other prisoners said anything to that—I saw this parcel (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on a shelf in the shop—I asked the prisoners if they knew where it came from—they both said, "No"—I remained in the shop till 10 o'clock—Sergeant Lyon then came—I spoke to him, but I do not know if they heard—I told them they would be charged with stealing and receiving this colour—I do not think they made any reply—it is painters' colour, green—both parcels con<lb/>

                  </hi> I am the prisoner's wife—Kathleen O'Flaherty was in our service—she left about the middle of October—I saw her three or four times since—about February 20th, on a Friday I think, O'Flaherty and his daughter came and made a statement about some money that had come to Mr. Blakelock from South America—I told them 1 knew nothing about it, but would ask Mr. Blakelock about it when he returned—I gave them 10s., believing their statement—I spoke to Mr.</p>

               <p>Blakelock about it in the evening—I was upset because I had not been told at the tune—I asked him to give me the money—a few hours after<lb/>wards he gave it to the charwoman when I was out—the charwoman gave it to me directly I returned—that was on a Saturday—on Monday, 23rd I had—to go to Southampton—on my way I saw Michael O'Flaherty in Maida Yale—I got off an omnibus and went after him—I gave him a card, because I was afraid they would not let him go to my bedroom without my authority—I told him to go straight to the bedroom and look in the cupboard, where he would find the money—the card was addressed to the girl I had left in charge—I said it was in a corner of the cupboard—I said nothing about its being under the bed—I came back from "South<lb/>ampton late on Monday night, practically Tuesday morning—I was told the money could not be found—I rushed immediately up to my bedroom—I found it where I had left it, and where I had told O'Flaherty he would find it—I had kept it there ready for O'Flaherty when he came again—after waiting till Wednesday morning I gave my husband a letter to post it—Kathleen told me on one occasion that her father was in the workhouse—I think it was soon after Christmas, but I <hi rend="italic">'am not sure of</hi> the date—while Kathleen was in our service her father slept in our house eight or nine nights.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-cutter, of 21, Combos Road, Victoria Park—I have known Jaeger twenty years—on the 14th January I went to his shop, which is a very small boot repairing place, at 42, Duke Street, Aldgate, and told him I was out of employment and wanted a job—he said he could put a few shillings in my way, as he had a parcel of skins for sale, 156 dozens. 125 dozen of basils, 30 dozen of coloured moroccos, and one dozen of patent—basils are always of one light colour; they are used for the boot and shoe linings—this is a morocco skin which I had as a sample;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190303300051"/>
               <p>the officer showed it to me on February 21st—these are the pieces I carried about—Mr. Jaegar gave me these—I asked him where the goods were—he said they were in bond at Rotherhithe—I asked him to whom they belonged—he said to a French firm; that a French agent was in London, and not knowing much of our language, nor the buyers, Jaegar was going to sell them for him on commission—I asked his" terms, and the name I was to sell on; and it was settled that I was to take his card and sell the goods under the name of Jaeger—he said the French agent would invoice the basils to Jaeger at 10s. per dozen, and the morocco at 18s. a dozen, and the patents at 42s.—I said that the firms I did business with, as they wanted prompt cash, would require a discount—he then put 17£ per cent, on the invoices, which he arranged with me would be 5 per cent, for me, 5 per cent for him, and 2 1/2 per cent, for working expenses—he gave me as samples these two small pieces of the coloured moroccos on that morning, not of the other things—<hi rend="italic">this</hi> corresponds to the big skin—he never gave me any more—he mentioned on the 14th that he had a large parcel of bristles—I told him I did not think I could do much with them as they were not used in boot manufacturing much in modern times, but I would see what. I could do the next week—he said, "It is all right; they will be cheap; the price will be all right"—I said that I would see what I' could do the next week, when I saw what I did—he did not say where the bristles came from—he said he would give me the samples of the bristles next week—I went to Napper's on the 14th, and submitted samples, and in the evening I saw Jaeger at his shop again and told him Napper could not buy from those small pieces; he would want to see the sample skin—Jaeger said he had sold 100 dozen of the 125 dozen basils he had spoken to me about—he told me to call at his house, 43. Brunswick Street, Hackney Road, the next day for the five sample skins—I went. I did not see him, but his wife handed to me the five sample skins; this is one—there is very little of this leather in England; it is very little used in the shoe trade—I took the five skins to Napper's in Whitechapel Road, and left them there—I called on Jaeger again on the evening of the 16th and asked if he had had a communication from Napper in respect of the samples I had left, and he said he had had a letter with an order which he showed me, for five dozen—Jaeger said he was going to deliver them next morning, and he had no doubt he should be paid on Saturday, and if I would call round on Saturday he would pay me my commission—I called on Saturday, and he told me Napper required a reference, which all my people who I am con<lb/>nected with do—he said, "I have taken them the reference from the French agent, and it will be all right, but he won't pay me till Monday morning, because Messrs. Napper intend making inquiries—he said Napper promised to pay him on Monday, and he would pay me on Monday if I met him at 11—on Monday, 19th, I met him by appointment outside Napper's, and said, "Have you got the cheque?"—he said, "No"—I said. "How is that 1?"'—he said "Messrs. Napper want to make further inquiries before they pay"—I said, "What have you to fear about their making inquiries? I can wait till to-morrow for my commission"—as I was speaking to him outside the shop, a man, who I cannot identify, came up and spoke to</p>

               <p>Jaeger, and he hurriedly went away, tolling me to wait in the coffee shop next to St. Mary's station, and he would be back in a quarter of an hour—in a quarter of an hour he came back and showed me this business card of Charles Davis and Son. Commision Agents. 29, Bread Street. E.C.; on it was "Wm. Jaegers, Sir, I must have cheque by 1.30, or you must refund goods by 2 o'clock certain, C.D."—I said. "I cannot afford <hi rend="italic">to waste</hi> my time like this; I must go about my business, I have my living to get"—I went away and did not see Jaegers again till I saw him at Worship Street Police Court on February 23rd—I asked him why he did not leave the goods, what had he to fear, and wait till to-morrow—he said he had to do what the agent told him—Napper's is a respectable house, and I have done thousands of pounds of business with them.</p>

I am a leather merchant of 94, Whitechapel Road—Madeby called on January 14th. bringing three sample cuttings; these two are from the same kind of skins—I looked at them and said they were no good to us as they were not suitable to our trade, but looking at them again I picked out this dark colour and said, "I will send this round to my slipper maker and see if he will buy them"—I asked him who he was selling the skins for; he said Jaegers, whom I have known for some considerable time—I said that I could not judge from that sample, he must bring the whole skins—next day he brought this skin—in consequence of a communication with Phillips, my slipper cutter. I wrote a letter to Jaeger: this is a copy—(<hi rend="italic">Requesting Jaeger to send next day five dozen maroon morrocos as they had a customer, provided they were up to sample.</hi>)—on the 17th about thirty dozen were delivered—I saw Jaeger with the skins as they were being delivered; I did not notice the carman—they were brought on a cart and Jaeger was there—the five sample skins were left at my warehouse and taken away later, except the one left with the slipper maker—it is very unusual to deliver more than are ordered—there were five dozen of this sort and twenty<lb/>five dozen of various kinds—there happened to be in my warehouse at the time of delivery when Jaeger was there. Mr. Sceppa, a foreigner: he noticed certain marks on the skins, said something to me, and in consequence I called Jaeger into the counting house and said, "This gentleman from Paris recognises the manufacture of these skins, and Madeby has given me to understand that you are the agent for them"—I said, "The</p>

               <p>name of the manufacturer is Fernand Flocquet, and from the value Mr. Sceppa put on them they appear to me to be stolen, as you could not sell them at that price: the proper price would be about 49s. a dozen, and Madeby asked me 22s. 6d."—I said, "You must prove to me where you got those skins from"—he said, "Well, the fact of it is it is a foreigner in the City who has got the skins, and he cannot speak any English, and I am selling them for him"—I said, "That tale will not do for me; you must prove now where you got those goods, or take them away"—he went away and came back about three o'clock that day bringing this invoice, "London, January 10th, 1903, M.

                  </hi>. I am a leather merchant of 129, East Road, City Road—on a Thursday, last January, I was negotiating with a man named Davis, who is like Day he had no beard) for some basils—he said he had a great quantity at a wharf—I made an appointment with him for the next Saturday—he did not arrive, but on the Monday he called and told me he had to remove the things by order of the wharf authorities to his warehouse in Holloway, and had to take a temporary warehouse—I went with him to Annette Road, Holloway—I did not see if the place was locked up or open—I saw a young man there, whom I do not recog<lb/>nise—I went upstairs; you can call it a loft if you like, I call it a warehouse, a place where a lot of goods were stored—there was a quantity of leather,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190303300056"/>
               <p>a very large quantity of basils, like these, porcelain figures like these flower stands and cases—I saw nothing downstairs but empty cases—the young man went upstairs with me—he was English, I think; I heard him speak—I saw no horses downstairs, but it had the appearance of a stable, it had a rack and manger—the tipper part more resembled a. warehouse than a loft—I cannot say what the man I went with called the young man—I do not recognise the young man: he resembled Taylor—they both went upstairs with me—Day spoke to me—he said he had the crockery and leather for sale, that they came from France, and that he had a larger quantity than those at some railway arches, and had not had time to remove them, but he had to move them because he was afraid they would be taken away: they were not quite safe there—I looked over the basils—he said he had to sell them for a French firm—he did not tell me the name: I did not ask him—he wanted originally 10s. a dozen for them—they were in my line—I could almost judge by the weight that they were worth no more than Us., because basils are generally bought by the weight—I made an offer of 9s. 6d. a dozen—he said it was a very low price, but he agreed to take it—there were 137 dozen, I believe, that was what I made the offer for—I saw the figures—I am not in that line—I said, "I am rather interested in china, because I have collected china ever since I was a youth"—he said that they were antique—I said, "No, they are not; I can tell when I look at them that they are imitation '—he said he had a large quantity to sell—they did not further interest me—I did not look at the roans or moroccos; I saw none there—the bargain was agreed for the l."57 dozen basils, and they were delivered three or four hours after I was there—he told me he would deliver them as soon as he possibly could—when they were delivered 1 signed for them in a book—about an hour afterwards Day brought me this bill the addresses on it are 29 Bread Street, and 1 and 2, work<lb/>shop Road—I went to Annette Road, which is not on the bill I wrote, "Arthur Road, Holloway," on it at my place after he brought the invoice—I think he told me he had another place there besides—I only went to the stable in Annette Road—I forget why he came to give me another address, it is so long ago—he must have given me that other address saying that it was his private address; I cannot suggest anything else—I entered the transaction in my books, not the address—I looked up the address in Bread Street, City, and saw Charles Davis was there—I did not called there paid by a cheque and 1s. in money because I found after reckoning I had made a mistake—I saw him write the receipt at my place—I had never seen him before; he was recommended tome by Mrs. Smith, a business relation, whose card he brought—I cannot say her address by heart; I gave it to the police—she is in the leather trade, near Brick Lane—I have known her for years—Day came four days before the 12th, on the Thursday. Nth—I know Jaeger: he used to call two or three times a week—he called about—January 20th and showed me a morocco cutting of a dark claret colour, something like his—he told me he had 15 dozen of those skins for disposal for a French agent who had to meet a bill, and he was willing to let them go cheap—he did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190303300057"/>
               <p>not give mo his name—he asked first £1 a dozen, I think; I closed at 17s. a dozen, taking the whole 15 dozen—he said he was only getting a com<lb/>mission out of it, and the French agent had to meet a bill and wanted the money very particularly—he told me the skins and the transaction were thoroughly straightforward—I said, "Can I sell these goods to anyone without fear, by exposing them; is there anything wrong about them?—he said, "No, nothing whatever"—I had known Jaeger as a boot manufacturer—you cannot tell by seeing a part of a skin what the skin is: it was a different thing when I saw the whole one, I knew then what they were—when I saw them I found they were ordinary book-bind<lb/>ing moroccos, and then I went at once to my solicitors—they were delivered in Jaeger's absence—I paid him by cheque, dated January 20th, £12 15s., which has been paid—I did not see—the skins till four days after they were delivered—they did not want much examining to see they were book-binding morocco—there was no discount—I saw the skins were marked F. F. in a circle, and I knew it meant Fernand Flocquet, and I then packed the skins together, put them on a shelf and went down to my solicitors—on their advice I went to Jaeger and told him my solicitors had advised me to call on him, and that I had strong reasons to doubt that the goods were come by honestly and could never be sold at the price, that they were really book-binder's morocco, and I thought they were only common grained roans—he said he could not make it out, that he thought they were all right and he would do the best he could in the matter—he came next day after receiving my solicitor's letter, and said he was very sorry, but he would try and see his people and get me the money back for the goods, and he re-affirmed that the goods were according to his opinion as straightforward as anything he had ever bought—this is the receipt that was given when the goods were cleared away on January 20th—I have not seen any of the money back—I paid by cheque—I asked for it—three days after my solicitor wrote to Jaeger he came and told me he had tried to find his people and would try to get the, money back, but he did not take the goods then—the cheque is endorsed J. Jaeger, and was cashed the same day, 20th January—Jaeger also offered me some bristles, which were not in a leather merchant's or bootmaker's line—he said he had two or three cwt. for sale, and his people wanted to sell them cheap—I had nothing to do with them, they were not in my line, and he took them back and said he would not have anything to do with them—he showed a sample something like these—they arc not the kind shoemakers use, but a stronger kind—he left the box with me—I think he left that sample a day or two before I bought the 15 dozen skins—it might have been the day after, or a day or two before—he took the box back afterwards when I said I did not want them.</p>

If it was taken down by the Magis<lb/>trate that I said the bristles were shown me on January 21st, that is what I said—when I said I did not want them, he said he would not have anything more to do with them; they were not in his line—I had known him for fourteen years as selling leather to him—he is a bootmaker—I think when he came on January 20th and showed me this sample he came in the ordinary way of business to buy leather—he told me he had been trying to sell leather for some people, to Napper, and there was a difficulty about it and he thought he would not have anything to do with it—I did not say I thought it was a pity, I should like to have a look at it; it was all right—he said he had shown the leather to Napper, and they wanted to pick a few dozen out and he would not have that—he said he would not have anything more to do with it—I did not say, 1 "That will be all right; you let me have a deal"—he said he had offered the things to Napper, and Napper wanted to pick out five dozen, and he could only sell the bulk of it—I did not mean to say Jaeger said he could not have anything more to do with them—he began dealing with me after he said Napper had refused to buy the lot, and wanted to pick a few dozen out, but he could only sell the lot—he did not tell me Napper wanted to make enquiries about the goods, and his people would not wait for enquiries—I did not then suggest that I would buy the goods—he did not say, "I have sent it back to my people, but if you want it I might get it again and let you look at it"—when he gave me the invoice he said it was all right, and I could show it anywhere—when I said I had found out they were book-binding moroccos he said he thought they were imitation morocco—he said, "Now I know about them I will have no more to do with them"—one is imitation and the other natural grain—we buy them as roans or moroccos—this invoice describes roans.</p>

"You have made a great mistake, I never had any skins in my house: I have made a statement to the police at Bethnal Green, and told them all I know."—Hurcombe was with me, waiting outside</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190303300061"/>
               <p>—I said, "We have got a man outside who says that he took twenty-two or twenty-six dozen skins from Davis's stables at Annette Road to your house, and that you took them in"—he replied, "Well, he is a liar, I never had any skins in my house" '—Hurcombe was then brought in, and he said, "This is the man that took in the skins at 43, Brunswick Street" pointing to Jaeger—Jaeger said, "Well, I am sorry I have told lies about it, but the reason was I did not want to upset my wife"—I had left his wife at Brunswick Street—I said, "You had better come to the station and make another statement"—he had made a previous statement, (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 20) at Bethnal Green Station: I read it over to Jaeger before I took a statement (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 21) from him at Leman Street, and after I had seen him at the boot shop—after I read the last statement to him he said, "This is a relief to me; I have now told you all I know; this is the only transaction I have had with him and it will be the last"—(<hi rend="italic">The statements gave an account of the sale of the leather to Messrs. Napper, in which he alleged he had acted as agent for Charles Davis, and denied that he knew there was anything wrong</hi>)—on February 24th I went to Mr. Hochfeldt, and in consequence of what he said to me I went to Worship Street Police Court, where Jaeger was waiting to go as a witness to identify the other prisoners—I said to Jaeger, "I have been to Hochfeldt's this morning, and he gave me this receipt," showing it to him; "Mr. Hochfeldt said you sold him these skins and he paid you for them and afterwards made you take them away"—Jaeger said, "I don't know anything about it; I know Mr. Hochfeldt, but have never sold him anything in my life; I don't know how he got my bill head; it has nothing to do with me, I assure you"—I then sent for Mr. Hochfeldt, and he said to Jaeger, "You sold me the skins: why don't you tell the truth?"—Jaeger said, "Well, I did sell them for Davis; I don't know what has become of them; the reason I said I did not sell them was I did not want to draw Mr. Hochfeldt into the mess:'—on February 25th I got from Hochfeldt this cheque for £12 15s., and the receipt for the goods given by Jaeger when he took the goods away—I sent for Jaeger and his son, and they came to Leman Street Police Station, and I showed them the cheque and the receipt, and told him I had just received these two documents, and wanted to know what had become of the skins-Jaeger said, "They paid me the money, I gave it to Davis; I only got 12s. out of it; I received a letter from Mr. Hochfeldt's solicitor, telling me to take the skins away; I sent my son for them and I don't know what has become of them"—the son said in his father's presence, "Father sent me for the skins; I got them from Mr. Hochfeldt, and gave them to a man outside; I do not know the man; he had a barrow, and took them away: that is all I know about them"—on March 3rd I went to 43, Brunswick Street, and told Jaeger I was going to arrest him for being concerned with Day and others in receiving a large quantity of leather, stolen on December 18th last—he said, "I am surprised; this is a serious matter for me"—on the way to the station he said, "When Napper would not have anything to do with the skins, Davis asked me to try and find him another customer; I then sold a part of them to Hochfeldt and got the</p>

               <p>money for them; as you know I don't know what became of the others"—when he was charged with stealing all the property in the van he said, "You have charged me with stealing all the property; I know nothing about that; I only know I had dealings with fifteen dozen skins"—when we searched the stable on February 14th, we found none of the morocco except the two little pieces.</p>

Kenrick, of 48, Leinster Square, W.—we wrote to the reference and asked if we could safely trust Brome and Phillips for £50 or £100, and the following day received Exhibit 17 saying that we could—shortly after, Shakles called in and asked if we had decided to open an account; I said that as it was a trade account I should have to put it before the secretary, who was then absent from business for a time—he then referred to Miss Nix and said that we should find her an excellent customer, she having paid them about £300 or £400 for furnishing—a day or two after, Kenrick called in and asked if we had decided to open an account—I told him we had got no further, but if he would leave the matter in abeyance I would let him know—on January 11th, Kenrick and Shakles called in again and wanted to know if we had yet decided to open an account; I told them I had put the matter before the secretary, and that he could not see his way to opening an account at that time, but if they dealt for cash for some time we might then open an account—the carpet they ordered was paid for, 45s.</p>

Miss Nix is a perfect stranger to me, I do not know her any more than I do you, and any business we have done for her she has paid us for; the last cheque she paid us was on January 10th, on Parr's Bank, Earl's Court, for three guineas; I have not seen her for a month or more"—Shakles said, "What Kenrick has said is quite right; I have previously lived at 48, Leinster Square, Bayswater; I know nothing about Miss Nix except that I have done business with her the same as was said by Kenrick. I remember someone coming and asking me if Miss Nix was all right as regards about £6 worth, and I said 'Yes, I think she is, we have always found her all right.' I think he came from Swan and Edgar's, and when Mr. Kenrick came in I told him what I had said. Some days after we were thinking of buying a carpet, and I went to Swan and Edgar's and saw Mr. Emery," pointing to Mr. Emery," and he said, 'You gave us a reference for Miss Nix, is she all right?' and I said, 'She is all right as far as I know of her.' I have not seen Miss Nix since January 10th. when I called upon her for a cheque for three guineas, which she sent by post subsequently"—on Kenrick was found a banker's pass book, a postal order for 2s. 6d., a half crown, three shillings, and a memo.—Shakles had ten pawn tickets and 8£d. in money—when I found the pawntickets on Shakles he said he had bought them from a man in a public house in Earl's Court Road, with the exception of one for a case of carvers and fish slice, and one for a plated waiter and mustard pot—those articles, he said, were given him by Nix to pledge, and that she had also lent him a tea service and some plate—Sergeant West in the meantime had arrested Miss Nix—I conveyed the three prisoners to Vine Street in a cab, and on the way Shakles said, "Miss Nix always told me she had an income and would pay the money," and addressing Nix, said, "Is not that so?"; she replied, "I do not want anything said about my income."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant C</hi>). On January 31st at 2 p.m. I went to 56, Redcliffe Square, where I saw the female prisoner—I asked her if she was Miss Nix, the occupier of the house—she said she was Miss Nix, but that she was the caretaker—I then told her I held a warrant for her arrest, and read it to her—she replied, "I have not defrauded anyone, and I intended to pay: I have some money in the bank, but</p>

Spink and Sons, as part of the goods supplied by them to her—on January 29th I had followed Shakles from 99, Regent Street to 93, Finborough Road, and from there to 56, Redcliffe Square, where the door was opened by Nix—I took possession of two ledgers and a quantity of memoranda at 99, Regent Street—I have examined the ledgers, and there are no entries relating to house furnishing and decorating, or electric lighting installation—the majority of the entries are for 2s. 6d., commissions for letting apart<lb/>ments.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals—on February 19th, about 10.30 a.m., I went with the Sanitary Inspector to 79, Union Road, Borough, in consequence of certain information I received—it had the appearance of being an unoccupied house, the shop front was shuttered, also the double doors, and the door was locked and bolted—I rang the bell and Jaeger came to the door—I entered the premises and saw a number of dogs there, thirty-seven altogether, and all very valuable—it was the finest collection I have seen in anybody's private possession—they were all in a shocking state of neglect, disease, and starvation, and the smell was so offensive that I, was <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> for ten or twelve days after—in the front kitchen by the fireplace I noticed this dog—it was wearing a collar—I told Jaeger that they were very valuable dogs, and asked him what he did with them—he said that he sent them to Paris, and he produced a' letter to verify the statement—the same day about 2 o'clock I went to the house again with the veterinary surgeon—I pointed out each dog to him, and he carefully examined each for the purposes of the Society—the bulldog in Court was amongst them—two days later I went again to the house to see the condition of the dogs and I missed the brindled bull—I said to Jaeger, "What has become of the bulldog, I see it is gone?" he replied, "Yes, I have sold it; "I then said, "Where do you get these dogs from?" he said, "I bought some in Club Row, the dog fair, and some I buy at the Dogs' home"—I found several vouchers there relating to dogs purchased at the Dogs' home, but they were all of mongrel breed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190303300074"/>
               <p>none related to valuable dogs—I thought it my duty to obtain a warrant for Jaeger's arrest, and it was executed on February 23rd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Lee.</hi> I have had a large experience of bulldogs, but I do not pretend to be a judge—I am certain this is the dog I saw at Jaeger's premises—I did not notice then the twitching of the jaw, because it was kept in an underground kitchen and the light was very bad—as soon as I went into Jaeger's premises I knew I was in a dog stealer's den, and when I came out I gave information at the Borough Road Police Station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons—on February 19th about 2 p.m. I went with Chief Inspector Warr to 79, Union Road—I there saw a number of dogs, and amongst them this bulldog—it was wearing an ordinary brown collar with a few brass studs—I examined all the dogs.</p>

I did not notice the defect in the dog's jaw because it was more or less frantic, as were all the others—I did not say at the police court that the dog had lost all its teeth; I said that they were very much worn.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Constable.</hi>) On February 11th, about 5 p.m., Handley came into Bethnal Green Police Station and said to the prisoner that some roasting jacks had been found—the prisoner said, "I bought them in a sack over the counter for old brass, I did not look at them; I do not know the man whom I bought them from."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made this note about half an hour or an hour afterwards—I did not consult Handley about the note—he was to be called, but was at the North London Sessions—he is now engaged at the police court—the prisoner did not say that he had bought the skins of a Mrs. Durall, or of a woman, or of a party—he told me he bought them and the bristles of a man at the Barbican fire, whom he knew—type was found, which he said he bought of Allen and Foster—I was not asked that, but since I have made inquiry I have added it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a note of the statement at the time, and read it to the prisoner—I knew the importance of what he had said, and I said, "I want to be perfectly fair, Renvoize, this is what you say now"—I understood he was trying to assist the police to recover the property, or to give information as to how he became possessed of it—he sent me the four letters produced, which it would have been improper to answer—he was committed—he mentioned Mrs. Durall, who is now in custody, awaiting trial on several charges of receiving stolen property—he said he had received skins from her—the prisoner was informed that his letters had been received and would receive attention—he was not committed on another charge—no evidence was offered against him at this Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Eighty-three or eighty-four boxes of bristles were found—they formed part of the load stolen from Mory's carman on December 18th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he did not know the goods were stolen, and did not hide them; that the jacks when brought were said to have been bought at a sale, and a woman left the skins when he was busy, saying, "I have got something there might suit you;" that she did not call again, but after his remand he found out that her name was Durall.</hi>

I have ascertained that Keep was employed at Singer's five weeks before his arrest—I believe he has also been employed by a man named Upton, of 32, Fullerton Road, Wandsworth—I believe he discharged Keep simply because he could not keep him fully employed owing to the state of his business—he has also been serving in the Imperial Yeomanry, in Africa—he came home in October, 1901—until he left home for the front he was employed by a Mr. Medcalfe of High Street, Putney, who says that Keep was honest, steady and respectable—I believe he has also served in the mercantile marine, and was discharged from two ships with good characters—when I saw the prisoners they did not go into the public house and have a drink.</p>

March 8th to Connolly's house in the Peckham Park Road, to ask her if she knew anything about them—I knew that Mr. and Mrs. Taylor had been in the habit of visiting there—I did not know where the Taylors had gone and I asked Connolly if she had seen them—she said Mrs. Taylor had brought a can on which a penny had been paid, to take back to a public house, and that she had given Mrs. Taylor the penny, and was going to take the can back on the Monday—I found they had taken the door key and the key of the room away—I broke the room door open and saw that some things had gone, so I went to Mrs. Connolly again—she said I should find Mr. and Mrs. Taylor in the Crown public house in the Borough—I asked her if Mrs. Taylor had taken any things there to wash, and she said "Yes"; then she brought me this sheet and asked me if it was mine; I said "Yes"—I told her what I had lost—I then went to the police station at Peckham, and told them what was missing out of the room.</p>
