               <p>I went to Hobbs's with the last witness; I went in on the 28th, and Hobbs sat in a little room behind the shop, close to the fire; it is a sort of a green-grocer's and a little chandler's shop; I told him we were come to search the place for some livery clothes that were stolen; the prosecutor was with me.</p>
               <p>What answer did Hobbs make? - I cannot say particularly; the drawers were behind where he sat, and in those drawers I found the things which I now produce; the bed was in the same room.</p>
               <p>Did he make any objection to be searched? - No, I did not ask him for any objection; he said he had the things from the prisoner Giles.</p>
               <p>When you told him you was come to search for some livery clothes, what did he say? - I do not remember that he made any reply.</p>
               <p>Before you found the things, did Hobbs say any thing about them? - No, nothing, because it was after the things were found, that he said he had them from Giles.</p>
               <p>Are you clear in that? - I am quite clear. I went into the shop after the things were found, and I found this pocket-book which the prosecutor said was his; it is not mentioned in the indictment: I found one livery coat, one fustian coat, one fustian waistcoat, one striped flannel waistcoat, one pair of velveret breeches; these are all the things that I found; here is a coat that belongs to the witness Hemmings, that I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260005"/> also at Hobbs's; I did not take up the other prisoner, I know nothing of either of them before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There were several lodgers in Hobbs's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hobbs always persevered in the story that he received the things from Giles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you happen to know whether that room where the things was found, was occupied by Hobbs himself, or was let in lodgings to any body else? - My lord, there was a bed in it, and this man and his wife sat there together, and a child was there, but I do not know whose child it was.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. When you went first into the house of Hobbs, and told him what you came to search for, do you recollect whether he made any answer? - I do not recollect his making any reply; he looked rather astonished and surprised; he did not say whose the things were, till they were found.</p>

The watchman came immediately; I told him I had been robbed, and gave him a description of the men; he went with me to look for them, and two days after Griffiths was taken; I went to a public house in Middle-row, there were nine or ten people there; the watchman desired me to look round, and see if there was ever a person that I knew there, and I immediately picked out the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was a fine evening, it was directly under a lamp, and I saw his face distinctly, so much so, that I knew him the moment I saw him by day-light.</p>
               <p>How long might he be with you? - About three minutes; he was in front of me; I observed his face distinctly at the time.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether he is the man that robbed you, or not? - I have not a doubt; and when I first saw him, I did not wish to swear to him, if I could have got him to have given up my things, as it would be attended with so much inconvenience to me; I am come all the way from Carlisle now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Where was this place where it happened? - In Charlotte Buildings.</p>
               <p>Was that in your way home? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you perfectly sober at that time in the morning? - As perfectly as I am now.</p>
               <p>Have you always persevered in giving the same account of the knowledge of that man's person, that you have now given, on your oath? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>I should think, if you had been previously sworn as to that man, and did take your oath in the same manner in which you have now done, that you must be sure of it? - I have always persevered in the same story that I have now related, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How often was this man examined before the Justice? - Only once.</p>
               <p>Are you as sure that he was only examined once before the Justice, as you are sure of what you have now sworn? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Are you equally sure of one as the other? - I am perfectly sure that he was up there twice.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me, Sir, what was the reason, if you swore as positively at the first examination as now, that he was not committed the first time? - He was committed the first time I swore to him, fully committed.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it that you was first before the Justice? - That I cannot tell, I never paid any attention to it.</p>
               <p>Did you never point out another man to the watchman, and say that he was one of those that robbed you, which the watchman denied? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Was there no trying on of two hats before the Justice; - Yes; but I fixed on the man before, and said the hat he had on was not the hat he had on when he robbed me, and they went to his lodgings, and fetched the other.</p>
               <p>What was the reason, if you was so positive of him the first time you saw him, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260010"/> you should desire to see him with another hat? - I did not desire it.</p>
               <p>Was there no such thing as trying on different coats, that you might know him? - There was no such thing passed.</p>
               <p>What kind of watch did you lose? - A tortoiseshell case watch, a metal watch.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear at first, when you was robbed, that you was robbed of a gold watch, and not of a metal watch? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Were you but one time before the Justice, or more? - I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>Were you called twice to make oath of this circumstance before the Justice, or only once? - I was called twice, but did not swear positively to him the first time.</p>
               <p>How came it that you did not swear positively to him the first time? - The reason is, I wanted to get my watch and my papers; if he would have given me the papers, I would have given him the watch.</p>
               <p>Did you, the first time you was examined with respect to this man, know whether he was the man, or not? - Yes, I did; I never was asked positively whether I knew him or not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to swear, that upon the first examination you was not asked positively whether that was the man, or no? - Yes, I was asked whether he was the man, and I told the magistrate he was the man; and I told the Magistrate why I did not wish to swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Was not your reason for not swearing to him the first time before the Justice, that you did not chuse to do it till you had seen the watchman? - No, I did not wish to swear to him; I said before the Magistrate, I wish to see the watchman, to see if I could get my watch and papers again.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, before you saw the watchman, swear positively to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you or not, at the second examination, go any further than to say that you believed he was the man? - I swore positively that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this man searched in your presence? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his lodgings? - No, Sir, I did not; I never saw him before that night.</p>
               <p>Court. The reason why you was not desirous of swearing to this man, was the great inconvenience? - Yes; if I could have got my papers, I would not have prosecuted him at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; on the 22d of January, at a quarter past one in the morning, to the best of my knowledge, I was going my rounds, and going up a court, called Charlotte Buildings, I saw three men standing together against a wall; I said nothing to them, nor they to me, and I went through the court into Bell-court, Gray's-Inn-lane, and I heard somebody cry watch! watch!</p>
               <p>How long was it after you saw these men? - In as little time as I have been in court now, it was not two minutes; then I said, who calls watch, and I saw the prosecutor; he said he had just been robbed by three men of his watch and pocket-book; he described the men; I told him I had just passed them, I told him I knew one of them by name; I had seen the others before; the next day I went to the prosecutor, and we went up to Sir Sampson Wright's to give information, and in two days after the prisoner was taken; he was one of the three men that I saw; the prosecutor appeared at the Justice's, and made affidavit that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Was you at the first examination before the Justice? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor swear to the man then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness was not there the first time.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw the three men that were standing there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them, or not? - Yes, I am very clear he was; I knew him by sight before.</p>
               <p>Was he the man whose name you knew? - Yes; I knew his name, I have seen him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260011"/> in my beat a hundred and five hundred times; I have frequently called the prisoner up, when he lodged in Bell-court.</p>
               <p>How came you not to question these three men when you saw them there at that unseasonable hour in the morning? - I did not say any thing to them.</p>
               <p>Why not? - Because on a Saturday night people sit up very late.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it is a part of your duty, when you see two or three men in company, lurking together, to disperse them, and send them home? - Yes, we often do it; but it was Saturday night; there is a public house, called the Footman in Waiting, that is open very late, I thought they might come from there.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a watchman? - Between two and three years.</p>
               <p>I hope, if you continue, that you will learn to know that it is your duty to question all suspicious people, and if they give suspicious answers, to apprehend them. - I have been knocked down twenty times in my time.</p>
               <p>You must take care to have proper assistance; but it is your business to discharge your duty; if you are afraid, others must be got, who are not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When this happened, you told this gentleman that you knew the name of one of these three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it happen that this gentleman thought while he was with you that evening, that he saw one of the men that robbed him? - He said he should know them if he saw them again.</p>
               <p>Did not he say to you, pointing to some men that were going by, there goes one of the men? - I do not remember that, indeed.</p>
               <p>Were you at the apprehending of this man? - Not at the taking of him.</p>
               <p>Did the gentleman tell you what his watch was? - He said it was a valuable watch, and his pocket-book was a great loss to him.</p>
               <p>Did he say it was a gold watch? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did he or did he not say it was a gold watch? - I do not remember that he did; I believe he said it was a valuable watch, or something to that purpose; I was not by when the prisoner was searched.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been turned away from any parish where you have been a watchman? - I never was a watchman any where but where I am now.</p>
               <p>Do you know the name of the landlord of the public house in this court? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - I saw him in the yard.</p>
               <p>Who apprehended the p risoner? - One of the name of Meecham.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the Justice, that that person, who was one of the three, spoke to you? - The prisoner did speak to me that night; I saw him about an hour before; he said, how do you do, watchman? or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Were you there when the hats were fitted upon him? - No.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner at No. 6, Tennis-court, Holborn, at his lodgings; I searched his lodgings in the three-pair-of-stairs room, and I found nothing. The prisoner made his escape once out of the back window; I took him in the entry, without a coat.</p>
               <p>What hour? - Between twelve and one in the day, on Wednesday; he appeared to have been in bed, or shifting himself, his clothes were off; he had his breeches and stockings and shoes on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You do not know that he escaped, only what was told you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then why did you state it; did not he tell you he was the man you was looking for? - No, Sir, to my knowledge he did not.</p>
               <p>Do you swear he did not? - I do swear so.</p>
               <p>When he was taken to the alehouse, how many hats-were tried upon him? - I believe there might be two hats; the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260012"/> said he should know him with or without the hats; the two coats were found.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is only one examination returned, and that says that the prosecutor firmly and positively believes the man named Griffiths was the man that robbed him.</p>

               <p>Who did you find there? - There was a young man with five horses, he rode one of them, and led the other four.</p>
               <p>What fort of a horse did he ride? - It was a chesnut horse, a very tall horse; he took the horses into the stables, he came into the kitchen where my mistress was lighting the fire, from thence he went to the tap room and pulled off his boots; and told me to clean them; he had one spur on, and he pulled that off, and hung it up in the kitchen; he ordered me to buy him a pair of stockings, and he put them on, and put his slippers on, and went to the barber's, and staid there till breakfast time; the horses were in the stable.</p>
               <p>How long did they all continue there? - They were there for three days; over night a person brought two more, and took away one of his, that was a little black horse; the prisoner laid there one night.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular of the chesnut horse? - I took him to the farrier's to have one bar shoe put on his fore foot, I cannot say which foot, I believe I took him on the Tuesday afternoon, he wanted a shoe when he came in, I had no conversation with the man.</p>
               <p>Should you know the man again? - Yes, I believe I should, the justice's men took him into custody, and one of them took the spur away, it was hanging in the same place in the window.</p>
               <p>Was the spur they took the same he took off and hung up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I went to Chelsea, to Mr. Lewis's, the Kings Arms, and asked for Mr. Lewis; I asked him if any horses were brought into his stables on Tuesday morning? says I, where is the man that brought them, he said he is in the stable now, I went there and I found the prisoner; I said Sir, are these your horses? he said yes; I said, where did you get them? he said, I bought them at a fair in the country; so I had a hand bill, and I looked at it, and picked out three of my lord's horses; the prisoner was taken into the house, I locked the stable door and went in; I continned there that night, and the next morning some more of the people of Bow-street came, and me and another man went home; I delivered the three horses that I picked out to Christmas.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else in the house? - No Sir: after this I came home and saw my lord's servants, they shewed me an odd spur, and I recollected that I had seen such a spur in Lewis's kitchen, and I desired Shallard, who went down, to take care of it; and I shewed the tall chesnut horse to several people that came from the country, he is at Froome's livery stables in Covent Garden.</p>

               <p>My Lord I have employed counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It is not in my power to make a speech to the jury for you; if you think you can relate any facts, you may.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. I was at Gainsborough fair on Saturday preceding the Monday evening, when these horses were stolen from thence; I went to London on a horse I then had, and from London I went to a place called By-waters; at Aylesbury I bought two long tailed horses, which have since been owned, for which I paid eighteen guineas, and I bought a chesnut horse for six guineas, he is foundered; Mr. Williams observed to me that he knew I had some connections in the New Forest, in Hampshire, and that he could help me to some forest colts, he should be at Hammersham on the Monday evening, and he desired me to meet him; accordingly I went to Two Waters, to Cheyney, and from thence to Hammersham; he is, I find out now, a notorious horse stealer; I had bought many of him before, but they never turned out in this way; I met him with only one horse, I was surprised he had no more, he said, I have some in the neighbourhood, and my horse is almost tired; says he, if you will lend me your horse, and one of your spurs, I shall overtake you; accordingly I proceeded on, and got as far as Hounslow Heath, at the further end there his horse was tired, and knocked up; I tied him to the gate and walked on to Shepherds-bush, and there I met two gentlemen, one of whom I knew extremely well; and while we were in conversation, up came Williams with the horses in hand; I told him he was tired, the horses came up, I agreed for them, and I paid twenty-eight pounds (two ten pound notes, and the rest in cash;) he gave one of the gentlemen the notes to look at, for he could not read; after that he went about his business, I saw him no more; I found I was cheated in my horses, one was broken winded, and the other horse had an injury in one of his fore legs, so that he was not worth three guineas, the broken winded one was not worth two guineas and a half. This is all I have to say in my defence, Gentlemen, which I submit to the Court.</p>

               <p>Did that afford an opening sufficient for any body to get in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has the necessary a communication with the warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the warehouse open or shut? - It was open, the folding-doors; I missed a quantity of rope, as near as I can tell, there was about two ton wanting, and six bundles of paper stuff.</p>
               <p>Where did this plank lay? - I found it on the platform; that platform has a communication with the river; there were holes in the plank, which appeared to be made with a gimblet, and afterwards they took a knife and cut it, so as to get a stick in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260017"/>Was that hole sufficient for a man to get in? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you happen to know how that plank was secured, whether it was nailed, or whether it was only laid down loose in the necessary? - It was fastened.</p>
               <p>How? - Nailed.</p>
               <p>When you saw it, did you look to see whether the nails were drawn? - They were forced out.</p>

               <p>I deal in cordage; I live in Narrow-street, Limehouse; I was alarmed by my servant that my house was robbed, on the 13th of January; I fastened my doors; there was no man in the house but myself; I saw the doors fast, and went to bed with my family; I did not get up till my man alarmed me; he said, master, master, your house is robbed! My wife and me came down stairs; and when I came, I missed this rope and six bundles of paper stuff, and some junk; I observed the board laid there, and the board that belonged to the outside of the warehouse was put up by the carpenter, and never removed till it was broke off: this stick was found in the place, and they took and knocked another board through the necessary, and here is where it has been cut with a knife; they came through the necessary, and unbolted the door; the outside plank and the inside plank of the necessary were forced out.</p>
               <p>Where does that outside of the necessary look to? - The necessary is below in the warehouse; the dwelling-house, warehouse, and necessary communicate together.</p>
               <p>Where does the back of the necessary look to? - It looks to the water.</p>
               <p>How could they get at it from the place where you found the planks forced out? - There are stairs directly under it; upon those stairs is built a little bit of platform, about three feet wide, and they stood on that. I sent for

               <p>He did not make any use of the knife, or offer you any violence with it? - No, Sir, he promised he would not.</p>
               <p>What became of the knife, when you knocked him down? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he had the knife at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not find any knife upon him afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you the watch? - The constable has it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He talks of my having a knife, and his seeing it, it was impossible to see, this was Saturday, the first of April, it was impossible to see, I could not see my hand, and I had no knife at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it was a knife, I saw it, I was close under the lamp.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is never a lamp in that place, I am sure of that, because it is very near my place of residence.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light, or dark? - A very dark night.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. In consequence of an information, you went to a house, No. 19, in Swan-yard, Drury-lane? - I did.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I think it was on Saturday the 11th of February.</p>
               <p>About what hour? - I should suppose it near upon five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>When you came there, describe what persons you found there, and what things? - I went to the room up one pair of stairs; there is only one room on a floor; I saw the two women prisoners in the room; Mrs. Harris was in the middle of the room, facing the fire, and I think, if I recollect right, the other girl was upon her knees: after they were secured, we began to search, and upon a kind of bureau, or chest of drawers, I saw a piece of get.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the metal that fills up the sort of gutter that communicates to the different moulds.</p>
               <p>Clarke. In a drawer Macmanus searched, he took out a quantity of good shillings, which he gave me; they have been in my possession ever since; and a bed was turned up; Macmanus saw the woman approached to that; and there we found a quantity of counterfeit shillings; they are here; and in a little room like a closet, in the same room, I found all the implements compleat for coining.</p>
               <p>Did that little room communicate with that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has that closet a door into any other place? - No communication only with that room: there I found a pair of flasks, sand, scowering paper, file, cork, and upon the mantlepiece there was this aqua fortis; there was a fire in the room, and charcoal on.</p>
               <p>Was the whole apparatus for coining and finishing compleat there? - Clearly so: I have compared the good shillings and the bad ones together, and they agreed; from which I conclude, that from the good shillings counterfeits had been cast.</p>
               <p>How many good shillings are there? - Twenty-eight.</p>
               <p>How many have you fitted? - I believe there is a dozen shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Do they tally in such a manner, as to enable you to pronounce that the bad ones were made from the good ones? - I have not a doubt of it, particularly as there is one sixpence that I believe any body may see; one sixpence has a hole in it, and the other has been cast from it; I saw the two women there; and in about five minutes the man came in; we stopped him, according to our information. The things are all here in a box as they were found; (the things all produced) flasks, sand, a crucible which is broke, and facings.</p>
               <p>Court. We have heard nothing of the crucible before? - I found the crucible by the fire-side.</p>
               <p>Whereabout? - On the hearth, on the side of the grate where the fire was.</p>
               <p>What fire was it? - Part charcoal, and part coal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. You saw no more than one crucible? - Yes, several.</p>
               <p>How many? - I fancy there is pretty near half a dozen; there were several of them broke lay by the fire-side.</p>
               <p>How many whole crucibles are there? - Here is one that has not been used, and one that has; every one of the crucibles were found by the fire-side; here is the get.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were the moulds set? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>They were in the state you first produced them in, before you screwed them together? - Yes; they were all in the box together.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not find any pickle? - No, only aquafortis.</p>
               <p>Is not pickle one of those things which is necessary to put this into a state of currency? - No, Sir; they are put into aquafortis, and by the different workings, it reduces its strength.</p>
               <p>Is this aquafortis in the strong state, or is it so reduced, so as to become a pickle? - It is in its strong state; they use the aquafortis alone; if a quantity of aquafortis is put into a pan, and by applying any thing to it, as it is put in, so it soments, and it reduces it, and from that it becomes a pickle.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if I understand you right, when aquafortis is first used, it is not a pickle? - They use it without water; then they throw them into water afterwards, and that water is what they call pickle.</p>

               <p>Did you go to the house in Swan-yard, Drury-lane? - On Saturday the 11th of February I went with Mr. Clarke, Mr. Macmanus, and Mr. Andrews, to the house No. 19, in Swan-yard, near the New Church in the Strand, between five and six; I went up one pair of stairs; the door was locked inside, I shoved against it, and it came open, I broke it open at once, and the two prisoners at the bar were standing at the fire-side, and screamed out very much, and upon that I peraceived something drop; the man came in about five minutes afterwards; I went in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260023"/> first, and Mr. Andrews came in next, and Mr. Macmanus and Mr. Clarke; I heard something drop, and there was a light got, a candle was lighted, it was between light and dark, it was about half after five; and upon the ground where the two women prisoners stood, I picked up these two sixpences, one half finished, and one not quite finished, and a piece of blacking, and some cork, and a quantity of scouring paper, and some broken crucibles, and a pair of nippers; they were all close together spread upon the ground, and a quantity of dirt and sand and rubbish on the floor.</p>
               <p>Do you know what that blacking and cork and things could be used for? - Mr. Clarke can inform you best; I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>You do not know what that was that dropped? - I do not; I found the two sixpences just between the two women; they were taken into custody, and carried to Bow-street; I saw some files on the table, and a little box, and some things Mr. Clarke saw in the closet like.</p>
               <p>When the man came in, was he immediately taken into custody? - He was, by order of Mr. Clarke; he gave no account of himself, how he came there, or who he belonged to.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - I do not know; I know nothing about him.</p>
               <p>(The two Sixpences handed to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you try the door first, before you pushed it open? - No, I did not; I opened it with a good bang.</p>
               <p>How long might it be till Mr. Clarke came up? - A minute after.</p>
               <p>Then they were standing by the fire-side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they continued in the same position till he came in? - Yes; then he ordered them be searched.</p>
               <p>Holman was taken dir ectly before he had any time to give any account of himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body on their knees in the room? - Not to my knowledge, I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Were neither of the women on their knees? - No, Sir; the women were at the fire-side.</p>
               <p>Did you take Mr. Hardy with you? - No, Sir; I did not.</p>
               <p>Where did you leave him when you went? I left him by the New Church.</p>
               <p>He knew you was going there? - I imagine he did.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Hardy? - No great while.</p>
               <p>How long before you went to this house? - About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>How long? - About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Do you know what business he follows? - He kept a house in Drury-lane, a green-grocer's, sold oranges; the way I came to know him, I went to serve a warrant upon him.</p>

               <p>I went with Clarke and Meecham to this house; when I went into the room, there were two women near the fire; Meecham said he saw something drop; I went and picked it up, it was a bad sixpence; presently he found another; they moved towards the window, and Harris took a key out of her pocket, and went to the bureau, and took this crucible out with the contents, and gave it to the other woman; she put it out of the window upon a place to put garden pots on; I immediately took it in with the contents; I found it all as it is; in about five minutes the man came in; and there was scouring-paper and other things.</p>

               <p>Then it was after the time of course, that you saw Joseph making the mould? - I never saw him making any mould, but three times, for I was deterred from going up; the reason I went was, they owed me a little money, and I went after it, I being somewhat of a confidant, I believed they were not fearful to trust me; I only saw them making the mould; I believe I have seen the woman at work six or eight times.</p>

               <p>This was whilst they purchased the unfinished stuff, and were working it into finished for uttering? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was before they began casting? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You was a frequent visitor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was the first time, after the lodgings were taken? - I believe it was within four or five days.</p>
               <p>What Elizabeth understood the business as well as Phebe? - She was not there then, she came since they began casting; there was only Mrs. Harris and her daughter and this man.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any casting going forward? - I never saw any metal run; I have seen the silver in the flask to make the mould.</p>
               <p>You have? - Undoubtedly; when I went up, they have been a little surprised, but then they said, you need not mind him.</p>
               <p>You have known this family eighteen months, how came you to be the person singled out to tell this falsehood to the landlord. - I never told any falsehood only by her own desire.</p>
               <p>However you was the person thought the fittest with that demure face to tell a lie? - I lived in that neighbourhood, and I believe she had no other connections<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260026"/> but me, as I had not been in the neighbourhood long, and she desired me to look her out a room.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man? - Yes, I lived at No. 62, I never saw her do any thing of the kind before; I did not know she was a person of that kind.</p>
               <p>Did you know those people were in the act of high treason, at the time you went there? - I knew it would affect their lives, I thought it right to divulge it at last.</p>
               <p>Did you always think it was a bad thing that they were doing, and that it was a bad thing to keep it secret? - Undoubtedly I did.</p>
               <p>Had they paid you the money they owed you? - Some time; I suppose for two months.</p>
               <p>Then you continued to visit them after the money was paid? - All the difference that arose between them and me, that made us separate in our connection was, my advising them to quit and leave that business, and they thought my advice too bad.</p>
               <p>So there was a downright falling out between you? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Still they continued in their old lodgings, going on with their old trade, knowing you knew of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was two months after your recommendation, and breaking of the connection, that you gave this notice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had all connection ceased between you? - I believe it might be a week.</p>
               <p>Did you desire them not to come to your place, that you might disclose this matter? - I had some struggle in my mind, and at the same time was in hopes my persuasions would have an effect upon them, as I saw it was dangerous; I saw they would not leave off, and there was no other method; besides, I saw clearly that they were leading young people into that error, and they might have led others; I so far persuaded her own daughter to quit the house, and come to live at my house.</p>
               <p>What is the age of that daughter? - About fourteen; she lived with me and my wife in the capacity of a servant, or in fact, till her grandmother would take her; she was not with me not many days before, not many hours; she came on the Saturday, and her mother was apprehended on that very evening.</p>
               <p>Had not you really made a discovery to the officer, before you took the daughter home? - No, Sir; the daughter was at my house settled before the officers went.</p>
               <p>I ask you, upon your oath, whether you had not informed the officer before you took the daughter home? - I had not mentioned it to any one person, till the daughter was in my house, for there I left her, when I went to apprehend them; I took her in order to save her life.</p>

               <p>Did you go with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - They did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known this woman? - I never saw her, to know her, but once or twice.</p>
               <p>Where did she live? - I saw her at a public house; I do not know where she lived.</p>
               <p>How much was you to take for your trouble? - She did not promise me any thing particular; she said I should be satisfied.</p>

               <p>So the woman was a stranger to you? - Yes; I had seen her once or twice before.</p>

               <p>Did you know where she lodged, or was to be met with? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you think it was a proper thing for you to lie for this woman, though you did not swear for her? - I did not think of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260030"/> the consequence; she told me she could not find the man.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; this is a case, the most painful that has come before you this sessions: you have heard this is a robbery; a robbery not committed in the usual way, not by force or violence to the gentleman who was robbed, but by those means, which I am sorry to say, the experience of this place, and other courts of justice, has proved, are but too frequent in these days; I mean Gentlemen, by threatening to charge an unnatural crime. Gentlemen, on the law of this subject, whatever doubts may have been entertained formerly, thank God, there will be none to day; we have it settled by all the Judges, that if money is taken from the person of any man by threats, either to affect his character or person, by which he is induced to part with his money, that constitutes the crime of a robbery, the same as if he had been knocked down; and indeed God forbid it should not; for such an attack to a man of character is worse than a publick robbery. Gentlemen, the prosecutor Mr. Drummond, is a very respectable <rs id="t17860426-11-viclabel55" type="occupation">wine merchant</rs>

On the 5th of April, Mr. Drummond was in the Park, and there was a great disturbance in the Park, which

             the attention of every body, and of course, of Mr. Drummond; upon enquiry, he found that a man was detected in woman's cloaths, and that that was the cause of the riot; on returning home, Mr. Drummond was accosted by a man who since turns out to be the prisoner, who said, how do you do, Sir; Mr. Drummond had no recollection of his person, and said, who are you? says the prisoner, do not you recollect me, I am one of the two soldiers that brought the drafts, and say she, you behaved very ill and very shabbilly to us, and gave us only a shilling a piece; Mr. Drummond said, he thought he had given them enough; but however, Mr. Drummond gave him a shilling more; then the prisoner used this expression, if you do not give me more, I will swear an unnatural crime against you, and that you lost the drafts when you was with me in the Green Park; I can swear to your person, from having seen you at your own house before, when I brought the drafts. Mr. Drummond, you may conceive, was unusually alarmed; and upon these occasions, one sets one-self to consider what one should do; I am sure it has often puzzled me, how I should behave on such an occasion; knock him down one of my friends suggest; why that would be equally dangerous, that would be called retaliation; should a man do as Mr. Drummond did, give him something; why that is an encouragement to all these scoundrels of the guards; otherwise, the best way might be, to give them something and get rid of them; that was Mr. Drummond's case, he did not chuse to be annoyed by this man, he gave him four shillings; the fellow said that would not do, he should go home with him, he would have more money; Mr. Drummond was obliged to submit, he begged he would follow at a distance; in short Mr. Drummond went home, and there he got some more money, two guineas which he gave the prisoner; this however did not satisfy the prisoner, for the constant experience of these cases is, that when once they have made a footing, so as to induce people to give them a farthing, they are never satisfied, because, they know that every additional shilling that is given, is an additional abatement of that story, which is to be told to the Jury; the prisoner desired Mr. Drummond to make an appointment to give him some more money, Mr. Drummond did so; the prisoner desired Mr. Drummond would be very cautious to attend to his appointment, or else he should visit him again; Mr. Drummond disclosed what he had done, to Lord Sempill, and some other gentlemen, and that very day the prisoner was taken up; when the prisoner was taken and examined at the Publick Office, in Bow-Street, he told this story; that Mr. Drummond had lost the drafts, while he was commiting indecent familiarities with another soldier, of the name of Wetherhill, who was the man that went with the prisoner, when they carried the drafts; upon this Wetherhill was examined, and he entirely disclaimed the whole story, and said he never saw Mr. Drummond, till he went to his house with the prisoner with the drafts; another circumstance is, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260034"/> this man made the charge in the Park, Mr. Drummond told him that there was a reason why he should be the last person in the world to be charged with such a crime; but Wetherhill will come here, and tell you there is no truth in the story told by the prisoner. If the prisoner should be unwise enough to-day to affect Mr. Drummond's character, by so foul a charge, Mr . Drummond lives in this country in a way that he can produce the most reputable witnesses to his character, and that I should think will go a great way in directing your judgments; but the Court will tell you, that I cannot call such witnesses, unless the prisoner makes it necessary; but if I do call them, they will shew you that Mr. Drummond is not, nor cannot be the man that the prisoner represents him. Gentlemen, I shall call my witnesses, and if you find this man has made this charge with a view of extorting money, you will pronounce a verdict of Guilty upon the prisoner, and leave him to the vindiction of the law, to be made, perhaps, a public example to a nest of men, who, instead of being the guardians of the public, are by much the worst subjects the King has in his dominions, and by much the worst set of men in this metropolis; so that in future honest men walking in the Park may not meet with these sort of attacks; but however, Gentlemen, your province, to be sure, is only to pronounce him guilty, or not guilty, from the evidence that shall be laid before you; and I know, from the experience I have had of you, that you will give the greatest attention to that evidence, and decide according to your consciences; I ask no more at your hands.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner at the bar one of those soldiers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Wetherhill the other? - I cannot say; I could not even have said the prisoner was one of them, if he had not made that attack upon me afterwards; I went and spoke to the two soldiers, and told them I would not pay the drafts; upon which one of them answered, that he did not present them for payment, he said he found them.</p>
               <p>Was that said by the prisoner at the bar? - I cannot tell; still thinking that some of Lord Sempill's family had lost the drafts, I went to the compting-house, and wrote upon them, not to be paid; I sent the soldiers to Lord Sempill's, and about an hour after they came back to me, with my Lord's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260035"/> own servant,

               <p>Did the servant say you must have lost them yourself, in the presence of the two soldiers? - No, it was in the cellar; I came up to the compting-house, and shewed them the drafts from the books, that they were entered and paid; I told them that the drafts were of no consequence, but as they had brought them home, I gave the soldiers a shilling a-piece for their trouble.</p>

               <p>Did they, or either of them, make any objection to going to Lord Sempill's? - No, none.</p>
               <p>When did you see the soldier again? - I saw no more of them till the 14th, which was Good Friday.</p>
               <p>When you gave them the shilling a-piece, did they say any thing before they left you? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did they make any complaints? - No, not a word; on the 14th, I went down to St. James's Park, about eight in the evening, and walked towards the Queen's House in the Mall; there were a great many people walking at the time, and on returning, there was a noise in the Green Park, and the people that were in the Park crowded to see what was the matter; the noise was a little above where the centry stands in the Green Park; I went up, and found, on enquiry, that it was a man taken in woman's clothes; and upon retiring from the crowd in St. James's Park, in order to go home, the prisoner followed me; he came up to me, and said, how do you do, Sir? I did not know him at all; I asked him who he was, and he said, did not I remember the two soldiers that came with the drafts some time ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you left the crowd? - Yes; I returned through St. James's Park to go home.</p>
               <p>You chose to go through St. James's Park, sooner than the Green Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Park. Was the prisoner in his uniform? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner follow you? - Yes; I asked him who he was? he replied, did not I remember the two soldiers that came with the drafts some time ago; I answered, yes; but I do not know that you are one of them; upon which he said, I am the one that found the drafts, and you behaved very shabbily, and not like a gentleman, in giving us only a shilling each; I told him I thought it was enough, as I had shewn him Lord Sempill's book, that the drafts were entered, and were of no consequence; that he might have the drafts instead of the shilling. He said that was too little, and he must have more; I told him I would give him no more; but on his still insisting, I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him a shilling, and told him to go about his business; by this time, I had got into St. James's Park; the soldier was still following me, demanding more money; I repeated I will give you no more: he then said, if you do not give me some more money, I will swear an unnatural crime against you, and that you was with me in the Green Park when you lost the drafts; I can swear to your person, from having seen you at your house when I brought home the drafts. I walked on the footpath; I was much alarmed, and left he should have made his threats heard in the streets, I turned towards the Queen's House, by the tail of the Green Park, and stopped almost opposite where the two centinels stand, on the north side of the Queen's House; I told him I had only a half-crown and three sixpences, which I gave him; he said that would not do, he must have more; and then he said, I will go home with you: I told him that I did not know I had any if I was at home, but on his insisting, I then told him,</p>
               <p>"Meet me any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260036"/> where that you please on Monday in particular, and I will give you a guinea," thinking by this means to make him desist, and get rid of him for the present, and bring assistance to apprehend him; finding all these means ineffectual, I told him I was a very improper person to accuse of such a crime, for a reason which I told the prisoner; he still insisted on having more money, and going home with me; I told him then to follow me home at a distance; when we had gone a little way, I saw him beckon to another soldier, and he said, there is a man that I know, he will go with us; I replied, you may bring whom you please. When I came to the end of Sackville-street, in Piccadilly, I told him to stand by the wall of St. James's Church-yard, while I went home for the money; in place of doing that, he followed me home to the door, and I came out, and gave him two guineas a little way from the door in Sackville-street: he then said, when shall I call on you for more? I told him I had given him too much; he still said he would call again; I then said, meet me at the Green Park-gate at St. James's Park on Monday night at eight o'clock, and I will give you another guinea; with the same intention I have said before, of apprehending him; and I made a point to consult my friends what I should do; the prisoner said, Sir, be sure to keep your appointment, or I shall call in a few days. Early the next morning, I went to Lord Sempill's house - Court. Properly speaking, we cannot hear from Mr. Drummond any thing that he said or did. - On the Monday evening I went to the place of appointment, and took with me Mr. Morant, an officer from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner at the bar when you met him on Monday night? - It was some time after eight before the prisoner came; he came up to me, and asked me, in the same manner, how do you do, Sir? I said I was very well; he said; do not you recollect me; I said I had good reason to know him; that I knew him perfectly well, that he had used me very ill, and he said in what, I said in threatening to charge such a crime against me, and extorting money from me by those threats; the prisoner upon that said, he had been at my house on Sunday; Mr. Morant came up, and took him into custody; when we went to the bottom of St. James's-street, he asked me to let him have a coach, and not send him to the spunging house; I said you are going to Sir Sampson Wright's, and he may send you where he pleases; he replied, then he may send me to the devil.</p>
               <p>When was you examined at Bow-street? - On the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say for himself at Bow-street? - As nearly as I can recollect, he said about two months ago, he was standing in St. James's Park, by the rails of the two Parks, that I came up to him and asked him what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the examination taken and returned of the prisoner in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it signed by him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The examination sent for from Bow-street.)</p>
               <p>Court. Have you told us all you know excepting the examination of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any counsel for the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Then I will ask Mr. Drummond one or two questions. When the man first told you that if you did not give him more money, he would swear an unatural crime against you, what was the impression that it made on you? - I was very much alarmed indeed, I hardly knew where I was going, or what I was about for some time, having heard of several things of that kind before, it struck the more terror into my mind.</p>
               <p>What was the immediate mischief that you apprehended? - I thought he would take me into custody, and swear against me that crime.</p>
               <p>There were a number of people in the Green Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it occur to you to return back to that crowd of people, or to apply to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260037"/> centinels, or any person for assistance? - If I could not have got rid of him by fair means, so as to get quit of him that night.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of your turning to the Queen's house, instead of turning homewards? - I was afraid he would have made an uproar in the street, or have seized me there.</p>
               <p>Did it not occur to you, that in the street, you might easily have procured assistance? - I thought he might have seized me in the street, he being a much stronger man.</p>
               <p>Then you had an apprehension in your mind of immediate violence from him, if you did not give him what he required? - Most undoubtedly I had.</p>
               <p>Under what apprehension was it that you gave him the four shillings? - To get quit of him.</p>
               <p>But what apprehension if you did not? - I cannot exactly say, I was really in terror, I thought he would do something to me if I did not.</p>
               <p>Have you any kind of recollection by what means these drafts could have been lost out of your possession? - No other way than by putting them in my pocket in my own room, and as I frequently went to the Green Park, to the Park-keeper's house, and drank some milk of a morning before breakfast; I know of no other way that they could be lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is on account of your health I believe? - No, Sir, I am very fond of walking in a morning, I used to go very often, I am generally pretty much confined in the day, and I like to walk in a morning.</p>
               <p>I think you said your servant was present, when you first spoke to the soldier about the drafts, and you sent them to Lord Sempill's with the drafts, and that my Lord's servant came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you have any recollection of the other man that came with the prisoner? - No, I knew him when I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Put your questions to me, and I will ask the prosecutor, if there is any thing I should ask him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, not particularly, only to speak for myself; I wish that Wether-hill, the other soldier, should be called.</p>
               <p>Court. He is here I understand, and if he is not called for the prosecutor, you certainly have a right to call him yourself.</p>

               <p>Court. Before you examine him, ask Woollett whether this is the person that was with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the examination be read first which was returned from Sir Sampson, and let Wetherhill step out of Court; this is the original examination, but it should have been signed by the Justice; is there any body here that was present when the prisoner signed this examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who brought this from the office? - Mr. Allen, who is the clerk at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>I am an assistant clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray, what is the reason that you did not prepare a regular examination? - There was the information returned</p>
               <p>But was there any examination of the prisoner returned? - I do not recollect that it was; I can answer for that being signed there in that book by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. The deposition of Wetherhill, taken before the Magistrate, is signed by the Magistrate, we read it as a paper under the signature of the prisoner, which, as against him, may be read; but that does not make the proceedings of the Magistrate regular; it is proper to mention that before the clerk, whose duty it is to take care that these parts of the Magistrate's duty are regularly performed.</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. Is this what the prisoner said at Bow-street, and did you take it down yourself? - It is just as he said, word by word; I wrote it myself as he delivered it, I saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>Did you read it over to him? - It was read by me to him before he signed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, it was not read first.</p>
               <p>Was it read to him? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did he make any objections to it? - He was asked if there was any thing wrong in it, and he said it was all truth; it was brought there and signed.</p>
               <p>Court. You may read that, if it is desired on either side.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow and Mr. Park look at it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not see that it is material to read it.</p>
               <p>Court. Unless it is called for, I do not see it is necessary, because the prisoner will have an opportunity of making his own defence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been a soldier in the Guards? - Four years and a half; I was a drummer some time.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a soldier, distinguished from a drummer? - Three months ago.</p>
               <p>Do you remember going to Mr. Drummond's in Sackville-street at any time with two drafts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - At the time I was at the recruit-house learning my exercise, after I had inlisted as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - The prisoner Harwood.</p>
               <p>What did you go for? - To enquire about the notes that I had found.</p>
               <p>When had you found them? - I found them six months before I was a soldier; I had them by me all that time, I did not think any thing about them; I shewed them to the prisoner, and asked him what he thought of them? he said he thought if he had coloured clothes, He could draw the money; I told him I would not think of any such thing, but that if he pleased he might go with me to Mr. Drummond's at Charing Cross, and enquire about them, and he appointed the next day, but he did not come till about a week after.</p>

               <p>Where did you both go to make the enquiry first? - To Mr. Drummond the Banker at Charing Cross, and he directed us to Sackville-street; we went both together; we saw the servant first, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260040"/> went and carried the notes to Mr. Drummond, and he came out and told us to go up to Lord Sempill's, and ask him about the notes, as the notes came from one Lewis, his servant. We went there, and saw the servant; we were to go and enquire of them how they had been lost; we saw Mr. Drummond before we went, and he wrote down directions where to find my Lord, and wrote upon them, not to be paid.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner go with you to Lord Sempill's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were informed there that the drafts had been paid? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who went back with you to Mr. Drummond's? - The servant of my Lord, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any conversation that passed, as you was going along? - I told the servant I found these notes in the Park.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him how long before you had found them? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Tell us, as well as you can recollect, all that passed, in your way to Mr. Drummond's? - We did not say any thing to the servant hardly, excepting telling him we found them in the Park; when we came back to Mr. Drummond, we went up stairs to the compting-house, and he looked over the books, and found the notes had been paid, and gave us a shilling apiece for our trouble.</p>
               <p>Did you and the prisoner go away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any complaint, or say any thing else? - No.</p>
               <p>You expressed no discontentment? - No; then we went to the sign of the Madman in St. James's street, and there we had a couple of pots of porter, and then I parted with him.</p>
               <p>At that time had you ever seen Mr. Drummond before in your life? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner claim any acquaintance with Mr. Drummond? - No; he said to me that he had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Did he say so expressly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any person with you at the time you found these notes? - No, I was by myself, in the Green Park.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner at the time you found the notes? - Yes, I have known him for a year or two.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mr. Drummond again till after the prisoner was in custody, upon any occasion whatever? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner about Mr. Drummond, or about his character? - No, never at all.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the prisoner after that day you was at Mr. Drummond's, till he was taken into custody? - I never saw him till yesterday.</p>
               <p>Did not you see him at Bow-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You was with Harwood twice at Mr. Drummond's house about these drafts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of you conversed with Mr. Drummond? - Harwood; I told him to converse with him, because I have an impediment in my speech; the second time, I believe neither of us spoke a word to Mr. Drummond; he told us the notes had been paid.</p>
               <p>You had full opportunity then, both you and particularly Harwood, who talked to Mr. Drummond, to know him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, after you left Mr. Drummond, either of the times, or at any other time, express any intimation that he had seen Mr. Drummond before? - No, Sir; he spoke of him as a person that he had never seen before.</p>
               <p>And that after the last time you had seen Mr. Drummond? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish to ask the officer any question? - No.</p>
               <p>The Rt. Hon. Lord SEMPILL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am acquainted with Mr. Drummond; on Saturday morning, I think about eight o'clock he came to me, and was in great distress, and asked my advice, I told him.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot permit you, my Lord, to relate the particulars of that conversation, as the prisoner was not present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have done.</p>
               <p>Court. Now prisoner, this is the proper time for you to state what you have to say in your own defence; you know what the charge is against you, and you have heard the evidence.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Please you my Lord, in the month of February, I was coming through St. James's Park, and I met Mr. Drummond, and he said to me, soldier what is it o'clock? that was the word he said to me, I told him I did not know; he then asked me to stop, and asked me if there were any common women in the Park, I told him I did not know; he told me to look for one, but I would not; then he unbuttoned his breeches and at the same time attempted to take hold of my breeches, and I began to make a noise, I said oh fie! Mr. Drummond; he put some silver into my hand, and left me; I saw no more of him till I went with the notes, and then I saw no more of him, till there was a disturbance in the Park, and then I said, Mr. Drummond, Sir, how do you do? says he, do you know me? I said, Sir, I went to your house, and do not you recollect ill-treating me so in the Park, about two months back? he said yes; and he desired me to make no disturbance, and he gave me one half crown and three sixpences to make no disturbance, and I went to him to his house, and he gave me two guineas; he desired me to meet him on the Monday night, and he would give me another guinea; I was on duty, and I wrote him two notes to let him know I could not meet him; when I came into the Park to get the guinea, this gentleman was with him, and took me up for saying I should swear an unnatural crime to him, which I never mentioned any such words.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to call? - I have no witnesses, there was nobody but our two selves.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to give you a character? - No, I have no friends in town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I wish to call witnesses to contradict this.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not see that there is any charge against Mr. Drummond but the prisoner's defence; and that is unsupported by any evidence but the prisoner's own allegation.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the nature of this robbery being an uncommon one, has been stated to you by the learned counsel, who opened the prosecution; and it differs from the common generally received idea of robberies in this; that in these cases, no personal violence is actually used, nor is there any immediate threat of bodily harm, which are circumstances that in common cases constitute highway robberies; when, therefore, the first case of this sort occurred in a court of justice, considerable doubt was entertained, whether an indictment for a highway robbery (which implies the idea either of actual force, or fear, as it was generally understood, of life, or bodily injury) whether an indictment for that offence could be supported by circumstances, similar to those which are now in evidence before you, and charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260044"/> on the prisoner; on the first case of that kind it was reserved for the solemn opinion of all the Judges, upon a question of law being a subject of great importance; for on the one hand it was of consequence that the law should not be improperly stretched to a case to which it did not apply; on the other hand the publick was concerned in the punishment of a crime, which, if not a highway robbery, was certainly not of a less magnitude. The Judges were unanimously of opinion, that upon the principles of law, and former decisions, it did sufficiently come within the law to constitute the offence of a highway robbery, and that that terror, and apprehension of mischief, following the refusal of money, though not a threat, or actual violence in the person, was yet a sufficient threat in point of law, to constitute the offence by putting in fear; therefore under that description, and considering this fear, as coming within the meaning of the law, it was unanimously determined on that occasion, to be a highway robbery in point of law: upon that the prisoner received judgment; but being the first case, it was not carried into execution. Another case has occured within my knowledge, in which a prisoner was convicted and executed for that offence. In considering this question it becomes of considerable consequence, because the life of a prisoner on the one hand, and the character of the prosecutor on the other, in a point not less valuable than life, are materially affected; therefore I have no doubt, that you have paid that attention which the nature of this case requires; and it is the more necessary, because the cases are generally to be decided, and the truth come at, more by minute circumstances connected with the conduct of the parties, than by the direct allegations of the parties either of the one side or the other; for the prosecutor who comes to charge this particular kind of highway robbery against the prisoner, certainly comes with so strong a bias on his own mind, and with so great an interest in the verdict, that it is fortunate for justice, and the prosecutor himself, where circumstances occur, so far to remove that sort of doubt from the case, which otherwise would rest upon it, if it stood on the prosecutor's own oath, standing on that situation, whatever the character of the prosecutor may be. You are therefore to consider, whether you can make out circumstances from the testimony of other witnesses, and from clear and indisputable facts, to remove all darkness from a case that is frequently involved in great obscurity. Mr. Drummond is the first, and from the nature of the case, the most material witness. [Here the learned Judge repeated his evidence, and added] With respect to the impression of the prosecutor's mind, it will go the full length, and rather further than the case I mentioned to you, and there cannot be the least doubt in point of law, that this charge made by Mr. Drummond, is sufficient to support the indictment; and Mr. Drummond's conduct is a proof how difficult it is to judge properly at the moment; most undoubtedly he was led to give the money through fear, which was the most indiscreet thing he could have done; for giving way to the first attack of this kind obliges the party either to lay under perpetual contributions to people of this sort, or make the complaint under greater disadvantages; and it is always a disagreeable situation to fall into; but it is a situation to which men with the best intentions, and the most reputable characters may fall under such an accusation; therefore, the mere circumstance of yielding to the impression of fear in the moment, ought not to carry the presumption of any thing like guilt in the party: the indecent conduct is disproved, independant of the prosecutor's evidence; not only by the evidence of Wetherhill, but this going to Lord Sempill, was an additional proof that they did not know Mr. Drummond before; if therefore you believe the prisoner obtained this money from Mr. Drummond by those threats, and that he delivered it under the impression of fear, which he has stated, from fear of injury to his character, of being apprehended for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260045"/> capital crime, or from an apprehension of personal violence; in that case, you will find the prisoner guilty: but if you can conceive the smallest ground for supposing there is any truth in the story of the prisoner, which would give any colour for his applying for money; or if you have any doubt of the truth of Mr. Drummond's story, in that case you will acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of March, between ten and eleven, I was going down Brick-lane, and I saw the prisoner coming along with a bundle; Brick-lane is one part in Spital-fields, and one part in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Is that one way of coming in from Hackney? - Yes; I asked the prisoner what he had there; he said, it was a bed wrapped up in a blanket; I asked him where he brought it from; he did not give me any answer at first, but afterwards he said he brought it out of Barker's-yard, and was going to carry it into George-yard; he desired me not to stop him, because his wife was down-laying, and he owed a little rent, and was going away; and I insisted on seeing what was in the bundle; I took him to the Rotation-office, and there I looked over the things; I found it was not a bed; I took him over to the watch-house; the bundle contained the things now produced. I searched him; he said I might search him and welcome, for he had nothing but his own property about him: when I searched him, I found these three pins and these three pieces of silver; before I opened them, I asked him what he had there? he said, there were some pins, a shilling, and some halfpence; I found these things in his waistcoat-pocket after I stopped him; he brought the things a little way, and he would not carry them any further; I got this young man to assist me.</p>

               <p>What did he say? - He said he was hired to carry them as a porter.</p>
               <p>Was what he said, before or after you searched him? - After I found what the things were, he said he was hired to carry them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did not he tell you that those things had been given to him by the person that had hired him, as a satisfaction for his labour? - I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Did not he give the account I mentioned? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you with him about half a guinea? - I do not remember any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, that if he would give you half a guinea, you would let him go? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Roberts, did not you ask me for the half-guinea, and I told you I was a poor man? - My dear friend, you told me you was a poor man, and was going to move the bed and things, because your wife was down-laying.</p>

I told him yes; I immediately went in and fetched out my knot; I went with him, and by the French church, Spital-fields, another man stood, and they put a bundle on my head, and bid me go into Whitechapel, and they would take it themselves; and when I got about five or six yards, one of them came in between the wall and me, and said, young man, we neither of us have any money, but you will find something in this paper that will satisfy you, and immediately put it in my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, and being confused, I did not know what to say when I was stopped; they said it was a bed, and so I said the same.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Tell me distinctly what the prisoner said with respect to those things that you found in his waistcoat-pocket, in the paper? - When I took them out, wrapped up, I asked him what they were, before the watchman in the watch-house; he told me they were some pins, one shilling, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not find any crow, or implement of house-breaking upon him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What did he say before you searched him? - He said he had nothing but his own property in his pocket; he said I might search him and welcome; he did not make any objection to being searched.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it toasted cheese? - No, Sir, Cheshire cheese, to the best of my knowledge it was; I brought them a great bowl to put the toast in; they had sugar, but no nutmeg. Some time after supper, his wife came in with a plate of cold meat that she went to the cook's shop for, and she called for a pint of beer, and asked him if he would have any? and he said no, he did not want any, he had had a very good supper; that was between nine and ten; and while she was eating her cold meat, he then said to his wife, Polly, says he, make haste, for we keep Mrs. Jones up; I looked at the dial, and said, no, Mr. Watts, you do not, for if nobody was in the house, I should not shut up till eleven; it was then near twenty minutes after ten, if not half an hour. After she had drank her first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260048"/> pint of beer, she called for a second pint, and it was after that, that he bid her make haste; that made me be so particular to the time, or else I should not have noticed it: then they called for the other pint after that.</p>
               <p>Who called for it? - It was his wife; she said, Bill, if you can drink a little beer, we will have another pint, I have had nothing all day.</p>
               <p>Where were the other two men that supped with him? - They were there also, for they lodged in the house; they were not out of the house at all, nor the prisoner was not out of the house from the time he came in; they staid all of them; they never went to-bed till I shut up my house; they were all of them with the prisoner in the same box, and the prisoner's wife eat her supper in the same box.</p>
               <p>Were here many other people in the same box at this time? - Only them three together, and the wife with them.</p>
               <p>Were these men at home all the afternoon? - They were in the room when the prisoner came in; Pike was mending his harness, he came in about half an hour after the prisoner came in, in the afternoon; he had his harness on his shoulder, he is a coachman; Jones was in the tap-room when the prisoner came in, for he was not well, and not able to work, and he was at home all day; he has no where to be, but about the house.</p>
               <p>What liquor had the prisoner from four till nine? - He had one pint of beer; he had no more till they joined in company, then I believe they had three or four pots of twopenny and toast at supper; but he had only one pint before supper.</p>
               <p>Had Pike and

             any drink when they came in? - I cannot recollect that; these three men did not join company till they went to supper together.</p>
               <p>Were they acquainted before, the prisoner and these two men? - No, not particularly acquainted; they had met together in the house before, they knew one another.</p>
               <p>Was your husband at home? - He was not very well that night, and was gone up to bed.</p>
               <p>What time did he go to-bed? - I take it he went up to bed at the time they were at supper; he says the bowl was on the table when he went up.</p>
               <p>Did he take a bit with them before he went? - No, Sir, he did not eat with them, nor drink.</p>
               <p>Did you sup with them? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor drink? - I never touched it, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Did not you sit down, and eat a bit with the wife, to keep her company when she came in? - No, Sir, I did not; I never sat down with any of them, nor eat nor drank with any of them; I was minding my business.</p>
               <p>How came they to have no nutmeg to this toast and ale, because that is a necessary ingredient? - They had none, Sir; nutmegs are too dear now, they are sixpence a-piece, they are too dear to give away.</p>
               <p>Had you none in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Had they any spirits? - No, no spiritual liquors.</p>
               <p>Had they no gin? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor rum-punch? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did they go away? - Mr. Watts went out of my house, a little boy fetched him out, about half after ten, soon after the conversation about his not keeping me up; I saw no more of Watts.</p>
               <p>How long did his wife stay after that? - She stopped a little bit, and then she went, she took her beer in her hand, about a quarter of a pint.</p>
               <p>Recollect now, whether she did or not? - I think she did, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you sure, one way or the other? - I think the took it in her hand; they live but over the way, and I suppose she took it home; there was not more than a quarter of a pint left.</p>
               <p>Might she not as well have swallowed that, as taken it away with her? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260049"/>What became of the two men that were in company? - They were left behind, they never went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner's wife and these two men continue in company together after the prisoner went away, till the wife went away? - Yes, she went out soon after.</p>
               <p>But till she went out they continued in company, only the prisoner leaving them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after she went away did you shut up? - About a quarter after eleven, I saw no more of none of them after that.</p>
               <p>Was there any body left in the house, after the wife went away, except your lodgers? - I am not able to say that, Sir, but I know we were in bed very soon that night.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in company with Pike and Jones after? - No, Sir, they never had any thing to drink after, nor fell in company with any body after, but went up stairs to bed when I shut in.</p>
               <p>How long had Pike lodged with you? - About seven months, or there about.</p>
               <p>How long had Jones lodged with you? - About a year and a half.</p>

            , and that was all that lodged there; I went up two pair of stairs on account of a man and his wife that came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260054"/> and laid a couple of nights in the house, and I moved up to make room for them, the man was going on board a ship, I have continued up stairs ever since.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after the prisoner was taken? - Oh, since the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear that the prisoner was taken up? - About eleven I believe at night.</p>
               <p>That was the very night he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who came and told you? - I think it was the watchman that told me while I was shutting the gates.</p>
               <p>Did you go to see him that night? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him that night before you heard he was taken up? - Yes, he had been at the house and supped with me.</p>
               <p>What time did he come into the house at night? - He was in before I went in.</p>
               <p>What time did you come in? - It was in the afternoon, I had been trying to get into Bartholemew's hospital, and it was a wet day and I staid by the way; I went out in the morning between nine and ten, I think I came home between four and five, as nigh as I can guess, I did not take knowledge of the time.</p>
               <p>When you came, I think you say, Watts was there? - He was.</p>
               <p>What was he doing when you came in? - He was hemming a stirrup and mending a pad, I think it was, or some of the harness, in one of the boxes in the house at the window.</p>
               <p>Did you join company with them then? - I joined company with them when I came in, I continued at the house the remainder of the night, I never went out any further than into the yard.</p>
               <p>What beer had you? - We had three pots of twopenny.</p>
               <p>Did any body else drink with you at that time? - Only us three, this man at the bar and the man with the wooden leg, and I, we had three pots of twopenny, we called for it about eight, when we began to toast the bread to put to the twopenny, I did not drink any beer before I went to supper, nor I did not see them drink; I sat all the afternoon without drinking, I commonly sit there all day without drinking, because I have been ill so long.</p>
               <p>What had you for supper? - Toast and twopenny and some Cheshire cheese, and some moist sugar.</p>
               <p>Which of you was it called for the nutmeg? - We had no nutmeg at all.</p>
               <p>How happenened that? - Really I do not know, I think it was asked for, but they said there was none in the house, I am sure we had no nutmeg; after supper there was a horse came in with the mad staggers, and we all three went out together to see it, there was nobody else in the house hardly, this was a little after nine, we stopped but a very few minutes, I came in again directly, we had a pot of twopenny after we came in, that made the fourth pot.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner go away then, or did he come back with you? - He came back with us again, and sat down and drank share of the last pot, he went away about half after ten.</p>
               <p>Did any of you go out with him? - Nobody that I know of that belonged to the house; the boy came and enquired for a porter, I do not know who that boy was, I have seen the boy leading a couple of blind men about, but I do not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Who answered the boy? - I believe the prisoner answered the boy; and said do you want a porter at this time at night, the boy said you must come directly, for the gentleman is waiting for a porter; I cannot remember who the boy spoke to first.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Jones your sister-in-law answer the boy? - I cannot say, I remember my sister stopping the boy, and asking him what sort of a man it was, the boy said it was a tallish man, with a cocked up hat, and my sister asked him where he was, and he said, he stood in the street; then it was that the prisoner asked who could want a porter at that time of the night? and somebody in the house made answer to him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260055"/> go and see, and he went out to see, and his wife followed him out, if I am not mistaken, his wife was there, and brought a bit of meat for his supper, and he said he had done supper, so she called for a pint of beer and eat it.</p>
               <p>Did she go out a little after him? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge she did, and came back again to look for his knot.</p>
               <p>What o'clock might this be? - To the best of my knowledge it was as nigh half after ten as can be, I could almost swear to the time, by his saying to his wife, we keep Mrs. Jones up, and she said, I shall not shut up till eleven, if there is nobody in the house, I looked at the clock, that made me so particular.</p>
               <p>What time was the house shut up? - At eleven, as nigh as I can guess, and while I was shutting the gates, I heard he was taken up, the doors were then shut.</p>
               <p>When you heard that the man that had just been supping with you was taken up; why did not you go to the watch house? - I could do him no good, I was no housekeeper, and another thing, I did imagine they would not have let me seen him, if I had gone; the next morning when he went to have his hearing, I went down, I do not know that I did tell them any thing of it that night.</p>
               <p>Was it so common a thing for your friends to be taken up? - I might mention it to my sister, Pike might be gone to bed, she might be gone up stairs.</p>
               <p>Had not your brother and you some talk about it that night? - No, he was gone to bed, I believe, he went to bed about nine, or between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Did he go to bed directly after supper? - I do not know, he did not sup with us.</p>
               <p>He supped in the other room? - I cannot say where he supped that night, or what time he went to bed that night.</p>
               <p>Was there any particular reason for his going to bed that night? - No, not that I know of, he had not complained of being ill that I heard, I was so ill myself; the next morning I went down to see Watts.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - I went by myself.</p>
               <p>Did your sister go before you, or after you? - If she went at all, she went after me, I believe; but I do not know, I did not see her there.</p>
               <p>Then you do not remember hearing her say it was very hard they would not let her in to speak for him? - No; that must be the second time, I do not think she went there, the first morning I went by myself, and I think I came back by myself.</p>
               <p>What became of the two Clarkes that night that the prisoner supped there? - They might be out, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Were they both out? - To the best of my knowledge I believe they were; I cannot be sure; I believe

               <p>Court to Jury. I confess, Gentlemen, I may now very openly declare, that I perfectly concur with you in opinion; I am extremely satisfied with your verdict. I think these witnesses should not be permitted to escape with impunity; I have no doubt but the story they have told us is false; let them all three be committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Watts. I do not mean now to pronounce upon you the sentence of the law, which will be done at the regular time, but I have called you back for the purpose of telling you what you are to expect, and the reason of it; the crime for which you have been convicted is an enormous one, and it is a growing one; your fate would have been extremely doubtful at all events; but if there was any doubt at all, you have probably completely removed it, by the attempt you have made in setting up a defence which the verdict of the Jury, concurring with my opinion, has discredited: therefore you must prepare for your fate, and you are not to expect that the mercy of your Sovereign will be extended to you: and I hope it will be understood by every body, that those attempts to escape punishment will always be considered as aggravations of the crime; and where the crime is of a capital nature, such attempts to elude the law will preclude the prisoner from any hope of mercy, and also bring the deserved punishment on the heads of the witnesses themselves.</p>

               <p>Between six and seven, on the Sunday evening the 9th of this month, a coach took me up at Osborn's hotel in the Adelphi,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260059"/> and carried me to No. 9, in Orchard-street, Portman-square; there were various parcels, and two trunks put into the coach; there was a deal box which contained the things mentioned in the indictment, all the parcels were taken out of the coach at my lodgings, except this deal box which was under one of the seats of the coach and carried away by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who took the things out of the coach? - The coachman and a servant of Mr. Dalby's who was then with me.</p>
               <p>Is that servant here? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon after the coach was discharged was this box missed? - I do not believe it could be more than a minute or two at the furthest, I instantly ran down stairs and missed the box. I called out to the servant, the coach was drove off, I ran as fast as I could into Oxford-street in order to see this coach; I observed a coach at some distance painted the same colour as the coach that carried me, but it was not the same coach; I then took a coach and went on to the Adelphi stand, I searched all the coaches, I did not know the number of it, the servant described it to me lined with green cloth, I searched different stands but in vain, till nine that night; when I came home; I immediately sent for a porter and ordered a hundred hand bills to be printed, which were accordingly done, and dispersed on Monday by ten o'clock; I had it advertised in the Daily Advertiser, and two men came and desired to see the family that had lost a deal box, they left the number of the coach, and the nick name of the coachman, which they called Green Harness, they could not tell his other name; in consequence of this information I went the next morning to the coach office, and I found the number of the coach, and the man's name as they described; on the Thursday following, I took the prisoner with this coach at the door of Messrs. Stock and Cooper, linen-drapers in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself recollect the man and the coach? - No, I had his master with me, who pointed out the man and the coach to me; I did not recollect either, I should not have known either; I immediately crossed the way, and took hold of him by the collar, and before I said any thing to him, he said, Sir I was at your lodgings to day with my wife, with the box, I asked him why he did not leave the box at my lodgings, knowing it to be my property, and he said that his wife asked for the reward which is three guineas, that was offered; and as I was not home, they had taken it away, and that he wanted money, and had carried the box to the house of one

Stock and Cooper's door, he said he could not get my box without he had liberty to speak to this man, to get some money, I told him he should not, I would pay whatever money was demanded by the Jew, we then went to the Jew's house, Mr. Dalby got out first, and asked for Mr. Mitchel; he came down stairs, and without ceremony I told him to go up stairs and bring me down the box and its contents, which the coachman had left there about two hours before; the Jew did not hesitate in bringing it down, and when he brought it into the kitchen I examined it, it was open, it had no lock from the beginning, but it had a hasp, and was tied very strong when I lost it; when he brought it down there was no cording nor hasp on it, it was quite open; I examined the box and found the waiter, the forks, the shirt pin, and the knee buckles, and the red pocket book, from which all the papers had been taken out: upon opening the pocket book, I found all the papers taken away, and the little implements, such as knives, scissars, &amp;c. were taken away also; I immediately asked the Jew where the bonds and he other papers were, and he declared that he never saw a paper, that he never opened the book, that he never opened the box, and know nothing at all about them; I then asked the coachman if he knew any thing about the papers, he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260060"/> yes, and I believe Mr. Dalby or myself then desired him to tell all he knew about the papers; he then said that the Jew had taken all those papers out of the book, and that he read them all over, but that he gave him a parcel of small papers, which he did not know what they were, as he could not read or write, and desired him to burn the small papers, for that they were of no use to him or any body; he said that the Jew took the papers out of the other side of the book, which were large papers, and that he pretended to burn them, but could not be sure whether he did or not; I then desired the Jew to produce me the bonds, and if he did, I should take no further notice of it; he persisted in denying any knowledge of them; I took the Jew before Sir Sampson Wright, and the prisoner and his master, and there was a Mr. Bond presiding. Mr. Bond examined them, and he committed this coachman, and bound over the Jew to prosecute; he did not think he was justified, he said, in committing the Jew; the reason he gave was, his readiness to produce the box.</p>

               <p>Was you the executor? - I was the heir at law, and executor; the things I found, and the box, were my property.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 5, in Castle-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>How came you by that box, with these things in it, that Mr. Weldon found at your house? - On the 13th of this month, the prisoner, in company with another man and a woman, came to my house; I had seen him several times before; I knew him very well by sight; it might be about three, as near as I can recollect; he came to my house, and said he was in distress, and wished I could lend him a trifle of money; I said it was a wrong time, I could be of no use to him, it was holiday, it was passover; he said if it was but five shillings, it would be a service to him; I then took pity of him; I said I had a few shillings in my pocket, if he would put his hands into my pocket, and take them out, he was welcome to them, only to pay me another time; he was not very ready to do that; but his wife said, I will take it out of his pocket; she took eight shillings, which was all the silver I had; she wanted to return me three shillings, and she said five shillings was enough; I said, no, she must take all the eight. They had some papers in their hands, and they said, why you may as well burn these papers, and I saw him go to the fire, and burn some papers; the woman then opened her cloak, and laid down a box; the prisoner says, Mitchell, be so kind to let me leave this here till I return back, I shall soon be back; I said, yes, and welcome; then I took the box, and put it by for them: about two or three hours after, as near as I can tell, Mr. Weldon and another gentleman, and the prisoner, came to my house, and asked me whether such a thing had been left there as a box? I told him, yes, I shall give it; and I brought it to them, and I thought it was the people that were to come for it, as the prisoner had desired me to save it for him.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in? - I am a dealer in all kinds of jewellery and watches, every day, except those days that I dare not go out; I wish I had not been at home then.</p>
               <p>Had you the curiosity to look into the box? - No, Sir; but when the gentleman mentioned bonds, I recollected their burning papers.</p>
               <p>The man charged you with burning these papers? - I never burnt any; Mr. Weldon said to the prisoner, you did not burn them; says he, I suppose Mitchell burned them.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>According to your representation of it, you did not ask for any deposit? - None in the world.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Some time; I have done business with the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lend him money before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was you ready to let this man have these eight shillings, without security? - Upon my oath, I did not desire any security, nor never thought of any.</p>
               <p>Should you have let it go, without the eight shillings? - Certainly I should.</p>
               <p>And you did not look in the box? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in this jewellery business? - Fifteen years.</p>
               <p>You saw them burn some papers? - Yes, I heard one of them say, you may as well burn these papers.</p>
               <p>Now, you are generally pretty sharp men, and know the world very well, did not you think how this box was obtained? - I had no present thought at all.</p>
               <p>No suspicion in the world? - None in the world, because I had never heard any thing amiss of this man, nor of the other that was with him.</p>
               <p>Did you take any care for your own security about the box, was the box locked, or unlocked? - It was with a hasp.</p>
               <p>No cordage, or any thing? - It was loose.</p>
               <p>I wonder you was not a little apprehensive of permitting these people to leave a box at your house, without your knowing, or their seeing that you knew, what the things were that were in it? - I had no scruple; I was easily persuaded that it was locked.</p>
               <p>You are a most open, unsuspecting Jew as ever I met with? - I should be sorry it should be otherwise; for there is not a person in the world that will speak against me in any one respect whatever.</p>
               <p>Why, I confess it does require some explanation, when you saw these people burning papers, that you should take no notice of it, and that you should let them leave this box? - They might have gone a message, or many things, and desire to leave a thing there for a little while: this man had never been at my house before; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260063"/> other man said, then, says he, I did not know rightly whether it was in Castle-street, or Castle-court.</p>
               <p>And do you now really expect to be believed? - Why not; any person that is so well known as I am at the court end of the town by every body that knows me, why not trust me.</p>
               <p>From what I know of you, from this story, I promise you I will never leave a box at your house? - If you knew me, very likely you would not refuse leaving it, and there is no person that knows me, can say any thing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was fetched from the Adelphi to take this gentleman up and the boxes, and when I came there, the waiter and the servants brought out the boxes, and put them in the coach, and I went to Piccadilly; I took up another trunk behind; then they ordered me to No. 9, Orchard-street; when I came there, the footman got down, and opened the door, and I took the trunks and put them in the passage, and one of the gentlemen sat in the coach, and gave me the things out one by one; I carried them into the passage, and I carried the large trunks up stairs, and he gave me sixpence above my fare; when I came down, he asked the servant whether all the things were out, and the servant said yes; I said to the boy, you had better look, to be sure; he said, I know they are; I then altered one of the traces of my horses, which was too long; I went to Marybone tank, and put in there for two hours and an half: when I got off from there, I went to carry a servant, with some boxes and some bundles; I put them into the coach myself, and when I came to take them out, turning up the flap of the seat, I saw this box; I said, this is not your's, says I, I cannot say whose it is rightly, I have carried a gentleman with boxes and bundles, and another person with boxes to the Greenwich stage; I took out the box, and I waited for the advertisement; the next day, when it was advertised, I went to the gentleman's house; my wife carried home the box, and the gentleman was not at home, and they would not give her the reward; and then this other man came to me for some money, and I told him if he would go with me, he should have it; and coming down Oxford Road, I saw a coachman; he asked me how I was; I told him I was rather in trouble, and I told him the whole affair, and he asked me if I knew any thing of such a box, that there were hand-bills about, and I found it was the same, and I told him I had been home with it, and could not get the reward; I said I wanted a few shillings upon it for a day or two, or three, and the man took me to Mitchell's house; he was not at home, and we called again, and Mr. Mitchell came down, and this man told him I was in distress, and wanted a trifle of money, and he would be obliged to him to let me have it; he said he could not touch money, it was passover time; with that, my wife laid down the box to ease her arms, and he took the box, and opened it, and weighed the waiter, and took out the forks and the pins; then the book my wife took to take care of, and he opened the book and took the papers out of the left side of the book, and read them; they were papers stamped and sealed with red sealing-wax, and they were printed and signed with a writing hand; he then said, these are of no use to you, you had better burn them, and he took and put some papers in the fire, but whether he put them all in, I cannot say; then he said they might as well burn the others; with that, I put some little papers, some bills, or something of that kind, on the fire, and he put a coffee-pot on the fire, that they might burn; my wife took the eight shillings out of his pocket, and I came off and I came home, and then my mistress said the two gentlemen had been about the box.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first tell your mistress that you had the box? - On the Thursday.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell her till the Thursday? - I waited for the advertisement, and kept it in my own possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260064"/>What became of the gold shirt pin? - That was left in the box.</p>
               <p>What became of the callico drawers? - I cannot say, they were in the box, as far as I know, I never looked at the box but the night I took it home, then I looked at the waiter, and the spoons, and the pin.</p>
               <p>Is your master or mistress here? - I sent this morning but I was too late, I did not know my trial was to come on to day, he is out with the coach; I have sent for two gentleman to day, but whether they are come, I cannot say. (Called but nobody answered.) I have lived in Leather-lane these nine years.</p>
               <p>Court. As you had given notice to the gentleman in the morning by sending your wife with the box, how came you to suffer the Jew to burn any part of the papers? - I did not know he was going to burn any of the papers till they were in the fire.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Jew how you came by the box? - Yes I did, and that it was advertised.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that you had sent your wife that morning with it? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, in this case the prisoner had not taken possession of this box, the possession was thrown upon him by leaving the things in the coach; I shall take care, as far as it is a new case, to reserve it for the opinion of the twelve Judges, if you should be of an opinion upon the evidence, that there was that sort of fraudulent conduct in the prisoner, and that sort of case appears upon the evidence which would have amounted to stealing it; now although the conduct of keeping it till it is advertised to get the reward, is such as an honourable man would not pursue, yet as to question of crime it is another thing, such a box might be taken by a civil process out of the hands of a man who had found it; but as to the question of stealing, to be sure, such a man would not be guilty of stealing, because the original intention of stealing is essential: now if this man finding the box in his coach, and even having a shrewd guess who it belonged to, detained it in hopes of a reward, and then meant to carry it back; if you think that is the case, the prisoner ought to be acquitted; there is a probability, that when a man had found a box, he would uncord it to see what was in it; on the other hand if the prisoner uncorded the box with a view to embezzle some part of the contents, upon that ground of the case, I think it is proper for consideration, whether the man who is so guilty should not be reached as a felon; and if you find the prisoner guilty, I shall reserve it to be considered, whether it does amount to the crime of felony or not.</p>

About the latter end of July, I had occasion for a person in the capacity of an amanuensis, to transcribe various things that I used to send to the press; the prisoner was recomended to me as a person in great distress, but who belonged to a very respectable family, and whose misfortunes he had not contributed to by any bad action; he wrote a very good hand, and I employed him in that capacity; he had recourse to my chambers, copied for me, and went away; I being concerned in a house that was in Gravel-street Harton-garden, and unlet, I let him sleep at my chambers; I placed such an unlimitted confidence in him, that Ivery seldom went there; however having occasion to be there on the 27th of March, I desired him to be there and prepare the fire; I went there, and the first thing I observed was, that there was no carpet on the large parlour; I said where are my carpets? he said, I have taken them up, and put them in the next room; I thought it was so, I found no carpets there; I went into the kitchen, and, in short, in every room in the chambers, then I followed him where I had sent him, and desired him to come to the chambers, I told him; he very candidly then confessed that he had made away with them, and some stockings, various matrasses, a bolster, pillows, and in short a variety of articles, and he produced the pawnbroker's tickets, pawned at various places, and in the name of Mason, some were pawned at Mr. Cooper's; I immediately applied to Mr. Cokayne, an attorney, who lives in Lyon's-inn, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. By the account that is given of you, Sir, you must have known that you were not at liberty to make that sort of use of another person's property? - Yes, my Lord. I have sent to two or three people, but I did not expect my trial to come on so soon.</p>
               <p>What part of the world did you come from? - Originally from Spital-fields.</p>

               <p>Are you aware, that by your affecting not to know how these stolen goods came into your house, that you are disgracing yourself, and making yourself to be the thief? - I very often left the keys for my brother.</p>
               <p>So you insist upon it here, in the presence of your country, that you do not know how these things came there? - I never saw them come, nor ever knew they were there, nor was never told by any body they were there in my life.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, this witness said the three handkerchiefs, she bought them in Crispin-street; she also said at Justice Staples's that she knew of them, and that she would have blown him, but he was her own flesh and blood.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Pick out those two pieces of sheeting, and the piece for a pair of breeches out of the rest? - These are them.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>We have a piece in court, that did once measure forty-one yards, it now measures thirty-eight yards and an half.</p>
               <p>Then there is a quarter of a yard missing? - It was measured at Manchester, and the cotton goods frequently run up.</p>
               <p>Roberts. This is the piece to the best of my knowledge, except it has been changed, I never saw any of the goods except this piece, if this is the piece, or such a piece as this.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The piece of sheeting that was found in the box, and the piece that was found in the drawers will appear upon comparing, to be one piece, the mark was cut away.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the demin found? - I found it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>In which drawer was it found? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Are you a wholesale draper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not deal by retail at all. - No.</p>
               <p>Then that could not be sold in the regular course of business? - No; I believe this is a part of that piece, I have no doubt in the world; this piece was near to the compting house door, which is on the ground floor in the right hand warehouse, going into the door; it was returned; that was the reason of its being open in the state you see it.</p>
               <p>How much of the coarse sheeting did you find? - Thirty-nine yards and an half, in three pieces.</p>
               <p>Where was that coarse sheeting found? - Part of it in the drawers, and part of it in the box.</p>
               <p>Can you distinguish which was found in the drawer, and which in the box? - This was found in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Was the coarse linen you asked about, that which the prisoner said was his own, was it that piece or not? - To the best of my knowledge it was, it was something like that.</p>
               <p>Court to Macbean. There was no more coarse linen found in the drawers? - No.</p>
               <p>What induced you to believe that the piece of coarse linen that came out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260070"/> drawers is yours? - Because it has a mark upon it, the figure of 40.</p>
               <p>Whose mark is that? - It is marked in Scotland, and we had lost a piece, with the figure of 40, they are not all of the same length.</p>
               <p>Is 40 a usual length? - From 36 to 40, or 41, is the usual length.</p>
               <p>Then there might be a multitude of pieces with the mark 40 upon them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing else that induces you to believe it to be yours? - The quality.</p>
               <p>But there is a vast quantity of linen of that quality? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you can only say this has a mark of 40 as your piece had, and that this is the quality of your piece; can you go any farther as to this sheeting? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any other evidence to prove that the things so found at Roberts's, were brought by the prisoner at the bar? - Only by her confession, she now thinks fit to deny it; this wrapper was in the box which Roberts said was the prisoner's, which was locked, and we broke the lock.</p>
               <p>Who had the key of that box? - I do not know, the prisoner when he was taken, was not searched.</p>
               <p>Have you the direction you say was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Produce it.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. What did you say before the Alderman about the box? - I told him the box was in the house when we went there, that it belonged to one Williams, a lodger that had been.</p>
               <p>Who did you say had used it? - I do not know that I did, I could not tell that he had.</p>
               <p>Your examination is, that he knows not how it came there, and Jones told you he had used it? - To the best of my knowledge he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Then you venture to deny it? - I tell the truth to the best of my knowledge, I am sure I told the Alderman the truth.</p>
               <p>Did Jones tell you he had used the box? - Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>When and upon what occasion was it, that Jones told you that he used that box? - I do not know; when they went in, I told them there was nothing but a box there, I could not tell whether it was locked or not, I told them I did not know whether Jones made use of it or not.</p>
               <p>Consider first of all you said there was nothing there, because there was a parcel of pans and things that covered the box? - I told them the box was there, and there was nothing but the box.</p>
               <p>Had you seen that box before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At the time you first saw it, can you tell whether it had any direction upon it? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Look upon that direction? - This direction to the best of my recollection came out of the country upon a hare and turkey.</p>
               <p>Was the hare and turkey brought to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I do not know; Mr. Macbean had the hare, I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>(The direction handed up to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Take that into your hand, and consider a little what you say; look at it again, and tell me whether, upon your oath, that direction came with a hare and turkey? - It did, my Lord.</p>
               <p>There are nail holes in it? - It was sewed to the basket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Macbean. There was a bit of basket to it, when I found it.</p>
               <p>How was it fastened to it? - I rather think it was sewed.</p>
               <p>As this was a box that you say you had seen before, and that your brother might say he had used it, how came it to be thrust into that place? - We had no place to put things in, and we used to put kettles and saucepans, and things upon it, we had no room to put it any where else, neither under the bed or the drawers.</p>
               <p>Court to Macbean. What were the articles that were in this box? - This wrapper has a mark upon it.</p>
               <p>What is that mark? - Thirty-three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260071"/> yards and a quarter; the witness,

               <p>They are your figures, are they? - Yes, for Mr. Macbean.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Macbean. Where did that wrapper use to be? - In the lower room.</p>
               <p>Howes. I left Mr. Macbean four months ago.</p>
               <p>How long before that, did you make that mark? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Macbean. These seven handkerchiefs, we had lost several dozen of the same pattern, but I cannot identify them; and here is the remaining part of the sheeting.</p>
               <p>Do these two parts belong to one piece? - I believe they are belonging, the exact quantity measuring thirty-nine yards and a half; there was a mark on the outside which is cut out, which makes up the other half yard; the number is on the outside of the sheeting, folded up like a book.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of them, I never knew they belonged to Mr. Macbean.</p>
               <p>The particular marks you are called upon to give an answer to, are the sheeting, and the two yards and a quarter of cotton demin, and the things that were found in the box? - I never put none of them, neither in the drawer or the box, nor did I take them there.</p>
               <p>You told your sister that the coarse sheeting was your's? - I was sitting by the fire, and she asked me, what is this put here for; I thought she meant a dirty shirt; and I said it was mine.</p>
               <p>What did you say as to the demin; did you say it was for a pair of breeches? - I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>As to the box? - I never used it, I never went out of the house of a Sunday morning before his hair-dresser knocked at the door, and the hair-dresser was angry because I would not get up sooner of a morning; and I never went out on business of my own, without his notice, while I lived with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Roberts, how long has the prisoner been in London? - About four months, he came from Wales.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 1st of April, having been out about ten minutes, I was informed, on my return, that two shop-lifrers had been at the shop; I ordered the shop to be shut up, and standing at my door, I was informed the two girls were gone into another haberdasher's just by, and I heard the prisoner Johnson say to the other, it will not do; so they went on a few doors farther, and they stopped suddenly, and Johnson said to the other, let us go back: after a pause of about a minute or two, they turned round; I let them pass me, and as they passed me, she said, I will buy, but God bless you, mind you are not seen; I concluded from that they were going into the haberdasher's shop, and I intended to watch them; but they passed it, and went into my shop, and the prisoner Johnson asked to look at a piece of cloth she saw when she was there before; she was shewn it, and made no difficulty about the price or quality, but upon the quantity; at last, she determined on buying a yard and a quarter of it; there were some printed cotton stockings lay upon the counter; I did not see either of them take any thing; Johnson paid, and they went out together, but I suspected Cole to have something, and I observed her to make a move with her arm, as if she wanted to throw something away, and she let fall a parcel of stockings, nine pair, with my mark upon the paper; I am sure of the property.</p>

             opened the warehouse first, it was a few minutes after I came down; I went and looked, and the piece was gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. What part of the counter did you see these goods on? - Almost at the further end of the warehouse, furthest from the street, under a press in a large hole, where there is nothing but lumber.</p>
               <p>Is that part of the warehouse a good deal frequented by the persons in your trade? - Yes; by our own people.</p>
               <p>Did not you recommend to Mr. Hotham or his partner to lay some plan, which I call some trap, and this particular plan to put this piece of goods under the counter? - No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Recollect? - I do not know whether Mr. Hotham bid me put it, or that I recommended it.</p>
               <p>Where were these goods taken from before they were put under the counter? - Out of a hole, a partition of about five or six yards from the place, and it was found by me under the press.</p>
               <p>At the time you found it there you suspected it to be put there for the purpose of being taken away by Jones? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it put there again for the purpose of being taken away by him? - It was put there to see what he would do with it; we expected it would be carried away by him; it was certainly put there to see whether he would carry it away.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Hotham? - Five years.</p>
               <p>How long did Jones live there? - About four years.</p>
               <p>Upon what terms have you lived together? - We have always lived on very friendly terms, only sometimes we quarrelled.</p>

               <p>I was requested to keep a look out, and on Wednesday morning I was in Grace-church-street before Mr. Hotham's warehouse was open; I saw the porter open the warehouse; a little time afterwards, I saw a man come from the door with a parcel; there is a court very near the warehouse; the man turned up the court, and I followed him; in that court there are several turnings different ways, and he escaped me; from the description I gave of his person it was supposed to be Davis; I went with the officer and Mr. Robinson, as soon as I saw Davis, I said it was him.</p>
               <p>Was it him? - I never was nearer him than fifteen yards, he was in the same dress, to the best of my knowledge it was him; I was present when the goods were found; they were found in Davis's apartments in a box near the fire.</p>
               <p>Was the box locked or open? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How did you know the apartment you searched was Davis's? - I did not know they were his, the constable directed me to them; Davis was present in the apartment; he said he had bought the goods of some person, but I do not know who; he looked out a great many bills of parcels, but did not find the particular one that contained these goods; there were two pieces of goods found there.</p>
               <p>Did he say he bought those pieces of goods before or after they were found? - After they were found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner Davis's counsel. You do not pretend to any knowledge of the prisoner Davis? - I saw him when we searched that apartment.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to be understood that he was the man that came out of the house? - I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the bills of parcels? - No.</p>

               <p>The servant-maid was the last up; she is not here; I always fastened the shop-window myself, and locked the two doors; there are two doors into the shop: the next morning, about five, we were alarmed by the neighbours that the shop was broke open; I got up, and went into the shop, and found the tiles and ceiling of the shop broken, and the leads both, and somebody had got in between the rafters; the shop adjoins to the house, but there is no room over it; there was room enough for a man to come through; I looked round the shop, and found two drawers open, one the till, and another; and I missed a number of different articles, and some silk articles which lay in the window. There was nothing done till about a quarter after seven in the morning, when Mr. Black came up to desire me to come down to the Feathers, that there was a suspicious man there; when I came there, we went up into the room where the prisoner and his wife were, and the first thing we discovered, in searching the room, was a Cheshire cheese under the bed; the next thing that I could swear to, was a snuff-box that lay on a chair in the prisoner's room; after that, the prisoner was searched; there was a piece of money found in his pocket; the prisoner said it was a crown piece when he took it out, but it was my medal.</p>
               <p>In which pocket? - I believe the right-hand breeches-pocket; I do not recollect any thing else being found: his wife was then searched, and all the rest of the articles, except a watch, were found upon her.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say for himself? - He said he had not been out; he said nothing more; we found the watch, on coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260085"/> back, which was in the cage where the prisoner was confined, before we took him to Bow-street; I saw it found.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the cage when he was there? - Nobody else, nor before, that I know of. I know nothing further.</p>

               <p>About six o'clock, on the 1st of April, I heard this shop had been broke open, and my suspicion fell on the prisoner, because I was sent for the Thursday before about him; I got assistance to help me; I sent for Mr. Fuller, to enquire what he had lost, before I took him; I went up in the room, and took him; he lodged at the Feathers.</p>
               <p>How long had he lodged there? - Not a fortnight; he had lodged at the Red Lion about six or eight weeks before he came there; I had seen him before; I do not know his business. The first thing that was found, was a snuff-box on the chair; I went to search him; he said he had a crown piece; I took it out, and Mr. Fuller said he would swear to it; I felt in his other pocket, and I believe there were some seals there, but I do not particularly recollect them; it was a japan'd snuff-box; after I had searched him, I told his wife I should search her; she said, it is of no use to keep it any longer; so she pulled out these things out of her pocket, and the buckles and pap-spoon, and tea-spoon, and this case and some of the seals, and some loose silver, which was tied up in this glove, I found in a box in the room; he said he had not been out that morning; I said I knew he had, his breeches were all over mortar; the watch I could not find about him then, though I believe I was flurried, and did not feel on the right side; when I came back, I found they were afterwards in the cage.</p>

               <p>Had any body else been in the cage between that time? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it that you looked in the cage? - As soon as we came back from Bow-street; it might be about three, it was in the afternoon of the same day; here is a leather purse I found in a box with Mr. Fuller's name upon it in his own hand writing, that was in the box in the room with the loose silver.</p>

               <p>I live at Brentford, at the Feathers; the prisoner lodged at my house about eight days; I remember the night this robbery was committed, the prisoner went out about a quarter after four in the morning, as nigh as I can guess; I never saw him till about seven, then he came in.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him bring any thing with him about that time? - He had something in a white cloth he carried in his hand, but what I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did he use to go out so early? - I never saw him go out so early before.</p>
               <p>What employment had he at your house? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he work at any thing? - I cannot really say he did, he was there so short a time.</p>
               <p>It was pretty near day-light, when you let him out in the morning? - Yes, it was break of day.</p>
               <p>(The snuff-box deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It lay in the till; I saw it forty or fifty times a day.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me look at it, it is an old box, a good deal worn.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260086"/>Then from the marks and appearance of it do you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of its being your's? - Not the least in the world; these rings were taken out of the same drawer; the two gold rings lay in a box, where there was some silver and halfpence, the diamond ring was in a box wrapped up in a paper; I have no doubt of the box and the rings.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Fuller deposes to them.)</p>
               <p>This purse is mine; I do not know the watch, this was a watch pledged on the Friday; there was a watch the night before in the drawer, and it was gone in the morning; I can swear to the silver medal.</p>
               <p>What is it a medal of? - Something of a battle; that lay in the same drawer where the two gold rings lay.</p>
               <p>What was the device on the medal you lost? - There was some man on horseback.</p>
               <p>And what woman, do you know? - I do not know, Diana, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Court. No, it is Anna, not Diana; how long have you had it? - Ever since I can remember.</p>
               <p>Have you never taken notice what the medal was? - No.</p>
               <p>How can you swear to it? - By seeing it constantly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fuller. I cannot say I know the medal; I have seen it a number of years in that same drawer; I know this little toothpick case; I do not know the handkerchiefs, otherwise than seeing them lay in the window; I know the ear-rings and buckles; I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>What may the value of these things be that are found at a low valuation? - About five guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I am as innocent of the robbery, as a young child.</p>
               <p>How did these things come into your possession? - A man brought them, and delivered them to me in the street; I asked him, whether I should come to any harm by them? he said, no; he delivered them to me; I cannot have my witnesses here till to-morrow, or Monday; or else I have witnesses where I was at the time the robbery was done; I went out to work at a gentleman's house, after a job of work; I am a day labouring man.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Name all the articles that are there? - A pair of silver buckles, four tea-spoons, one pap-spoon, a diamond ring, two plain gold rings, a pair of garnet ear-rings, and a silver watch, three silver seals, and a silver tooth-pick case, a quantity of old silver, and a silver medal.</p>

            ; my husband is a blacksmith, and lives in Rose and Crown court, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>How long did the prisoner and his wife lodge in that house? - Nine months, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Where did you sup on Thursday night the 17th of March? - On the Thursday night, I had supped before I went to sup with the prisoner; he came in on the evening of the Thursday night, as near as I can guess, about ten, and he went up stairs, one pair of stairs higher, and he came down rather displeased, because supper was not done, and said, he would go out and get a pint of beer; but he did not go out; when he came in he made up to the draft-board, where there was a hat hanging; my husband said he would not have him go out that night but come in and sit down with him while the supper was ready; there was a bonnet hung up by the draft-board, and he pointed to it with his stick; he said, he thought it was a woman; bless me, says he, how I am deceived; then he sat down with my husband and me in our kitchen; then he said, he would send for a pot of beer, before the house was shut up, and he gave our apprentice the money, and he said he would go up stairs, and my husband should go with him; my husband had supped; and he said, never mind that Evans, you shall go up stairs with me.</p>
               <p>Was the pot of beer drank below? - No; the prisoner took it up stairs himself; then my husband followed him, by the desire of the prisoner, and I went with them; by that time supper was ready, and we four sat down to supper; and we supped, to all outward appearance, very agreeably; he helped his wife to a bit of the pork; when we had supped, it was a little after eleven; then my husband shook hands with the prisoner, and we both went into the next room; and was called again about one by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What sort of a call was it? - Mrs. Evans; when I went in, and when I came in, he said to me, now do you believe there is a man in bed with her; and I said Simpson, what are you talking of, there is nobody in bed with her; he said, they were gipsies, and had been singing under the window the whole night.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time look into the bed to see if there was any body there? - Oh, yes, there was nobody but the deceased in the bed; he then said if you will not believe, go to bed; for you will see more of them come up stairs; then I went to bed; then I was called up again about four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you go to sleep? - I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>What was the call then? - Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Evans, for God's sake come in.</p>
               <p>Whose voice was that? - Both parties, Mrs. Simpson that is dead, and the prisoner; I got up and went into the room, and when I came into the room, the prisoner stood on the off side of the bed, in his shirt, with his breeches, shoes, and stockings on; he was undressed in the same manner at one o'clock when I went in; she was in bed; I said, what is the matter with you Mrs. Simpson; and she said, he would neither sleep himself, nor let her go to rest; then he put his hand very coolly into his pocket, and pulled out a knife; I immediately cried murder.</p>
               <p>Into his breeches pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a knife was it? - A clasp pen-knife.</p>
               <p>Was it clasped when he took it first out? - Yes, it was, and I cried murder; he opened the knife, and I repeated murder for God's sake; and he said to the deceased, d - n you, you bitch, I will run you through; then the prisoner made the knife to the left side, open, as she lay on her right side.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the prisoner making the knife to the left side? - He made it to the left side, as though he was going to give the wound; but I did not know that he had.</p>
               <p>Take the knife into your hand, and make a motion, in the manner he did? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260088"/> He held it in his right hand, and made a motion with the blade of the knife to the side.</p>
               <p>Where did he stand? - At the upper end of the bed, and looked exactly at her who lay in the bed.</p>
               <p>Then you being on the opposite side, could see distinctly the motion he made? - Yes, his face was towards her; he looked at her, he did not look at me; as near as I can recollect, it was the right side.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect which hand it was he took the knife out of his pocket with? - He certainly must take it with his left hand.</p>
               <p>Is he left handed or right handed? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Which hand did he open the knife with? - As near as I can tell, he must hold it in his left hand, and open it with his right; that is, as near as I can think; but my flurry was so great, I can hardly answer.</p>
               <p>What, did the woman lay covered? - She lay with the clothes mousled like from her shoulder; she was a very lusty woman.</p>
               <p>Were the clothes off from her left, or her right shoulder? - Her left shoulder.</p>
               <p>How low down might the clothes be off? - As near as I could see, with my fright and flurry, they were laid down off her shoulder.</p>
               <p>When he made a push towards her side, was it to the lower part of her side, or the upper part? - I cannot say; seeing no blood follow, I thought nothing of it; then Mrs. Simpson turned round immediately upon her back, and looked up at the prisoner, and said, Simpson are you going to murder me, and he immediately took the knife, and thrust it as she lay on her back, in the small part of her nose; she lay with her head rather turned; then the blood followed there in a most violent manner.</p>
               <p>Did he use any expression when he made that thrust? - None that I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing upon receiving that wound? - Nothing; I never heard her mention any thing.</p>
               <p>What did not she cry out? - They neither of them said a word.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - Upon my word I cannot recollect that I spoke, except to my lodgers, who came down stairs, they lodge in the garret; my husband came and stood at the door, and he said, Simpson, what have you done, have you cut your wife's throat; and he made no answer.</p>
               <p>What became of the knife? - He came round while I was washing the blood off her nose; Simpson came round to the place where I stood; I had the deceased's head on my arm, and was washing the blood off her nose, and was trying to stop it; then the prisoner came round to my side with the knife in his hand, and I said, Mr. Simpson, I wish you would give me this knife, upon which he gave it me; it was open when he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Was there any blood upon it? - Upon my word in that confusion I cannot say; I gave it to my husband, as he stood at the door; then with the assistance of my lodgers, we took her and helped her into the next room, into my child's bed, for fear any thing should ensue; I took her thinking if there was any thing of passion, she had better be out of the way.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of either of them being in a passion? - None, that I saw at that time, in either of them.</p>
               <p>Did the man appear to be in a passion when you first came into the room? - No, but what I made mention of; he looked in a very fierce terrible manner.</p>
               <p>Different from what he used to look? - Yes, Sir; I never saw him commit such a rash action before; he looked in a very troubled bad situation; I never saw him look so before.</p>
               <p>Did you put any clothes upon her before you moved her? - I put her on a clean shift; that was dirty on account of the blood and the water.</p>
               <p>Where did you shift her? - In her own room.</p>
               <p>In doing that, you did not take notice of her having received a hurt in her side?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260089"/>- No; after I got her into my room, I asked him if he had not better go to bed, he came to the door, and made answer, he should not go into that bed to night.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said during the time you was shifting her, by either the prisoner or the deceased? - No; she never made any complaint at all.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of him after he said he should not go to bed that night? - He had his clothes on, and I said, he had better go to bed to his wife, and I said, I would make the child get up and come into our bed, which was in the same room; he laid down by his wife, and I believe he lay about ten minutes, I cannot recollect there was any thing said by either of them; then after I was settled in bed, he got up and blew my candle out that stood on the drawers, I said Simpson, this will never do, I shall not lay here in the dark, and I got up and struck a light, at that time he got off the bed, after I struck a light, and got out in the passage; he was disturbed and troubled in his mind as I thought; I cannot recollect any thing more of the circumstance, till after he had been out in the morning, and had been in again, which was about eight o'clock, then he came into the room, and he said, remember, Mrs. Evans, I gave you the knife.</p>
               <p>Where was his wife? - In bed; he said you have my knife; I said yes, but I do not choose to give it you; with that he said, never mind it; and he went out of the room, and went into his own room, and soon after he came out of his own room and came to my door again, with a pair of new buckskin breeches in his hand, and his plain shirt; and he said he was going to the Halfmoon, in Halfmoon-alley, at

            's; I saw no more of him the sore part of the day, till eleven or twelve; then he came into the room where his wife lay; and said, I believe one of her eyes is out; and I said, no Simpson, her eyes are as well as your's, it is only the wound in her nose; says he, I must send for a surgeon; then he went down stairs again, and nothing passed at that time; then I went out, and went to her friend to let him know the situation she was in, a gentleman where she used to have her trifle from; the gentleman said, I must get her advice for what was wanting, and he would give it me; I came home, and went and fetched a surgeon; by this time it was about two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This friend used to pay her her annuity? - Yes; then I went to Mr. M'Larching in the Fields; he was not at home, he did not come to his time; then I sent for him again; he said he could not come; and she complained of being sore all over, then I sent for Mr. Taylor, that was about seven, or after seven, I cannot say justly; she said one of her ribs was very sore, and Mr. Taylor put his hand into her bosom, and felt it, and said, swelled indeed! and he bid me bring a candle, and he examined where she complained, and there he found the wound; that was the first time the wound was discovered; he took an instrument into his hand, and examined the wound, and I said, I hope it is not so deep as that; and he said it was, and he ordered me to make a poultice directly, which I did with bread and milk, and hog's lard; he ordered her a draught to compose her, and she slept, as near as I can recollect, near half an hour; then she grew worse and worse the whole night till the morning, when she expired.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning did she die? - At half after six on the Saturday morning; the whole night she lay in great agonies; she said, God forgive him, for I do; they asked her if she had any body to send to, and she said no; she said her misery was so great, she could not live many hours.</p>
               <p>When was this man taken up? - He was rather obstrepelous; she was then alive, and he said he would go up stairs to see his wife; I said, well, Simpson, you shall go up, and he sat down quite composed, to all appearance, and as soon as I went down, he pulled the pillow from her head, and mousled the clothes; I found them sowhen I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260090"/>You told me, that after he had said he would not sleep in that bed that night, he went out, and you do not recollect seeing him till the morning, when he said, Mrs. Evans, remember I gave you my knife? - It was after he went out, he had the buckskin breeches, and after he had said one of her eyes was out, I had been to her friend; when he came in that night, I was in the kitchen, I went up with him, and when he came up, he seemed very composed; he sat down by the bed-side; there was nothing of anger or passion, and I seeing every thing was quiet, went down.</p>
               <p>How long was you down stairs? - Upon my word I cannot say; I left him there while I went out for a surgeon the first time; and when I returned, I went up to the deceased, and he was down in the kitchen; how he got down, or by what means, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When you went up, what state was she in? - I found the clothes half way down as she lay in bed, and I saw the pillow laying at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased say any thing at that time about his coming up? - She said he had been pulling the pillow about, and she had rather not see him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the particular expression she made use of? - She made use of none; says she, do not pother me, Simpson, let me alone; that was when he was talking about her eye being out. I hope, my Lord, if I am mistaken, you will be so good as to excuse it, it is a heavy affair, she was as good as a mother to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What age was the woman? - Fifty-two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Evans, these two people have lodged in your house for nine months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know from what place they came to lodge with you? - Yes, out of Ludgate prison.</p>

               <p>Do you know how long they had been there? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You have said you never saw him behave to before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Upon what terms did they live together during the nine months you observed their conduct? - Very happy.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him beat her? - No; but I have said to her I would go to my friends; says she, Mrs. Evans, if I came to you for my support, then you should speak; if I like it, who has any business, my five shillings a week will always keep me.</p>
               <p>You say they lived well together? - Yes; his wife lodged with him in the prison backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>This poor man, I believe, has had a great deal of misfortune, and five shillings a week was all they had to live on? - That I cannot say; five shillings was all she had; she was always contented.</p>
               <p>What was the state of his health at the time this happened? - He was ill, to be sure; it was the first time of his going out.</p>
               <p>How had he been confined, had he any assistance from any body of medical prosession, at the time he came in, in the evening, to your room first; I wish you would describe a little more particularly to my Lord what he said about the hat? - He said he thought it had been a woman.</p>
               <p>Did not he say he had caught one at least, or any thing of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you ever heard him talk in that way before, about catching gipsies, or men in bed? - No, never before.</p>
               <p>They supped together very agreeably? - Yes, to all outward appearance.</p>
               <p>It was the prisoner that called you up the first time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the first thing he said to you, was, now, do you believe I have caught a man in bed with her; to which you answered, no, there is nobody in bed with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then what reply did he make? - He said there were gipsies under the bed singing.</p>
               <p>Was that the time he talked about the trap-door? - I come here as much on one side as the other; I do not come to tell you what other people have said.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - Something that it was a bad house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260091"/>There was no complaint made by the wife, till he took the knife out of his pocket? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>What was the expression? - He will neither sleep himself, nor let me sleep.</p>
               <p>Did she say, he cannot sleep, or he will not sleep? - She said, he will not sleep.</p>
               <p>You cried-out, murder! how did you perceive him to look? - When I see a man in bed, sitting in that manner, and taking a knife out of his pocket, I had but little thought how the man looked; when he opened it, I cried murder, for God's sake!</p>
               <p>After he put the knife towards her side, it was that she asked him quietly whether he was going to murder here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he went out of the room, did he take a light? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his coming in at five, and saying he would go to the Spread Eagle? - I cannot tell the time.</p>
               <p>Did you see him before he went out on that day? - I did not.</p>
               <p>This annuity entirely ceased on the death of the wife? - It did.</p>
               <p>What was the man's business? - A barber and hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>How long before this did you see him? - I saw him in bed the day before.</p>
               <p>What time of day was that? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Morning or afternoon? - After dinner.</p>
               <p>Did he keep his bed? - He was in bed, but I never was in his room, except just asking how he did; I had no occasion to speak to him in the course of that week; his wife said he had a cold.</p>
               <p>Before that time, he behaved himself decently and soberly? - Soberly I cannot say; but sober or not, he always behaved well.</p>
               <p>Was he apt to be in liquor? - Like other people.</p>
               <p>Was he given to drink? - As every other man in business.</p>
               <p>There are some men that are sober men, there are other men that are often in liquor; which was he? - I must leave it to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>How do I know; I never saw the man in my life before, good woman? - I must needs say, I believe he was in liquor a pretty deal, or else he never would have made away with what he has made away with.</p>
               <p>Are you able to judge that night, when he came in, and when he mistook the hat for a woman, was he sober or not? - I may safely say then he was sober.</p>
               <p>When he was in liquor, how did he behave? - I never saw him any ways outrageous till that night.</p>
               <p>Had he, when in liquor, any tendency to be mischievous? - I never observed any thing of that kind.</p>

The prisoner came home on the Thursday night about ten, or rather before; he went up into his own room, and found fault with his wife, because she had not dressed his supper; they had a few words, but what they were I do not know; he came down into my apartment, and I desired him to fit down, and have a drop of beer.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - Sober; I asked him to sit down, and next to the draft board that I have hanging in the room, there was a hat hung, and he makes to the hat, and said, God bless my soul! I thought it had been a woman, and he drew back again; after that, he sat down, and called for a pot of beer; we drank part of it; in the course of half an hour afterwards, he said, Evans, you may as well go up to supper; says I, Mr. Simpson, I have had my supper before, nevertheless, I will go up with you; he took the pot of beer into his own hand, and we went up stairs together into his own room; he sat down, and there was a bit of loin of pork roasting, and he turned it round, and basted it, and he took it up, and desired his wife to lay a cloth; and she said she had none; my wife fetched a cloth of her own, and laid it for her; they took the meat up, and had their supper; after supper, about half after eleven, we left them in good friendship, and went to our bed; I heard no more till about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260092"/> one; about one, Mrs.

               <p>When he followed her, did he say any thing? - Not to my knowledge; after that, in about a few minutes they called, I awaked my wife, and she went to the room to them; and what they said, I do not know; I went to sleep; but after that, between three and four, the prisoner got out of bed again, and called, watch, watch, watch, several times over; I thought he was going down stairs, in the room of that he went up stairs, in my boy's garret, and what he did there, I do not know; I kept my own apartment; after that he came down, I called to him as he passed my room door, Simpson, why do you not go to bed; and he went into his own room, and in a few minutes after that, they both called.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts did he stand when you came in? - In the middle of the room partly.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In his breeches and stockings.</p>
               <p>Any shoes on? - I will not be sure; the deceased sat on the side of the bed, all of a gore of blood; I said to him, Simpson, what have you cut your wifes's throat? and I drew back again; she said, she has got three men in bed with her now; do not you see them there now, these are gipsies, says he, I am sure they are; and they have got a trap door behind the bed, I am sure of it; whereas my Lord, there is no such thing as a trap door; my wife and lodger washed the deceased's face, and washed the blood off, and put a clean shift on, took her into my room and put her to bed to my girl; in a little time he came into the room, and I said to him for God's sake what is the matter with you, go to bed; he said, I will not get in there any more; I said, go then and lay down by your wife, and he did; during this time, the wife said nothing; then he got up and blew out the candle I had in my room; I said then to him, Simpson, if you cannot be quiet, go out of doors; accordingly my wife struck a light, and he went out; he went up stairs into the garret again, there I heard him make a noise, I jumped out of bed, and went up to him, he came down stairs, and went out of doors; my boy let him out; at about eight, he came back again; I was in bed, and he said, that he had been to the Spread-Eagle, in Bishopsgate-street, and had been tried there for killing a man; he had killed a man, he said he knew he had killed a man, and struck him through the ribs; and, says he, running through the street, after I got away, a man went to shoot me with a gun, but says he, I got away from him; then after that, he goes to Mr. Wood's that keeps a publick house in Halfmoon-alley, and carried a pair of breeches, and a shirt there; a little time after Mr. Wood and he came past my window, and Mr. Wood asked me if I would go and have a glass of any thing to drink; and we went to the Horse and Groom, the corner of Moor-fields; we had a glass each of us, and came away at about one, as nigh as I can recollect; he came back again; I was at dinner, I asked him to have a bit, he said no, then says I, have you been to the bankers? no, says I, you shall not go, I will go, or my wife shall; he directly started up in a rage, and said he would go to

               <p>When he was in the kitchen with you, had you any conversation with him, or had your wife? - No; when he came back again, I was resolved to see what he had, whether he had pistols or no; we searched him, me and another man, and I found he had nothing in his pockets at all; with that, says he, shall not I go and see my wife again? says I, go up stairs, and he went up stairs, and came down again, and I heard my wife say, he had used her very rough; and I thought it proper to chargean officer with him; and we took him to Mr. Wilmot's; and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Did any thing particular pass at the Justice's? - No; he said he had killed a man.</p>
               <p>When was the second examination? - On Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Before, or after the woman was dead? - After, she died about five o'clock; she said that Simpson had done for her; and she hoped God would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had not then any idea that the woman had received the mortal wound? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say before the Justice? - I cannot say; the next day he was examined again, and he said, he had caught a man in bed with his wife, whose name was Williamson; and that he had killed him; that was a second time.</p>
               <p>Had he and his wife had any words? - I did not hear that they had, I did not hear what had passed between them.</p>
               <p>When they supped they were then sociable and agreeable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately before he came home had you seen him, before he made a push at the draft board, and in what state did he appear to be? - Very bad; he said, he had a violent cold about him, and was in a very bad situation.</p>
               <p>You awaked by an out-cry before Mrs. Simpson came in? - No, Sir; Mrs. Simpson came in first; that was the first thing that awaked me.</p>
               <p>What answer did Simpson give you, when you desired him to go into his own room? - He said to my wife, that the gipsies were singing under the window.</p>
               <p>Have you ever said any where, that upon your desiring him to go to bed, that he gave you this for answer; that there were gipsies in the bed, and that they had a trap door behind the bed? - He did the second time.</p>
               <p>Whether on the first time of their coming in, he did not give that answer? - Not then he did not; after he got into his own room I heard him say so, before four o'clock; I heard him say so twice, both at the first time, and at four o'clock, I heard the prisoner calling the watch, I observed nothing to call the watch for; I desired him to go to bed.</p>
               <p>What sort of a noise did you hear in the garret? - A kind of rumbling of chairs, and things.</p>
               <p>At the time he said she has three men in bed with her, do not you see them, you had no idea she had received a mortal wound? - No; only the wound in the nose; at the time he came from the Spread-Eagle, he said he had laid there all night, that he had been tried for killing a man, and had been acquitted; he said he had a bunch of white ribbons, and he would bring them home for my wife to wear.</p>
               <p>Had he any? - No; the prisoner and his wife lived together very happy and very agreeable, as a man and woman need to do; this annuity was a principal part of their support; she was a very affectionate good worthy woman, and very tender of him.</p>
               <p>Did she ever complain of any ill treatment or brutality? - No, none in the least; only about four in the morning, just as they were going to bed she said, Simpson has done for me, and God forgive him.</p>

               <p>I am the husband of the last witness; on the 17th of March last, about three or four in the morning, or before that, I was awaked by the prisoner calling repeatedly to Mrs. Evans; Mrs. Evans got up to know what was the matter; he came out and went down stairs, and called watch, then he went up stairs, and threw down several things; the boy asked him what he wanted, he said he would let him know what he wanted; he asked t he boy where he was, the boy said at Mr. Evans's; he said no, he was at the Spread-Eagle; he went down, and went to his room; in a few minutes Mrs. Evans cried out, murder, murder, murder, Evans; I jumped out of bed immediately and ran down, when I came down, the deceased was sitting on the bed-side, in her shift, with her hand on her forehead, and all bloody; the prisoner was there, with his breeches, and shoes and stockings on, he looked at me in a very wild manner; they were going to wash her, but I returned; soon after that he came out of his room again, and came up a second time, and then Mr. Evans being a good deal exasperated, pulled or pushed him down, for making an uproar in his house; he then returned to his room; soon after he went up again to go to bed; Mrs. Evans hearing that, called her apprentice and I up; I heard him say to the boy, which way are they gone now? but, however, the boy shut the door, and I heard no more of him, I went to work for the day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say when you went into the room to him, he was in a very distracted state? - Yes, Sir, I spoke to him, he only stared at me.</p>

               <p>Did you probe it, Sir? - Yes, Sir, and I suppose the probe might pass about an inch and an half, but finding an obstruction I did not pass it any further; I sent her a draught, I never saw her after.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of the man? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon, at No. 39, in Shoreditch; I examined the body at the desire of the parish officers; I discovered a wound on the nose, just at the junction of the bonds that form the nose to the bones of the forehead; the knife had entered just in the suture, where they join; it had penetrated a very little way; she had also a wound on the left side, between the seventh and eight ribs; the appearance of a large extravasation of blood under the skin; the external skin was formed into several blisters, containing a dark red fluid; I then opened the abdomen, or belly; I did not discover any thing particular in an unhealthful state, except a slight inflammation in the small intestines; afterwards we opened the breast or thorax, we discovered the wound between the seventh and eight ribs, about sixteen ounces, or thereabouts, of coagulated blood, in the left cavity of the breast; and also that some sharp instrument had entered the lungs; they shewed me a knife, and it appeared to have been some such kind of instrument; it had entered about a quarter of an inch, or near half an inch into the lungs; from the air escaping from the lungs, it had got underneath the skin, and had swelled the body up to a considerable degree above its natural size.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the ribs? - Yes; I also found, that it had divided an intercostal artery running along the inferior edge of the seventh rib.</p>
               <p>Was that in the direction of the wound? - Yes; it had passed with violence against the ribs, and there was a small notch made in the ribs.</p>
               <p>What do you suppose to be the cause of this poor woman's death? - The wound, and the consequence of that wound was the cause of her death.</p>

               <p>Court. Could you form any judgment whether any blood had passed outwardly? - I think there must have been some, but perhaps not much.</p>
               <p>Could you form any judgment how long that wound might have been given? - No, my Lord; externally, it appeared to have the appearance of an incipient gangreen or mortification.</p>
               <p>Is this intercostal artery that you describe a large vessel, or a small one? - Not a large one; perhaps about the diameter of a crow's quill.</p>
               <p>Were the mouths of the vessels choaked by the coagulated blood? - The vessels were quite divided; there was no blood in the vessels at that time; there was a large quantity of blood underneath the skin, so as to spread all down that side, and to the right side, and down part of the thigh, it was black all the way.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You hear the charge and the evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot make any defence for myself; I do not recollect any thing of it, upon any account.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not recollect any of the circumstances? - No, I do not recollect supping at home at all.</p>

               <p>I am a perfumer in Fleet-street; I have known the prisoner fourteen years.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you had occasion to travel with him? - I cannot exactly recollect the time; it is either between four or five, or five and six years; we went first to Lynn, and then to Cambridge.</p>
               <p>In the course of that journey, did you observe any thing particular in the conduct of the prisoner? - At Yarmouth he was taken ill of a nervous complaint, a trembling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260096"/> and shaking; I sent for a gentleman, who gave him something; one of the mixtures was Hoxton's Tincture of Bark; when we got to Lynn, we slept in a double-bedded room, at the Duke's Head, in the Market-place; about four in the morning, or at least early in the morning, he waked, and said he had heard groaning and mournings all night, and could not possibly sleep, and wondered how I could sleep; I was astonished; he was out of bed, and walking about the room; I desired to go to sleep again, but he would not let me; he seemed uneasy in his mind from the road to Cambridge; when I had him in the chaise, he used to say, do you not hear the singing; what the devil do they sing for; sure you must hear them singing; do stop the chaise.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what sort of music it was? - Singing; he described one song to be Yankie doodle dandie; he hummed the tune to me.</p>
               <p>Did you apply for any other medical assistance, in the course of your journey? - No; in the evening at the Red Lion at Cambridge, I had a friend that supped with me, and as soon as he was gone, the prisoner was sitting in the room, and he started back in the chair, with his eye fixed full on the window, which was shut with outside shutters; says I, what is the matter with you? - says he, do not you see a woman looking at me through the window? I said, I see no such thing indeed; how can you be so ridiculous; I thought him very strange and wild again; some time after, he repeated the same thing, do not you see the woman again; she has now got a pair of spectacles on: I was very glad when I brought him to town.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate this to his wife? - I do not recollect, in particular; but I told every body that knew him, that I had any occasion to speak to about it, because it was so extremely strange and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be a person disturbed in his senses? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>Now, as to his character for humanity, as far as you have had an opportunity of that coming under your observation? - As to humanity, I always believed him to be a very humane man, good natured, rather tender-hearted than otherwise; soft in that respect.</p>
               <p>You have had occasions of seeing him and his wife together? - Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Do you know upon what terms they lived? - I always understood they lived upon very good terms; I believe they lived upon very good terms.</p>
               <p>I believe you made some resolutions about his travelling with you again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did not you apply to any medical man at Cambridge? - No; I thought I should get him to town next day, and therefore I did not.</p>

               <p>What were his own words? - He said he was at the Spread Eagle, and I said he was; he came a little further, and there was a table fell down, and he said they have put them in my way, that he should not get to me, and he came to the bedside, and laid hold of the bed's foot, and then he went away.</p>

               <p>In what state did you find him? - Very bad in bed; a violent pain in his bowels; he said he was very droughty, and had cold shivering sits; I saw his wife each time; she was taking care of him; they were upon good terms; I called on the Tuesday evening, about eight; I asked Mrs. Simpson where he was; she was ironing a shirt; she said, poor creature, he is just gone out, but he is very ill; I asked her where he was gone; she said, she believed to Wood's; I went to Wood's, but did not find him; and going home, he came behind me, and tapped me over the shoulder; I asked how he did; he said he was very well; so he asked me to drink, and we went into a house with a long passage; as soon as we got into the tap-room, he turned short round; says he, what did we come here for; he walked on directly towards the door; I followed him; then he came back, and said, we will have a dram at the bar; I told him he had better not drink any liquors, as he had been bad; he said he had had nothing to drink all the day.

               <p>I keep the Half Moon; I saw the prisoner on the Thursday afternoon, as near as I can recollect, it must be about four o'clock, and I rather wondered that I had not seen him during the course of the week, for he generally used to come once or twice a day into my house; he seemed in a violent palpitation, and he said he had been very ill, and had been in his bed; I observed nothing more than a violent agitation and shaking, and he hovered over the fire, and signified that he had been very ill; he observed to me at that time that he should go over and get shaved, and he did come through my house about ten that night. On the Friday morning, just turned of eight, I saw him; I made very particular and strong observations upon him; he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260098"/> into my house, and he seemed violently disturbed, and appeared very wild; I asked him what was the matter, and he turned short round to me, and with a very gloomy appearance, he observed that he had committed a deed, which, he said, when he had related it to me, would make every drop of blood in my veins run back; I made use of a vulgar expression, and said, it must be a d - nd strange story, indeed, Simpson, to operate so powerfully upon me; he seemed rather confused, and said it would, and turned to the fire, and said he would tell me; he sat down; he did not tell me immediately; he staid in my house the course of two or three hours; he was out once; I urged him to relate the tale; he said that he had found a man in bed with his wife, and he had stabbed him in the body, and he made no doubt but the stab would do for him; and he clapped his hand upon his wrist, in this manner, and said he had run a knife into his body thus far; I immediately proclaimed him mad; says I, the man is disordered, knowing the disposition of the man, I was sure, in my own opinion, that he could not commit the act; I proceeded to ask him, in consequence, where he had been to commit this fact; he said he had been at the Spread Eagle all the night; that he had laid there; that is, after he had caught this man in bed with his wife, and stabbed him; that he went to the Spread Eagle; that they brought the man there; that he had been tried at the Spread Eagle, and acquitted; that they had made him a present of some white things, to wear as a proof of his innocence; this confirmed me in my idea that the man was out of his mind; I told him, was I in possession of a strait waistcoat, I should certainly put it on; and in the next place, I said, you will be either in bedlam or in a mad-house; then, said he, you do not believe the tale I tell; I said, no; then, said he, I will go and fetch Mr. Evans, and he will prove it, for he knows it to be a fact; he went away, and came back again in about ten minutes with a pair of buckskin breeches and a clean shirt in his hand; they were wrapped up together; and he asked me leave to go into the parlour and shift himself, which he did, and he brought me his dirty shirt and his buckskin breeches to take care of for him; he said Evans was coming; he said he could not think, for his wife was some years older than him, what could possess the old fool to take a young fellow to bed with her; what, says I, is he a young fellow? yes, he is a young fellow; he said he would take me to see him, if I chose to go; I rather detained him; I told him I was going out, I asked him to take a walk with me, which he agreed to. Prior to that, he fancied he saw chimney-sweepers dancing in the street; he said to my waiter, in my hearing, he tapped him on the shoulder, see there, John, says he, see the chimney-sweepers dancing in the street; at last we went out together, and it was my intention to call on Evans; we went there; he was sitting at the work-board; I asked how he did: Simpson and I went in, and we all three went together to the Horse and Groom in Dagger's-court; we were there about six or seven minutes; nothing particular passed; I was not informed by Evans of any thing about it; I asked him to go with me, but in Moorfields he altered his mind, and said he would go to the Change; I saw him about three in the afternoon; he came with a stranger, a hair-dresser; he asked him to drink, and they had a glass together; he invited this man to call at my house, to spend an evening with him; he had a pen sticking across his mouth, as if he was writing; his eyes were open, his hat cocked up, and not in the usual way, but wild and extraordinary; he continued with me ten minutes, I saw no more of him till after he was taken up; she always spoke of him, and he of her, on good terms, and happily.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Having known this man twelve months, did you ever observe any thing particular in his behaviour before this day, that this unfortunate behaviour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260099"/> happened? - The most that ever I observed in his behaviour, was a kind of stupidity about him.</p>
               <p>Court. I rather suspect that he was apt to be prevailed on to drink a little? - He was a man that was free, when he was in liquor; there was a kind of stupidity, a kind of inactivity, but not disposed to be quarrelsome or mischievous; on the Sunday afternoon, when I went to New Prison, the man was frantic in my opinion, and Mr. Yardley observed to me, that he thought it feigned; I said, I did not think it was; I was not afraid to go to him alone, for I was very sure that the man was so harmless, that he would not hurt man, woman, or child if he knew it; now this I only give you as a proof of the opinion I had of the man.</p>

               <p>I am a fishmonger in Leadenhall-market; I have been acquainted with him a good many years, I have several times observed something remarkable in his conduct; I believe about five, or between five and six years ago, he had been into the country along with one Mr. Sharp, and some time after he was returned, I was in his company at the Spread-Eagle in Gracechurch-street, spending the evening with a few friends, and the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon after his return? - I fancy it may be about a week after, or not quite so long; he came in and he sat himself down close to me, there were several people there, I cannot tell who they were; he took notice to me, that as he was coming along through the gateway of the Inn, he had met a large black hog, and it would not let him pass, and fought him, and he at last persevered, and it bit him by the legs, he then sat down a little, and was much discomposed, he then imagined that there were three people behind the curtains, and he desired us to look at them, and that they made faces at him.</p>
               <p>Was that a mere imagination of his own? - Yes, there was no such thing, and that about the hog, I took it at the time to be his illness, a kind of light headedness, or insanity; I was frightened at the time, he was that evening just got up, and come from home, he had been in bed for a day or two; I have observed at different times in his company a rambling, and a kind of light headedness.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing, whether that was increased at all by drinking? - It generally was when he complained he was ill, or that he laid by from his work for three or four days, or a week.</p>
               <p>What did you take his character to be as to good nature and humanity? - I never saw any thing hurtful, or of bad disposition in him, and I have been a great deal in his company.</p>

               <p>Was you acquainted with his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On what terms did they seem to live? - Very agreeably.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You have not been in his company since he failed, as when he was in his prosperity? - I have not been in his company much these two years, only a little while before this happened.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing in his behaviour then? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner at the bar stands indicted for a crime of a most enormous nature, that of the murder of his own wife, by stabbing her with a pen-knife: the enquiry has necessarily gone into a very considerable length, not only on account of the discussion that was necessary to establish a fact against the prisoner, but also on account of the particular nature of his defence.</p>

               <p>Upon the result of the whole evidence, it seems to be a fact of which there can be no reasonable doubt that this poor woman received her death by the hands of the prisoner at the bar, and that it was done under no circumstances which could in any degree, in point of law, operate either to justify or mitigate the fact; so that if any crime can be imputed to the prisoner, in respect to that fact, it must necessarily be the crime of wilful murder; because there is nothing in the case which could in any degree provoke, or justify a man being provoked, to commit such an outrage as this was, in the deliberate manner in which it appears to be committed; and therefore it was truly stated to you by the Counsel that opened the prosecution, that it would ultimately come to the question, whether the prisoner was guilty of murder, or of no crime at all; and in order to lay a foundation for you to believe that he was guilty of no crime at all, you must be satisfied, at the time this fact was committed, his mind was in such a state of distraction, that he could no longer be sensible of the internal distinction between right and wrong, and more especially the distinction between the affection that was due to an affectionate wife, and this savage outrage he committed upon her; and that though his hand was guilty, his heart was free from that act which the guilt of his hand would otherwise impute to him. Upon the whole result of the evidence, in which there is no contradiction, it seems to be most clearly ascertained, that this man is in no confirmed habit or state of lunacy; that he is by no means like an idiot, but has sufficient sense to govern himself, and to be answerable for his conduct; that generally speaking, he has been in possession of his right mind, and that if there be any foundation to excuse him from the guilt of this homicide, in consequence of his being insane at the time, it is the ground of an insanity, temporary in its nature, which arose in consequence of a particular circumstance taking effect only during a particular period, and that at this moment, for any thing you learn to the contrary, and at a very short time before the fact was committed, this man was perfectly in the possession of his senses; and this thing is that which makes this enquiry so extremely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260103"/> serious, because it would be a dreadful circumstance, if the bare enormity of the offence was to be suggested as a foundation to excuse the man who could be wicked enough to commit it; and the possibility of the man who meditated a crime of this kind, forming a plan which might lay a ground of excuse, makes this sort of enquiry, in which you can have very little assistance from any thing that was done at any series of time previous to the fact, and still less satisfaction with respect to the conduct of the prisoner since the fact; it is on this account an enquiry, far more serious than those enquiries are which end in insanity; for in those cases it has generally come out, that the party is in a state of habitual insanity which would justify his being delivered into an actual state of confinement; now, from the present case, I see nothing that we can draw any conclusion of that nature from. This is a man who has seen better days; married a woman, who was something older than himself, with some final provision made for her, and they had lived no ne degree of respect for some time, having apprentices and servants; but by degrees, probably, I should think from the general scope of the evidence in consequences of intemperance, having neglected his business, and ruined his health, he comes from the prison of Ludgate to these lodgings, living with his wife in a considerable degree of distress and poverty, but at the same time with a reasonable proportion of affection and regard; the circumstances of the fact which appears to have been committed, are certainly such circumstances as cannot easily be accounted for on any other grounds, than grounds of insanity. It is not true, that the Jury ought to find the insanity of such a person sufficiently established; it ought to awaken the attention of every body to look out for such a case, and to expect to see it proved, and to view carefully, and with great caution, all these circumstances attending the state of the fact; not withstanding there wants in the evidence any thing that looks like a probable foundation that looks like ill will; for there is not a centilla of evidence, except the man's going up stairs, and expressing some displeasure at his supper not being ready, in which they cannot, on being cross examined, express the words of the displeasure, or whether he was out of humour or no; and beyond that, the fact itself is committed in a manner that was immediately open to observation and detection; the man seemed industriously to call in witnesses to see the fact committed; having in that extraordinary manner committed the fact, with frequent opportunities, (for they did not know the extent of the mischief) with frequent opportunities to get off; he makes use of none of them, but goes about in that state in which he is described, running backwards and forwards where the fact was committed, and where the woman lay languishing, and to the last moment he seems to have no thought or idea of getting away, or escaping the hands of justice. These are circumstances that belong to the fact, in their own nature so extraordinary, as to lay every considerable ground of probability that that would turn out to be a case of lunacy; and when you come to examine the rest of the circumstances, it appears that there is the strongest ground to believe that is the case. This man appears to have been five or six years ago on a journey to Lynn and Cambridge, with Mr. Sharp; to have first, as I can collect, betrayed some degree of a mind disturbed in consequence of a nervous complaint that was then upon him; Mr. Sharp has satisfactorily proved that, and the proof of it is confirmed by the last witness Mr. Sanders, who tells you, that the prisoner came to a public house which he described, and there discovered marks of what the witness calls light headiness, talking wildly of a black hog, and of seeing three people that were moving the window curtain, and were making mouths at him, and insulting him, when in truth no such thing passed; these were certain marks of a mind agitated by a certain degree of lunacy; and you find, that the week before this accident happened this man was again ill of a nervous<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260104"/> aguish complaint; he had been confined to his bed several days, and it was not till Thursday night, having been in bed three whole days, and part of a fourth, that he broke out into the unhappy outrage that produced this enquiry. You find he had pork for supper too; and though in the houses of persons that are better judges of what is to be done with sick people, one should hardly expect to find a supper of roast pork for such a man, yet these lower people think that eating and drinking is the only thing for a fever, and the moment they can be prevailed upon to eat, they are well; and therefore I do not at all wonder that the first idea was a hot supper; this supper was had, except a single circumstance mentioned by one of the witnesses of his expressing some dissatisfaction that it was not done to his time; this supper was had in great good humour, he inviting two of his neighbours to sup with him; he had drank one glass of gin, or anniseed, before; he drank some beer at his supper; he eat a meat supper; he had been ill of a nervous complaint for some days, and it is not at all improbable that this had slown to his brain, and had produced a considerable degree of delirium; for in a short time after they had been in bed, he first of all calls out, makes a noise and alarm, expresses a great uneasiness, thinks there are gipsies in the bed, and people in his room; that there are men in his bed, and then proceeds to the idea of some man being in bed with his wife; the people he calls in find there is no man there, no ground at all for this alarm of his; they compose him, they succeed; he returns to his bed again; the alarm is soon raised again, and the wife is alarmed by the state of her husband; they both call out to the family to come in; they come in, they find this man sitting in his breeches and stockings, and probably shoes, and in his shirt by his bed-side; Mrs. Evans enquires what's the matter; he talks of there being gipsies in the room; and then draws his knife, unclasps it without any circumstance of secresy, and with great deliberation thrusts the mortal wound, and with an evident design, I think, to stab some person who appeared to him at that time to be the proper object of his resentment, after he had done this, and made another stroke at this poor woman, which made the blood flow, and Mrs. Evans desiring to have the knife, he gave her the knife, made no attempt to rush out, but stood there with a stupid kind of look, probably full of the idea that seemed to have impressed his mind, that it was somebody else he attacked; you find, after this he is still uneasy, discontented, lays down in another bed with his wife for a moment; then he goes up stairs, talks to the apprentice about his being at the Spread Eagle; an idea which you see afterwards is drawn out into some form in his mind; for afterwards he says he has been at the Spread Eagle, and there he was tried for the death of a man he had killed, and was to have ribbons on his acquittal. Now, unless you can see reason on this evidence to collect that all this was fraud, and all made up for the purpose of having an opportunity, in a way that would not expose him to personal risk, to destroy his wife, this is plain and evident insanity. I have looked to see if there was any thing in the evidence, from whence so deep and so abominable a practice could be suspected of him; and here the general course of life you have heard of the man, of his inoffensive manners, and of his gentle conduct towards his wife, come to be material; for it is almost impossible that a man would deliberately form a scheme of destroying his wife, and conduct it both before, at, and after the act, with that astonishing regularity with which this madness of his seems to be managed. Therefore, if you should not see reason on this representation, to entertain any considerable degree of doubt of the state in which this man was, I think I need not go further and state the whole evidence; I confess, my own mind is satisfied with respect to it; therefore, if you should be of the same opinion, I think that public justice will be satisfied, if after this long enquiry, on the ground of a temporary insanity, which this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260105"/> man had laboured under for four or five days before this fact, you think that this man is not guilty of the crime imputed to him in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we wish to go out.</p>
               <p>Court. Oh, if you wish to go out, I must state the evidence to you; because if you do not feel it at once in the way in which I have stated it, it is fit I should state the whole evidence to you.</p>

             coming out with a fore wheel of a chariot; he said he was running it for pleasure; I said it was an odd night; it was a wet night, it was seven o'clock; I returned, and saw him come back without it; I waited, he never came out again; the gate was open three quarters of an hour; I shut the gate, and in consequence of some conversation I had with Holloway, I communicated the story to one of the partners, Mr. Wright.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Trout was called? - Yes, on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Was Holloway there at the same time that Trout was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell us any thing Holloway said in the presence of Trout, but not when Trout was absent? - He said, before Trout, that he had run that wheel to Mr. Davy's by Trout's order, and was to have a glass of gin for his trouble.</p>
               <p>What did Trout say to that? - He said he had lent Mr. Davy a wheel.</p>
               <p>Did he directly acknowledge that he had employed Holloway to run it, or only not deny it? - He acknowledged that he had run the wheel; he said he was going that way home, and Trout said to Holloway, as you are going home, leave this wheel at Mr. Davy's; Mr. Davy was sent for; when Trout and Davy came together, Davy said he did not know any thing of borrowing a wheel of them, but if any of his people had, he did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>What did Trout say to that? - Trout said he believed it was some of Mr. Davy's people; Trout was then asked if he should know the man that borrowed the wheel; Trout said he believed he should, he was a tall man.</p>
               <p>Was any question asked of Davy before either of the partners, as to his having purchased any wheels? - Yes; Davy said to one of the partners that he had purchased several wheels, and had been in the yard to look them out; and he said that Mr. Allen, one of the partners, had seen him in the yard; Mr. Allen said he did not remember seeing him in the yard for some time; Davy said he had been there some time ago, and had bought wheels there; he was asked how long ago; he said it might be a twelvemonth ago; he did not believe he had bought any within a twelvemonth,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260106"/> it might be that ago; all the conversation was confined to one wheel.</p>
               <p>There had been conversation about a pair of wheels? - Yes, there was conversation about new wheels, and things that did not concern my business.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Allen or Mr. Wright ask Davy any questions about the other wheels? - Not at that time, till he came back from the yard; Mr. Davy and we went to Mr. Davy's yard, when we came there we found one wheel, which was either the wheel the boy had run, or the fellow to it; he said, he did not know how it came there, he supposed his people had borrowed it; then we came back again; he said, he did not know that he had any more, nor he did not know that he had that till he saw it; in about two hours after, Mr. Wright took me with him to Davy's, I went with him to Davy's shop, and we found the fellow wheel to this, and two others, the two others were a pair of fore wheels, we found them in Davy's shop; he and his son were both present; Davy said he did not know how they came there.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing more? - Not at that time; there was no more conversation then; on the Monday following, I went with Mr. Wright and the constable, having a search warrant; in a large cellar under ground, we found five wheels, one pair of phaeton hind wheels, one pair of chariot wheels, and one fore wheel belonging to a coach.</p>
               <p>Was Davy at home at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of those wheels? - He said he had none, he was very agreeable to go down and shew, he did not know he had any, he helped them out of the cellar; I am a wheeler to those gentlemen; I know these wheels, they were made by me or my man.</p>
               <p>Tell us when those wheels were taken off? - The Bishop of Exeter had new wheels put on the 8th of March, (looks in a book.) This is a memorandum book of my own making, in my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the Bishop of Exeter's wheels at Davy's? - Two hind wheels of the chariot, and Mr. Woodley's pair of fore wheels which we found at Davy's were taken off the carriage the 6th of March; there was a pair of Mr. Stanley's chariot hind wheels, we found them also, they were taken off the 16th of January, and the 22d of January Lady Onslow's pair were taken off; Mr. Newcombe's wheels I did not take off, we found these there, a pair of Mr. Newcombe's hind wheels of his phaeton.</p>
               <p>The wheels are broken up in general when they are taken off? - But that depends upon the state of them.</p>

               <p>Have you any doubt at all of these wheels being the property of those gentlemen? - No, I am sure of the wheels, I can prove it by every matter that can be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Is it always the case when wheels are taken off that they are broken up? - If they are good for nothing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What does the coach-maker allow the coachman for these old wheels? - I think it is one guinea for the set; but that is not my business.</p>
               <p>Do you remember hearing any thing from either of the prisoners as to the price that was to be paid, by one to the other, when they were examined? - At Bow-street Davy said before the magistrates, that he gave six, seven, or eight shillings a pair for them.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he had given for these wheels? - No; he said nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know that the allowance given to the coachman for the wheels, is a particular compliment made to the coachmen, and that more is given than would be given for the wheels themselves? - It depends upon the condition of the wheels.</p>
               <p>Is not it a common thing to give the coachman a guinea? - If the wheels are not worth five shillings, the coachman expects a guinea, if they are worth a guinea, he receives no more than a guinea.</p>
               <p>How far do you live from Mr. Wright's? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260107"/>Davy is a considerable wheeler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not the custom of the trade to buy wheels and fit them up, and sell them again to the hackney men, or any person that wants them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you not do it yourself? - I am not in business for myself.</p>
               <p>You do not know the conduct of the yard? - No.</p>
               <p>What the particular department of Trout is, you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>When this conversation had taken place at Mr. Wright's, you went with Davy to his house? - Yes; he shewed me that wheel in his passage.</p>
               <p>Trout said he believed it was one of the men? - Yes, and he said he believed he should know him if he saw him.</p>
               <p>The first time you went to Davy's house was the Sunday morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you made a discovery of this single wheel of the Bishop of Exeter's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Davy was with you, and he said here are all the wheels I have? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went again with a search warrant on Monday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there was all that interval? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Davy had opportunity of removing these wheels from the premises? - At a certainty he had.</p>
               <p>Is not a cellar a common place to put wheels in? - I do not like to have them in a cellar, they do no good under ground.</p>
               <p>A pair of fore wheels is are not so much worth, as a pair of hind wheels? - That depends on the state of them, but it they are in the same state, the hind wheels is of most value.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Rag? - Yes, a publican.</p>
               <p>You have not lived on any good terms with Davy? - I never had any words with him; I know nothing of him, only how do you do, and good night to you.</p>
               <p>Have you to Mrs. Rag, or any body else said these words, or to this effect, d - n him, I have found some wheels in the shop, I have him now, and d - n my eyes if I do not do him? - I never mentioned any such thing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you or have you not? - At a certainty I should never say so; why should I do him, I do not know that I ever said such a word.</p>
               <p>Does your memory serve you to say so? - I do not remember any such a word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was the Bishop of Exeter's wheels worth that you found at Davy's? - They were worth eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Woodley's? - About eight more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newcombe's? - The phaeton wheels are worth fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Did he at the first time shew you the cellar? - No, only the gateway; he said, these are all the old wheels I have.</p>
               <p>Court. When Davy was sent for, and questioned upon them, he acknowledged he had frequently bought wheels, and said he had often been in the yard to look them out, and that Allen had seen him there; Allen said he had not seen him there for some time; Mr. Davy acknowledged that.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Allen deny having ever seen him there for the purpose of looking out wheels? - I do not remember that Allen said he ever saw him look out wheels.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Allen deny that he had ever been there looking out wheels? - He said if it had been, it was a long time ago.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Allen deny his ever having any knowledge of the purpose of his being there? - Mr. Allen said he did not know that he came to look out any wheels.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - I did not attend, I did not take any notice, I cannot positively pretend to say.</p>
               <p>If you cannot say positively, why do you say at all in answer to my question? - Mr. Allen told him he did not know that he had been there to look out wheels.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that positively? - Mr. Allen said, he did not know he had any right to look out wheels, and did not know that he bought any wheels there.</p>
               <p>Who was present then? - All three partners;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260108"/> I remember Mr. Allen said to him, he did not know that he came there upon any such business.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that Mr. Allen said, in answer to Davy, that he did not know he had ever come there on that business? - Yes, Mr. Allen said, that he did not know that he came there upon that business.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am in partnership with Messrs. Lukin and Allen, coachmakers in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>What situation was the prisoner Trout in, at your house? - He was foreman to the labourers.</p>
               <p>Have you lost any wheels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any authority to send any wheels from your shop? - Never.</p>
               <p>Do you sell any wheels to any body second hand? - We have sold wheels but very seldom, the reason is, those that are good I keep to put on other carriages; and those that are good for nothing, he had the breaking up of, and I used to give him sixpence a set for breaking them to pieces.</p>
               <p>You worked up the old iron? - Yes, and the wood work we burn.</p>
               <p>Had he any authority from you, or your partners, to dispose of any wheels to any body? - He never had; he had like to have lost his place some time ago about selling a pair of wheels.</p>
               <p>How long ago was that? - The 19th of November, 1784, he sold a pair of hind wheels that came out of a gentleman's phaeton, that were very good ones; he sold them for fourteen shillings, they were worth two guineas, he had no authority for that; Mr. Lukin then sent for him and told him, if ever he sold any more without authority, he should have no more business; people have come into the shop and asked if we had wheels to sell, and I have sent them to Trout, but he was to shew them to me, that I might fix the price, and he was not to sell them himself; he sold one pair, and gave the money to the clerk.</p>
               <p>In March 1786, were any wheels sold? - I do not know of any; we fixed the price on that pair which he sold; he asked me; I took twenty-eight shillings for them, that is brought to account in this book; Trout was brought before me and my partners, and Holloway said when Trout was present, that he told him to take that wheel to Davy's, and he would give him a glass of gin for it; I then asked Trout if he did, he hesitated a little, and said, he did; that he met Mr. Davy the day before, and he desired him to give his compliments to me and desired I would lend him a pair of wheels.</p>
               <p>When Davy was brought, what was said then? - I asked Davy if he had borrowed any wheels of Trout, he said, he had not seen Trout for some time, I believe it was a fortnight; then Trout said it was not Davy, it was Davy's man, that he asked to lend him a pair of wheels; Davy said he had bought wheels in the yard; I have seen him I believe to the best of my recollection; I said, I have not seen you in the yard these two years; he said Mr. Allen and I was by; Mr. Allen said, he had not seen him for a great while, for a twelvemonth; Mr. Davy said, it was a long time, he could not say, it might be a twelvemonth; Chantry went to Davy's, and after he had been there, Davy came back himself, and told us that Chantry had been there, and found another pair of fore wheels in the shop, but he did not know how they came there; I went and saw the wheels, and then he said they were our wheels and he had them of Trout.</p>
               <p>Did he describe how he had them of Trout? - No, I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>He did not say when or how? - No; I then said, Mr. Davy, if Trout comes for these wheels, do not you let them have them away, nor do not you let any body have them, till I come for them myself; I asked him if he had any more wheels of ours on his premises; he said, no, he had not; about six I went to the fore gate and there was Trout, with a pair of fore wheels, says I, you scoundrel how dare you bring these wheels here, and I made him take them back; about two hours after, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260109"/> same wheels were put into our yard again, how they came there I do not know; on the Monday morning we went and found five more wheels there, which he acknowledged he had of Trout; Davy was present at Bow-street, and Trout said he had six shillings a pair for them, and Davy said, that was eight shillings for the hind ones; I asked him when he paid Trout; he said, he could not say when it was, he sometimes paid him four or five guineas at a time.</p>
               <p>How much was the hind wheels worth? - Sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. This house belongs to you, and Mr. Wright, and Mr. Allen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has your uncle no interest in it? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor any dormant interest in it? - No.</p>
               <p>When was the present firm established? - At Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner Trout is foreman under the labourers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you say, he is the man to whom you referred the enquirers for wheels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you generally refer the people to Trout? - To look them out, but not to sell them.</p>
               <p>You just now told us that you referred them to him, and he was to come out and let you know the offers; now is not it the general custom of the trade to sell the old wheels? - I do not know what other people do, I do not sell old wheels; in 1784, Trout sold some wheels.</p>
               <p>And had not he before that time sold wheels for you? - In that way, no other way.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it possible for you to know with certainty off what particular carriage wheels come? - No; there was one particular circumstance in a pair of these wheels, there were boxes in them.</p>
               <p>Court to Chantry. How do you know these wheels? - The hind wheels were there and the fore wheels were gone; I found the fore wheels at Mr. Davy's.</p>
               <p>How long had that man worked with you? - About seven years.</p>
               <p>All that you can tell was, that they were his make? - Yes, and my turning; I can tell when they were made, I always book them.</p>
               <p>When the old wheels are taken off and mixed with other wheels, how could you distinguish them from other wheels made by the same man under your direction? - By the colour, and by the paint, they were painted yellow, and the hoops black, we had no other painted that colour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You took them off the 8th of March? - Yes; off the Bishop of Exeter's.</p>
               <p>How do you know Mr. Woodley's? - It is a very heavy coach, it runs very hard, they were stronger, I know the wheels, I observed them when they came off Mr. Woodley's carriage.</p>
               <p>New as to Mr. Stanley's chariot wheels? - I know them perfectly well.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. Newcombe's phaeton wheels?</p>
               <p>I know them to be the wheels, but I do not know when they were taken off, because there were a set of patent wheels put upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I suppose the new wheels of this heavy carriage are of the same sort as the former were? - Yes, they had not been on one year; I saw these wheels of Mr. Woodley's on the Friday before, the man owned to running them away on the Saturday evening.</p>

               <p>Do you remember seeing Chantry on Saturday night, the 18th of March? - Yes, I was taking a fore wheel and running up Hanover-street out of Mr. Wright's yard to Mr. Davy's, by Trout's order.</p>
               <p>What did Trout say to you? - He told me his master had sold the wheels to Mr. Davy, and that he was allowed one shilling to carry them, and if I would carry them, he would allow me half, three-pence for two, and four six-pence.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Chantry speaking to you about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you carry that wheel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260110"/>Where did you deliver it? - I left it at the door, I took two more the same-day, and I left them in the same manner, by the order of Trout.</p>
               <p>What wheels were these? - Three fore wheels, I do not know to what carriage they belonged; they were yellow wheels.</p>
               <p>Have you, at any other time, taken any other wheels from Mr. Wright's? - Yes, for this five years past at different times.</p>
               <p>Was it known to Mr. Wright? - Trout told me they were sold to Mr. Davy, by the order of Mr. Wright; I took there by the order of Trout.</p>
               <p>At what time of the day? - Some. time one, and sometimes five; these are the hours we have to ourselves.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular instructions from Trout as to the manner? - He bade me not say where I was going with them if I met any body; I have seen Davy himself when I have delivered them, sometimes his son, sometimes his man.</p>
               <p>Who paid you? - Trout.</p>
               <p>How many have you carried in the last six month? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>How many do you think? - About twenty sets.</p>
               <p>How far is Davy's house from the prosecutor's back gate? - About a minutes walk.</p>
               <p>Have you at any time received any money from any body but Trout? - Yes, lately before Christmas, I received sixpence from Davy, once or twice, I cannot say when.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the wheels that were found at Mr. Davy's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are any of these those that you carried to Mr. Wright's? - Yes, I carried them all; there are nine, some fore wheels, and some hind wheels; I used to carry more fore wheels than hind wheels.</p>
               <p>Court. How long before this was it that you had seen Davy, when you carried any wheels? - I saw him the day before I took them; I saw him the Tuesday before, he was standing at the shop; I took some home that day, and delivered them in his presence.</p>
               <p>How many did you take then? - A pair of fore wheels.</p>
               <p>Do you know of Davy's disposing of any wheels? - I saw a cart load of wheels as I came by one day.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose property those had been? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then in the course of the five years you have by your account carried a very large number to Davy's by Trout's direction, and as much as twenty sets, within the last six months? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have you ever gone to Mr. Wright's for Trout? - Yes, by the order of Mr. Davy.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular directions from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260111"/> him about that? - Yes; he told me to go for Mr. Trout to Mr. Wright's yard, and he told me once, if I saw Mr. Wright not to mention that Davy was at my house.</p>
               <p>Did Trout use to come in consequence of these messages? - Yes, when he had an opportunity, when Mr. Wright was not in the was; these messages were not at any particular times, they were in the working hours.</p>
               <p>In case Mr. Wright was there, what was you to say to Trout? - I was to give him a backon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How came you here to day? - I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Who brought you the subpoena? - I do not know the gentleman; Mr. Wright came to me.</p>
               <p>Did not you know very well that Mr. Wright and Mr. Davy were not upon good terms, and that Mr. Wright would be angry if his foreman was sent out of the house? - I have not kept the house above a year and a half; I did not know that Wright and Davy were not upon good terms.</p>
               <p>Has that intercourse between Davy and Trout subsisted any time? - It has continued down to the present time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I am now to submit to your Lordship, that there is no evidence to affect Trout; that there is no evidence to affect him as accessary; I am ready to admit, the boy expressly proves that degree of criminality upon him, and no other, that he took these by his order, which is one of the ingredients, constituting the criminality of an accessary expressly.</p>
               <p>Court. Ask the question first.</p>
               <p>To Holloway. When you took the wheels from Mr. Wright's to Mr. Davy's, where did you take them from? - From the place where they stood, against the wall.</p>
               <p>Was Trout present when you took them? - He generally was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Trout. My Lord, I cannot make a speech; I make hold to hand up this paper. (Read.) May it please your Lordship, and you the gentlemen of the Jury; having an impediment in my speech, I beg the indulgence to observe, that I am totally innocent of the charge, for which I have the misfortune to stand here arrainged; I have been twenty one years in the service of my prosecutors; I appeal to them what has been the general tenor of my conduct during that time; I have been for years past, authorised by them, to dispose of all the old wheels; the wheels in question I did sell, in consequence of that authority; I paid them the money I received; therefore I beg leave to add, that I am a poor man, that my afflictions are much exaggerated, by having a numerous insant offspring, without a mother, and they must be without a friend should conviction follow; I therefore humbly hope, that this court will temper justice with mercy, by passing upon me as lenient a sentence as justice will admit in my distressed situation.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Trout. You see one of the gentlemen has denied your having any authority to sell? - Here is a gentleman in the court that has been in the counting house, and enquired whether there were any old wheels to sell, and Mr. Fletcher, and Lukin, and Allen have said go down to Trout; my master has been angry during the time of business; he has made use of some bad words; the next day they have come, and I have agreed for them; I have seen one of my other masters, and told him, says I, the man has offered a guinea, says he, how are they, are they pretty tidy Trout? Sir, says I, the hoops are on, the wood is but so and so; I have told the man he might have them for one pound one shilling.</p>

               <p>What character has he borne? - I never heard any thing of him but an honest man; I have bought wheels of Trout; I have bought a set of Mr. Wright, a set of Mr. Allen, and several sets I have bought of Trout, in the course of these ten years.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you that Trout was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260112"/> man with whom that business was to be transacted? - Mr. Wright has sent me down to Trout; I have gone down to Trout into the yard, and I have looked for such a set of wheels as I have wanted; I found them there, and I have agreed with Trout for them, and paid him for them; one time I told Mr.

             I wanted a set of wheels for an old carriage; and he said, go down to Trout, and Trout will deal with you for old wheels; Trout will sell them to you.</p>
               <p>Then, you understood from Mr. Wright that Trout was the man with whom this business was to be done? - I have bought several sets in the yard in the course of ten years.</p>
               <p>What prices may you have given? - Twenty-four, or twenty-five shillings; sometimes I have gone as far as thirty shillings; that is the whole sum.</p>
               <p>What is the lowest of those of a more moderate quality? - I never bought any but what was very good; I wanted them that were fit to put on a gentleman's carriage, that would run for a month or six weeks, till a new carriage was made; I gave a better price than a hackneyman would have given.</p>
               <p>It may happen that a pair of fore wheels are worth very little, unless they are fit to put on? - They give gentlemen's coachmen more than the wheels are worth; a guinea is the price, that is not worth above ten or a dozen shillings; then the fore wheel cannot be worth above four or five shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where do you live? - I am wheeler to Mr. Hatchett, in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>When was this transaction with Mr. Wright? - I believe it may be three or four years since; I have not dealt with Mr. Wright since, but with Mr. Trout I have sometimes; I have seen Mr. Wright in the yard, or Mr. Allen, or Mr. Lukin, and had what I wanted.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay the money to at that time? - To Mr. Wright, in the yard.</p>
               <p>How did you fetch them away? - I generally had them sent away; I took them home in the open day, in working hours, I and my fellow servant, that was foreman to the labourers, the same as Trout was; we sold them there; we never went to Mr. Hatchett.</p>
               <p>Court. You had a general authority from Mr. Hatchett to sell, and account with him for the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect at all particularly what Mr. Wright said when he bid you go down to Trout? - Go to Trout, and Trout will deal with you for the wheels; I looked out the set myself, and then he was to deal with me for them.</p>

               <p>Is it, or is it not, customary to intrust that man with the sale of the cast wheels? - Certainly; the shop I am in, I have been in about twenty-five years; I succeeded Mr. Foster, in Long Acre; I never knew him sell a set of whels; we wish to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260113"/> them out of our way; when any person comes, we let them part with them; they bring the money to account.</p>
               <p>Has it happened that any of these men had sold wheels to persons applying? - I have one man that I sold twenty sets at a time to; he has gone through with that bargain, and brought the money to account.</p>
               <p>What is the value of a set of wheels? - Why they must be a pretty good set, with a good deal of iron upon them, to fetch twelve or fourteen shillings; I never gave a receipt for any such thing in my life; whatever they sold them for, I always abided by what they did.</p>
               <p>Court. When you speak of the price of twelve shillings, you speak of those that are to be broken up? - Yes; I have sold the fore wheels for about eight shillings, and the hind wheels for about fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>But many for a much higher price than that, I suppose? - Oh, yes. I have known Davy twenty years; he is in a capital way of business as a wheel-wright; always bore the best of characters; an honest, hard-working man as ever I knew; he has certainly brought up a large family, with a great deal of industry; he has many servants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did he deal with you for old wheels? - He has frequently bought fore wheels at our shop; fore wheels are more applied for, because they are wanted to send into the North, to use in the coal trade.</p>
               <p>Court. Has the prisoner Davy dealt frequently at Mr. Foster's for old wheels? - I cannot say, Sir; it did not come within my knowledge; lately he bought five pair of fore wheels, for which he gave eight shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>- BERRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a coach-maker in Long-acre, near to Mr. Davy; I have known him seventeen years; I have dealt with him to this very time; I always found him a fair, honest man, rather likely to be imposed on, than impose; he has a dozen men under him; I have sold him wheels.</p>
               <p>- SLODDARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Davy I suppose for twenty-four years; I live in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square; his general character has been a very good one; an honest, industrious, hard-working man as ever was; I always understood him so.</p>
               <p>- WELLS sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Charles-street, Long-acre; I have known him upwards of twenty years; I know him to be a very honest, hard-working man, and took great care of his family.</p>
               <p>- HEATHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Long-acre; I have known him seventeen or eighteen years; a very honest, industrious, hard-working man; I never knew any body speak against him in my life; he has a large family.</p>
               <p>- MABERLY sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Little Queen-street; I have known Mr. Davy twelve, or fourteen, or sixteen years; he has bore a general good character, and stood unimpeached, I believe, till this matter.</p>
               <p>- FROOME sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Oxford-street; I have known him twenty years; I always understood him to be a very worthy, honest man, and I have sold him ten pair of wheels, hind and fore ones together, for eight shillings a pair, not more.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Marcello called me to take charge of one of these prisoners; she told me she dare say there had been a robbery committed; that she had some things offered for sale, and they were wet.</p>
               <p>Who did you find there? - The prisoner Eades.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said the things were given him to sell by Smith; he did not say any thing about Embleton.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any body but Smith having any thing to do with the things? - No; I then went to the public house, and took the other men.</p>
               <p>When you first went there, and took the two men, what did either of them say? - Embleton said he knew nothing at all about them; he went in to buy a pair of shoes; Smith did not deny but what he gave them to him to sell, and said he found them in a ditch.</p>
               <p>Did Smith say that Embleton was with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Embleton deny any knowledge of the things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Smith contradict that? - No; Eades said that Smith was the man that gave him the things; I am sure those are the things.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of February, my youngest child brought up a bag, containing some clothes in it; I went down, and my wife had given charge of one man; I saw nobody when I came down; they were at the next door, at Mr. Allen's; I saw the prisoner Eades in custody at Mr. Allen's; I asked him how he came by these goods; he said that a brewer's servant, (that was Smith) who was at the Star and Garter, gave them to him to sell; I asked him where the brewer's servant was; he said he was gone to get a pint of beer at the Star and Garter; then I said to Mr. Allen, you had better apprehend the other two men, and the brewer's servant; he said there were two men with him, but it was the brewer's servant that gave it to him.</p>
               <p>After your wife and Allen went away to look after the two men, did any thing pass between Eades and you? - No; he said he was innocent; I was present at the examination of all three of them; the officer told Mr.

             the charge; Mr. Wilmot called to Smith first; when he was alone, he said, young man, it will save me a good deal of trouble, if you tell the truth; Smith said he was coming along the fields, and he found the bundle in a ditch, and he had a scuffle with two men, and one of them cut him over the eye; I saw no mark or wound; there would have been one, if it was fresh. Embleton said he was present; the other man said the things were found; none of them said that Embleton knew any thing of this. I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Marcello. Is your girl here? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came down, you found these three men in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who asked for the shoes, can you recollect? - Yes, each of them; Smith and Embleton said they wanted a pair of shoes, but I looked at their feet, and I did not think they wanted any; they had very good shoes on their feet; they both said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260116"/> would go and have a pint of beer; Smith said to Eades they would go to the Star and Garter and get a pint of beer, and Embleton said, so they would.</p>
               <p>Did Smith and Embleton say any thing? - No, nothing; but they were very loth to go away from the premises.</p>
               <p>When you offered the nine shillings, and agreed for that, it was with a view to get the officer? - Yes; I did not mean to buy them; I would not wish to buy them under twelve or fourteen shillings at a fair price; I would not wish to buy them cheaper.</p>
               <p>It was between seven and eight? - It was a little before eight.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How far is your house from town? - About six miles from Shoreditch church.</p>
               <p>Mrs. King. My Lord, that prisoner, Embleton, was at our house the evening before; our's is a public house; there was him and another; I cannot tell who the other was; I do not know that it was either of the prisoners; I knew him again when I saw him; he had a pint of beer; I said, gentlemen, how far are you going this dark cold night; and he said, Madam, we are going to town; he paid me for the pint of beer; it was about eight in the evening; they staid half an hour at our house; I saw or heard no more of them.</p>
               <p>What part of the house were they in? - They were in the kitchen; I was ironing in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Eades. I was walking down Shoreditch, and I met

             in Shoreditch, that very morning that I was taken up; and he said, Dick, I have been very sick a long while, will you give me part of a pint of purl; I said, yes, and welcome, if I had but a penny I would give you a part of it; we drank out one pint of purl, and went to the door, and drank another at the door; and as we were going out, George said to me, Dick, will you give me part of another pint; as we were drinking it, the prisoner Smith came past; he spoke to George; I never saw him before; and he told me as he had found these things; I said, I was going to Shoreditch; Embleton, he was going to buy a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER SMITH'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I picked up these things going to town; I came back and met with these two men at the Rose and Crown door; I said I have found something, but what they are, I do not know; and as I said so, I turned the things out in the middle of the high road.</p>
               <p>PRISONER EMBLETON'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been very ill, and I then got up and I met with Eades, and he and I had a pint or two of purl; when this man came up, we went with him; I wanted a pair of shoes, the shoes I had on were tore on both sides; and I had them mended in New-prison; I could not get a pair of shoes; and this man employed him to sell the things for him, and we went to the Star and Garter; as for being in the prosecutor's house, I was bad in my bed and had been for five days; and the constable knows I was very bad when he took me; I could scarcely walk to the office.</p>

               <p>What character does he bear? - He always bore an exceeding good character, a hard working, sober, honest man; he was taken up either the 22d or 23d; I remember his being taken up; that was on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was the Thursday? - I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>How long was it after he was taken up? - He was taken up on the Monday as I was told; I did not hear it till the Thursday following.</p>

               <p>What day of the week was that? - It was on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the Monday before the Thursday, or the Monday week? - The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260117"/> Monday week before I heard he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was it in February or in March that you heard he was taken up? - In February.</p>
               <p>You heard it was in February, was it the last Thursday in February? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>And you had seen him the Monday before that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it the Monday before that, or the Monday week before that? - The Monday week before that.</p>
               <p>Then you had not seen him for ten days before you heard he was taken up? - Yes, I had.</p>

               <p>How so? - Then it must be the Monday before I heard it, and not the Monday week.</p>
               <p>How long had he been taken up before you heard it? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the Thursday you heard it? - Yes; I think it was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Where was it you last saw him? - He was at my house the last time I saw him; he left my house about six in the morning; the last time I saw him, I think it was on a Monday.</p>

               <p>What did you loose? - All the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Hand up the hat. (The hat produced.) The prisoner messed in the house, and had the use of every thing in the house; before the magistrate the prisoner discharged himself, and laid the whole upon Moore.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was a lodger of mine six months and a half; on the 1st of April, some clothes were hung to dry in the one pair of stairs; my wife set the door and window open; the prisoner lodged in the two pair of stairs; she went down in the low parlour at two, and staid till seven; and whenever she went up stairs, we heard her in the room above; we imagined she was going to shut the windows; she staid about a quarter of an hour there; we asked, her whether she had been in the room above, and she said, no; then she lighted her candle, and went up stairs; then she came down again, and went out; my wife went up stairs, and I went up; and the clothes were gone; the box was quite open, and nothing in it but one pair of ruffles; in about three quarters of an hour the prisoner returned; I told her she had taken the things; she denied it; on the Thursday following I took her up; her room was never searched; the things were afterwards found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This poor girl had been six months a lodger of your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How had she behaved? - Exceedingly well.</p>
               <p>You had a good character with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you had reason enough to know that she was much distressed? - I did not know it, but it might be so.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA MACKY sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have had many conversations with this young woman about your things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At last, I believe, you told her, if she would give you the things, or tell you where they were, that you would say no more about it? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before you got the warrant for her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After you got the warrant for her, and took her up, did you, after the constable came, make her any promise? - No; I told the constable if she would let me have the things, I would not hurt her. I did not tell her so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260123"/>- ASHTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I took the prisoner; I found the things in the prisoner's room; she gave them me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Macky. As you authorised the constable to tell this young woman so, how came you to prosecute her afterwards? - The constable told me he was bound over, or I should have let her go.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner left your room in the afternoon when these things were lost, did you hear where she went to? - I am sure I can swear it, I heard her in my room three minutes, unlocking my box; and I went up stairs, and came down again.</p>
               <p>Did you say you heard her unlocking your box? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go up stairs then? - I did not think she was a thief.</p>
               <p>Then, what business had she to unlock your box? - I swear I heard her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

I made some enquiry in the neighbourhood, and I found from a hackney coachman; I saw all the things at Bow-street on Monday, except the papers; a woman was in custody.</p>

             and a man came home at one o'clock, on a Saturday night, about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Were they sober when they came home? - Middling sober.</p>
               <p>Did any body come home with them? - Nobody but their two selves.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - At home.</p>
               <p>How near do you live to them? - At that time I lived in the house with them; and in about an hour after the prisoner and her husband came in.</p>
               <p>Do they lodge in the same house too? - No, the man that lived with the deceased is brother to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did they come about? - About a son that she has at sea, to tell her brother of it.</p>
               <p>Was you in the room with them? - Yes; and the words began about the boy that is at sea; and this woman, the prisoner, put the deceased in a passion.</p>
               <p>What did she do or say, to put her in a passion? - She was talking about the boy that is at sea, and she said he was dead.</p>
               <p>Why should that put the deceased in a passion? - Because the deceased said, he had better be dead, than come home, for he had no house nor habitation; and the prisoner said, why was it so; and the deceased said, it would be a happy turn, if please God to take him; and so the prisoner called the deceased a b - h, or something or another; and she put her in such a big passion, that she up with her hand and slapped her face; the deceased slapped the prisoner's face; then after, the prisoner took and held her hands, and shook her; I fancy she took and shook her; and the deceased fell down; and she got some hurt in her back; I do not know how she came by it, without she fell against the box.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether she fell against the box or no? - Sir, she fell down, but whether she hit herself against the box or no, I cannot say; but she said, she did hurt herself against the box; her husband picked her up, and she complained of her back, most monsirous of a pain in her back; and afterwards there were words between them, and they went at it again; and they went out into the yard.</p>
               <p>What do you call going at it? - Why, fighting, and shaking one another.</p>
               <p>Did they strike? - The deceased had the most blows; this woman did not fight her; she held her hands, and shook her well.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased do, did she try to fight? - Oh yes; she fought again, to take her own part.</p>
               <p>Who was it that began the second time? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What did she say or do, to begin the second time? - It was about the boy; I sat by the fire, and in about a quarter of an hour I heard the cry of murder; what they were doing in the yard I cannot tell; they went out after the two men; I got up and went out, and this prisoner had hold of her by her hand; and held her hands, and shook her well.</p>
               <p>Was the deceased at that time standing, or was she on the ground? - Standing both of them; it was the deceased cried murder; I knew her voice.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased do, while the prisoner had hold of her hand? - She strove to strike as well as she could with her hand.</p>
               <p>Did you interpose to put a stop to this? - They soon let one another go, and the deceased complained of her back and they did not go to it any more; they both came in.</p>
               <p>What became of the husbands of those two people? - They were in the yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260131"/> and drinking; they were trying to part them when I went out.</p>
               <p>Did she complain of her back before she went out the second time? - Yes; and she complained of her back when she came in; and when her husband came in, her passion was so great, that she took some red hot fire out with her hand, and hove it at him.</p>
               <p>What did she take the fire out with? - In her hand.</p>
               <p>Was it wood or coal? - Coal; and then afterwards she took up the poker, and she hit him over his head; then after he took a stick, and was going to lick her; and I took the stick from him and broke it; and then I believe it was all over; then they made it all up again; and then the prisoner called the deceased out, and told her she wanted to speak to her, and the deceased said, what do you want to speak to me, how you have almost killed me? and the prisoner said, says she, almost killed you, if it had not been for your brother, I would have laid you for dead; and then afterwards they went home together to the prisoner's house in Old-street.</p>
               <p>The deceased did not live at the prisoner's house at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What did they go home for? - They went to get some victuals for the man; the deceased brought some meat home with her.</p>
               <p>How long after did the deceased come back again with the meat? - I take it, she went home about six, and returned about half after six or seven; this was in the morning.</p>
               <p>So then you set up all night in this affray? - Yes; the deceased and the prisoner came home, and the deceased told me where she got it; I dressed the pork; we had it for breakfast; and the deceased eat very heartily; but she still complained of her back and her belly till she died; she eat nothing more; she kept about till she went to bed; and she got up no more till she was brought to bed.</p>
               <p>When was she brought to bed? - On the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did you see the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any judgment, can you tell me whether it was at its full time? - No Sir, it was about six months; it lived about three hours after she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend she was not more than six months gone? - No; I believe she was not.</p>
               <p>How soon did you discover that she had labour pains upon her, and was likely to be brought to bed? - I cannot say how soon, she complained all day of the Monday and all night; and she was brought to bed at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had she any assistance? - Yes, a midwife.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in liquor; as well as the deceased? - Yes, the prisoner was very much in liquor; the deceased was not so much in liquor.</p>
               <p>How long have you known them? - I was with them a twelvemonth constant.</p>
               <p>What business did the husband follow? - He is a wheelwright.</p>
               <p>How had they lived together, were they good friends, or did they live jangling? - They agreed very well.</p>
               <p>They did not bear any ill will to one another that you observed? - I cannot say; the deceased said, if ever she got over it, as her child was dead, that she would get a warrant for this woman, and keep it by her, they did not bear any will to one another that I observed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you remember any conversation between these two women about the deceased having no bread for her children? - The prisoner's husband cut two slices of bread off for the deceased and some butter.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation with her after she had got the pork and things, about coals? - Yes; she borrowed seven farthings of the prisoner for coals after the quarrel.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it known among you that the deceased was with child? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether she was ill or not? - Yes, she was ill, she complained of a violent pain in her back.</p>
               <p>Was you with her after that? - I saw her on the Monday, about five or six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was she then in bed, or up? - She then was in bed; when I went in, she said, she was very bad, I asked her what was the matter, she told me, she had been in a violent pain, and she believed it was through the ill usage that this woman had given her.</p>
               <p>I do not ask the account of what the woman did to her, but I want to know her condition; when did you apprehend that she might be likely to be brought to bed? - On the Tuesday morning she sent for me in, and when I went in, she says to me, Oh, Betty, I am very bad, and I asked her a few private questions, and she told me, as I could understand, that she was going to be delivered, or at least to miscarry; I said, if please God, I will go and ask Mrs. Martin to come to you, she is your landlady, and is a midwife, and she came immediately half dressed and half undressed, and when she in, I said, Mrs. Martin, I believe every things is ready for you.</p>
               <p>When was she delivered? - On that Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>How soon after Mrs. Martin came? - Why Sir, the deceased was delivered I may say before she came in; the child was born before the midwife came.</p>
               <p>The child died soon I understand? - The child lived about three hours, and the woman died the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Did she apprehend herself to be in danger before she died? - She said, from the beginning to the last, that she thought she never could recover it; she said, if please God she went to bed, she thought never to get out of it, she said, I shall be worse to-morrow than I am now.</p>
               <p>After she was brought to bed, did she tell you any particulars? - After she was brought to bed, and the child died, she said, Betty, if please God I die, I hope you will do your endeavour to see justice done me, and take up that wicked hussey for murdering me and my child.</p>
               <p>Now at this time, did she tell you what it was in particular that the woman had done to her? - She had told me all before.</p>
               <p>Did she repeat it at that time? - I cannot say she did, she said to me as thus, says she, Betty, I wish I had some relief; that was after the child lay dead on the table, I said, I will go to the parish officers and see if I cannot get you some; I went to the gentlemen, and got a note for the apothecary; the apothecary was not at home, I went again at two o'clock, and the apothecary said, he could not come till ten o'clock the next day.</p>
               <p>Had you a note from the parish officer to the apothecary? - Yes, Sir, I delivered it into the apothecary's house; with that the gentlemen of the parish said, if we would stay till about five at night, they would see what was the reason he could not come, and they would make him; between five and six they came and saw her, and went out again, and said, provided he did not come, they would bring another within half an hour or an hour; and as they said, so they did, about six on the Wednesday afternoon.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter by trade; I happened to be in the room at the same time.</p>
               <p>You are the person that they call the prisoner's husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It seems you are not her husband? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor the deceased's man was not her husband neither it seems? - No.</p>
               <p>A scandalous state you all live in! relate what you know of this? - The prisoner went to see her brother on account of her son, to know if he knew any thing of the Rattlesnake being blow up, in which he was; I was very unwilling to let her go, but she prevailed upon me; when we went there first, she spoke to her brother; he said, no; the deceased said, I am glad to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260133"/> hear he is blown up; the prisoner made answer, I think it is a very cruel thing to have a person blown up into the air, without having time to say, Lord have mercy upon me! They discoursed of this some time, and at last bad words arose; at last the deceased flew into a very great rage, and with a very bad word in her mouth, which was, d - n your eyes, you b - ch, I will murder you; upon which, she took up something to strike her with, which I think was a dish, or something of that sort; the prisoner wrenched it from her hand, and held her for some time; then she let her go; she took up a brick, and swore she would put her eyes out with the brick; upon which the prisoner laid hold of that, and took it away from her, and after that she held her hands, the deceased endeavouring to beat the prisoner; and the deceased offered to kick the prisoner; and there was a box lay pretty near to the bed's foot, which she tumbled over; I saw her, and I believe she fell against the bed-side, and hit herself; in a little time after, they went into the yard, we all did, to drink a couple of pots of beer, which I had sent for.</p>
               <p>What, did you drink your beer in the yard? - It is a kind of a garden.</p>
               <p>What, go out into the yard to drink in the night, in the middle of April? - Yes; we had the beer out, and could not drink it on this happening; when we had been in the yard a little while, some words arose again, and the deceased was going to throw something at the prisoner, and the prisoner took hold of her hands, and gave her a shake; we came into the house again; I did not imagine any thing happening, I called to them several times; says I, you will hurt one another, and then you will be sorry for it; I endeavoured for some time to separate them, which I could not obtain.</p>
               <p>So you and Mr. Lewis, that lived with these two women, you stood by, and suffered them to pull themselves to pieces in this manner? - They often had words in this manner before, but they did not hurt one another, and then they went to drink after it.</p>
               <p>Why, you all knew she was with child? - No, I did not; she was a woman that I did not altogether like, and I told the prisoner not to let her come into our room several times, for I did not like her, she had very bad expressions.</p>
               <p>You were both of you two abominable brutes, to let these people tear one another to pieces in this manner? - The deceased cried out murder in the yard, and the prisoner said to her brother, Richard, go and give that woman good words, for she makes a shameful noise; in a very few minutes, we were all friends; I insisted upon the prisoner's coming home, and staying no longer. As we were coming to go home, the deceased said to the prisoner, Fanny, you have got a good loaf to carry home to your children, but I have not got a bit of bread for mine; the prisoner said, you shall have some, and she said to me, Jem, cut her some; I cut three slices, but she thought it was not enough, and she cut a fourth off it; I likewise gave her some butter; then we went to the Crown, and had another pot of beer, to depart in peace; then the deceased said to the prisoner, Fanny, you promised me a hat when your child died; and the prisoner said, that I did; if you will go with me, you shall have it now; and they both went home together; and there happened to lay a piece of pork, which I had bought for dinner, and she seemed to have some kind of inclination to this pork; upon which the prisoner lighted a fire, and broiled some, as I understood, and came and gave it her; I and the other man were at the Crown, drinking the beer.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Crown? - We might stay an hour and a half, or two hours; when we parted from the Crown, we went home alone, and these two women came back to the Crown to us.</p>
               <p>Did any body come back with the two women? - They came by themselves; then we staid a little while, and each went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260134"/> to her own home, all in friendship; I did hear the deceased s ay, I think it was at the Crown, that she had hurt herself by tumbling over that d - ned box; I do not remember hearing her say any thing of it in the house or in the yard; I think it was there; however, that was the expression, and all I heard her say of it.</p>
               <p>So, you do not remember her complaining in the house, or in the yard, of being hurt? - No, I did not take notice, there was a noise; and I thought as the prisoner did not strike her, there could be no damage; all I minded was that the prisoner did not strike her; I saw the deceased again on Tuesday night; that was after she was brought to-bed.</p>

On the 12th of April, between six and seven, or thereabout, Mr. Briant, and the other overseer of the parish, came to my house, and desired me to go with them to see a poor distressed woman, because they said they had sent for the apothecary of the parish, and he would not come; I went with them, and found her in a dying state, with a putrid fever; I told them, this woman is a dead woman, and they desired me to send a trifle in; I sent in a balsamic, that was not taken, and the next day they told me she died, between seven and eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was she at that time in her senses? - She was in her senses, but as low as could be to be alive.</p>
               <p>Had you been informed she had been delivered lately? - Yes; they did not tell me she was ill treated.</p>
               <p>I suppose, in the state she was in, you did not think it of any use to make any enquiry respecting that? - On Friday, Mr. Riley and me examined the body, and we found several bruises and contusions in different parts of the body, and particularly on the os sacrum, and between the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260136"/> shoulders, and the upper part and the lower part of the left arm; then, according to my own opinion, it was by violent passions, and by struggling, each of them, which brought on a premature delivery, which was the occasion of her death.</p>
               <p>How the premature delivery was brought on, you cannot tell? - No.</p>
               <p>Are those putrid fevers often the consequence, or do they accompany deliveries? - Always in such cases they cause mortifications.</p>
               <p>I thought they were more likely to be inflammatory? - They turn to inflammatory, and then mortifications ensue.</p>

               <p>Would bruises that have been received a few days before, acquire a worse appearance, in consequence of a putrid fever happening? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>That bruise in the os sacrum, is that a likely thing to happen by a fall against the corner of a box? - Yes, or against the floor.</p>
               <p>This species of fevers, is that the species of fever that ordinarily attends child-bearing? - Generally, it first arises from an inflammatory fever, which is what we call a puerperal fever.</p>
               <p>Where the party is delivered on Tuesday, and is in a dying state on Thursday, is that the puerperal fever? - I took upon it, that this fever was brought on by passion.</p>
               <p>I want to know, whether this kind of fever is a common circumstance that happens upon premature births the day before? - It is common for a fever to attend persons in this state.</p>
               <p>Is it this sort of fever? - The same fever but not so violent.</p>
               <p>An inflammatory fever that degenerates into a putrid fever, I should apprehend would require some time? - Not much, my Lord.</p>
               <p>These puerperal fevers are brought on I suppose by a variety of causes? - Yes; either from pains of delivery or the state of discharges after delivery.</p>
               <p>It is natural enough, when you are informed that there has been a great affray, and that there has been blows, to take that into your consideration, and to ascribe it to that.</p>

            , and on the Coroner's inquisition, she stands charged not with the murder, but with manslaughter; the circumstances or the case, as well as we can collect them from witnesses, who either do not speak so correctly as one would wish them to do, or have their reasons for not stating accurately the whole that is past, are these. [Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260137"/> then added.] This is the whole of the evidence; the prisoner could not in the nature of things, have any witnesses, unless it was the people whom I should have been glad to have seen that kept the Crown. Upon these circumstances you are to say, in the first place, whether this woman's death is at all imputable to any thing that was done by the prisoner, on the Saturday night, and if it was, what is the nature of the offence, of which she is guilty, in consequence of her having produced the death of this woman; with respect at all, to its being imputable to the prisoner; the deceased appears from all I can collect to the contrary to have been in health, before this affray happened; it is agreed on all hands, that there was a violent affray, that the deceased was in a great passion, in consequence of something that had passed; and that in the course of that, her hands were held, there was a struggle, a scuffle, and she fell down, or was thrown down, and was certainly hurt in a part that would have caused the consequences that followed; the contusion on the os sacrum; nothing was more likely to have produced a premature delivery; she complained of this contusion on the os sacrum: upon the whole of the evidence, though undoubtedly these fevers are no uncommon consequences of all kinds of births natural, as well as premature; yet, when you find the woman does not appear to be in ill health before a premature birth, brought on soon after this affray, I think you can hardly doubt much, but that that affray which happened on Saturday night, did contribute to bring on that premature birth, which was followed by this fever, of which the woman died. Whether any degree of crime, whether any share of the injury that was brought on this woman, is to be imputed to the prisoner may depend on this; whether on the whole of the evidence, upon which it appears, as well as we can judge, that the deceased was the aggrestor, by provoking this woman in the very tenderest point, in which a woman could be urged to passion, by throwing out, that it was a good thing that her son was blown up; that sort of inhumanity, that must awaken the feelings of a mother; whether after that it does appear to you that the prisoner did any thing more than restrain the deceased from doing her a mischief; and according to the representation of it by some of the witnesses, they would have you understand, that the prisoner did nothing more, than when the deceased flew into a violent passion, and caught up first a dish, then a brick, and attempted to strike the prisoner; that the prisoner did nothing more than lay hold on her hands, and endeavour to make her quiet; and if she had done no more than that, and it appeared in that scuffle, that the prisoner did no other than that, and the deceased fell down, and that that fall was not imputable to the prisoner, but by holding her hands prevented her doing her any mischief; I should be of opinion, no share of the mischief was occasioned by the prisoner; on the other hand, the prisoner though provoked to a considerable degree by this sort of language, if she entered further into the affray, and was herself active in attacking the deceased, and if she did, what one of the witnesses described to you, after she held her hands, shook her well, if shaking well means that she offered any violence to her; and particularly if she threw her down, in consequence of which her back was so much hurt; I think, considering her situation, who was then six months gone with child, considering the extreme probability that this might produce mischief, and bring on a premature birth, which was so likely to be followed by a fever, and death; I think then there will be some reason to impute to the prisoner some share of these consequences, and which we shall be obliged to enquire into, in the second part of the discussion which I propose to offer to your consideration; I propose first to enquire, whether any share of guilt was imputable to the prisoner, and second, what degree of guilt be imputable to her: If you should be of opinion, this fever was not brought on by any thing that was done to the deceased, or that the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260138"/> did nothing more than defend herself, then you will be disposed to acquit the prisoner entirely; but supposing that was not the case, then what is the nature of the crime she is guilty of; with respect to that, I think there cannot be two opinions; there certainly was no such precedent malice, or ill-will between the deceased and the prisoner, as to lead you to think that the prisoner did what she did with any serious and formed intention, to injure a woman in the circumstances in which she was; to be sure, if in deliberate malice, one woman was to attack another, who was known to be six months gone with child, and was to beat her, and abuse her for the purpose of forcing miscarriage, of which she should die, that would unquestionably be as much murder, as if she stabbed her to the heart; but if this affray was such an one, as plainly arose from a sudden quarrel, in consequence of the deceased being the aggressor, and the prisoner being provoked; if this woman used more force that she should have used, it is impossible to carry it any further than manslaughter, which is a homicide, though committed under circumstances which screen it from that crime of murder; if any blame is imputable to this woman, it is, that this misfortune has been brought on in consequence of some an act of violence on the person of the deceased; but still I think it can go no further that what the Coroner's inquest have made it, supposing they are right in attributing any crime to the deceased, namely the crime of manslaughter. But the points for your consideration are, whether this woman's death has been brought on by this affray, that happened on Saturday evening; and if it was, whether, in the course of this affray, any blame is imputable to the prisoner; in the event of this not being so brought on, or that the prisoner did nothing but hold her hands to prevent her doing mischief, then certainly you ought to acquit the prisoner: but if you think that the prisoner did use violence to this woman, and shook her, and threw her down with violence, by which she was hurt, in that case you will find her guilty of manslaughter.</p>

Gentlemen, this is, you easily perceive, another method of bringing the case before you; I shall recommend to you in this case, to find a general verdict of not guilty; it is a great deal too much to charge, on the circumstance of the child being alive, the death of the child to the prisoner at the bar, in any shape at all; to be sure the child perished merely in consequence of a premature birth; therefore publick justice is satisfied with what you have done already, and it would be an improper verdict to find her guilty.</p>

I run out, and saw two or three people running; I run out, and caught hold of the prisoner Carr; he was not in a run, he was in a kind of walking; just by the Cock door, one of the lads came up, and said he was the man; but I do not know, he was about fifty yards from the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he is some friend of your's? - No; I never saw the man in my life before.</p>

               <p>Haylock. I belong to Litchfield-street office; if he had run, I could not have caught him, for I have a bad leg.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When did you see the meat? - When I went into the shop, the meat was hanging on the hooks; when the child was alarmed, I immediately ran out; I saw the prisoner Carr in Market-street; I was in the market-house; I saw him about twenty yards from my shop; he was running, and the other after him.</p>

When the prisoners were brought back in the shop, there was beef and veal, and mutton, in different pieces, in this bag, which was taken off a hook, and it lay in the same place where the boy told me he saw the prisoners lay; I came back along with Carr; I did not see him taken.</p>

               <p>Sir, Haylock was in the public house, over at the Pitt's Head; he said, here is Burleigh's man over the way, playing at marbles; says he, I will go and send him for a beef-steak; says I, why do not you? I went up with him, and he told the boy to go for some beef-steaks; says the boy, it is very right, I forgot the bag; says I, then, you rogue, run as fast as you can, they have no dinner.</p>
               <p>Court. I rather believe that circumstance is a mistake; but I am not satisfied about the other; and if the Court will take upon themselves to be at the expence of a prosecution for perjury against Haylock, I will commit him.</p>

               <p>Blacketer. I ordered a shoulder of mutton for my own dinner.</p>

             came into our family, we had another boy of the same name, for which reason, he was called Jack, he has ever since gone by that name, though his name is William; he then upon being questioned further about the matter, said, that Valentine had put this paper in a secret place, with the gold in it, for him to carry away, that he had repeatedly done so, and that there was some of it concealed under the stairs in the kitchen, in Field's father-in-law's house; we desired then to go and search his father-in-law's lodgings; which we did, with another person; Field went with us; we found some of it under the stairs as he described it; he does not lodge there; we then went to the prisoner Field's lodgings, and there we found other pieces of paper full of the same kind of chips, which quantity is I suppose about the quantity or rather more than stated in the indictment; in the whole of the chips about five penny weights; he continued to tell the same story, that Valentine had secreted these papers for him to carry away; in consequence of which we took an officer and searched for Valentine, and we found him at his father's; we brought him home that night, it was then eleven or near upon it; we locked him up in a room in the house.</p>
               <p>Did he understand that he was in custody of the constable? - I cannot say; the next morning they were both examined at the office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him the morning before he went to Litchfield-street? - None at all; the next morning at the Justice's, Field told the same story he told us, and upon my asking Valentine, whether he had not at times put up the small pieces of gold in three pieces of paper, and put in a secret place for this man to carry away, he said, he had; he was then questioned as to the quantity that had been sold; he said, at one time he had received so much, and at another time so much; the magistrate desired they might be kept in custody, and that Mr. Cox might attend; the day following they were examined again, and repeated the same story, they said they were sold at Mr. Albion Cox's; we suspected he had no opportunity of getting rid of the gold out of the paper, and some of it was on the matt in particular at the counting house door, and that was the only part of the gold I saw.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That stair case was the only staircase for all the work folks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you told this boy that you would not proceed against him, or give him some hopes of mercy? - Yes, Sir, it amounted to that, he begged we would forgive him; I answered him, that the only hope he could have for any lenity, was that he would make an open and candid confession of all he knew.</p>
               <p>In consequence he went with you, and did as you have stated, under the impression of that promise of your's? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Did not you send a letter to Valentine's father when he was out on Easter Monday that you would not receive him again? - Yes; he did not absent himself that day from any consciousness of this subject; the father told me he had found him; there was no promise made him to induce him to confess.</p>

               <p>How old is Valentine? - Nineteen, he said he was; Field is twenty three.</p>
               <p>With respect to Valentine, did you make him any promises? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any thing said either by you or your brother to Field, in the presence of Valentine, which could induce him to expect the same? - No, nothing.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 30th of March, I heard a noise of stop thief; I came from the back part of the house, and I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Martin following him, crying out, stop thief; I then went out from the door into the road, and Martin cried stop him, that is him; I immediately seized the prisoner till Martin came up.</p>
               <p>Court to Martin. Was the man that this witness laid hold of the same man? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I received these things from Mr. Martin; he had the prisoner in custody, and the bundle was near them, some person had it in their hand, I had it in the presence of Martin; this is the same bundle, it contains the same things; the prisoner begged I would be silent; I searched him directly, he had an apron on, and upon the back part of his apron I found this false key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was the key I had of my landlord, it is not a false key.</p>
               <p>Bamford. He owned the handkerchief before the justice's being his own, and asked for it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Laycock. This petticoat I swear to by a darn, and this apron I stained with some rabbit's blood, and my child's stay has three streaks of ink, and I believe all the rest of the things to be mine, by their general wear, and I had such things in my drawers.</p>
               <p>Have you recovered all your things? - No; these are all I have seen since, here is a cotton petticoat, a cloth apron, a child's frock, seven clouts, and a number of little articles, and a quantity of new cloth, which I can swear to; they are all worth two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Bamford. Do you know this Pickering? - Yes, I have seen him, I was present in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I believe the account this boy gave, was, that Pickering told him he was acquainted with Mrs. Laycock, and that he asked him to carry some things.</p>
               <p>What is become of Pickering? - I do not know, I could not find him.</p>

               <p>I was going to the Black Dog to have a pint of beer yesterday was a month, and one Pickering came in to ask for a porter; I asked him what for? he said to carry a bundle into Crispin-street, No. 13, up two pair of stairs: I said, can I do? he said, if you will go with me, you may do as well as another; I went with him to Blossom-street, and he bid me to go on till the man took me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, for some time; I met her last Saturday, she asked me if I would go with her to pass off some bad money, which I refused to do; then she asked me if I would buy some, I then took two guineas-worth; I shewed them to a friend of mine, and he advised me to take them to Mr. Clarke. I bought some of her, and gave her ten shillings and sixpence for them, they are in this paper.</p>
               <p>How much is there in that? - Seven shillings and nineteen sixpences. Mr. Clarke advised me to take half a guinea's-worth, when he would send somebody to take her in possession; I did so, and the woman was taken into custody, this is the same woman.</p>

I told him I was going to Wapping, and would enquire whether or no they went there, if they did, I would buy some: this I told him, in order that I might bring him to justice, I thought it a duty incumbent on me, if possible, to bring him to justice. I went once or twice to Clerkenwell-green to tell the affair the next day, on the 23d I went again, Justice Girdler was there, and a young gentleman his son; I related the story to them, and young Mr. Girdler directed me to the Solicitor of the Mint, Mr. Vernon, and he directed me to Mr. Clarke at Bow-street; I told Mr.

             the story, and the prisoner's name, and he knew him by the name of the Cheap Butcher; Mr. Clarke told me to buy half a guinea's-worth of halfpence; on the 27th I met the prisoner, I did not see him till then, I told him I would take half a guinea's-worth of halfpence, if he would bring them at four o'clock; he appointed the Robinhood in Holborn, as I was going there, I met the prisoner, and he told me he could not possibly come till five, I waited there, and the prisoner made it eight, when he came, there was another person waiting for him, he went out with the other man, and returned in two or three minutes; he then came to me, and said, how many do you want? I said half a guinea's-worth, he brought some halfpence from the other man, and laid them on the table, and received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260152"/> silver for them; the prisoner then came and sat down by me; he gave me a paper that was done up square; this has been open since, which I gave him half a guinea for; there were three five-shilling papers of halfpence; there were three hundred and sixty in the whole, I counted them the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did you know they were bad? - No, Sir, I do not know, of my own knowledge; Mr. Clarke has seen them; I carried them to Mr. Clarke direc tly, when I received the halfpence, he pulled out a shilling out of his pocket, and said he was queered; I likewise asked if he had any silver to sell; I met him again at the Robinhood, in Holborn; Ting and another attended there to apprehend him, but he was taken at the Magpye in Middle-row, with two separate half guinea's worth of half-pence, and some silver, which I was to buy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. So, you bought one lot at half a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the money to pay for them? - Mr. Clarke, of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>He desired you to buy them, did he? - He did.</p>
               <p>So you had the misfortune of having the trouble of going to the Rotation-office three or four times, and nobody was there? - No, Sir, I did not say three or four times; I said, twice; it happened to be out of office hours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke desired you to buy these half guinea's worth? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you, you was committing a felony when you was doing it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you, you should be indemnified? - Yes; he said it was done, in order to bring a person to justice; he did not say that I should be indemnified; I did it for the good of the public at large.</p>
               <p>That is to say, you committed a felony for the good of the public? - I did commit a felony.</p>
               <p>You knew it at the time? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>You continued this negociation with this man, and dealt with him for some silver and more halfpence? - He was to bring more halfpence; I did not deal with him for more halfpence; he was to bring me more, by order of Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>You did deal with him for more half-pence? - He brought me more halfpence.</p>
               <p>Did you desire him to bring you more halfpence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you settle the price? - No; I was to have them the same as the others.</p>
               <p>Did he agree to bring them for the same price? - Yes; some more halfpence, and silver.</p>
               <p>Did you know, that after committing one act of felony yourself, you were to desire him to commit a new act of felony? - I asked him to bring them, that he might be taken with them upon him.</p>
               <p>Did you know you was desiring him to commit a new act of felony? - I do not know that I thought any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Did you know it? - Most certainly; I knew the first was a felony, therefore the second was.</p>
               <p>You knew you were repeating an act of felony? - Yes, in order to bring him to justice.</p>
               <p>You was desiring him to commit an act of felony, that you were repeating yourself? - I did not think any thing of it myself.</p>
               <p>Having been told so, as to the first parcel, upon your oath, did not you know that you were desiring him to give you an opportunity of committing a new act of felony? - I can say no more than I have said already.</p>
               <p>Did you know you was inducing him to commit a new act of felony? - I did not think about it.</p>
               <p>Then, had you so totally got rid of all impression about it? - What I was doing, was to bring the man to justice; most certainly I must have known it.</p>
               <p>Did you know, then, you were inviting him to give you a new opportunity? - To be sure I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260153"/>You said, he was to be taken with some bad halfpence, or silver, about him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was that settled by? - By Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a house? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of tallow chandler are you, have you a licence? - No; I work day-work; journey men are not obliged to have licences.</p>
               <p>For whom have you worked lately? - Mr. Morris, on Holborn-hill; I lived with him, and with Mr. Bedford, in Short's Gardens; about half a year ago he left off business.</p>
               <p>Who may you have been employed for since? - Now, I deal in kitchen-stuff; there is very little to do in the tallow-chandlery way now; I can buy candles much cheaper than I can make them.</p>

               <p>Where do you keep your warehouse? - I have none; I carry them on my shoulders.</p>
               <p>Then, that is your whole stock in trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is your only way of getting your living for six months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the week was it you purchased this money? - It was Tuesday the 21st I met him, and I purchased it on the 27th; I had the money from Mr. Clarke to purchase it; I bought it for the purpose of detection; then I desired him to bring some more; I was to purchase half a guinea's worth of silver, and the rest was taken upon him; the half guinea's worth of halfpence I saw taken from him.</p>

               <p>Look at these halfpence, did you desire him to purchase any more? - Yes, I did, another half guinea's worth, in order to get him into custody.</p>
               <p>What more passed between you? - He told me, in the first instance, he had been with a Magistrate, and the Magistrate sent him to the Solicitor of the Mint, and the Solicitor of the Mint sent him to me; he brought half a guinea's worth to me, and I desired him to get another half guinea's worth of halfpence; I sent an officer, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Look at these halfpence? - These are bad; these in the bag were found upon him; they are all bad; here are six papers, five shillings in a paper; this is the usual way of doing them up; six of these papers, which is thirty shillings, they call a piece.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevan met me on Clerkenwell-green, and asked me if I would go into the tallow chandlery line; I asked him what benefit should arise from that; he said he did not mean to pay any duty; from that, I think, he has owed me a spight; I never bought any thing of him in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

            , the prisoner, and asked my way into Bishopsgate-street; she said she would shew me, if I would give her a shilling; I told her I would give her sixpence, and the other sixpence when she came to the place; she took me up to a house, under a pretence of getting a candle and lanthorn; I never was in London but twice before in my life.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - No; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Did you take any particular notice of the house, so as to know it again? - Yes, particular notice of the door; when I got out, she took a bit of candle in her hand, under pretence to light it; and she asked me to stop; and she went just within the door, and then she told me I had better sleep with her; I told her I would do no such thing, and the sixpence was no object to me; so, if she did not chuse to go, and shew me the place, I should depart; she told me there was a door opposite to this door, and there was a bed there, and I might sleep with her; I told her I would not; then she took me by the collar, and I went to resist her; and at the door where the bed was, as she said, the prisoner Patrick came in at that door; he set his back against the street-door, to keep me from going out; she then demanded fifteen shillings of me to pay this man for coming into his house; I refused, and the prisoner Patrick said he would let me off for seven shillings and sixpence, and then he would let me out; and I refused to pay that; with that, she began to pull my hat off, and throw it down; then she turned my breeches pockets inside out; the man stood all this time close within the door, within six inches, or thereabouts; I might have six or seven shillings in my pocket, I cannot say, but I am sure there was four shillings and sixpence; I refused her taking it out, and she tore my breeches all to pieces, and my pocket out too; then, after the woman did that, she turned my waistcoat pockets out; then I had a great coat over this that I have on now, and they turned the pockets of the great coat out, and there were two handkerchiefs, one in each pocket; only one handkerchief was found; then the woman took a white cambrick handkerchief from my neck, and threw that down likewise where my hat lay; then the woman ordered me to stop, and I refused to stop; then, my Lord, she tied this cambrick handkerchief round my neck, in a noose, to throttle me, because I should not follow her out; then I began to halloo; then I heard the watch crying the hour; with that, the prisoner at the bar got from the door, and I caught my hat up, and got away.</p>
               <p>When you began to cry out, were they both standing by you? - Yes; this man just as he was at first.</p>
               <p>What did you cry? - I cried, murder? as loud as I could; then I heard the watch, and the prisoners got from the door, and let me get out; I made the best of my way, I came to the watch-house in this condition.</p>
               <p>While the woman was taking the things out of your pocket, did the man say any thing to you? - Only repeated that I should pay seven shillings and sixpence before I went out; he never laid a hand upon me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been in that house before? - Never in that part before.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that man and woman before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you owe this man any money? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260155"/> No; when I got out, I went to the watchman in that condition; he went with me, and shewed him the house; the watchman was coming along the street within a hundred yards of me; I was so frightened, I cannot say exactly; he asked me whether I knew the door; he saw I was sober; we went to the door and heard a woman and a man talking in the same house; and we went to the officer of the night, and tried to open the door, and the man from the inside said he would shoot through the door; the man and woman were not the people.</p>
               <p>When you came back to this house, was the back door open or shut? - Open, we heard them clatter out as soon as ever we went to break the door open.</p>
               <p>Where does that back door go to? - It went out into a brewers yard, where she wanted me to go and sleep; then we went back again, and I staid with the officer all night; then I was obliged to attend here on Le Gross's trial, and we went the next morning about nine, and we heard a talking again, and they were gone in an instant; the lad came and looked up, and before that we saw this prisoner peeping out of a house that was not furnished; we pursued and took him; that house where he was looking out of window looked into this yard; the street door of that house was bolted, and the window was pretty high, we were obliged to get in there; when we came to the top of the stairs to look for him, he was below and we took him; I am positive he was the man.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was this when you took him? - Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Did you find the woman? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is that the woman? - Yes; I am positive that is the woman; it was pretty dark when I first met her.</p>
               <p>Where was the candle, when she was taking your things from you? - That I do not know; it was not light when they robbed me; I was robbed in the dark; there was a fire made of boards, and that flamed, you might see a pin; it was made of old paling, and bits of old tubs.</p>
               <p>Did she never light a candle? - Yes; and I am now sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Had there any familiarities passed between you and her? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bunn. Did not you give me one of these handkerchiefs, and eighteen pence? - No; only sixpence to shew me the way.</p>

               <p>Where, and when did he apply to you for the payment of any money due to Mr. Rust? - At my house, in 1784, but I cannot be positive to the month; I look upon it to be some where in the spring of 1784; I went in the beginning of a week, and ordered one or two pair of shoes, I cannot tell which; and told him if he would bring them that week, I would pay the bill for the last year; it is likely I might leave the message with the prisoner, or some other person, I cannot say; he came punctually on the Saturday afternoon; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260157"/> was the person that came; but I did not then understand his name to be Disney; I conceived him to be Mr. Rust's son, from my own ideas only.</p>
               <p>What passed at the time he came to your house? - I paid the bill.</p>
               <p>Tell all that passed when he came to your house? - I cannot recollect any particular conversation, more than the delivery of one or two pair of shoes, and the payment of the money.</p>
               <p>Did you pay him the money? - I did.</p>
               <p>How much? - If you asked me that question, till I saw the bill the other day, I could not have told; I paid him the money; I cannot say to the three halfpence; he gave me a receipt; he wrote that receipt in my presence.</p>

               <p>You had it you say from Mrs Brown? - I had, and her husband I believe was present; Mr. Brown saw it; he said, he saw it; he said, he thought the prisoner was my son; it was delivered into my custody, and I have had it in my custody almost ever since; I believe I had it about January last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Rust. You have had it almost ever since? - Yes, till that young gentleman had it from me.</p>

               <p>Did you ask him any questions at all? - No, I did not, I looked upon him from my own idea as Mr. Rust's son, from his generally leading the business.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between you on that subject, whether he was or was not Mr. Rust's son? - No, not at that time.</p>
               <p>Did any at any other time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to that; this was for a bill in the year 1783? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And as you recollect paid by you in the year 1784; when for the first time did you hear any complaint of payment from Mr. Rust? - Never.</p>
               <p>Have you dealt with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you paid him the last bill? - No, there was a dispute about it, and Mr. Disney had that bill of me to set to rights.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I think it was the beginning of this year.</p>
               <p>Then since spring 1784 have you not paid Mr. Rust any money? - No, Sir; none at all.</p>
               <p>He was pretty universally taken for Mr. Rust's son? - It is likely he might.</p>
               <p>He used Mr. Rust's name? - I never heard him call himself so.</p>
               <p>You have seen him sign himself so? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You never heard any complaint of this receipt? - I was never called on by Mr. Rust; Mr. Rust called upon me, not to pay the money, but to ask me if I had paid the bill; it was about the beginning of this year.</p>
               <p>You never heard this young man while he conducted the business of Mr. Rust's, called by the name of Disney? - No, never, he afterwards informed me that his name was not Rust, but Disney.</p>
               <p>When was that? - It was in conversation at Mr. Rust's shop, I should rather suppose it to be at the latter end of the year 1784.</p>
               <p>At that time I believe the young man at the bar had left Mr. Rust? - No, Sir, not at the time he told me.</p>
               <p>How soon after did he leave him, and enter into partnership with another person? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Is it two or three months since he left Mr. Rust? - I do not know, I think it was in the beginning of this year.</p>

               <p>Then during the time he continued in this employment, he continued in the name of Rust? - I think it was before he left Mr. Rust that he told me his name.</p>
               <p>Did you know, when he told you that, that he intended to leave Mr. Rust, upon your oath; what is your name, is it not Brownrigg? - Yes, Sir, and I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>I do not blame you, nay I will add to it that you was very honourably acquitted from that bar by that name, however that is your name, and you was very honourably acquitted by that name.</p>
               <p>Court to witness. Have you in business been known, and passed by the name of Brown? - Yes, these ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. That is the name that you have constantly given up and passed to the publick as your name? - Yes, and I am well received by my friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect any conversation between the prisoner and you at the time you paid it, about the date? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire the prisoner to antedate it in order to avoid the payment of the stamp duty, and that is the reason it is torn off? - No, Sir, I do not; there never was a stamp to it.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with old Rust about it? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then you had no conversation with him about this? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Then you do not recollect having any conversation at all about his name? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>My Lord, on the 17th of February last, the day that this note appears to be due, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner in company with another young fellow, came into my office, he said it was due on that day, and he wanted me immediately to proceed against Mr. Rust, the person who was to pay it; I told him, it was only due that day, and that he must wait till the morrow before I took steps with it, that it would be sent for payment, if he chose it; the young fellow that was with him, said, you had had better leave it with Mr. Herne, and let him send one of his clerks with it.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. Fielding, counsellor for the prosecution, just entered and opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am to beg your pardon as well as my Lord's, for being rather later than my time; you have heard the indictment read, and you all very well know how extremely important to public justice it is, to be as active as possible in the suppression of the crime of forgery, and how necessary that punishment should follow on such convictions. This young man at the bar had for some time lived as an apprentice with the prosecutor, he had an opportunity of knowing his master's affairs; the master, who will appear before you probably, (though I know not that he may, from a circumstance that will perhaps impede his attendance) he is extremely infirm, and a very likely subject of imposition; this young man had an accident of a fortunate kind happened to him; after which, instead of the industrious apprentice, he became an extravagant young man, conceived some objection to the behaviour of his master, and had taken such a dislike as to threaten him with vengeance of a a particular kind, I shall not open that to you, if the witness tells the story, I make no doubt but it will have its proper, and only its proper impression upon you. This young man living in the character of a journeyman, carried a draft, supposed to be drawn by his master, a promissory note to him for 350 l. to Mr. Herne to procure payment; now to be sure upon the very outlines of the case, it must appear strongly impossible, that the master should be indebted to him in that sum; what could induce the master to give him such a promissory note, I cannot say; he carried to Mr. Herne, an attorney, this promissory note, purporting to be a note from Mr. Rust to him, promising to pay him 350 l. he gave Mr. Herne very singular directions upon it, desiring him to go on to recover the money; Mr. Herne being a gentleman of very considerable reputation, told him, there was no room for all that acceleration of the business, that he might wait; that he should first of all apprise him of the business; and when Mr. Herne came to Mr. Rust, telling him of the note, he was perfectly astonished, declared at that time, that he never had given such a note as this, but that it was a forgery; the young man came a second time to Mr. Herne, who told him he must go to Sir Sampson Wright's; but an acquaintance of the prisoner's thought it better to go to my learned friend here, Mr. Garrow, and to him they went. Gentlemen, the case is very particularly circumstanced, and it will require a very serious consideration from you; for as the law stands, this being Mr. Rust's note, purporting to be drawn by him, and bearing his signature, he is a man interested in the event of that suit, and cannot be a witness; then, how is it possible that he should establish the criminality of this young man, Mr. Rust cannot be a witness; you will then have to go another degree of proof, for whereever there is a criminality existing, it behoves the laws of the country to sift out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260160"/> the criminality, and if one degree of testimony is cut off, you must resort to another; remembering, however, that unless the matter in issue should at the last convince an honest and intelligent jury of the guilt of the prisoner, the man will go acquitted. In most common transactions we are obliged to resort to probability, and it will be for you to put all these circumstances together, to weigh them well, and consider whether they furnish that result in your minds, as shall honestly and fairly convince you of the guilt of the prisoner; if there be any doubt, you will let him go acquitted. This being the case, and as I am free to confess, I shall be cut out of the advantage, and the public also of receiving the evidence of Mr. Rust; I must trust to the circumstances of this case: the first circumstance is the situation of this young man, in the employ of Mr. Rust, a journeyman, not having it in his power to advance money, not requiring any particular act of bounty, whether it be probable his master should give him this note, is for you to determine. I shall lay before you this sort of evidence from those people that have frequently seen Mr. Rust write, and are confident of his writing, that it is not his hand; I shall prove that this young man one day, a little before the execution of this instrument, had bought a couple of stamps, and was writing on one of them, and manifested confusion, on being discovered of what he was writing; but I wish not to catch your passions, nor to inflame them; I wish that the evidence may come seriously before you, that your minds may be as free from passion and prejudice as possible; if you should be of opinion that the probability of the circumstance furnishes a degree of testimony, which shall in your breasts, and as you think to all others, furnish the evidence of demonstration, it will be your duty under the consideration of what you owe to your country, to find the prisoner guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Herne. He left the note with me at that time, but on my turning to the back of it, I saw it was not indorsed; I told him nobody could recover it; he did not seem to understand what indorsing was; I did not enquire that young man's name, I should not know him again; the young fellow said he was a shoemaker in St. Martin's-lane; I asked him who recommended him to me; he said, a Mr. Mell.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not seem to be well acquainted with the nature of notes or bills? - He did not seem to know the nature of indorsements; but at the desire of the young fellow, he wrote his name very well on the back.</p>
               <p>Did you hold any conversation with him at this presentment of the bill? - I was going out in a great hurry at that time, therefore nothing passed; he desired I would send one of my clerks; I went up to Islington, and it struck me it was a very extraordinary circumstance, a young fellow coming so soon after it was due, to arrest him; I went the same day into Butcher-row; I called upon an opposite neighbour, and went over to Mr. Rust, and presented it to Mr. Rust, and he refused payment.</p>
               <p>Did, at any future time, any conversation pass between you and the prisoner? - The prisoner said he would come at eight that evening, but he did not; he called several times at my house, and I did not see him; he called on me one morning, in company with another young fellow, not the same that came before; that was after the warrant had been issued for his apprehension; I believe it was five or six days; he said, have you got me the money? I said, Mr. Disney, you have got me into a fine scrape, you must go with me to Sir Sampson's; why, says he, where is my note; what, will he not pay me my money? No, says I, he says it is a forgery; he said he would go directly; he appeared no more confused than I was; the person that was with him said, you had better not go to Sir Sampson's; do not let us go into the lion's mouth, says he, we will consult Mr. Garrow; and the prisoner afterwards said, why then, we will go to Mr. Garrow, and call on you, Mr. Herne, in the evening; and away they went, and I never saw him any more.</p>

               <p>Was he known to you? - I thought I knew him; he told me he lived at No. 9, or 11, in St. Martin's-lane, and was a shoemaker; I do not know that of my own knowledge, but I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>He left the note, without any caution on the business, but to get the money as fast as you could? - Yes; he wanted to have him arrested that night; I have no concern whatever in this prosecution, I attend merely as being bound over; he wrote his name on the back of the note,

               <p>Have you seen him write? - I have, many different times.</p>
               <p>Do you think you have seen him write so frequently, as to enable you to say, upon your oath, whether such a writing, bearing his name, is Mr. Rust's hand-writing? - I have many a time seen him write, and the prisoner at the bar. (Looks at the note.) I do not believe this is Mr. Rust's handwriting;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260163"/> for he writes in a more full hand than this; I have seen the prisoner at the bar write, and he writes a more light hand than this.</p>

            , and tell me if you think that is his hand-writing? - I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>You have seen him write many times? - I have; I do not think it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you, Mr. Smith? - A leather-factor.</p>
               <p>Have you seen much of his hand-writing? - A good deal of it.</p>
               <p>Have you at this time a promissory note of the prisoner's? - I have.</p>
               <p>And from your knowledge, you do not think this is the prisoner's hand-writing? - I do not, really.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - About fourteen years; he lived with Mr. Rust, he was his apprentice, and afterwards his managing man; I never saw Mr. Rust before yesterday; I never went to the Justice of Peace, nor the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it yesterday, when he applied to you? - I saw him in the early part of the day.</p>
               <p>Was you here yesterday; when we had Mr. Brownrigg? - I was not in court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rust shewed you this, did not he? - I saw it at Mr. Herne's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rust told you it was a forgery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you it was a forgery, and wanted you to prove it? - I would have trusted the prisoner at the bar with any property.</p>
               <p>I ask you, because I know you are an honest man, and have a good opinion of the prisoner, he told you that it was not his hand-writing, and that it was a forgery? - He did so.</p>
               <p>And then Mr. Herne shewed it to you in the presence of Mr. Rust? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What marks did he point out to you, by which you might know it was not his handwriting? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>By which you might think about it? - I am not at a certainty about it.</p>
               <p>What mark did Mr. Rust describe to you by which you knew it was not his handwriting? - I do not say that it is not his hand-writing; Mr. Rust asked me if I thought that was his R.</p>
               <p>I knew it was the R he had fixed upon? - I do not swear neither one way or the other.</p>
               <p>He told you at first it was a forgery, and that it was not his hand-writing; what stroke of the R was it that he pointed out directly? - I think just the same as I said before; Mr. Rust writes much larger.</p>
               <p>What state of health was your neighbour Mr. Rust in about a twelvemonth ago? - I believe he was in the country, as near as I can recollect, about that time; I do not recollect his being very ill; he went into the country for his health.</p>
               <p>Is not he a very infirm old gentleman? - I look upon him a very hearty man of his age.</p>
               <p>Not an infirm man? - No.</p>
               <p>What was that he told you at Mr. Herne's, about the blemishes at the top of the T? - There was not a word mentioned about the T; there never was any thing mentioned, but about the R.</p>
               <p>What was the particular observation that he mentioned to you? - That it was too light for his hand-writing; I have known this young man for fourteen years, and if he was to come to my shop to-morrow, I would trust him with fifty pounds; he had the management of the business.</p>
               <p>He was called his son? - I never heard that before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Did you look to him as the young man that was likely to succeed to the business? - I did look upon him so.</p>
               <p>How long was it since Mr. Rust's wife died? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know that this young man had the fortunate accident to get something in the lottery? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Have you had much dealings with Mr. Rust? - He always paid me ready money.</p>
               <p>Does Mr. Rust deal in country-made shoes? - I believe he does.</p>
               <p>We all know that the country shoemakers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260164"/> very often bring up very good bargains to town? - Certainly they do.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Rust was in the luck of buying a good many bargains? - Not to my knowledge; I have seen country made shoes in his shop.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the hand writing of Mr. Rust? - Not well enough to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him write? - I have often seen him write.</p>
               <p>Can you say, when you see his name to any instrument to which Mr. Rust's name should be wrote, that it is hand writing? - I think it is not his hand writing, but I cannot swear it, nor do not pretend to swear it.</p>
               <p>According to the best of your belief, is it, or is it not his hand writing? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Court. You believe from your recollection of his hand writing that it is not his hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - I am a butcher in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Then you have had once a year, or once in every half year a receipt from Mr. Rust for shoes? - Once a month.</p>
               <p>Is your knowledge of his writing, or is it not, formed from a comparison with those receipts? - I thought it was not his hand writing when I first saw it.</p>
               <p>How did you first see this note? - I saw it at Guildhall; I went with Mr. Rust; Mr. Rust had told me of this forgery, and that it was not his hand writing; Mr. Rust never pointed out any thing particular of the letters; he put the note into my hand, and asked me to look at it, and to give my opinion of it.</p>
               <p>Wherein does it differ? - I think the R. and the Thomas is not so like.</p>
               <p>In what do they differ? - I think he writes a lighter hand, not so heavy a hand at the word Thomas in particular.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted you can write? - A little.</p>
               <p>I dare say it has happened with you to begin with a new pen, and at first it writes ill, you never taught writing? - No. I teach writing!</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose this note now had been for five pounds instead of three hundred and fifty, and it had been brought to you to discount it, was it so unlike that you should have refused it? - I do not know that I should, but I should not think Mr. Rust ever had a note out; I should have thought it was not his hand writing, because I should have thought he had no note out.</p>

               <p>That is quite a different thing, if you can separate in your own mind the impression under which you first saw this note, which was the impression of its being forged; now supposing you had seen it without that, if you had seen these words

            , without having heard any thing of it before, should you have thought it was not Mr. Rust's hand writing? - I rather think I should.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Pring is a relation of Mr. Rust's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What relation are you to Mr. Rust? - I married his niece.</p>
               <p>Has he any children of his own? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the young man at the bar? - Ever since he came there, he has been with him all the time, from his first going there till lately; he was a great favourite, I always looked upon him so; a very good servant.</p>
               <p>I believe it was pretty generally understood, that this young man would succeed to the business? - It was.</p>
               <p>I believe he was so great a favourite, that it was understood if there was any fortune he would get that too; you hoped not, I know? - Mr. Rust told me he had left him sixty pounds; I never heard this young man called by the name of Rust; I visited there many times.</p>
               <p>I believe this young man had the good or ill fortune to hit upon the expedient of making boots without a seam? - Yes, I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Now you have heard this, that for that same boot of his without a seam, he should have a seam round his neck, that he would hang him if he had twenty lives? - I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260165"/> heard any expression from Mr. Rust of that sort; I heard him say if he had continued with him till Christmas, that he would have given him his business; but he would not stay any longer than Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>You heard so from Mr. Rust? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was very ungrateful in Mr. Rust's opinion? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Has he never said it was a very shabby and scandalous thing? - Never.</p>
               <p>He praised him for it may be? - Not to me, I had no conversation with Mr. Rust about it.</p>
               <p>Yes, you had; was that all he said, did he not accompany it with any blessing or benedictions on the young man? - I heard nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has taken his son since apprentice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What age is your son? - Between fourteen and fifteen; he went apprentice just about the time of his leaving him; he was with me before.</p>
               <p>What business did you intend to put him to? - No particular business; when this young man was gone, I applied to Mr. Rust to take my son.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you know any thing of his intentions to this young man more than his suceeding to the business? - I heard him say he had left him sixty pounds in his will, and letting him succeed to the business.</p>

               <p>Have you seen him write at all during the last eight years? - I will not take upon myself to say that I have seen him write his name to any thing.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A shoemaker; I live now in Mitre court.</p>
               <p>You was before the Grand Jury Mr. Marm, when this bill was found against the defendant? - I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>When was you applied to about this? - It might be a week.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was not since last Sunday? - No, I believe it was before last Sunday; Mr. Rust called upon me, and asked me if I would attend in respect of a note that was drawn on him for three hundred and fifty pounds; that it was not his hand writing, and he would be very much obliged to me to attend; I saw it at the attorney's about Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Rust there at that time? - He was there.</p>
               <p>What was it in the capital R. that he pointed out to you that was not his hand writing? - It is rather not done strong enough.</p>
               <p>It therefore appeared to you to be done twice, that the principal thing, he marked it out to you, you thought it very singular he should give a note for three hundred and fifty pounds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What are the usual wages you give to journeymen? - Generally two shillings a pair, we do not pay any man by the week; Mr. Rust gave me twelve shillings; I have had sixteen shillings; I have had one guinea a week.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260166"/>Did it happen that you lived with the prisoner any time after this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where and when? - In St. Martin's-lane; he carried on business there; I lived with him as errand boy; this was in October; it was that day week I went to him after he left Mr. Rust.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time in October send you to a stationer for any thing? - About a month before he left St. Martin's-lane, to the best of my knowledge, that day week that the warrants were out, he left St. Martin's-lane; about a month before he left St. Martin's-lane, he sent me to the stationer's in St. Martin's-court for a shilling stamp, and a two penny stamp, I took them in to him, and came out of the parlour again; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that, I went to go into the parlour again; as I had just opened the door Mr. Disney put his hand upon the door and would not let me come in, and on one of these stamps he was writing, but I cannot say which; to the best of my knowledge, it was between seven and eight in the evening; then when he left St. Martin's-lane, I used to go backwards and forwards to him when he was at hide and seek; I went to him at Mr. Lord's in Gracechurch-street, and he said to me one morning, when I saw him at Mr. Lord's, says he, the lawyers have been here, and I only wish I could get a man to swear that he had seen Mr. Rust put his name to this note, then he said, you can swear that you saw Mr. Rust put his name to it.</p>
               <p>Was it in answer to any thing that you said? - No, I said nothing.</p>
               <p>What answer did you make? - I told him I did not like to do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass between you before you left him at that time? - No, Sir, not at that time.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again after this? - I do not know that I saw him again after this at that house.</p>
               <p>Well then at any other place? - About a fortnight after he sent a young man up to me.</p>
               <p>In consequence of that message did you see him at any other place and where? - I went to an empty house, Clerkenwell-green, Alyesbury-street; that night he sent me for some bread and cheese; and then he said, the only way to do Mr. Rust over is to set his house on fire, and burn him in it; says he, I will tell you how it is to be done; there is a hole just where the scraper is at the shop door, and by putting some links in there it may be done; there was nothing more passed that night, we went to bed together; I was with him all day on Sunday; he was there unknown to any body.</p>
               <p>What did he say on the Sunday? - I do not know, for we slept all the day away almost; I left him on the Monday morning, I went to him again towards dinner time to the same place, I fetched him two rolls and treacle.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between you aboutthe note? - He told me he would be d - d if the signing the note was his writing, meaning himself; I had told him if he was taken that the Judge and Jury would think within themselves that Mr. Rust being a man of property would never go to be indebted in such a sum to a servant; then I told him again, says I, the Judge will ask you how you came by this money; then he made answer to me, and said, what is that to them; then I left him.</p>
               <p>Did you see him any more after this time of parting, before he was apprehended? - I saw him the next day, and he was talking about a young fellow he was very well acquainted with; I was saying what a fearful man he was, and he said, yes, he was very fearful; and I think to the best of my knowledge he was one of them that was concerned; I do not know any thing more that passed.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more before he was taken up? - He went away from that house on the Saturday, and he went down to his sister's, and he told me to come on Sunday to his sister's, in Church-lane, Rosemary-lane, and he said, do you know a man that is very much like me, says he, I wish I could get a man to go and surrender<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260167"/> himself for me, and take a trial for me, and then, says he, after he has had his trial, he can say, he is not the man, and I will give him fifty guineas, or fifty pounds, I am not sure which he said; then I left him, and he said, there are two or three brothers of the name of Withers, and he said, that is the hair-dresser, that is very much like me, I wish you could go and see if you can find him, I am told, says he, he lives in Leather-lane, or somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Did you know this young man when he lived at Mr. Rust's, before he left him? - Yes, I lived twice at Mr. Rust's.</p>
               <p>What appearance had he of property? - No appearance at all of property but wages.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Fielding. You forget your own opening, you stated that he had property, and became very extravagant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was in Tothill-fields Bridewell, what was the name of that woman you robbed? - I do not know her name, she accused me wrongfully.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - Fifteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Therefore you would have us believe that since that robbery you have been an honest lad? - No, Sir, nobody has found me out.</p>
               <p>How long did you lay in gaol on that occasion? - Till sessions, and when sessions came I was turned out.</p>
               <p>When was it that Mr. Rust said, that you was a loitering, lurking, half hanged rascal, and should never come into his house, you was his apprentice? - No, I went of errands.</p>
               <p>So this Mr. Disney, who is supposed to consult some counsel, consulted you as his counsel? - There was no counsel nor attorney.</p>
               <p>So you stood in place of counsel, and attorney, and judge? - No, I do not put myself upon a footing with that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lord was present at this conversation? - Mr. Lord never knew to my knowledge what Mr. Disney and I was talking about.</p>
               <p>You never had any conversation with Mr. Lord upon the subject? - No, nothing in particular as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Cannot you recollect whether you had any conversation at all with Mr. Lord upon the subject of this business? - I will tell you the conversation in a minute.</p>
               <p>Give an answer? - He was used to ask me if I saw Mr. Rust, or the like of that.</p>
               <p>What might you answer? - I told him, whether I had seen him or not.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Mr. Lord about that? - Mr. Lord was talking to me once about the note, and he said, did you ever know Mr. Disney lend Mr. Rust any money, and I told him, yes, two and three guineas at a time; but to my knowledge always paid him again very soon.</p>
               <p>Now that was exactly what you said? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I shall brush up your memory before I have done with you; was not there a little conversation about Mr. Rust's signing a note in the shop ha! look at this gentleman and give your answer? - Yes, I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Now let us hear what that conversation was? - Upon my word I cannot recollect to my knowledge what it was.</p>
               <p>Why could not you recollect when you said yourself, as well as the story of the links and the scraper? - I am very dull of apprehension.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never tell Mr. Lord that you saw Rust sign a note in the shop, to the prisoner Disney? - I might say so, or I might not.</p>
               <p>You may or you may not be hanged, but I ask you what you did say; I apprize you that Mr. Lord is here, and I shall call him?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say so, or did you not? - Yes, my Lord, I did.</p>
               <p>Now as you had some talk about Mr. Rust's signing a note to the prisoner, upon your oath did you say what that note was given for? - It might be two hundred, it might be three hundred, I cannot possibly say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260168"/> it was three hundred and fifty? - Upon my word I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you, or did you not say so? - I do not know to my knowledge, whether I did, or did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say at the time that it was for three hundred and fifty pounds? - No, Sir, I cannot swear that I did not, nor I cannot swear that I did.</p>
               <p>What sum did you name? - I do not know that I mentioned any sum in particular, I might say two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that to the best of your knowledge and recollection you did not name any sum? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, that you heard Rust say, it was for 350 l. do you believe you did say so? - I might say so; but upon my word I can't say.</p>
               <p>Did you say so, or did you not? - I cannot say whether I did, or did not, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, did you, or did you not tell him that you heard it was 350 l.? - Upon my word, I cannot particularly say, whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Come, try once more, you know what you said yourself, as well as what the prisoner said; did you tell Mr. Lord, that you heard Rust say that it was for 350 l. did you say so? - I do not know upon my word.</p>
               <p>Did you you tell Mr. Lord when the note was signed? - I told him it was signed in February; but for what sum I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>February, in what year? - It was either in 1783, or 1784.</p>
               <p>When did you go the second time to Mr. Rust? - In January, 1785.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell Mr. Lord, that you knew this note was signed in February 1785; because it was a fortnight after you came back to Mr. Rust's? - I do not know upon my word; but had I known what would have happened since, I should have remembered.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not say that? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is of no use to go further; I think it is impossible that such a young villainous testimony can have any weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will go on with it.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him over and over again, that you knew the time when you saw the note signed; because it was a fortnight after you went to Mr. Rust's the second time? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to make an affidavit of it before any magistrate? - Yes, my Lord, I did.</p>
               <p>With whom did you live these last three or four weeks? - These three or four weeks past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Aye? - I work for Mr. Rust.</p>
               <p>Have you lived with his family? have you eat at his table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you slept in his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much money have you received from him? - I never received but one guinea of him, and then he paid me for what work I had done.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, for what did you receive that one guinea; come, I know it, and I shall state it if you do not, and I will make you state it too; what did you receive that one guinea for? - Because Mr. Disney was taken.</p>
               <p>At the time you have stated that you saw Mr. Disney; did, or did not Mr. Rust know that you was going to see him? - I do not know that he did know it.</p>
               <p>You mean to state that answer? - I do.</p>
               <p>Where was he taken? - He was taken in a court in Church-lane, Rosemary-lane, at his sister's.</p>
               <p>Who shewed the officer where to find him? - I shewed the officer.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you go to him by the desire of Mr. Rust? - I told Mr. Rust so far as this, that I knew where he was.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him that you was with him frequently? - Since he has been taken, I did.</p>
               <p>How often have you held conversation with Mr. Rust about him? - I cannot say I ever did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260169"/>Did not Mr. Rust ask you every night whether you had seen Disney? - I did not see Mr. Rust every night, I never was in Mr. Rust's house to board and lodge before Disney was taken, I went backwards and forwards there for work.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you at all these times converse with Rust about Disney? - In fact, I never did go backwards and forwards to Mr. Rust's till Disney was taken, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>With whom did you make the bargain, that you should receive the guinea from Mr. Rust? - I did not make any bargain with him.</p>
               <p>How long before Disney was taken, did Rust promise you the guinea? - It might be a week or ten days before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Now, in that time, how often have you seen him? - I might have seen him three or four times.</p>
               <p>Was it not ten or a dozen times? - It might be ten or a dozen times.</p>
               <p>When was it you told Mr. Rust about the links? - Not till Disney was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Speak out, till some judgment strikes you dumb, you have kept it snug, perhaps you intended to do it yourself, you thought it would be a snug thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Lord present, when Disney told you he wished somebody to prove Mr. Rust's signing? - He never shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Did not he at that time shew you the note, in this way, holding the paper; here is the note of the old rogue's writing, if I could get some person to prove his hand writing; why, you could prove it? - He did not shew me the paper.</p>
               <p>When did you tell the prisoner, you should not like to go before the court? - I cannot say, whether it was before or after; I was not a witness to Mr. Brownrig's prosecution.</p>
               <p>How much money has Rust promised you, in case Mr. Disney should be hanged? - He promised me no money, he only promised me work.</p>
               <p>Have you dined at his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. From the time Disney left St. Martin's lane, who did you work with? - I did not work for Mr. Rust then.</p>
               <p>Who did you work with? - I did not work with any body then, I was expecting to get a place.</p>
               <p>Who did you apply to for work? - I spoke to several people, to people that I knew.</p>
               <p>What people; name any one, except Mr. Rust, that you applied to for work, and that person shall be sent to? - I used to go backwards and forwards to Mr. Lord's, after Disney left Saint Martin's-lane, Mr. Disney told me he should speak to Mr. Lord about a place for me.</p>
               <p>When did he tell you that? - After he left Saint Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>How long after? - It might be a week after, I did not get any work from Mr. Rust till Disney was taken, I do not know to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now, that you may not be caught, I will read you what you have said already; you have said, Mr. Rust has paid you a guinea, besides paying you for your work, and that was a week or ten days before the prisoner was taken. Now do you mean to say, that you had done no work for Mr. Rust then? - Yes, Sir, I had worked for him then a little.</p>
               <p>Before that time, before he promised you a guinea, how long was it after he left Saint Martin's-lane before he was taken? - It might be six weeks, or two months, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Now, how long of that time had you worked at Mr. Rust's? - I might have worked for him two or three days, or a week.</p>

               <p>You had better speak the truth? - I said, he promised me a guinea when Disney was taken, I could not say that.</p>
               <p>You have said it, and you may contradict it now? - It was about ten days; because I remember meeting Mr. Rust.</p>
               <p>Court. You may go down, but not out of court.</p>

I told him no, none to my knowledge; he then mentioned it again, that I should tell Mr. Rust, and I made answer and said, I suppose Mr. Rust knows what money you mean, and

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 38, Gracechurch-street, I am master of an academy, I have been acquainted with Mr. Disney four or five years; I knew him, while he was in Mr. Rust's service.</p>
               <p>You have had an intimate acquaintance with him? - I was introduced to him four or five years ago, I made an intimate acquaintance with him, I always believed him to be exceedingly honest, sober, diligent and prudent. I have been with him in company several times, when there have been friends met together, he never was persuaded to drink above two glasses of wine; about a month, or some time before he left Mr. Rust, he applied to me for a little money I owned him, and to lend him some more, in consequence of which I did at that time, I did not take security for some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>He came to your house about some hesitation in paying a note of Mr. Rust's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mason? - Frequently, after Disney at my house; two, three, or four days; not less than two, or more than four; as I knew Mason had lived with Rust, I thought he might know something about the affair, I called him up into a room, where there was nobody but him and me; I questioned him if he knew any thing about it, he said yes, I do; I replied, what? he said, I know that in February, 1785, Mr. Disney called Mr. Rust into the shop, says he, will you sign this note, (Mason told me that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260171"/> Disney said so to Mr. Rust) Mr. Rust seemed rather angry, but went to the board, what they called the cutting-board I understood, and signed it. I asked Mason if he knew what the sum was, or how much the note was; he told me he had heard Mr. Rust mention the words 350 l.; I asked him how he knew it was in February, as it was so long since; he told me it was a fortnight or three weeks, or such a time after he came to Mr. Rust's service; the last time, I said, are you sure of that? because if you are sure of it, I will be Disney's friend; he replied, he was sure, and that he would take his oath of it; I told him not to deceive me, for if he was not right, I should be very sorry to be engaged in it; he insisted upon it, that it was; I said, you may deceive me perhaps; but if you are taken before the Magistrate, or before a Court, you will be so cross-examined, that you cannot deceive them; says he, I will take my affidavit of it before any Magistrate, or before any Court in England; I questioned him two or three times on the following days on the same subject, he still persevered in the same words, or very near them, that he would take his affidavit before any Magistrate, or any Court.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Disney left your house, you still saw Mason? - I still saw Mason, and he told me he did not know where Disney was, several times he told me he could get no place, in consequence of having nobody to give him a character, for that Mr. Rust would not, for Mr. Rust had told him in Disney's shop a few days before, that he would be hanged, and that he deserved to be hanged; that was not long after the affair was first known, not long after the warrants were issued, it might be a week since Mr. Disney was apprehended, and before he was apprehended after the warrants were issued, Mr. Rust was at my house many times, and I at his house, and many times he told me that Mason was a villain, a d - n'd rogue, that he would be hanged; he called him by the name of Ned, the usual name he went by; he said, he deserved to be hanged long ago, that he would come to the gallows; this he repeated many times, and I repeated many times: Mr. Rust and I were talking at my house about the affair after Disney was apprehended, I believe it will be a fortnight tomorrow Mr. Rust called on me, and we were talking about Disney; Mr. Rust said, Disney has robbed me of what he cannot give me, for he has told of my cheating the king of his taxes: Rust was collector of the king's taxes, I understood so, that he would not have prosecuted him, if he had not told about that, if he had robbed him of five hundred pounds: Rust told me before Mr. Greenwood and some others, that when Ned (meaning Mason) came back from discovering where Disney was, Mason did offer to come into Mr. Rust's house, that he told him to go away and be hanged like a d - n'd rascal as he was, for he would come to the gallows.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot ask you any thing that the prisoner Disney said to you, consistent with the rules of evidence, but I will ask you this; did you by any means know where Disney was before he was taken? - I did not for some time; but I did know where he was before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You keep an academy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of what sort, pray Sir, how many scholars have you? - Near 130, which I raised in three years from four; I have some ushers. I have known Disney four or five years.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when he served as a journeyman shoemaker to the prosecutor? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was he an intimate of your's at the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>In what line of intimacy at that time? - I was introduced to him at a ball, at a dance I was at with a friend of mine; in consequence of this I saw him several times.</p>
               <p>Did he dress in the style at that time in which he is now, at that time when he was a journeyman shoemaker? - He did,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260172"/> and he was introduced to me at a ball; at first, I did not know his business; but I understood afterwards he was a relation of Mr. Rust's; I imagine he might be dressed as he is now; I was first told he was a shoemaker; I thought he was in business for himself; I understood he was a relation of Mr. Rust's.</p>
               <p>Did your curiosity lead you to enquire what degree of relationship he stood in to Mr. Rust? - No, I did not; I asked him, he told me Mr. Rust was not a gentleman; he continued to dress in the same way; but when I saw him at Mr. Rust's house, I have seen him very dirty.</p>
               <p>When did he make his application to you to borrow some money? - I believe it was in August; I believe it was fifty pounds that he had lent to me; I always understood that he was a man of property, and that he had several hundred pounds of his own; I did not conceive him to be a common journeyman shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Did not you know when the business of the note was first put in agitation? - I did not; I know, when he brought the note to me after Christmas, he was to have paid me back some money I had lent him; in consequence of which, I thought he used me ill, and was rather displeated; I had written a letter to him; I had called at his house, but did not see him; after a few days, I cannot say how long, he called at my house, and there was a young man with him; he says to me, I cannot pay you the money; I am very sorry for it; but here is a deposit, I will put this into your hands as a security; the note was, I believe, for three hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Then, at that time, he was not able to make good his payment to you, and you had requested payment? - It might be about the beginning of February, I told him the note was a great deal above my demand, which then, I believe, was sixty, or between sixty and seventy pounds; I said, I did not want security, that I wanted the money, as I was to pay some; and I should be glad of a part of the money; I lent him money after the first time; I made him up the sum of fifty pounds; I lent him at one time, I believe, twenty-five pounds; I have his note of hand, payable so many days after date; I did not negotiate it; I afterwards had another note for another twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Did he give you a note for twenty pounds? - I had a note for twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>At what time was it that this note for three hundred and fifty pounds became due? - In February; this was in February, he and the other person that was with him, which I understood to be White, took up this note; and he told me when this note became due, this note of three hundred and fifty pounds; Mr. Disney then came to me, I believe it was the 17th of February; he said the note was not paid; he said that the note was not paid, that I am sure he said; that in consequence, he had deposited it in the hands of a Mr. Herne, of Paternoster-row, who is an Attorney; I am sure he said that the note was not paid.</p>
               <p>And in consequence of that, you saw Mason after you knew of this young man being pursued by Mr. Rust? - I had that conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Mason that Disney had offered the note to you? - I had told Mr. Rust that Mr. Disney had offered the note to me several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had the note to run when it was offered to you? - It was in the month of February he offered it, to shew me there would be money to pay me soon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mason. Whose buckles are those that you have got on? - Mr. Disney's.</p>
               <p>Did Disney give them to you? - I will swear he gave them to me; it was soon after I went to Mr. Rust's; I asked him two or three times to lend them to me to put in my shoes; he said, I will, after two or three times wearing them; I swear that positively; I used to wear them on a Sunday now and then, before he left Mr. Rust's service.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, did you ever wear these, before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260173"/> he was in custody? - Yes, Sir, at the time he was in St. Martin's-lane I wore them.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath, Rust did not give these buckles to you? - No, he did not give me the buckles I now have in my shoes, I can swear the prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Was any body present? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you went into Mr. Rust's service? - It might be half ay ear or seven months.</p>
               <p>Court. What buckles did Mr. Rust give you? - I do not know that he ever gave me a pair of buckles, I have only got this one pair of buckles, I have no other.</p>
               <p>What buckles did you think the gentleman meant, or was asking you after? - I could not say what buckles he meant.</p>
               <p>What buckles did Rust give you? - He gave me no buckles to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you positively swear that Rust never gave you a pair of buckles in your life, will you swear it? - No, my Lord, he never gave me a pair of buckles. I have one question to ask if you will hear me: Mr. Lord said that I asked Mr. Rust to take me into his house; now I never did ask Mr. Rust that, Mr. Rust sent for me.</p>
               <p>Then what Rust told Lord was not true? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then Rust sent for you? - Yes, I did not apply to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much money did Mr. Rust give you to take the clothes out of pawn? - He gave his apprentice the money; they were Mr. Disney's, I pawned them, Mr. Disney told me to pawn them.</p>
               <p>Then when you took them out of pawn, you carried them to Mr. Disney? - I gave Disney part of the money and some money I got on part of the things he told me to keep.</p>
               <p>How much money did you give him? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Whose name did you pawn then in? - In my own name.</p>
               <p>Where did you pawn them? - I pawned some of them by Clerkenwell Church.</p>
               <p>Was this after Disney had left St. Martin's-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now when did you tell Mr. Rust that you had pawned them, was it after Disney was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you redeem them? - It was when Mr. Lord came for them.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Lord you had pawned them? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not Lord come from Disney for his clothes after he was taken? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>How much money did Mr. Rust advance to get them out of pawn? - He sent his lad to go with me, and he gave the money to the lad, he gave him a guinea.</p>
               <p>How much of that money have you given Mr. Disney? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you give him one shilling of that guinea? - I did, Sir.</p>
               <p>How much? - I cannot say how much.</p>
               <p>Did you give him one, two, or three shillings? - It might be one, two, or three shillings; it might be three, four, or five shillings, I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Lord. At the same time that Rust was asking me about Mason, he was secreted in his house; Disney appeared to me in a worse situation than I had observed him, he said his clothes were pawned; in consequence of this I went to No. 62, in Clement's-lane, I enquired of Mr. Rust if he knew where Mason was; he said no, that he had seen him a day or two before, and that he might see him in a day or two again; and if he did, he would ask him for these things; in a day or two after Rust came to my house, and brought me the duplicate of these things; he said he had met Mason, or met with Mason, and that Mason had given him these duplicates. I said it was not in my power to know where they were pawned, Rust left them with me, then I called upon him in the evening with a friend, to know if he had enquired of Mason for a direction where these things were pawned, he desired me to leave the duplicates, in consequence of that, Mr. Rust sent the things to me the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260174"/>Mr. Fielding. How much does that young man owe you now? - I should suppose near thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Can you re collect nearly about what time it was that Rust sent you the prisoner's clothes? - It was after the prisoner was taken up, of course it was not above a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Court to Mason. Who was it that Rust sent with you to redeem the clothes? -

               <p>Look at that? - There is something, I think, resembling it, but to say positively I will not.</p>
               <p>From the knowledge you have little or great of his hand-writing, do you believe that is his hand-writing? - I cannot say; but if a note came to me signed like this, for any small sum, I should not have rejected it.</p>
               <p>From looking at such a note should you have thought it a forgery? - No, Sir, not if it had come from any body I knew.</p>
               <p>Now look at it, supposing you had known nothing of it? - I think there is something in the R, and a little of the T, because he makes his T turn up a little.</p>

               <p>If that had been offered to you as his signature to any vestry act, would you have thought it to have been his hand-writing or a forgery? - Upon my word I should have thought it to have been his handwriting.</p>

               <p>He was a collector of the King's tax, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From your knowledge of his writing do you believe and do you think that is his hand-writing; would you take that as his receipt for land-tax? - It is very much like it.</p>
               <p>Is it so much like it as it would have passed upon you as his hand-writing? - Oh, yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - No, Sir, I should have had no doubt about it, it would have passed with me. I came by the shop one day, and Mr. Rust called me into his shop, it was before Disney was taken; the very next day after this was mentioned, I went in to enquire of Mr. Rust after Disney, and he said, that he had forged so and so for 350 l. I said, dear me, could it be so? says I, if I knew where he was, I would send him fifty miles further from you sooner than you should take him; that is really truth, for I could not think his story was true; says he, he has certainly done so. Then he was taken up; I came by the door, and he caught me by the hand and pulled me up the steps, he said he certainly was a bad fellow, for he had several receipts of his that he had forged upon him for different things, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260175"/> he would hang him if he had twenty necks.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Thwaites, No. 106, High-Holborn. On Monday the 7th of November, in the evening, between five and six, Mr. Thwaites sent me with his cart to deliver some goods at Mr. Gibson's, <placeName id="t17860426-111-crimeloc507">Barbican</placeName>

Leith and Watts, Sadlers-hall, Cheapside; the cart was at Mr. Gibson's door; the goods were all taken out; this box and another remained; I was standing by the cart, and saw somebody go up Prince's-street with the contents, without the box; I found him on the opposite side of the cart; I followed the man without looking in the cart, but before I overtook him, a man met me in the street and pushed me down, and asked me, if it was me that eat part of a turkey; he took me, and laid me down, not with any force; I immediately went back to Mr. Gibson's house; I did not continue to follow the man with the prints.</p>
               <p>Why did you not cry out for help when you first saw the man? - There was nobody near; I told Mr. Gibson, and he followed them, and cried stop thief; that is all I know; the carter's name is

               <p>On Monday the 7th of November, between five and six in the evening, and Mr. Thwaites cart was at the door, I heard Bradley cry out, there are six pieces of prints gone; Mr. Nicholson ran after him; I ran into Golden-lane, expected him to come that way, and there I saw the two boys scuffling with the prisoner, when I got within fifteen or twenty yards of him, I saw the boy fall down; he was making his escape; I ran after him, and laid hold of him as fast as I could; he said, I will shoot you; he put a pistol to my face, and the fire came into my face; I called for assistance; the two boys said to me, that is him; I saw him drop the goods; the prisoner was on the spot; it was just as I had laid hold of him that the pistol snapped in my face; I tried to secure his arms, and cried out, for God's sake assist me, he has more; he gave a plunge, and threw the pistol away; there were two or three came up, and he was taken to the constable and secured; I desired the constable to take care of him, I expected he would be rescued, he looked about for his cutlass, but could not find it; I was near half an hour in the house with him; I went out through the croud and called the patrol, and desired the patrol to come and bring his cutlass with him; the patrol came; my wife was very much frightened, and I stepped in to let her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260179"/> know I was not hurt; and I heard a shout that he had acted the part of harlequin.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know his person to a certainty? - Yes, my Lord, I should know him from five thousand; I looked at his face, and pulled off his hat once or twice, and I looked at his hands, and said, how do you get your living my friend, he said, he was a watchmaker; I said, you work very hard, you have a nice soft hand; the prints were brought to my house, either Tuesday or Wednesday; I sent Mr. Nicholson, to deliver them to Mr. Lieffe.</p>
               <p>Did any of Mr. Thwaite's people see the prints? - Nobody but but Bradley; I had seen the prints at Mr. Thwaite's and I knew them to be Mr. Thwaite's; they were not untied at all; I have seen them loose at Mr. Thwaite's, but they are easily distinguished; I could see them very plain; they were only tied round with a cord; I am sure they were Mr. Thwaite's property.</p>

            ; the prisoner came into our shop about five in the afternoon, she came and asked to see some remnants of cloth, I shewed her several pieces; I could not find any that would please her, at last I found a remnant that suited her, and she bought it; when I went to look for some more, there was some muslin lay near where the cloths were, and she took up four of them, says she, this is not cloth, this is callico; she carried them to the light, where the cloths were, and she laid them amongst the cloths; they laid there a quarter of an hour amongst the cloths, and I sold her a remnant of cloth; she went out; I went to see if I could find the muslin handkerchiefs, and I could not find four; then I pursued her, I overtook her about half a dozen yards from the shop, and she came with me back to the shop, I asked her to let me see what she had in her apron, and I found the handkerchiefs there with the cloth; she begged I would not send for a constable, and she would pay me for it; so I immediately sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Did she take that article she bought? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did she stay after she bought the cloth? - Ten minutes or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>When you found this in her apron, were they folded up, or separate? - They were separate; I put a paper about the cloth, and it was taken off, I am sure I put a paper on; it was not tied, it was only a small remnant.</p>
               <p>Was the muslin handkerchief rolled up in paper in the shop? - No.</p>

            ; we looked through a board in a skettle ground behind the house; the skettle ground belongs to the Rose and Crown in Cloth-fair; it is partly a wall, and the rest is carried up with boards, and there was a knot in one of these boards, which was cut; I saw Hill at work at the fire, with a crucible heating the metal; I saw Lard, who is an evidence, at work; and there was mould and sand, I saw him throw sand and dust over it: Guire came down as I was upon the ladder, he came through the shed, and came up the wall, and came out of a trap door, I was then upon the ladder; Guire came up to this trap door and came out; there were sacks at that time over the windows, which is a sky-light, he moved the sacks, and I thought we were perceived, and I pointed to the top of the place immediately, and the other officers went to the door of the street, and broke it open; I went in at the trap door, and that brought me into the room where these people were at work; Hill and Lard made their escape up stairs, it was a shed on the ground floor adjoining to the house, I found only Guire there.</p>
               <p>How came he to stay for you there? - I cannot say, I was down very soon after him, he let himself down very easy, and I dropped down after him, I cannot say where he was going.</p>
               <p>You did not see Guire doing any thing in the shed? - I did not myself, I was the last that looked through the board. and I suppose there was an alarm; I searched Guire, and found two halfpence upon him, which I suppose to be like them that were making, and some others that were very good, the others were in his pockets; many other things were found there, which the other witnesses have; I was the first person that was in the room, I found the crucible in the furnace at that very time, there was boiling hot metal in it, there were scales and weights, and a pair of tongs, and things of different kinds, and this ladle, and this is what they hand the crucible out with; I saw the prisoner Hill using these things, as I was on the ladder looking through the hole; this ladle was laying on the furnace, here is the mould, it was then open, but it was put together since to keep it, as it was then set; there were some old buckles for melting, and some small sheets of copper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. I suppose you know as little about casting, as you do about coining? - I know nothing at all about it, I never saw a thing of this kind before.</p>

               <p>What did you understand by small work? - Such as watch seals and that.</p>
               <p>How do you mean to do, lad? - To cast it; I went to Hill's house, No. 4, Cloth-fair, on the 21st of March, and there was about ten pound of metal run in a square piece, and afterwards Hill said he had a little job to do, and this mould had thirty-nine halfpence in one part, I made one side by the help of Hill and Guire, we made it between us.</p>
               <p>What is it for? - They told me it was do some cast-iron halfpence.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of St. Giles's, I stopped Minton with a pewter pot under his coat, on the 21st of March, I think it was on a Tuesday; I marked the pot at the bottom, the prisoner Minton told me where he was going to sell it, the Magistrate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260187"/> sent us with the prisoner Minton to see where he sold it, I was at the door, I stopped him as he came out; he said he sold it for sixpenny-worth of halfpence, there are the halfpence that he sold it for.</p>
               <p>Into whose house did he go? - Into the house of the prisoner Fletcher; and as soon as he came out, I went in; he carried in the pot, and brought out sixpenny worth of halfpence, and said he had sold it for them; Fletcher keeps an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The value is sixteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Lucas. I went to Fletcher, and told him I believed he had got the pewter pot that the boy had brought in just now; he said he had not; I said, I am afraid you have; and looking to the fire, I found this shovel on the fire; not seeing the pewter pot, I searched the wife, and found this pint pot; there was a kind of a forge, and I found the quart pot in the fire; I took him to the Magistrate, and left him there, and came back to search the house further, and found these pieces of pewter; I left a man that assisted me, till I returned; the Magistrate said to Minton, that he would shew him all the favour he could, if he would find the receiver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. Whether he did not ask me what money I would give him to make up this affair? - No such thing; no conversation of that kind.</p>
               <p>Who was the Magistrate? - Mr. Walker, in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury.</p>

               <p>I belong to Mr. Walker's; I was with Lucas, and we met Minton, and took this quart pot from under his coat; we took him to the office, and Mr. Walker said he should like to find out the people that bought these things; and the prisoner Minton said, I will tell you where; and we went with him to the prisoner Fletcher, in Newtoner's-lane; he went to Fletcher's, and was in about a couple of minutes, and came out with sixpenny worth of halfpence in his hand; he shewed them to me, and I gave them to Lucas; Mr. Walker promised the prisoner Minton some favour, on account of discovering the receiver; I saw him take in the pot under his coat; we watched at some distance; then Lucas and I went into the back yard, and there I saw a forge, and a frying-pan atop of it; I did not find any thing in the fire; I staid in the shop, while Lucas searched in the backyard, and I saw Lucas take a pint pot out of the woman's pocket; I believe this is the same; then Lucas called out to me, I have found a quart pot; I looked, and I saw it was the same pot that the boy had in his hand before; and in a basket in the shop was this melted pewter; and I took Fletcher up to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of the value of this pewter pot? - I cannot say that I do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. Ask him what passed when Mr. Lucas took me into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Did you, or Lucas, offer to make it up for a sum of money? - God bless you, it is totally false; nothing of the kind; Mr. Lucas called him in, and told him the Justice was going to take it up on a particular act of parliament, and the penalty was twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>(The pot deposed to.)</p>
               <p>What do you give for such a pot, when it is new? - Seventeen-pence.</p>
               <p>Is that the same value as a new pot? - It is as good as a new one.</p>
               <p>What do you value it at? - At sixteen pence.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, upon the oath you have taken, what is the value of that, to be sold? - It is worth that to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. What did you first value it at? - At ten-pence; but the Justice told me I must value it at more.</p>

               <p>I found the pot in the street, on the side of the pavement; nobody was by.</p>

            ? - No, Sir; all that I remember, is, one day, while I officiated for Mr. Slade, there was a man that came for some business of a ship; it was on or about the 4th of April; but what ship, or what man it was, I cannot say; and on referring to the book, there was an observation that the will was supposed to be forged; upon which, I told the man, whoever he was, he must go to Mr. Knight, or Mr. Dyson.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any more than one person that applied to you at that time? - There was a woman.</p>
               <p>Was there any other man? - I do not undertake to say that there was.</p>
               <p>In what character did that man apply to you? - As the representative of the seaman.</p>
               <p>Are you clear in that fact? - I did not attend so very particularly to that fact.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect, whether the person at that time applied to you as being a representative of the executor to the will, or as coming from him in any other character? - He applied as executor; because there was no power of attorney, only the probate of the will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have but a very imperfect recollection of this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For instance, could you tell, at this distance of time, whether it was a probate, or letters of administration to the seaman? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether there was an objection to the administration, or the probate, which it was you do not recollect? - No.</p>
               <p>Might it not be, then, quite consistent with all your recollection of the subject, that that person might come as his attorney to enquire whether the objection was removed? - They certainly came for payment.</p>
               <p>It was on or about the 4th of April? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many days might you officiate for Mr. Slade? - Four days in that week.</p>
               <p>Might there not be other men in the four days? - There might; but I do not recollect that there were; I am not so perfect in my recollection, as to say that they were not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did any other man apply to you, besides this man, from the Navyboard; not on that day, but about that day? - I cannot say.</p>
