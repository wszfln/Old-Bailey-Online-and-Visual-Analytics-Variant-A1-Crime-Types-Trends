On Tuesday, 19th June, between 7 and 8 in the morning, I was in St. John-etreet-road—I saw a coal-van there, loaded with two tons of coal, twenty sacks—it stopped at the corner of Raw<lb/>storne-street, and another van came up to the side of it, containing coke—I there saw the prisoner Lamb throw five empty sacks out of the coke-van on the top of the coal-van, and then drive off—Charles Wells and Wilson were with the coal-van at that time—I followed them to 10 Myddleton-square, the residence of Mr. Millaret—on arriving there Wells knocked at the door or rang the bell; the door was answered, and he went in—I then saw the iron plate shoved up—five empty sacks were then placed down alongside the wheel of the coal<lb/>waggon, one over the other; the men then commenced shooting the coal out of the van—they shot down fifteen sacks; after that they delivered the coke—the coke-van went with the coal-van—they shot some of the coke I believe—the servant came out first and counted the coal-sacks—Wilson and Lamb counted up twent sacks, she looking on—they the unloaded the coke, counted the sacks, and then went in and had some beer, and then left the house—I told anther constable to watch the van, and not to lose sight of it—I went to the house, had some communication with Mr. Millaret, and then went after the van—I found it at the bottom of Rosoman-street—I afterwards went to David wells, in King-street, Compton-street—in going there I asked Wilson where he was going with the coals he had got in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker at 10, Myddleton-square—just before 19th June, Jones called on me—he said he had come from the Great Northern Coal Company, and he requested me to give him an order for some coals, and I did give him one for two tons of cdals, and one chaldron of coke—I asked him, "What Company, what agent?" and he said, "Mr. Clarke;"it was then I gave him the order—I think I had once before given an order to the Great Northern Coal Company—I believed the statement that Jones made to me; if I had not believed the statement, I should not have given the order—that was all that passed between us—on the 18th, the coals came and were not delivered, because the coke was not with them—on the morning of the 19th, I was told by the servant that the coals and coke had come—I was up stairs, I saw nothing of the delivery of the coals myself—after the delivery, I told Charles Wells I would settle his account; I gave him a cheque for it—the servant brought me the bill; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave this cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this stamp, "Paid, W.

I was salesman to Theodore Hyla Jennens, and Co. before their bankruptcy, and, after that, I was retained as salesman by the creditors' assignees, Thomas Phillips and George Alcock—on 4th March, in this year, somebody, giving the name of Dennistoun, called at my place of business, No. 6, Halkin-street-west—he said he required a small selection of papier-machô goods, for a correspondent of his—he gave me, in writing, this reference," W. Robertson, and Co. 38, Crutched-friars, ship-brokers"—he gave me as his own address, 33, Great Tower-street—in consequence of what he said, I wrote to Messrs. Robertson, of Crutched-friars, to say that a per<lb/>son named Deunistoun had applied for some goods; I stated the amount, and asked if Messrs. Denmstoun, and Co. were trustworthy—I received this letter in answer (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "36, Crutched-friars, London, 9th March, 1860.

Sole and Turner's, solicitors, and explain it, as I had been so many times and never could see him—he declined to do so, but said he was alwaysto be met with between 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2—I did not find that that was the case—I never found him till I took him into custody on 22d May—I think that was about three weeks after—I met him quite promiscuously, the day before the Derby—he said that he had been recommeuded to James Dennistoun by a Liverpool captain—that was on the first day that I saw him—he said that he had shipped them on board the <hi rend="italic">John Phillips</hi>, on the 10th of March—those were hi» actual words.</p>

I am in the detective force—I know a person of the name of Clemitson—on Saturday, 2d June, I went to 23, South<lb/>grove, Peckham—I was in company with Mr. Fifield, in Mr. Wilson's house—I went there to make some inquiries—while standing at the window there, T saw Mr. Clemitson, Robertson, and a poulterer named Owen, come to the gate—Robertson was at that time out on bail—it was after the time he had been at the police-court—he said once to me, when he had been up at the Westminster police-court two or three times, that he would render me all the assistance in his power to find Clemitson, and if we found Clemitson he would get over it—Robertson was not admitted to bail after I</p>

I reside at 33, Great Tower-street, City—I did not let a room in that house to a person of the name of Dennistoun; I have the looking after the offices—there was a room let to him in December, or there<lb/>about—I never saw any business transacted there—there was one chair there, and a carpet there once, but the carpet was moved out a few days after<lb/>wards—a lad used to come there for letters—one day, when the lad came for letters, I followed him to 38, Crutched-friars—I stayed outside half an hour—he did not come out when I was there—I followed him again, a few days afterwards, and he went to the same place again—I once went into this office and saw that boy there—I saw that same lad at the police-court—he came to solicit an adjournment of the summons on behalf of Robertson.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you saw him in the act of putting the watch in Mr. Green's pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did—Mr. Green put his hand back and said, "Don't put it in my pocket," and in the scuffle it fell on the pavement—he was working his hand under the coat into Mr. Green's pocket—the prisoner was in front of me, and Mr. Green was by my side—there were other people about—we were not pushing about till the policeman came—I saw the prisoner with my watch in his right hand, and he was putting it into the pocket of a loose alpaca coat of Mr. Green; Mr. Green was standing with his side towards me—I had been in the excursion train and started twenty<lb/>five minutes past 9 in the morning; I had not been drinking—I only had part of a pot of half-and-half amongst four of us—I had nothing more but tea.</p>

I am a porter in Billingsgate market—I was with the last witness at the station in Fenchurch-street on 31st July—I was looking for my little boy—I felt a shove at my pocket—the last witness collared the prisoner immediately, and said "He has got my watch"—I said, "No, he has dropped it in my pocket"—the policeman took the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter to Mr. Leon, of 7, Upper Woburn-place—we had some coals of the Great Northern Coal Company—they amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a ticket had been left with them by the collector, after the coals had been delivered—in June last I was called into the hall to see somebody—I do not recollect the day—it was about the middle of June—I went into the hall and found the prisoner there—on seeing him he solicited orders for coals from the Great Northern Railway—I said we did not require any coals, and I would pay an account that was owing—he said that he had not called for the money—I said, no; but I would prefer paying him, and asked him if he had any bill with him—he said, no—I said that I had a bill with me and that he could receipt that—I paid him the money and saw him sign this receipt at the corner, "Paid, J. West, June 14th, 1856"—he left, after having signed that—I do not know the date when I saw him again—I was called out of bed on the next occasion, and on going down I found the prisoner and the policeman there—I did not go to the police-station at that time; I refused to go—I heard the prisoner speak at that time, and that added to my recollection of the man—I said I believed that he was the person—he was asked on that occasion, before he left, to give his address</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130019"/>
               <p>—I did not ask him, I told the policeman to ask him, and he wrote his address—he wrote two addresses—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the papers that he wrote on that occasion—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Henry Jones, 33, Provost-street, Hoxton," "Henry Jones, 33, Provost-street, East-road, City-road")—I saw his writing on the first occasion when he wrote the receipt to that note—I have looked at this since; in my opinion it is the writing of the prisoner.</p>

I reside at 18, Alfred-terrace, Devonport-place, Commercial-road-east—I remember giving a little hospitable party on Thursday, 29th December; in the Christmas week—the prisoner and his wife and some other friends came to see me—they came to tea and supper—we had a game of cards—the party continued till the next afternoon from three to four o'clock—before they went away they had a good strong cup of tea which I thought would do them good—I am a widow and live on my property; my husband was a licensed victualler—I have occupied the house for 10 years—I can swear that the prisoner has had a moustache between 2 and 3 years—I have known him 18 or 19 years, and never knew a flaw in his character from a boy to the present time—I have not been without seeing him during that period once or twice a week.</p>

Mr. Wemyss Jobson has written at least forty or fifty pages in all, and he has explained to the editor, Dr. Macauley, that he had been too grossly plundered by the late vile, legacy-hunting whig peer the Earl of Camperdown, and the present miscreant representative of Ayrshire, Sir James Ferguson of Kilkerran, the former of whom by marrying Mr. Wemyss Jobson's niece to the uncle of the latter succeeded in stripping Mr. Wemyss Jobson and his family of their inheritance, to be able to give the usual credit. In consequence of nonpayment he has been subjected to pri<lb/>vations and humiliations which it might delight these wretches to learn, but which he shall not stoop to describe; as he is unwilling to believe a religious society desires to promote their views, and while aiming at the conversion of heathen in the South Seas attempt to deprive an Englishman of bread."</p>

Some time in the middle of June last I received a letter in an envelope by post—I sent it to Sir James Ferguson, who was then in Scotland—I was in Chesham-street when I received it—I kept the outer envelope, and sent the letter in the inner envelope to Sir James, and afterwards when he came to town I gave him the envelope that I had kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the governor of the House of Detention—the defendant was under my care in April last; a letter containing these verses was brought to me by one of my officers for the purpose of inspection—I read it; I—took it to the prisoner and returned it to him, telling him that I considered it so offensive, particularly being addressed to a young married lady, that I would not send it out—he rather pressed me to forward it—he said he did not see why I should not, but I said I should not do it and I gave it back to him—while he was in prison, I became perfectly acquainted with his handwriting—I have no hesitation in stating that the song and the envelope are in his handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I admit it—I will not put Captain Hill to the proof—I will admit any of my writing, provided the whole of it is read—the letter addressed to Mr. Disraeli I admit to be mine. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is in the same handwriting—to the best of my belief, this letter of 21st December, and the envelope addressed to Sir James Ferguson, is in the prisoner's writing, and also this of 13th February—I have no doubt that the letter of 23d March is his, and the writing inside the envelope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>you were brought up to confront Mr. Disraeli, you were staggering under the influence of starvation—I do not know that you had not tasted food, except twice, in seventy-two hours—you had food offered to you, if you did not eat it it was not my fault—you requested the indulgence of a penny newspaper—I laid your application before the visiting justices, and they did not think proper to allow it—you were permitted to take exercise in the yard—in order to do that, you were not compelled to herd with thieves and pick-pockets; they walk a yard apart—you were subject to the rules of the prison when you came in; every prisoner is searched and bathed—it was according to the rules of the prison that you were exhibited to fifty detectives; every Saturday by order of the Commissioners of Police, a constable from each division goes through all the gaols in London, to see the prisoners under remand—I had no communication with Sir James Ferguson about you, and I am sure he had none with any of the officers of the prison—I never saw your brother—all the letters that I did not give back to you were posted—when you came in the first time, you had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think, in your possession—no solicitors or their clerks were refused access to you—I received a letter from you when I was out of town, which I destroyed—it might have been five or six weeks after you were discharged—I think I saw the outer envelope which contained these verses, at the police-court—I said to the best of my belief it did not look like the other, and I should say it was not yours—I know your common ordinary handwriting, it was not of that character; I said it was not yours, and I should not say it was.</p>

The constable came in and I said it might have fallen down the area; they went down, and in the deposition it is stated that they were there ten minutes. Were I charged with smuggling away that piece that was on the floor, the Jury could not say that I was guilty; but merely because I was convicted before I must be guilty of uttering the coin. I called my wife to see what I had done, and she said, "Throw it away;" and had it been bad I would have done so. The lady would not swear what day I was there first, and she says she put the shilling in the box because she suspected me; she never told me, but took the shilling, and afterwards said it was bad; would any gentleman take a bad piece and allow a man to leave the shop without telling him?

I live at 26, John-street, Bedford-row, and am a leather<lb/>bag manufacturer—On 13th June, at night, I notioed the staircase window; it was shut—that was before 10 o'clock and after 9—on the following morning I got up about 6 o'clock—the staircase window was then open—I went into the drawing-room; the parlour and drawing-room folding-doors were open and all the silver lay about on the table, chairs, and ground—the things that were scattered about were fruit-baskets made of silver, silver candlesticks, and several dozen knives and forks and spoons—they were all scattered about—upon looking, I found to be missing Mrs. Berge's and my jewellery; several brilliant brooches, and five or six brilliant rings; and all kinds of diamond rings—at the time I thought it was only about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery, but it is more than 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—it was private property—they would go into a very small compass—I missed this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from the kitchen; it is my property—I am quite certain of it—</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Owing to the excited state I was in on the day I was committed at Bow-street, and my broken-hearted mother and wife being in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130047"/>
               <p>court, and my being in the flurried and nervous state that I was; I beg to recal the plea which I made that I was guilty, it being given unintentionally, as the letter was only detained by me, it not being in a fit state for delivery. The letter would have been delivered in due course, had it not been for the following accident. As I was about commencing my delivery, I went to pull a newspaper out of the bundle of letters, when the string which was round the bundle, only once, broke, it being very rotten, and let some of my letters fall to the ground, and some of them went into a puddle of water; I picked them up and arranged them again as I went along Duke-street, and took a piece of string from my pocket and tied them up afresh, and on arriving at the corner of Charles-street in Duke-street, I thought I would go down and deliver those letters for that street; aud on account of their being wet and my putting my hand at the bottom of the bundle to pull them out, the first one that I went to pull out was the one directed to Mrs. Rymer, 51, Charles<lb/>street, but, owing to the string being tight round them, the letter would not come out, and I was afraid to slacken the string too much for fear of upsetting my letters again, so I went to pull it out, but rather harder than I intended, when it tore up the middle—the string had cut it through, being wet in the manner shown. On finding that it would not come out without tearing more, I let the string loose; and on looking to see what was the cause, I found the letter contained money, and that the cause of the tearing was that the string had got between the two coins which it contained; on loosing the string more and drawing the letter out, one of the coins fell out on the pavement, which I picked up im<lb/>mediately, and a gentleman that was passing at the time said to me "Postman, that is a very careless way for people to send money in letters like that"—I said it was, and then he said, "If I were you I would take it back to the office, and show it to some one, for they might write to the office and state that some of the money was lost out of the letter, and then you would be blamed"—I replied, "Perhaps it would be the best way to take it back and get the inspector to put it in another envelope, and state to him how it happened"—so I put the letter in my coat pocket and the money in my waistcoat pocket, and went on with my delivery; had I known that this would have happened through it I would have got the gentleman's name and address. When I got to Parliament-street I put my hand into my pocket to see that I had got the letter safe, when I found that the other coin which was in the letter had worked out of the letter into my coat pocket, and on taking it out and looking at it I found it to be a half-sovereign. I took the American coin from my waistcoat pocket and the half-sovereign from my coat pocket, and placed them both in my tobacco-box for safety, as I did not like to put them in my pocket with my own money, nor to have them loose in my waistcoat pocket for fear of their getting out while I was running up and down the stairs to the different offices in Parliament-street. When I had finished my delivery about half-past 3, I did not know what to do about delivering the letter, but I made up my mind not till I had been back to the office and showed it to the inspector; but on arriving at the office at ten minutes past 4 o'clock, which was my time, and the duty being rather heavier than usual, and the short time which is allowed to do the duty in, and the hurrying and driving which there generally is at that hour of the day on account of the men wanting to get out of the office to get their delivery done to go home to their tea, and my being the same as the rest, caused me to forget (but not wilfully) to show the inspector the state of the letter I had in my possession; the consequence was, as I was leaving the office with my delivery about a quarter to 5 o'clock with the other men in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130048"/>
               <p>a hurry, I was stopped at the corner of Charlotte-street, Pimlico, by the post-office officials and taken back to the office, to the comptroller's room, where I was asked if I had a letter for Mrs. Rymer, 51, Charles-street, and not thinking for a moment but that what the inspector meant was, had I got one in the bundle which I then had, I stated that I had not seen one, upon which he told the officer to search me, and he found the money in the tobacco-box where I had put it when it came out of the letter, and on being asked about the money I forgot what I was saying; my being taken as I was and never having been in such a position before, made me in that flurried and nervous state that I hardly know what I said or did till it was given in evidence against me at Bow-street the next day; I did not know but what they had got the letter, as they did not ask me for it or ask where it was until I was placed in the cell at Bow-street, and I had been in there about half an hour when I put my hand in the pocket of the coat I am now wearing and found the letter; but being in that state of mind charged with stealing, and thinking it was of no use, I tore it in half and threw it down the closet; but afterwards I was sorry I did for I was told that I ought to have kept it till my trial, to show; I can solemnly declare I had no intention of detaining the letter for any other purpose but to show the inspector as I was advised; had I been allowed to go with the delivery, which I had when, I was stopped, the letter would have been delivered to whom it was directed, as I should have thought of it when I got to the ground again. The original letter was destroyed in the cell; here is one like it (<hi rend="italic">handing one in</hi>).</p>

Hill and Jones, Jewry-street—Otten made a communication to me before this took place—on this morning, the 11th, Silk brought me a churn of milk into the warehouse—on that occasion I examined another churn that was in the cart; it was empty—I followed Silk into the back house and saw the milk measured—we ought to have had fifty quarts, and there were fifty-three or fifty-four—the milk looked rather darker than usual.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in milk, at Mitre-square, Aldgate—I employ ten men—they are employed in the delivery of milk every morn<lb/>ing and afternoon—Knight was in my employment, and had been for nearly three years, and ten years previously with a former master—during that time</p>

               <p>his character has been very good in every respect; I never had any complaint to make of him—his former master lives in Essex—I receive my milk from the country, from Ingotston-hall; Mr. Reed supplies me—on the morning of the 11th my supply of milk from Mr. Reed was short; I expected three churns from him that morning, he only sent one—I was also disappointed from Ilford that day; I should have had one churn from there, but it did not come, therefore it made me three churns deficient—I am not aware of the deficiency till I come to town at 11 o'clock—my foreman has instruc<lb/>tions to purchase milk wherever he can for the customers—very frequently we have a stoppage on the railway—it is a very frequent thing for the trade to buy of each other.</p>

Q.</hi> But you would not expect that any of your milk coming up by the train would be sold by other persons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not care about it; it is usual—if you sold me milk and sent a man with it, that man has a right to sell that milk to people—if I sent my man out with forty quarts of milk to a particular person, and he sold it to some one else, he would then probably come back for forty quarts more—Knight was in my employ<lb/>ment that morning—I do not know whether he had any right to carry that pail or not that morning—I will swear that I have not told Mullineaux that Knight had no right to take that pail—if the milk is deficient when I come at 11 o'clock I do not give orders on that morning—we have many mishaps, and, of course, we have to be prepared, for these contingencies—I don't give them the money to pay for it; frequently they buy it and don't pay for ifot the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Manchester warehouseman, and live at 21, Watling-street—the prisoner was in my employ under the terms of this deed—I was in the habit of keeping in my establishment the cash-book, the entry-book, and the ledger, and also a duplicate pass-book, which ought to have been a copy of the bank pass-book—the bank pass-book was only made up occasionally; sometimes not for a month together—it was at the bank—the prisoner kept the duplicate pass-book; it was his duty to enter in it all cash that went to the bank, so that I could take it up any hour of the day and see what my balance was—I was in the habit of referring to that book, but latterly he did not write it up—he used to give me the balance on a slip of paper for a month or two before he left—he used to keep the cash-book—it was his duty to make entries of all cash that he received—the usual place of deposit for the books was in the safe—the prisoner kept the key of that safe—he had no authority to take any of those books from my house—I recollect before the 4th of June his taking home the duplicate pass-book—I asked him where it was; he said he had got it at home—I told him that was not the place for my books—when I came from Brighton on the morning of 4th June I saw the book brought home under his arm—I said, "You have brought the book back," and he said, "Yes"—I should say that I saw the cash-book for 1858 and 1859, three or four days before he left, and I saw the duplicate pass-book on the morning of 4th June, and about an hour before he left—it was then in the drawer of the</p>

               <p>in my private ledger, 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was in the estate; I have not borrowed it—the interest was paid on that every year—I received this paper from the prisoner at the latter end of December—I was in a negociation to sell my business in February—it was in the latter end of December I took stock—in the general way, we took an account of all the stock at the valuation, and all the book debts—we had a book to enter the stock we took in—Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Clements, and the prisoner were engaged in taking the stock; I looked at it occasionally—we put a valuation on the stock in hand and it was entered in the book—that was done in December, 1859—Mr. Clements and Mr. Fletcher are here to-day—they gave the account to the prisoner and he wrote it down—they took the cost price—at the beginning of that book there was an entry made on the debtor and creditor side; here it is—it is not torn out; it is in the state in which it originally was—it is the stock-taking book; it purports to describe all that was due to me, as well as all that I owed—this paper gives book debts 7,729<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and dividends 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that means dividends on the insolvent estates—I can't tell you on what estates dividends were due—there is the bdok, that will tell you—I received an old dividend the other day that was not in the book at all—it was from Oaks, of Croydon—this 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dividend means that I was entitled to them myself—I had to receive them myself—on the other side here is bills, 5,326<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; open accounts 1,010<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and dividends 457<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that I had to pay—my bankers were Currie and Co.—I have been banking with them ever since I have been in business and before—here is my banker's pass-book—I very seldom looked in my banker's pass-book; in feet, I did not look in it for months together—from December, 1859, till 4th June, 1860, I don't think I looked in my banker's pass-book—the pass-book used to be at the bank for a month together, and I used to say to the prisoner, "Why do you keep it there?"—I did not look at it myself, but I wanted him to tell me whether it was correct—I think I could say that for six months I did not look at my banker's pass-book—I might just turn it over with the prisoner—I can't answer whether I several times looked at it—I left the whole business to the prisoner to manage—I did not go over the books frequently with him—I have looked at the cash-book occasionally and asked him what was the occasion of these balances, and why he did not send the money to the bank—the private ledger was not private to him; he had the key of it—I seldom had it in my possession—if there was occasion to look into it, I looked into it—I won't say that I did not take the key away, but the last time I got it was when he left—I won't deny that I took it home with me, but he had the key for a month together—I sometimes returned to town once a week, sometimes in a fortnight; but I have been out for a month together on a journey—I had two old cash-books, one was of 1858, one 1859, and a portion of 1860; the other began about May 12th—I wanted a new one, the previous one was in the safe, but it was used up—the last time I saw the two cash-books that I now miss, was about four or five days before he went away—I will swear I did not see them in the counting-house on the 4th of June, the same day that the prisoner left—I have never said that I saw them in my counting-house on the day the prisoner left—I swear I have not—I saw the duplicate pass-book within an hour of his leaving the counting-house—he left about 8 o'clock; I and he were together up to the very time that I left—he slammed the books into the iron safe which is fixed in the wall—it is not very small; it is pretty large—it could hold all the books that we were working with, and the old cash-book—I had a porter named Ellis—when the old books were out of use they were placed</p>

I am the wife of Richard Ellis, 7, Adam-street, Seymour<lb/>street, Bryanstone-sqnare—I went to the prosecutor's warehouse in Watling<lb/>street; I paid the prisoner the money mentioned in these two invoices—I can't say that I saw the prisoner sign these receipts, because I was not looking after him—he gave me the receipts, and I paid the money in his hand—one is for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the other 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid them on 16th April and on 21st May.</p>

                  </hi> What I stated in the former case was true—I kept certain books; supposing the prisoner to sell goods, it was his duty to enter the sale in the day-book, and it ought to have gone in the ledger as ready money, and into the cash-book of course—I have looked through my books; there is no entry that I am aware of, of this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the days that have been mentioned—several of my cash<lb/>books have been lost—the only cash-book I have got commences on 12th May, 1860—supposing this money to have been paid on 21st May it would have been the prisoner's duty to enter it in this book; and I don't see the entry.</p>

I accompanied Clark to Red-bourn, and saw the pony and the mare in the pound—the prisoner was in Redbourn police-station—about 11 o'clock on the night of Thursday, the 12th, I saw him at Hendon, just about fifty yards from where the horses were; he was by himself—he had his boots in his hand and his coat across his shoulder—I spoke to him—all that I could understand that he said was "London"—when he was delivered to me at Redbourn he had neither boots nor coat on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Ladislas Kiss, warehouseman, at 93, Wat ling-street—he has no partner—I recollect Casabianca coming to me early in May—I had known him before as the agent of Messrs. Million, of Lyons—he said he had recommended a gentleman to us who wanted to buy some silk goods, and he thought we might very safely deal with him—this was on 5th May, I think—he said the order was so small that he did not think it worth while to send it to Lyons for execution, and that he knew the class of goods we generally kept, and that we could do the thing right for him—I inquired of him who the gentleman was—he said he was a very respectable man; that he had had transactions with Million and Co., and had always paid them—he said that he did not owe them anything then; and that we might safely trust him—he said nothing more at that time—I don't think he gave any name at that time—he said the person would call—he said he wanted about eight or ten pieces of silk—about two days afterwards the prisoner Honess called—he said that he was the person "recommended" by Mr. Casa<lb/>bianca—I don't remember whether he used the word recommended—it was either "recommended" or "introduced"—he said he wanted to select a few pieces of silk—he was shown some goods, and the goods were selected for him—he told us at the same time that he had had transactions with Million and Co. himself, to the extent of 8000 or 10,000 francs; or more than that, some 20.000 francs—he said he did not owe them anything then; he had not had transactions with them for some two months, or it might be more—he subsequently showed me some bills—he said he wanted the goods to ship them—I understood him to say to Hamburg—he named some foreign place but I did not take particular notice—he pamed some place in Germany</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130070"/>
               <p>—he did not mention the name, I think, to whom he was going to send them—I went to his office in Moorgate-street chambers a day or two afterwards—we had not then parted with the goods; they had been looked at—I went to his office for the purpose of seeing what sort of a place he had got—he had got very good furniture and there was every appearance of respectability about it—I interrogated him as to his transactions with Million and Co., and he showed me then some bills of Million and Co. which had been drawn on him, and, I believed, paid; I had no reason to doubt it—I do not recollect the sums of the bills; I saw the name of Million and Co.—he confirmed those remarks which he had previously made, that he owed them nothing at that time—I asked him where he kept his account—he said at the Unity Bank; I decided eventually on allowing him to have the goods—it was principally the introduction from Mr. Casabianca, and subsequently the recommendation we received from Mr. Bellamin, that induced me to let him have them—if I had known that he had not an account at the Unity Bank that would have influenced me to some extent—I applied to Mr. Bellamin and had a state<lb/>ment made to me by him—he is clerk or manager to Messrs. Million of Lyons—the goods were sent and an invoice sent with them—4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the price agreed on for them—the amount of them was 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill that was given by Honess for the goods—it was dishonoured (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: dated "March, 1860: 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Drawn by Kiss upon Honess and Co., and accepted payable at the Unity Bank; at one month"</hi>)—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter that I received from Honess before the goods were sup<lb/>plied—I believe it to be in his writing from the knowledge that I have obtained of his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Moorgate-street Chambers; May 11th, 1860.

I am a detective officer—I apprehended the prisoner on 24th July, on a warrant which I have here—I read it to him and told him he was charged with conspiring with Casabianca to get 750 yards of silk—he said, "Mr. Kiss will suffer for this;" he said that Casabiauca knew all about it, and that he had the greater part of the money—that the silks had been obtained to turn into money to take up his own acceptance in favour of Million and Co.—he handed me three letters, that is one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) there is</p>

               <p>no date on it—he said that that letter was written at the time the goods were at Mr. Bennoch's, and before they were paid for—that upon receiving that letter he applied to Mr. Bennoch and got the money—he said he handed the 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mentioned in the letter to Casabianca—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>) "Dear Honess,—Your delay in the affair yesterday has put me to a great deal of incon<lb/>venience, and unless the 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is paid to hand by 2 o'clock, I shall not escape his bad treatment"—The prisoner stated that he had paid Casabianca 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before the 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had got that from Mr. Bennoch—he said it was only in consequence of a suggestion from Casabianca that he went to Mr. Kiss at all, he really did not know Mr. Kiss—that was all that passed with Honess—I afterwards apprehended Casabianca.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that there was some evidence of con<lb/>spiracy, from the fact of Casabianca introducing Honess to Holmes for the purpose of getting goods; when he knew at the time, that shortly before, Honess had been in the Queen's Prison, and that he had referred him first of all to Million and Co, and then to Levick, and then to Johnson, Gilman, and Co.; he considered that there was also evidence in the statement made in the letter, written by Casabianca.</hi>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The following letters from Casabianca to Million and Co. were then read; they were in French.

Honess and Co. and to tell me seriously if you will assist them with some good introductions until they pay us—I had sworn to have them put in prison, but I see that I should not have got any good by it"—<hi rend="italic">The other letter was dated 13th April; the following passage was read,"What shall I say to you? I see them every day, but their con<lb/>dition does not yet permit them to pay—it is, perhaps, a poor commisera<lb/>tion to tell you that other houses are in for loss, much more considerable than ours; but after all I promise you to have a loan upon theca, and to get out of it in one way or another.</hi>")</p>

I live at Brick-kiln-row, Plumstead Common, and am in charge of the felloe stores of the carriage department at the Royal Arsenal—I did not know the prisoner till he was taken into custody—he was employed in the laboratory department at that time—on Thursday afternoon, 2d August, about a quarter to 5 o'clock, I saw him at the back of my stores—he was drawing the copper hooping from the vat, doubling it up and concealing it about his person, between the waistband of his trousers and his shirt—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; I saw it taken from him—he had got it straight down—I asked him what he was going to do with this copper; he told me he was going to take it to the fitter's shop—I told him it was decidedly wrong, and that he had better put it back again—he said it was all right—I begged him again to put it back, but he still persisted in taking it with him—I told him it was under Mr. Dean's charge, and belonged to the carriage department—he made no reply to that but walked on, and I said that if he persisted in taking it away I would follow him—he walked away at first—he took the direction down to the timber shed at the back of the saw-mill, and when he had got there he ran away from me through the wheel shop—I followed him and overtook him in the front of the saw-mills, and took him to Mr. Wren, one of the masters of the saw-mills—Mr. Wren asked me what was the matter—I told him, in the prisoner's presence, that the man had got something concealed about his person, and I desired the prisoner to pull it out—he drew from his person the copper now produced, and laid it on the table, and said, "There it is"—Mr. Wren asked him where he belonged to, and the prisoner said that he belonged to the carriage department under Mr. Ambrose—Mr. Wren sent me for Mr. Ambrose—we found out afterwards that the prisoner belonged to the laboratory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter employed in the carriage department of the Royal Arsenal—on Thursday, 2d August, I was passing by where the felloe stores are—I saw the prisoner there behind the cask concealing the copper between his waistcoat and trousers—I did not see him doing that, before my attention was called to him—Mr. Peen called my attention to him—Mr. Peen had not spoken to him then—I saw him put the copper between his waistcoat and the waistband of his trousers—after that I saw Mr. Peen speak to him—Mr. Peen told him he had better stop there, and the prisoner afterwards ran away.</p>

I live at 21, Camden-terrace, Plumstead, and am as<lb/>sistant timber-master in the Royal Arsenal—on Thursday afternoon, 2d August, Mr. Peen came to me and brought the prisoner with him—I said, "What's the matter, John? "speaking to Peen—he said, in the prisoner's presence, "This man has concealed a quantity of copper about him"—I directly said to the prisoner "Where do you work, and who is your fore<lb/>man?"—he told me that Mr. Ambrose was his foreman; that he worked in the carriage department—I requested Peen to ask Mr. Ambrose to step down; the, prisoner heard that—when Peen had left the office the prisoner requested leave to leave the office for a minute or two to go to the water closet—I allowed him to do so in charge of one of the workmen—I called Stephen Cowley; the prisoner went with me to call him—the prisoner did not come back that afternoon—I next saw him at the police-court, on the following day; Friday—I believe this to be the copper which I saw concealed about him—it has the mark of the broad arrow.</p>

I am foreman of the stores at the Arsenal at Woolwich—I went on the morning of 3d August to the place where the cask was, containing the copper—I found that one of the casks there had been opened, and that some copper was gone from it—I was round there on the Tuesday evening before; the 31st July—the cask was then shut, and the tarpaulin was over it—I saw the cask itself—I did not lift the tarpaulin up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, carrying on business at Old Charlton in Kent—I have known the prisoner some two or three years—he has been in the habit of travelling round the neighbourhood—I have bought bonnet shapes from him—he came into my shop on 12th July, about 8 o'clock at night—he offered me some bonnet shapes for sale; I did not buy them, but gave him an order to supply me with other goods; at that time a boy named Brown was in the shop; nobody else—the prisoner re<lb/>mained in the shop some few minutes after I gave him the order—Brown came in for some ribbons; I stooped down behind the counter to get at them—I had some other conversation with the prisoner about the bonnet shapes, and a few minutes afterwards he left—he bad a bag with something in it—I could not ascertain what it was at the time—he had a few bonnet shapes with him; I think he had them out on the counter—he took them away in the bag; his bag was large enough to hold a feather bed—after he had left the shop about ten minutes I missed a piece of calico—it had been in the fitting of the shelf; I had placed it there about ten minutes before he came into the shop—I am sure nobody was in the shop at the time except the prisoner and Brown—I saw Brown two or three days afterwards and asked him some questions—on 3d July the prisoner came with the shapes I had ordered—in consequence of something that Brown had told me, I said to the prisoner, "The last time you were here I lost a bit of calico, and you took it; now if you took that from distress and were in want, or your family wanted a loaf of bread, I will forgive you"—he said, "No, I did not take it"—I said, "Confess the truth; I have a boy who saw you take it"—he said, "I did not take it"—I said, "I shall give you in charge and we will see whether you did or not"—when the policeman came he said, "Well, sooner than be locked up, I will say I took it"—I then gave him in custody.</p>

I then went to a public house just opposite to have some refreshment; I afterwards went to another, and then to the railway-station, and had to wait a quarter of an hour for the train, therefore the prosecutor had ample opportunity to find me if he had chosen.

I am the wife of Philip Beard—I live with my hus<lb/>band at 16 Manor-place—we occupy the first floor—I have one little boy about 11 years old—I occupy the back room as a sleeping-room—the little boy slept in the same room—on the morning of Tuesday, 31st July, I should think it was nearly 6 o'clock when I awoke—a noise above my head awoke me—it was a sort of scuffling on the boards—I thought it was the children playing when I first awoke—I awoke my husband, thinking it was late—I heard a sort of lumbering as if something fell on to the boards after that; that was not till after I awoke my husband—I could not say what it sounded like, falling—it appeared to be as if something heavy had fallen on the boards—I thought it was in the bed-room; it seemed over my head—I could not say whether what I heard fall fell on the landing or in the room—my husband went to the bed-room door and went up the stairs—he then called out the "Murder!" and came down—he afterwards went up again with Mr. Bevan, the landlord—after he came down the second time I went to the door of our room and saw the prisoner on the stairs between the first and second floors—he either said, "Mr. Beard" or, "Mrs. Beard, my mother has done all this, she has murdered my sweetheart and my two little brothers, and, in selt<lb/>defence, I believe I have murdered her"—while my husband was dressing the prisoner called out from the stairs, "Mr. Beard, for God's sake fetch a surgeon, I believe there are some alive now"—when my husband was dressed he left the house—he and I went down stairs into the lower parlour—I locked my bed-room door, and locked my child in, and we went down below to the landlord's room, and my husband directly went for a doctor—I did not see the body of the young woman at all—I had seen a young woman come to the house on the previous day, Monday, 30th July; I think it was pretty well 11 o'clock in the morning when she came—she came with the prisoner—I saw them again about 7 in the evening, going out, as I thought for a walk; they went as if they were going to the Walworth-road—I afterwards saw them return about 10 o'clock; they returned together, by themselves—I saw them come down stairs again about five minutes afterwards, that is I saw them outside the door as if they had come down stairs—I saw them come into the house again about a quarter of an hour afterwards; that would be about a quarter past 10.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and joiner—I and my wife occupy the first floor at 16 Manor-place—I remember the prisoner coming to the house, but I cannot say exactly what time he came—I had seen him there some days before 31st July—I had seen him in the house—I remember Sunday the 29th—I had some conversation with the prisoner that day in the yard—a little conversation passed on trivial affairs, and he told me that he had been a valet and footman, but that he had left that, and was going into the farming business—he did not say why he had left it—I did not see the young woman on the Monday night—on the Tuesday morning I was awoke by my wife early; it was about 5 minutes before 6, or something like that—after she had awoke me I heard a sort of rumbling noise on the stairs, it appeared to be on the landing over me, it was like children running about, or something like that, I had heard the noise frequently before—I was on my landing—it seemed to come from the top floor above me—when I came out of my room I heard a slight scream, when I got to the foot of the stain—I went up stairs—the first thing I saw was a spot of blood on the stairs, on the fourth stair from the top, I did not notice any on any other—I went a little higher, and the first thing I saw was the little boy lying on the landing—I thought he was dead, he had his throat cut, and was lying on his back with his head towards the stairs—I then went a little higher and there saw the female lying on the landing—I did not then know who she was—I found afterwards it was Mary Streeter—she was also lying dead, a little beyond the dead body of the boy—I did not observe any other body at that time—I was alarmed, and went down, and called up Mr. Bevan, the landlord—I then went up again with him, behind him; there was no one else with us; the inspector had not come at that time—when I had called the landlord I went up stairs and began to drees—I did not go up with him then, I went up to my own bed-room, I did not go up to the second floor then, not till the inspector came—he did not come till Mr. Bevan went for him—I did not go up any more till after the police had been—I went for a surgeon—I saw a policeman at the top of Manor-place, and I sent him down—I did not see anything more of the prisoner—he called me out of my bed-room after I had began to dress, he was then on the stain—he called me and said, "Mr. Beard, my mother has done it all, she has murdered my two little brothers and my sweetheart, and, in self-defence, I believe I have murdered her"—that was all he said then—I then went into my bed-room again, and finished dress<lb/>ing and he begged of me to go for a surgeon.</p>

               <p>the prisoner came to live with me—he had before that been at service at Dr. Duncan's; that was the last place he had lived at—he was footman there—I do not recollect on what, day it was that he came to my lodgings, but I should suppose it was about a fortnight before the 31st July—he used to sleep in the back room, the same room that I slept in—Thomas, the eldest of the two boys, slept with him in the same bed—I slept on a bed made up on the shop-board—I am a tailor, but I work away from home along with a son who lives in the neighbourhood—my wife slept in the front room and the boy Charles with her—I am frequently away from home at my work, during the day; mostly all day—I go home to dinner very frequently; not at all times—I was away from morning till night, except sometimes when I went home to dinner—on Monday, 30th July, I came home about a quarter or twenty minutes after 10 at night, as near as I can bring it to mind—I did not see the young woman, Mary Streeter, at all that night—I saw my wife before I went to bed—the prisoner went, to bed that night as usual, in the room—I should think it wanted about twenty minutes to 11, at that time—I told him when he was ready I would put the light out, and he said he was all ready, and I put the light out and went to bed directly, and he at the same time—my boy, Thomas, was in bed when I got into bed; he was in the bed with the prisoner—I awoke in the morning, I consider, somewhere about 4 o'clock; I did not know the time because I had not a clock in my room; I imagine that was the time by the appearance of the morning—at that time I saw the prisoner at the foot of his bed—it was daylight; just the break of day—he was in the act of getting into bed—I supposed he had been to look at the clock—I believe the door of the room was not closed; it generally stood open, but I did not take that notice—I usually slept with the door about an inch open—I took no notice of it then—the door of the front room was always closed at night, to the best of my knowledge—I fell asleep again—I got up at 5 o'clock that morning—it was about twenty minutes after 5 when I left my room—I expected that the clock went 6, but in lien of that it was 5 I found when I got out—the prisoner and Thomas were in bed at that time—I went to my son John's to work—I did not go into the front room before I left; the door of that room was closed—I was afterwards fetched from my son's—I should think it was about twenty minutes after 6—I came back to the house—I saw the body of the young woman, Mary Streeter—she was then dead—I had seen her before, three or four times, I believe—the first time I saw her I dare say might have been two years pre<lb/>vious—she had not been in the habit of coming to our house then—I saw her two or three times since—I saw her once or twice in July; that was at Manor-place—I do not think I saw her more than once in Manor-place—I saw her once at my son John's, along with William, and once at Manor<lb/>place with him—the prisoner had never said anything to me about his in<lb/>tended marriage—I understood it was to be the case, but he never acquainted me with it—a knife was shown to me on the morning of 31st July, by Lack the constable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is itz—I had seen that knife before that day—I saw it in my son John's shop—it was in the prisoner's possession—it was then quite whole, to the best of my knowledge; not broken as it is now—the prisoner was showing it to a man who was working at my son John's, and the man said it was not a fit knife to carry—the prisoner said anybody had a right to carry such a knife, if they thought proper, for their own protection—I should think this was about nine days or a fortnight before 31st July—I never saw him use the knife for any purpose—I never</p>

On the morning of 31st July I went with Mr. Dann to 16, Manor-place, Walworth, a few minutes before 6—I saw three bodies lying on the second landing—I found this knife—it was lying just between the two females; it was open as it is now, with the point and a piece of the guard broken off, and smeared with blood just the same as it is now—I picked it up—I saw the prisoner at this time—he spoke to me first—he pulled his right shirt-sleeve up and said, "Here is a job; my mother has done all this"—I said, "Where is your mother?" he pointed down to the elder female and said, "There she lies; I struck her in my own defence"—I said, "Was this young female lying here when you struck your mother?"—he hesitated for a moment and then said, "I do not know."</p>

               <p>to the house 16, Manor-place—that was, I should think, about 6 o'clock—Beard, the carpenter, the man who lives in the second floor, came to me—I went to the house immediately—I there found the bodies of four persons, who were dead—three were on the landing and the body of the little boy was on the bed in the front room—the bodies were all quite warm; as warm as if they had been alive; from animal heat—I examined the body of the young woman, Mary Wells Streeter, which was lying on the landing—I found a stab over her left breast which penetrated the cavity of the chest—there was also a wound on the throat; it was literally cut from ear to ear—that had been done with a very sharp and very strong instrument—the carotid artery and jugular vein on each side were divided; making a clean sweep through everything, down to the cervical vertebrae or bones of the neck—the wound had severed the windpipe and the gullet—such a wound would, I think, have caused instantaneous death; the cutting through the windpipe and the gullet would prevent a person from calling out; it would be quite impossible for a person to call out with such a wound—I think it must have required a strong arm to have inflicted that wound.</p>

               <p>entered the pericardium, the enveloping membrane of the heart, that would be necessarily fatal, the other penetrated the lungs—both wounds entered the lungs, the top as well as the bottom plunge, and both would be fatal—if the child had grasped a sharp instrument, the hands would have presented exactly the appearance that I discovered, if the weapon had been drawn through the hands—I see the knife that has been produced; the marks I saw were just such as I should have expected to find from such an instrument—all the wounds upon all the four bodies were inflicted with a sharp instrument; it must have been a very sharp, powerful instrument—I have seen this knife before; the point of it is broken—I apprehend that it was originally a sharp pointed instrument; such an instrument as that, if the point had been sharp, might have inflicted all the wounds I saw upon all the bodies—there was no mark upon any of the bodies of a struggle having taken place during life, except upon that of the child that was lying near the stairs; his were the only hands that were wounded.</p>

I suppose you will stay as you said before with Mrs. Walker, at Gloucester-terrace, till she leaves, which you said would be on 26th of this month, that would be on Thursday week, so you could stay three or four days there, and I shall be, of course, there with you once a day at least, I have made up my mind to get away from here this week, so I shall be with you next week when you come. Since I gave notice to leave here last Wednesday, our people have spoken to me in such a manner that has not suited me, and I am certain to give Mrs. Duncan a good talking to next time she goes on at me again, when I hope the Doctor will tell me to go at once, has theu that is what I want, when I shall be paid my wages the same up to 11th August, when I shall go to my brother's and be able to do many things I want to do before we are married, dearest girl. I know I shall have a job to get a holiday when I want it if I stay here longer than this week, so I am in hopes of getting off from here this week, to-day; to<lb/>night I want Mrs. Duncan or the Doctor to talk to me, then I shall he ready to talk to them, and so be sent off. You understand, I am a little sharp in this. Now, my dearest Polly, I have a form to be filled up to take to the Life Assurance Company's office, that his, to answer all the written questktns as asked on the printed forms, which is necessary should be done</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130100"/>
               <p>first. I know your name and address, but your occupation, I shall say you have (<hi rend="italic">none</hi>)—you understand? But I want to know your place of birth, and date, and your certificate of birth is required to be taken to the office, just to let them see your right age; then, of course, I shall say single, and a spinster; then I want to know your father's and mother's ages, and also to know if you have ever been abroad; if so, where, and for what period of time; also, have you had the small-pox, or have you been vaccinated; have you ever had the gout, or spitting of blood, asthma, rupture, convulsions, fits of insanity, vertigo, habitual cough, disease of the lungs, complaint of the liver, or any other disease which tends to the shortening of life; let me know this, but I can say what I like, or you like, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> any of these com<lb/>plaints, of <hi rend="italic">corse</hi>, would be against your having your life assured. Then it's asked, has any member of the family died of consumption; I think you said your sister died of that dreadful complaint; but I must say no to that answer. Then they want to know the name and residence of your medical attendant; you could say you had none, to that question; but the name and residence of an intimate friend is required to be referred to for general information, that is to say, they must have some one who knows you to write to, to ask <hi rend="italic">they</hi> how long they have known you and your family, and are they healthy, and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> your health been good, and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> it so now, and to ask if any member of the family have died of any bad disorder, such as I have said; and you must tell the friend, whoever you get to do this for you, to make it out in the best manner he or she can, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you will also do; and let them say they are not a near relation, only a friend, if ever you are. You understand that, dearest girl, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> all must be done in the best possible manner to have them assure your life, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> they would not take you if they thought you were unhealthy, or any of your family had died of anything bad, or <hi rend="italic">where</hi> any of them unhealthy, that would be, of <hi rend="italic">corse</hi>, against it, so, when they write to your friend, let them give a good letter to them—he sure and manage that with them, and to answer the letter they send by return of post; so, when you come up on Monday next, all you will have to do will be to go with me to the Assurance Office, near the Bank of England, city, and see the, medical man there, then I can give you the money to pay the first premium upon your life, which will not be a large sum to assure 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in case you should die any death, which sum would be of use to your children or me, in that case, dearest girl; but it <hi rend="italic">his</hi> a very good thing to do, and the duty of every mother, or wife, or father to assure their lives, if they can but spare a little to pay every quarter; see what distress often arises from friends not leaving any thing to their relations or dear friends when they die! You know the benefit of all this, therefore you will, of <hi rend="italic">corse</hi>, just send me the information I require of you, that I may take and fill up the form to take to the office, so they can write to your friend <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I tell you. Write <hi rend="italic">has</hi> soon <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you can, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I am anxious to get on with it before you come next Monday to London. Now, I am, with love ever to you, your loving, affectiouate, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GODFREY YOUNGMAN</hi>.—My kindest remembrance to your friends, and quick answer I hope to have, my most beloved girl; I am indeed anxious to get all these things settled, and look forward for the happy day when you will be mine for life. Adieu, dearest."</p>
               <p>"16, Manor-place, Newington, London, S.</p>
               <p>"My most beloved Mary.—I received your affectionate note this morning, but I must say I am very much hurt to find you state in your note that you do not wish to have your life assured; why, my dearest girl, why do you alter your mind? I have been to the office, have told them to write to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130101"/>
               <p>your friend, Mrs. James Bone, for the information they require, they did so yesterday, and expect her to send them answer by return of post; and I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> them you would come with me on Monday for the policy, so let Mrs. James Bone write to them <hi rend="italic">has</hi> they wish, and that you will go with me and assure your life on Monday next <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you said you would before. Why can you go from your word? You will never lose anything by assuring your life; will not die any sooner, my dear girl And as regards your father and mother not <hi rend="italic">liken</hi> you to do so, you can do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you like without them preventing. Now, say no more to them about it, but come and do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I wish you to do. I shall, indeed, never forgive you if you do not, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I, wish you to do so for a particular purpose, which I will tell you of. I will always pay for it, of <hi rend="italic">corse</hi>, and you will never lose anything by it. I in<lb/>tend to get a house for you and myself near or in Brighton next week, as it will, of <hi rend="italic">corse</hi>, be foolish for me to go there without you can go with me, even after you have assured your life; but if you will not do this, and will rather mind what your friends say to you about assuring your life, why I cannot think you would love me <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I wish you would. You will never find any one to love you so again, and would you break my heart aud not do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I wish you in this little thing? Why do you not do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you said? Can you cease to love me? Will you now refuse to do this which is for the good of those you leave behind when you should <hi rend="smallCaps">DIE</hi>? Surely, my dearest girl, you will still love me and do this, or how can I think you do love me if you refuse? no, I cannot believe you love me. Now, my dearest girl, I have nearly Bettled the assurance, I have left my situation, I have look for a house for us to live in, and with your consent I have published the bans of our marriage, and you have consented to be mine next Monday week. Now, can you break my heart and act like-this? do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I tell you, dearest girl, and I will do anything you wish to be done, only do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you have agreed to do, let me assure your life on Monday next, and be mine own dear wife the following Monday <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you promised me in your letter, and every thing you wish for shall be yours. I shall have money enough to supply more than our wants. Next Wednesday or Thursday come and be mine, and we will have all this settled, and we will go down and see all your friends in a few days after things are Bettled. I want you to go to Brighton <hi rend="italic">to get</hi> a house, where I wish to live with you, my dearest Polly. Do you love me still 1 if so, do as I wish and keep your promise; be sure and bring the certificate of your birth with you on Monday, and let Mrs. James Bone answer the letter to the Assurance Company to-day, if she has not done so yesterday, so they will get answer on Monday morning before you and I go there. They will not keep you a moment, ray dear girl, only be mine and do this and be happy. You cannot do wrong in this, you will never have cause to regret; pray do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I wish, come and do this on Monday; come, come to me, and be mine, you will never want for a thing while you live, believe me. I cannot but be <hi rend="italic">hurt, hurt</hi>, indeed, if you do not comply with my request; do make me happy, do this, it will be all for your good. Write again so I can have a letter on Monday before you come up. Oh, my dearest girl, I know you will not break my heart, I that love you more than life; be mine and never will you want for anything, I swear; but say not a word to your friends till we are married, then they shall be made glad, and we will have a jolly day near home; they will not be sorry for your having me, one that make a lady of you soon, and make you happy for life; one who loves you more thau his life, and can you not do has he wished you to do I say yes, dearest Mary.—I am,-with</p>

               <p>love to you, hoping you are well and happy, your ever affectionate lover, and ever more I am your best Friend, believe me; but I am hurt, pray heal me, say you will do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I wish, my dearest girl, I am your dearest <hi rend="smallCaps">W.

               <p>"16, Manor Place, Newington, July 19, 1860.</p>
               <p>"My most beloved Mary.—I received your kind and most welcome letter this morning about 11 o'clock; I was expecting to get it by 8 o'clock, but you put Boro' in the address too much, so it was sent to the Boro' first, which caused it to be late; put the address only as above, dearest girl. I have filled up the paper now and took it to the Life Assurance Office, aud they will write to Mrs. James Bone to-day to get answer on Saturday, so you can go with me to the office before 2 o'clock on Monday; when you come up you will arrive in London about half-past 9 o'clock on Monday morning, that was the time I arrived last Monday week. Do not, my dearest girl, say anything to your mother about what you are going to do, only say you are coming to see me and stay with me and my friends till you get a situation here in London; and I think you had better not bring all your things, only the most particular ones, the best you <hi rend="italic">has.</hi> You will not want many things till we are married, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> you will have some made or bought for you by me before we are married, but bring a few of your best things only, and, above all things, bring all your letters and papers, leave nothing of importance behind, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> all little things you have I want to see, And I shall, of <hi rend="italic">corse</hi>, go to Brighton for a time after we are married, if not before; but I shall see you on Monday morning. You must bring the certificate of your birth with you, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> it must be taken to the office on Mon<lb/>day next, before the quarter's premium is paid, aud I wish it to be done nest Monday morning. I will take lodgings for you and me when you come up on Monday. You need not go to Mrs. Walker's at all; keep with me and I will manage it all comfortable enough for you; don't bring all your things, you understand, and only the best bring with you, and if you can borrow a little money of your father, do so for a few days when I can give it you to send him back, you understand, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> money is short with me till about this day week, Thursday. But I want to see you, dearest, and get your life assured, and get many things settled before then; and we will both go down and see your father and mother and friends, and surprise them, in about a week or eight days after we are married; but I am now, even now, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> much <hi rend="italic">has</hi> husband to you, dear girl, do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I tell you, and I am, with love, ever and ever to you. Do not forget to bring your birth certificate, as you cannot assure your life without it. I hope you will let me have answer by return of post, my most beloved girl, and one on Monday as well, to meet you at the station, London Bridge on Monday. I am your dear and most affectionate, <hi rend="smallCaps">W. G. YOUNGMAN</hi>."—Kind remembrance to your frieuds. You might bring a little of your home-made butter, and some things with you, only do not say I told you, you understand, it will be for your good, my dearest girl, I am now waiting to see you.</p>
               <p>"16, Manor Place, London, July 21, 1860.</p>
               <p>My dearest Mary.—I received your letter this morning. I am very much hurt to find you say you will not have your life assured, after I have troubled, and you had promised me faithfully to have it done, and to be my own dear wife on Monday next, but Tuesday will do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> well <hi rend="italic">has</hi> Monday, my dear girl, only your father, and mother, or any one must not know it. You pro<lb/>mised me faithfully, over and over again, and I expect you will keep your promise that you would be <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, and that your frieuds would not know it till we were married. But now, dearest Mary, if you will only let Mrs.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130103"/>
               <p>James Bone write to the Assurance Office at once, and go with me to have your life assured on Monday morning next, I will settle with you, and after that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> done your friends may know that we are going to be married. I will arrange all things, so you and myself can go down to your house, if possible, the same day we are married, so you need not bring any of your things up with you. Keep to your promise, my dear girl, and your friends shall know we are married the same day that we are, next Tuesday week, but I must have you first assure your life, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I have a great wish for you to do so, and cannot believe you love me unless you do, so cannot certainly think you do love me now. I sent this in haste that Mrs. James Bone may have time to write to them to-day, so the letter will get in London on Monday morning, first post, if not, and you come, bring the letter with you, and the certificate of your birth. Now, I am in earnest; I am keeping my word; you have promised me, now if you love me do this. I am, your affectionate lover, ever till death, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GODFREY YOUNGMAN</hi>—For your own sake, dearest girl, do <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I say. Adieu."</p>

               <p>My beloved Polly.—I have posted one letter to you this afternoon, but I find I shall not have to go to Brighton to-morrow, as X have had a letter from them with what I wanted inside of it; so, my dear girl, I have quite settled my business now, and I am quite ready to see you now, therefore I send this letter to you. I will take this to London Bridge station to-morrow morning, by a quarter past 6 o'clock, and get the guard to take it to Wad<lb/>hurst station, to give it to the porter there, who will get a man to take it to your place. I can only give the guard something, so you can give the man who brings this a small sum. I shall expect to see you, my dearest girl, on Monday morning, by the first train. I will await your coming at London Bridge station. I know the time the train arrives, a quarter to ten o'clock. I have promised to go to my uncle's to-morrow, so I cannot come down, but I will go back home with you on Monday night, or first thing Tuesday, so return here again Tuesday night to be ready to go anywhere on Wednesday; but you know all I have told you, and I now expect you will come up on Monday morning, when I shall be able to manage things <hi rend="italic">has</hi> I wish to do, Excuse more, my dearest Mary. I shall now go to bed to be up early in the morning to take this letter. Bring or bum all your letters, my dear girl; do not forget, and, with kind love to you and respects to all, I now sum up, waiting to see you Monday morning, a quarter to 10 o'clock. Believe me ever your loving, affectionate, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GODFREY YOUNGMAN</hi>.—You know all I have told you, therefore come, dearest girl; come, I am anxious now to see you.

Caroline Lefevre came to school to me, two years after which I agreed to take her to live with me; but she was a very naughty girl very much addicted to thieving, particularly the children's school-money, when she was entrusted with it to give it me; which I have looked over but have given her a stripe or two with the cane used in school, to try to break her of doing it, bat never to injure the child. I would send her for two loaves of bread, she would give me one and spend the other money; she would often serve me so by the meat and tea, which she often got a smack for, to try to break her of if; she always said she would not do it again, but did it the very next time she went out; and the filth that she speaks of was this, we all sat down to dinner off hashed beef and potatoes; I got up from my dinner to go after a younger child that was asleep, to bring it down to dinner, and said to Caroline, "empty that pan while I am gone up-stairs;" when I came down again I began to eat two or three mouthfuls, and thought it tasted very nasty, then looked and saw what it was; I asked her how it came there, she said it was a bit of wood, I said it was not; I said "I have eaten some, and you eat the rest;" she did it to serve me out because I asked her to empty the pan, but whether she eat it or not, I know not; I did not lay a finger on her for so doing, only told her to eat it, as she had put it for me; as to the burn on her hand, I told her three times not to touch the mat while I was rubbing the iron, and she would, and the iron did touch it as I was rubbing it on the mat, and did burn it; and the cut that is at the back of her head, she fell against the bedstead, backwards.

I took her for company, and to try to break her of some of her bad ways, if I could; to ill-use her I had no such thought, nor to keep her without her food, or I should not have found so many slices of bread and butter, fish, and meat thrown into the cupboard where she sat close to, to have her meals, partly eaten and thrown there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 37, Hooper-street, Westminster-road, and am a hammerman—the prisoner lived next door to me, and my father and mother—on the night of 5th July, about half-past 8, I went into the yard behind our house, and I saw a girl there with an infant in her arms—both the girl and the infant were crying—I spoke to the girl, and about three or four minutes after that the prisoner came out of her house into her own yard—there was a fence about three feet high between our yard and hers—I could get over it, because the palings were broken—the prisoner rushed over to the girl that had the infant, and took it out of her arms, she pushed the girl on one side, and caught hold of the infant by the front of the pinafore, and one leg; but before that she hit it with her hand; her hand was closed—she hit it just on the back of the head once, then she caught hold of one of its legs, and the front of the pinafore, and dashed it down on the ground—the right side of the child's head touched the ground—the yard is gravelled—the prisoner then made an attempt to get the child again, and I jumped over just in time to pick it up—I picked up the child and gave it to its mother again—I thought she was going in-doors with it—she said she would go in<lb/>doors with it then—she was very drunk—she then walked over to the water-butt, and I followed her—she lifted a bit of wood that acted as a cover to the water-butt, a sort of lid, and then <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the baby head first into the water-butt—I rushed over and picked the child out of the water-butt directly—the child was about four months old—when the prisoner had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the baby into the water-butt she turned her back to the butt to go in-doors—I can't say whether she saw me pick the child out or not—she did not go in<lb/>doors—I kept the child in my arms, trying to take its clothes off for a minute or two, and then the prisoner came and tried to take it from me several times—it was dripping wet—I kept her back with one hand as well as I could and I gave it to my mother, and went for a policeman—when the policeman came we went into the prisoner's house—the prisoner was sitting down on a box with her own eldest child in her arms, about eight years old—the policeman told her that she was to go along with him, and she asked him where her infant was—some one in the room said it was outside, and some woman was taking care of it—the policeman caught hold of her arm—she tried very much not to go with him, and said, "For God's sake don't take me; let me</p>

               <p>stop here"—she would not go out with the policeman, and I caught hold of one of her arms—we had a very great job to get her out into the street—at the time she was in the act of putting the child into the water-butt, I saw a woman in the prisoner's room who wanted to come out, I expect, to save the child—she put one of her legs on the sill to come through the window because the door was locked—she could not get out at the door, and when she saw the prisoner coming over to the water-butt with the child she stepped back again—when I picked the child out of the butt the prisoner was not above a foot away from the butt—she turned her back to the butt directly she <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the child in—she stood still about a foot from the butt—she stopped there about a minute till I had got it out—there was water enough in the butt to drown the child; it was three parts fall—directly you pushed the lid on one side you could see the water, you could not help seeing it—the butt was about three feet high, and about three parts full—the woman was reeling about, but I believe she could have stood steadily if she had liked, because, in the room, when we went in, she seemed as if she was all right—there was about ten minutes between the time she put the child into the butt, and the time that she said to the policeman, "For God's sake don't take me"—I did not observe the face of the baby when I took it out of the water-butt—I could see where the mark was on its head, where it had been bruised on the ground, and it was very pale—it never moved—I did not have it in my arms above two or three minutes.</p>

I am the mother of the last witness—on the evening of 5th July I was in my own room about half-past 8—I heard the cry of a baby, and went out into the back yard, and my son gave me the prisoner's baby—it was a girl about four or five months old—it was dripping wet and looked between black and blue in the face, and it had a bruise on the right side of the head—it seemed to be a bruise just received—I undressed the baby, wrapped it up warm, and suckled it—it lived, and is now doing very well—I had known the prisoner for about two months as a neighbour—I never knew her to be cruel to her children before—she was always neat, and was either working or knitting at her door, working hard for her family—I never saw her in liquor before—she was in liquor that night.</p>

I am the wife of John Williams, and lived in the same house as the prisoner, on 5th July—between 7 and 8 that evening the prisoner called me into her room to pay me a shilling that she owed me—she began to tell me what a bother she had had to get her pension money—she is a soldier's widow—she had been drinking a little, but spoke sensibly enough to me—while I was there she took the baby from the bed where it was lying; it was crying—she took it by its clothes in front and threw it down on the ground on its back—she did it violently, in her passion—it was on the bed, but there was no bedstead—it fell on the boards, against the fire-place, about a yard from the bed—I picked it up and took it out into the street, and gave it to the prisoner's little girl; I then went back to the prisoner's room—the pri<lb/>soner shut the door to keep me in; the handle was off on the inside and I could not open it—she said she had spent a good deal of her money, but she had only had one glass of gin during the day—she then undressed herself to search and try to find her money, and she broke and smashed the things in the room, and tore down the curtains; after that she heard the baby crying in the back-yard, and she said, "You b—bastard, I will do for you"—I</p>

I am an inspector of the Thames police—on 26th July, at a quarter to 10 I was in the police galley—I saw the barge called the <hi rend="italic">George</hi>; four persons were in it; Wickers, Bates, Moss, and Jupp, who has absconded—Wickers' name was on the barge—they were coming from Young and Raymond's premises, Bermondsey-wall—they were about twenty yards from there, coming out into the stream—I hailed them and shortly after went on board—I found 11 quarters of oats and 110 barrels of flour—I had spoken to Wickers and he said he had got 10 quarters of oats and 110 barrels of flour, and on counting them I found 11 quarters—I then asked for their orders—two orders were given to me; these are the documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Wickers produced them—one is for 110 barrels of flour and the other for 10 quarters of oats from S. and H. Bowyer—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—this is not signed—one ia an order for 110 barrels of flour from Messrs. Young and Raymond—when I saw the order was for ten quarters I said, "You have got eleven quarters; how do you account for the one quarter, or two sacks?"—Wickers said, "They have been put in, they have been given over"—I then said, "The sacks are marked 'Brown and Young"—Wickers said, "They are all over the world"—I said, "This is all wrong, I shall have to take you into custody"—the tide was going down and we had to make across the water to Wapping—the barge was made fast at New Crane—Wickers then pulled me on one side and said, "Won't 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., settle it?"—I said, "No, not a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—Moss and Bates were tken in the head sheets of the barge—they could hear; we were all close together—I afterwards showed these sacks to Messrs. Young's foreman—none of the sacks were marked S. and H. Bowyer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you know Jupp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; he works for Young and Raymond—I believe he is a constant man—I believe he is not a man of good character—he absconded on this occasion—he came ashore in a boat—I did not pursue him, because I did not know at the time that anything was wrong in the barge—I boarded the barge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130116"/>
               <p>because I thought four men was too many to navigate a barge of that description, but I could not stop Jupp because I had no proof—I went ashore, but I did not follow him any distance—I hailed him aud he bolted—I have never seen him since—I first saw the <hi rend="italic">George</hi> about a quarter to 10—I believe I stated before the Magistrate that Wickers said that the sacks were all over the world—with regard to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Wickers did not say to me that he would rather have given a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note than that those oats should have been found in his barge; I am quite sure that was not what he said—there was no conversation going on at that time—the twenty-two sacks would make what we call a broken tier on the barge—when I first went on board the barge the other men said they were assisting Wickers over the water—Wickers was then in the head sheets of the barge—this was not said in a low voice—I believe I have told you all that Wickers told me at the station—he said he did not know how the corn came into the barge—it might have been at the station that the others mentioned about the assistance—I did not know at the time who Wickers was working for—I thought by his name being on the barge it belonged to him—I believe the barge belongs to Mr. Ticer; he made an application for it—there is no charge about the 110 barrels—that was correct—they were for Messrs. Young aud Raymond—he was properly there as to those—he received them from that wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the firm of Yonng and Raymond—I saw Wickers' barge on 26th July, about a quarter to 10 in the morning—it was then moored alongside the warehouse at the water<lb/>side door—I went down there and Wickers was standing in his barge by the water-side door—I said, "What are you for?"—he said, "110 barrels of flour"—the barge was quite empty then, not a sack of corn in it—I am quite sure there was not twenty-two sacks of oats in it at that time—our sacks are not allowed to be used by other people—I have seen these twenty<lb/>two sacks produced—they are our property—these are two of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some are marked "John Raymond and Son," some "Brown and Young," and some "Young and Raymond," our present firm—I and my son and Mr. Young succeeded to the late firm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant dealing principally in silk plash; I carry on business in London at 86, Upper Stamford-street—I have also a business in Paris, at 9, Rue Chaveleau—the prisoner, Woillez, was clerk in my employ in April last, and had been so for about nine months previous to that time—he had to keep my books, to be careful about the goods when I was not there, and to furlough the orders that were transmitted to him from France, and to carry out my directions—I kept at this office in Stamford<lb/>street, a stock of silk plush—he had no authority from me at any time to sell any of it—I left London on 15th April—previous to leaving I had a stock of silk plush in my office in Stamford-street—it was worth about 1,830<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the cost price—I left that all safe on the premises when I left London—I returned to London again on 22d May, in consequence of a telegram which I received on 26th April; in consequence of my engage<lb/>ments I could not come back till the 22d May—on my arrival in London I went to my office in Stamford-street; I did not find my silk plush there, it was all gone—in consequence of some inquiries that I made I went to the premises of Mr. Soloman Abraham Hart, in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe—I there saw some silk plush that was my property—my tickets were on it—that was the silk plush that was safe before I left England—I know Hart now; I had never seen him before that time—I never gave Woillez or anybody else any authority to dispose of that silk plush to Hart—I was at the police-station in Tower-street, Lambeth, when woillez was brough there on 30th July—I saw him and he said, "I am guilty, I am very sorry for it; take pity on myself and my wife"—I have since received these two letters from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are in his handwriting—when silk plush came into my office in England from Paris, it was the duty of Woillez to enter it in a stock-book—I have that stock-book here—I also keep an approbation book—when goods were sent out to persons to look at, it was</p>

               <p>the duty of Woillez to enter these goods in the approbation book—these goods were entered in the stock-book by Woillez—they were never entered in the approbation book by him—they were not entered in the stock-book as sold to any one—there is an entry as having come in, but not as having gone out—when I give an invoice to a customer of mine I always state in it all the numbers and yards of pieces of plush, and then all the prices of each piece—Woillez was in the habit of making out these invoices in that style—he never made an invoice while in my employ up to the time he left, without doing that, stating all the prices and so on—on Saturday, 7th July last, I accompanied Jones, a police-officer, to the lodging of the prisoner Bliss—I saw him there; he was charged in my presence—the police-constable said he charged him with being the accomplice in a robbery and stealing about 6,000 yards of goods, my property—he mentioned Woillez's name—Bliss said to me in French, "I know, Mr. Gilly, you are very un<lb/>lucky to lose your goods; but I cannot do anything, it is not my fault"—he repeated several times, "I know it is very unlucky for you"—I then asked him if he knew Mr. Woillez for any length of time—he told me he had known him a year—I asked him if he knew Mr. Soloman Abraham Hart of Bury-street—he said, "I have known Mr. Hart all the time I have been in London, ten years; Mr. Hart would not see me in this embarrass<lb/>ment and trouble even if it cost him 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—I answered him that he was very lucky to have such friends—he was then taken from his lodging to the station-house; I there gave a charge against him to the inspector—I did not appear against him on that charge before the Magistrate, because I was in the Court of Common Pleas—I had an action there; that was the action of Gilly against Hart—I did not appear at the hearing before the Magistrate, because I was appointed for 10 o'clock in the morning, and I only left the Court of Common Pleas about half-past 5, or something like that, so that I could not keep my appointment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Bliss.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you went to take Bliss in custody on Saturday the 7th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the case of Gilly against Hart was appointed for the Monday morning—I did not know that Bliss was going to be examined as a witness on behalf of Mr. Hart—I mean to swear that—the effect was that he was left in custody until, my not appearing, he was discharged—when I took him in custody, I knew I should have to appear against him as a witnssss—the officer did not tell me that I must appear on the Monday morning—he did not give me any notice of what time I should be required to appear before the Magistrate on that morning—I knew at that time that the trial of Gilly against Hart was fixed for Monday morning—I did not know that Bliss was kept for a considerable part of Monday in custody before he was discharged; I did not know any<lb/>thing about it—I said that if I took a man in custody, I would take the responsibility of that taking him in custody—I did not inquire what had become of the man whom I had given in custody—I supposed that if I could not go there on the Monday, my solicitor could ask the Magistrate to remand him till the day after—I sent my solicitor to ask for a remand—I don't know whether he is here to-day—the first time I saw Bliss after I had given him in custody, was on the Monday; it was not on the Tuesday—the trial lasted two days—he was examined on the Monday; I am certain of it—I did not give the policeman instructions not to allow Mr. Bliss to communicate with Hart; I am sure of that—Woiliez was iu my employ nine months, beginning, I think, about last August—there was not a person of the name of De Jardin in my employ before Woillez, in the same</p>

               <p>capacity; nor a person of the name of Westley, not at that time; there was before—I had De Jardin about three, years since—the very first day I took my house in London, De Jardin was with me; about two or three years afterwards I took Westley with De Jardin—I kept Westley perhaps six or seven months, or something like that, and I dismissed him in the month of April or May, 1859—I always kept De Jardin with me; and in August, three or four months after I dismissed Westley, I took Woillez—De Jardin was always with me—he is not in my employment now; I did not dismiss him, he left me at the end of August, 1859—Westley and De Jardin had not authority to sell without consulting me, more particularly Westley, who was a traveller going to collect orders—my house was a French house—the authority of De Jardin was decidedly larger than the authority of Westley, but he had not authority to sell without consulting me—I did not say in the Court of Common Pleas, that both Westley and De Jardin had authority to sell on my behalf, or if I did say so or something like that, there has been probably a false interpretation, because I only could say what was true—they had not authority to sell without consulting me, and I think they never did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in the Court of Common Pleas, draw a distinction between the form in which Woillez was employed by you and that of the other two, and say that the other two had authority to sell, but that he had not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not have said that, and if it was understood so, it must have been a mistake—I never gave the authority to our clerks—Woillez's education allowed him to write a letter with an autograph, and Westley could not—I think Woillez was a person of superior education to Westley—I always corresponded between my London house and my Paris house—I wrote a letter from my house in Paris, and Woillez had authority to open it—my clerk, like Mr. Woillez, was the only person who had authority to open it—from February till April, I corresponded with my London house—Woillez was the person who was attending to the business of my London house from February till April, 1860—I expected and intended him to open the letters and attend to the business—I received several letters from him with reference to the pecuniary position of the house—they are here, I have got a machine copy of them in a book—I have also got the letters which I wrote to the house; they are here too (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here called for the letters, and put them in as his evidence</hi>)—I have in my book a letter of 27th August, 1859, from Woillez to me—it is a letter by De Jardin, and here is a letter of 19th December 1859, from Woillez to me (<hi rend="italic">The witness read the letter in French, and Mr. Albert the interpreter translated it, as follows</hi>: "I have received your letter of the, 17th instant, and I received yours of the 18th. Be persuaded that I regret as much as you do yourself, perhaps more than yourself, that I have not sold any goods, or anything, during your absence, but that it is not my fault, I do the best I can for you, but business is very bad at this moment, and particularly for us; besides, this is not the month to sell; almost everybody postpones giving orders till January next. De Jardin is not more lucky than I am; since the plushes have arrived he sent thirty pieces on approbation, but not one has been sold yet: with the fancy hats, I am not mote lucky; these are positively difficult to get a customer for, there are a great many of these hats in the market." <hi rend="italic">The rest of the letter was not read, being considered immaterial</hi>)—here is the letter of 20th December, (<hi rend="italic">Read in part</hi>: "I have received your letter of the 19th; I went four times to Mr. Hart to-day without being able to see him, and I waited for him</p>

               <p>till half-past 5, and therefore must wait till to-morrow morning. I have no news yet about the paletôt, and I have not been able yet to obtain anything else than the goods from Ferrari: when you are in London, doubtless you will be more lucky than I am. De Jardin and I are both very much grieved by your reproaches, but against force there is no resistance; it is impossible to sell anything. I saw to-day Mr. Gilham, who is in London for some months; I did every thing in my power to sell him something, but he cannot take the Reynard plushes, he wants some plushes from the manufacturer, Martin, or none at all; and he will wait till you come back before treating with anybody about it; and this is the promise he has made to me. If the two pieces of plush that you are about to sell remain on the shelves, that will not be my fault either."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then did you get from him, on 2d March, another letter in reply to yours, in these words: "I could, with much trouble, obtain from one House which makes advances, a loan of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on twelve pieces of plush of low quality, and I will send you the numbers to-morrow; but I have had to sign an engagement to return the amount in a month with 10 per cent., and therefore the agreement has been signed for 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—is that the transaction of which you were ashamed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—I had no notion when I authorised him to borrow 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he was going to do it at 120 per cent, per annum—supposing he found a customer for plushes, he had no authority to part with them without first telling me the name of the customer, and getting my approbation to sell to him—the name of Hart has been mentioned in one of those letters; that is not Mr. Solomon Hart—it is another person altogether, a good friend of mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to put in the transcript of the summing-up, but tlie Court was of opinion that it was not admissable</hi>)—I was present when the verdict was returned—it was for the defendant—it was in these words, "We find the verdict for the defendant, but we couple it with this, the jury consider that the defendant's system of making purchases without inquiry is highly reprehensible and pernicious in its effects on trade."</p>

I could not say which—I understood Bliss to say, "We are waiting"—Woillez then went up stairs, put on his hat and coat, and they both went out together—Woillez was not gone very long—he returned by himself—I did not see him come in, but I heard him let himself in with the key—I remember a cart arriving on the following morning, Wednesday—there were two men with it—the plush was carried out and put into the cart—Woillez was present during that time—I said, "Why, you are making quite a clearance"—he replied, "Oh, no; it will all come back again; I am sure they will not buy"—I don't remember his saying anything else just then—he afterwards called me to give me some orders, and he said he was going out about the plush, as the old gentleman that was there the day before did not know anything about it—he said, "That old man is just like a child stroking a cat; he puts it all the wrong way"—he said there would be some gentlemen there to meet him that morning—he left a letter to take somewhere, and he took the paper himself—he said, "I suppose I must take it, but it will be no use, you may be sure"—it was a blank invoice—he said, "They will offer me about half-a-crown a yard; it will sure to come back to-morrow"—he then left, and returned at ten minutes to 3 in the afternoon—a Paris letter arrived for him in his absence—I put it on his desk; I saw him open it—he said that Mr. Gilly had had some goods detained at the Customs at Boulogne, and then he took the letter up as though he were translating to me, and he said "Mr. Gilly says,' if I cannot ascertain at the Customs here, I must go to Boulogne at once, or it would be condemned if it was not claimed before Friday,' that is, the goods"—I said, "I suppose if you go to Boulogne you will take Madame with you, as she wants to go"—by "Madame" I meant Mrs. Woillez—he said "Oh! no; the weather is very bad, and I cannot be troubled with two children"—he then went out, and returned again at half-past 7, and said he was going by the half-past 8 o'clock train to Boulogne—his wife was then present; he said to her in my presence, "Are you ready?"—she said, "I will be ready in a few minutes"—they both went up stairs—at a quarter past 8 they both left in a cab; Madame Woillez, the two children, and Mr. Woillez—they took one black trunk, a small square box, and a bundle—I saw nothing of them afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for some years porter to Mr. Gilly—Woillez was his clerk—on 15th April Mr. Gilly was obliged to leave England suddenly in consequence of the death of his mother—when he left there was a large stock of plush left on the premises—it consisted of 139 pieces—when Mr. Gilly left London, the persons left there were Woillez, his wife, who was allowed to live with the children, on the premises; myself and my wife—on Monday, 23d April, Woillez told me there was a gentleman coming to look at some plush, and that he was coming to-morrow morning—on Tuesday, 24th, a gentleman came about 10 o'clock in the morning—that gentleman was Mr. Hart, the gentleman who is standing in Court now—I was about my usual work, and I heard a knock at the door; I turned and opened the door—the gentleman said, "Mr. Gilly?" said, "Mr. Gilly is not here"—as soon as the knock was given at the door Mr. Woillez began to descend down stairs—he said, "Good morning, sir," and showed Hart into the warehouse, where they stopped, I think, twenty minutes; not more than half an hour—I saw Hart look at some of the stock of 139 pieces of plush—there were about fifteen pieces; apparently taken out of the stock to be looked at—I have been three or four years in the business—the stock varies in quality—every piece must be looked at before a gentleman can form an opinion on it—when Mr. Hart went away Woillez showed him out—I did not hear what passed between them—during the Tuesday, Woillez said that the gentleman was a large buyer of plush, and was going to have the bulk of the goods on the premises, so that he might have a few friends to look at them—next morning, about 10 o'clock, a cart was driven up to the door, a couple of men attending—I saw written on the cart, "S. A. Hart, St. Mary Axe, Houndsditch" or something of that sort—I opened the door to the men with the cart—Woillez was up stairs—he came down directly I opened the door—he said, "It is all right, get down the plush"—it is not usual to have the plush put in in bulk, without being checked off or something of that sort—I got them down, and I said," Mr. Woillez, shall I call them off?"—he said, "No; it is no matter now, as I am not dressed"—he said he could check them out of the book—there is a book kept called an approbation book—he said, 'Ton need not mmd that now"—the 139 pieces were then taken and put in the cart, I assisting, and Woillez directing; and then it was driven away—I had occasion to go out almost immediately afterwards—I think I went out before Woillez—I got back about a quarter-past 3 in the afternoon—as I was coming back, towards Stamford-street, I met Woilles in a cab between Blackfriare-bridge and Stamford-street-the stopped me—he asked me how I got on with my business—he asked me if I would get a glass of ale; I said, "Thank you"—when we got to the Cross-Keys public-house he pulled out a Paris letter he said, "Here, look; the property that you packed has been stopped by the Customs"—I had packed a case of pro<lb/>perty—I cannot read French—he read what appeared to me to be a trans<lb/>lation; he had it in his hand—he said that he was then going to the Customs—I said, "There is no use in that"—he said, "I shall do as Mr. Gilly told me; I shall go to the Customs; I shall—go to Boulogne to-night; if I am not there by Friday the goods will be condemned"—he had still the letter in his hand while he was saying this about what Mr. Gilly had told him—I took that as the instructions which Mr. Gilly had given him in the letter—I said, "How about the plush T he said, "I have nothing to do with it; Mr. Hart has telegraphed to Mr. Gilly, offering him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard for the</p>

               <p>bulk; do you think he will take it?"—I said, "Well, I don't know; the price is very low, and there are many good plushes amongst them"—he said, "Well, I have nothing to do with it; it all rests with Mr. Gilly and Mr. Hart"—I got home to Stamford-street about 4 o'clock—about 8 o'clock that evening, or a little after, he left the establishment in Stamford-street, taking with him his wife and children—there had been a habit of having a letter from Paris every day—as he was going out I said to him, "How about the Paris letter?" he said, "Oh; there will be no Paris letter, Mr. Gilly knows I am going"—as I was going to bed my wife drew my attention to the doors being open—I turned into the room and my attention was turned to the grate, where there was a large quantity of burnt paper—next morning a Paris letter did arrive, and the prisoner having told me that none would arrive I opened the letter myself—not knowing French myself, I got it translated by a person who does know French—the letter was translated to me, and in cousequence I went to Mr. Sydney, the solicitor, and he telegraphed to Paris—I did not see him do so, but I saw the tele<lb/>graph dispatch written out—this letter, dated the 25th April, is in Mr. Woillez's hand<lb/>writing (<hi rend="italic">This letter was here read, it was addressed to Mr. Gilly, acknow<lb/>ledged the receipt of a cheque for 1551. which arrived too late for him to deposit it in the bank; it referred to matters of ordinary business, but made no re<lb/>ference to the plush</hi>)—I went with Mr. Sydney the solicitor to Mr. Gilly, to Mr. Hart's premises that very day—I myself did not see the 139 pieces of plush on his premises at all.</p>

I said, "I expect he will be in this country on Thursday next"—Bliss said he was innocent—he did not at that time say anything more about Woillez—I searched his luggage, and found this envelope, with some other papers—he did not say anything at that time, when I told him there was a man in custody—on the way to the station he said he had only acted as an agent for Woillez, and he had received 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as his commission—I said, "It is a very bad job for you, but you must make the best of it;" he said, "It is a very bad job for me"—I said, "Have you known Woillez long?" he said, "I have known him</p>

               <p>complete confession, I take the liberty to write you again. Believe as certain, Sir, that in everything which took place I have always been the iustrument and the victim of a swindler, who is to-day the cause of all my misfortune, and by whom I have been incited and advised. It is himself alone who has trained this business, and who made me conclude with Mr. Hart's connivance, and who had not the slightest doubt that he was not doing with Mr. Gilly. Before introducing me to Hart, Bliss had been to his office to settle this business with him; therefore Hart asked no questions. The fact is, that Hart and his clerk both together had recognised myself as your clerk, having seen me before when they went to Cannon-street to buy plush, and when De Jardin, with whom they had to do, said to them, in my presence, that Mr. Gilly was in Paris, and he will write to him about his offer—very evident proof that Hart was quite knowing that he had not to do with Mr. Gilly. It is by Bliss that anything <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been made; he did all himself. I have followed wrong counsels, and I have fallen in the snare laid by him. He did assure me upon his word that in three weeks we could have the plush again and restore them, and then work as partners for ourselves. This deceived me to commit this fault, and without his counsels I should never have thought of doing such a thing. I have always been an honest man, bold, and good father of my family, always working to educate honourably my children; my antecedents are able to prove it. I am born of an honest family, and should never have done anything to dishonour it without the counsels of a man without any faith, heart, or honour, like Bliss. It is <hi rend="italic">him</hi> who pressed me to leave London to go to Hamburg, where he ought to go with me on the 25th, but we missed the mail-train at 8 o'clock, and I took, with my wife, this one of half-past 8 for Dover; but not being able to take the luggage, Bliss was forced to remain till the morning, day after, and meet me at Ostend, from where we left the same day for Hamburg. He stays there with me ten days, Hotel de l'Europe, and thence to Eppendorf; he stops there some more time with me, and left to return to London, but he was not certain if he would go to see his father. He only writes to me about three weeks afterwards, telling that he was in the Queen's Bench, where he had been put by your order. I have received this letter at Eppendorf, and received there another, in which he said that I had to leave at once, because you knew where I was. Bliss has named on his passport, my wife and my two children, and also a maid. He went to have his passport on the 24th, afternoon, or 25th, morning, to the Consulate of Payrbas. Now you know what remains. This affair (will mean robbery) has been performed between Bliss, Hart, and me; and I do not doubt one minute to have been the dupe of those gentlemen, who well know all that passed. I have been unhappy enough to follow this bad advice. I have nothing else to do than to hope in your mercy and God. I have confidence that both together you have pity for me, my wife, and my poor children.")</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Charles James, who is a pocket-book maker—I live now at 17, Newton-street—I remember being at a tea-party in Mr. Ellis's house—I was there on the day the prisoner was there—I was down stairs waiting for my husband—I did not take tea with them—I remember seeing the prisoner there a certain evening, lately—it was on a Saturday, but I can't say what date—it was within a month or five weeks.</p>
