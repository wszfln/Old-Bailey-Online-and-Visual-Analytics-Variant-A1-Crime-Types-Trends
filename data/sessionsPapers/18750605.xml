               <p>anything about Furze's case—I was at the Halifax Arms about 7 o'clock on 2nd February, it might be between 7 and 8 o'clock, I think it was before 8 o'clock—I walked with Mackay to the station, as he did not know the way—on the road I said it was a very serious thing of him locking a man up in a case like this—he made use of very obscene language and said he did not care, he knew as much as Davis did, and he would b----up the license at the Halifax Arms unless his friends came down in the morning with 150 <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>, and if I was a friend of his I ought to produce some portion of it—I know the prisoner's handwriting, these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all in his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about the middle part of the day when Mackay gave his evidence at the Police Court, somewhere about dinner time—I did not take a note of what he said, I am speaking from memory—I did not give my evidence till 15th April—I had the Halifax Arms once myself, I bought it about this time twelve months and sold it to Davis—I had the Rose at the same time as the Halifax Arms—I was at the Grapes in Houndsditch about eighteen months ago, I sold that and lived out of business for a month—I then bought the Rose and the Halifax Arms together—I kept the Rose and put my son-in-law, Mr. Morgan, in the other as 1 could not hold two licenses; the Halifax Arms was transferred to Davis just before last Christmas—Morgan was in it about nine months, or six or seven months—I did not keep a beershop in Boston Street, Hackney Road, I had a licensed public-house there, I sold it ten years ago, I had it about eighteen months and sold it to very good advantage—I have had thirteen licensed houses in the city and suburbs within twenty-six years.</p>

Carter Wood, the brewers—I was at the Police Court on 3rd February, when this case against Davis was heard before Mr. Hannay—I took a note of what Mackay swore on that occasion (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>) he said that his name was William Mackay, living at 3, Thomas Street, Hackney Road, a licensed victualler's broker—on Monday night last, 1st February, he was at the Halifax Arms, at the house kept by Davis, it was a benefit night of a friend of his—he said "He asked me to take some tickets, and 1 took 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, I took the trouble to send them out; in the evening I went to the Halifax Arms, I went upstairs into the club-room. When I came downstairs 1 walked to the bar; I was standing at the far end of the bar, the prisoner was standing talking to another man, I heard Davis say to the other man Get a card out of his pocket, he has got some <hi rend="italic">quids.</hi> Then Furze came round the corner and stood on my right hand side, I felt somebody's hand in my pocket, and I missed my pocket handkerchief. There were two women there, one of the women said 'I saw him put his hand into your pocket.' Directly Davis had said this Furze went round to my pocket. There was a very rough lot there, and I gave instructions to a detective and he captured Furze, and in the evening I took Davis. There was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and papers in the pocket-book; I found the papers in my box this morning at my private residence.</p>

               <p>the house. Then there was a letter of December 20th, 1874, put in, and then he was asked whether he had ever been an attorney's clerk, and what he was, and he said he carried on business as a public-house broker at 32, Coleman-street, Bank"—that is all I have taken down—the man was discharged without any one being called for the defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Notes were taken by the Magistrate's clerk—I took <hi rend="italic">down</hi> all I thought material, we were acting for the defence—I took down every word he said in chief, and the cross-examination as far as it goes—he may have said a little more—I did not give evidence before the Magistrate when the prisoner was charged with perjury—I heard Towsey give evidence as to what he heard Mackay say—I don't remember an objection being taken by Mackay—Mr. Hannay sent for the depositions that had been taken on 3rd February, and they were produced, they were written in a book—I don't think I had this paper in my pocket at the time, it was at the office—I did not tell the Magistrate that I had taken it, it was not necessary—I did not mention to anybody that I had taken it, I brought it here to-day with other papers in the action, because I thought it might be wanted—there were two actions brought by Mackay, one against Davis and one against Towsey—he admitted in both actions that he had not any ground for the claim—the first writ was on 18th January 1875, for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., there had been a writ before that, but we had nothing to do with that, Mackay had settled that between himself and Davis—I believe the claim on 18th January was for cash lent and work and labour done—Davis brought the writ to me—I took his written instructions to enter an appearance, which I did in due course—Mackay delivered a declaration on 28th January, and notice of trial, and we pleaded in due course on 10th February—here is the replication dated 18th March, I suppose the issue would be delivered with it—he was not threatened that if he proceeded with the action there would be a summons for perjury against him, I believe a summons was applied for about 25th March—the action is not still pending—it was put an end to by a letter from Mackay "I hereby withdraw from both my actions, and I further undertake and agree never to proceed with them, and also to pay whatever law costs have been incurred; with regard to the charge I made against Mr. Davis, I entirely exonerate him from the same"—I heard that letter read before the Magistrate—in another letter he not only counter<lb/>manded the notice of trial, but he said that his attorney had been acting without his instructions.</p>

                  </hi>. In February I was lessee and occupier of the Halifax Arms—I have been a pugilist—I was at my public-house on the lot of February—Mackay was there, also Furze—I did not tell Furze to take a card from Mackay's pocket as he had got some <hi rend="italic">quids</hi>; I never spoke to Furze, I did not in any way assist Furze in robbing him—I did not know that night of his having been robbed—I was on the premises on Tuesday morning, 2nd February, between 11 and 12 o'clock; Mackay came there—he had two glasses of ale, and I another gentleman were behind the bar; and just before be left he said to us "Now you <hi rend="italic">sods</hi>, I am going to <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> a ticket-of-leave man, and if that don't settle the license of the b----Halifax Arms, I will do it. by fair means or foul"—I was married that morning, and had just fetched my wife home—at 7.30 that evening Mackay came in with a detective and gave me in charge for being concerned with Furze, in robbing him of a pocket-book and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 3rd I was taken before Mr.</p>

               <p>Hannay, Mackay gave his evidence, and I was discharged—I instructed Messrs. Burchell to take out a summons against him for perjury—he has no claim against me for money due to him, he owes we money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a fighting man; I am not now—I was tried for manslaughter at Maidstone, and you defended me—I was acquitted—I had nothing to do with the fight—I was taken for being at the fight asan accessory—it is very nearly two and a half years since I fought in the ring—I have not been in any other trouble—about twelve years ago I was locked up for being along with some <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> that were trying to steal some tea, and I was in prison for two months—when I first communicated with Mackay about the pur<lb/>chase of the Halifax Arms, I was a billiard marker:—I had been manager at the White Swan public-house, 227, Mile End Road—I had just come out of it—I had had a bit of a quarrel with the landlord—he did not charge me with anything; he sent his wife after me to get me back and manage the house for him—I had been billiard marker at the Earl of Warwick, in the Mile End Road—I was there nearly twelve months—I was not dis<lb/>charged, I left to take the management of the White Swan—I was not charged with cheating the players—there was no charge against me at the White Swan for robbing the till—I was born in Australia—I was between seven and eight years of age when I came away—I have never been there since—I had been out of the White Swan five or six weeks before I com<lb/>menced to negotiate for the Halifax Arms; during that time I was enjoying myself, I had been hard at work for eight or nine months and I thought 1 would have a week or two—I did not know that Mackay was a public-house broker till he told me—he spoke to me at the White Swan—I had not much to pay down for the Halifax Arms; I had some acceptances from friends, and some 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but out of that Mackay cashed a bill and stuck to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not a farthing of money to pay down—Mackay did not negotiate the whole of it—I cashed the bills—I had the money to go in, less the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. That he stopped—I am not aware that he negotiated with the brewers for the loan of the money for me to go into the house; I did not; Mr. Towsey did 1 believe—the brewers offered to advance me 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being a public man, but I did not know that Mackay had been the means of getting it; I swear that—1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the price of the house—Mackay did not <hi rend="italic">get</hi> four bills of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for me for the other hundred pounds; he did not get them accepted, he got one and kept the money—one I took away and gave back to the party, because I did not want it; the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he kept I had borrowed from another gentlemen, or I could not have gone into the house, and the other two I paid—Mr. Towsey discounted one—Mackay did not get it discounted—a wine merchant dis<lb/>counted the other; I did not know the wine merchant—it was accepted on the night of the change, nobody got him to accept it; he offered to do so and I was offered money besides by Mr. Muddle, a friend of mine, a publican—the negotiation was going on for five or six weeks before I got into the house—I saw Mackay in reference to it during that time, twenty times I should think; it might have been more or less, and he kept writing letters to me to go and see him—he did not tell me of communications he had had with the brewers, he told me of communications he had had with Mr. Towsey—he never told me that he had seen the brewers, or that he had been several times to them to induce them to advance the money; he told me that Mr. Towsey had—I have not gone with Mackay to the brewers; I met him there once, he went to give me a good character if I required one—he did not give a written guarantee to pay the four 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills if I did not take them up;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050007"/>
               <p>no guarantee was given—I don't know what he did about the bill that he cashed, because I did not have the money—the others were accepted on my word—I asked them—he did not hand me any money on the night of the transfer—the charge against me was made up of the broker's charge, four teen guineas, and Mr. Towsey's the same—I did not agree to pay both—Mackay did not lend me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not a penny—I saw him bring Mr. Pode and Mr. Boatland to my house in a cab one night, that is all I know of them—I did not in their presence acknowledge that I owed Mackay 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did not see any affidavits made by them—I heard from Messrs. Burchell that they were made. (Mr. Armstrong. They were not made—they took out notices, and gave us copies, but the affidavits were never sworn.) On the night in question there was a benefit for Bob Travers, not a sparring match—I should think there were 100 persons upstairs—there were a few fighting men among them, no woman—I decline to answer whether there was a rat match there a short time before—I should think Mackay came downstairs on this night about 10.30, from that to 11 o'clock—there might have been eight or nine or ten persons at the bar when he came down, not more than a dozen—I knew most of them as customers, and knew several of their names—there were several women and their husbands; I knew them—there were no women of the town to my knowledge; I am sure of that, I don't, allow them there—there was a man "named Grant, a labourer and his wife, and Armstrong and his wife; I knew them as customers they are not here—at the time this is said to have happened they were drinking at different parts of the bar; there was no noise or confusion, everything was quiet—I was behind the bar with Mr. Payne, he lives at the house; he goes by the name of Beverley because his wife is a professional singer—he has lived in the house almost ever since I have been there—I do not know Joseph Donaldson—I never heard of a man complaining of being drugged and attempted to be robbed at my house at the end of January—all the time I have been in the house I have never had a complaint till Mackay made it—I know that he took some tickets for this benefit; I don't know how many, or the price—Furze was no acquaintance of mine; I knew him from coming to the house, for a month I should think—I knew nothing about his antecedents till I was told by Detective Cowley, and I then forbade him the house and he has not been since; that was after this—I don't know where he is—my brother was there that night; he is not here—I believe he was conducting the room upstairs for the man that had the benefit—he was downstairs at the time this happened—Jane Harrison was not there that I know of—there were one or two women there that Mackay used to write to and treat; they were his friends, not mine—Turk was not there at 10.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have never been charged with any act of dishonesty except that twelve years ago—I have held the license of this house since 15th December, 1874—I gave the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill to Mackay to get cashed for me because he said it was the broker's business to pay the money down on the night of the exchange—I have never received any of that; I have had to pay it in hard cash.</p>

I must have heard it—next morning, Tuesday, I was in the Halifax Arms at 11 o'clock, when Davis was there, behind the bar—Mackay came in; he called for some ale, and after he had drunk it he said "Now, you <hi rend="italic">sods</hi>, I am going to <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> a ticket-of-leave man, and if that don't settle the license of the b----Halifax Arms I will do it by fair means or four—he did not charge Davis with anything that morning—he then left the house—I have never passed by the name of Beverley; they called me Beverley because they knew my wife in that name; that was her maiden name, and she is a professional singer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That is the letter that Mackay brought himself, or else it was brought by his daughter—he called upon me when he came out of prison and begged of me to withdraw from this charge—he came out on a Saturday, I think—he was kept in prison till he found bail, and after he obtained bail he came to me with his wife—I think the letter was written the day before he came, but I won't be positive—I am sure the letter was written before I had an interview with him—his wife came first and sent him the next day or the same day—I did not have any conversation with him about that letter, or with anyone on his behalf—the letter stated "I hereby withdraw from both my actions against you two, and I further undertake to agree never to proceed with them against you in any circumstances whatever"—there was no arrangement that if he withdrew from the action that I was not to go on with the perjury—the summons for perjury had been taken out before the letter was written—he came to me and asked me to withdraw the summons—that was the same day or the next day after the letter was written—the letter was brought to me for me to take to the brewer to show them, to try and induce them to intercede with Davis to get him to give up the prosecution for perjury—I read the letter; it was in an envelope, but not closed—he brought the letter and gave it to me—I know now that he came with the letter—I did not go to Mr. Davis; I did not promise to go—his wife came on the same day that he brought the letter; she came in the morning and he came in the after noon—I was disgusted with him and her too, and I took no notice—I said that her husband was a very bad man and I would not intercede, if he wanted to see me he had better come, and he brought this letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Stephen Evan, of Knightrider Street, and Mr. J. Winterbotham is one of the partners—I have charge of a portion of the mantle department—I sit by myself at a desk at one end of a room and can see part of the other end of the room, but there is a pile of cloth up to the ceiling which prevents my seeing part of the other end—on 27th May, about 10 o'clock, I saw Stiles come into the room—the <hi rend="italic">employes</hi> of the establishment pass through that room to go to an urinal—Stiles was in the habit of coming there two or three times a week—he was in the service of Mrs. Andre who does business with the firm, and he brought things from her—he would know the premises pretty well—I saw him again about 1 o'clock, and he went to the other side of the pile of cloth—I then went there and saw him going into the urinal and close the door—I did not miss any mantles then—I went back to my place, sat down, and heard the urinal door open; I then heard paper rustling and went to look, and saw him passing into the urinal again—I went back to my seat, remained three minutes, and when he came out I noticed that he was rather bulky and that he had a bundle under his coat on the left side—I then searched and missed thirteen mantles from a parcel of twenty-one—they were about 2 yards from the urinal door—thirteen mantles would not make a greater bulk than would go under his coat; they were very thin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was near Brooks' what on the morn<lb/>ing of 12th May—a little before 6 o'clock I saw Rogers go along Thames Street down to the wharf—he stopped and spoke to the watchman, and I saw the watchman do something to his trowsers—I waited at the top of the wharf about five minutes when I saw the three prisoners, the watchman Baker, and the other watchman who was left in charge of the barges, come up together, to the King's Head and Lamb public-house where they stayed some little time—Baker came out first and went down on the wharf—the three prisoners and the other watchman came out about a minute after<lb/>wards—the three prisoners started towards Southwark Bridge—as soon as I saw that I crossed over the road to face them—Alford turned directly and ran down Brooks' wharf, Frostick crossed the road and Rogers proceeded on his way towards Southwark Bridge as fast as he could walk—I walked back and found Alford had run right down the wharf—I then followed Frostick up on to Southwark Bridge—as soon as he got there he ran across the road to. Rogers, who was on the bridge—as soon as they saw me Rogers began to swear about the other one staying behind and walked towards Thames Street again—I crossed in front of him—Rogers said "Good morning, sir," to me—I said "Good morning, I want to speak to you for a minute"—he said "I can't stop now" and he commenced to run—I said "You must stop."—he said "I shan't," and away he went as hard as he could run on to the bridge again—I followed him and he doubled back under my arms into Thames Street—he dodged me about in Thames Street till he got to Queenhithe where I overtook him—I caught him by the collar—we had a bit of a scuffle—two scavengers came to my assistance or I think he would have got away—he had a packet of a dozen gloves in his hand which he was about to throw away, but he did not—I took him to the station with the assistance of the scavengers, searched him and found another dozen—I asked him if he had got any more—he said that he had, and pulled out ten pairs and said that was all he had got—I found two pairs more on him, and three bottles of eau-de-cologne—I then went back to Brooks' wharf and saw Alford going along. Thames Street—I went after him and stopped him—I asked him if he had any gloves about him—he said "No"—I put my hand into his pocket and took out a pocket-book, and from his inside pocket a canvass bag—I took him to the station and searched him, but found nothing—I told him I knew he had had some gloves because I saw them in his pocket when he came up from Brooks' Wharf on the first occasion—I don't think he said anything to that—he might have said that I was mistaken, but I won't be positive—I searched the barge <hi rend="italic">London</hi> and afterwards the <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi>, in the cabin of the <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi>, under the floor in the water I found three dozen black kid gloves, and on a ledge just above three bottles of eau-de-cologns—I took them to the station, and Alford was asked whether he knew any<lb/>thing about them—he said that he did not—he gave his address to the inspector—I went there and found four packets of Berlin wool, twenty pairs of cotton gloves, and about 9 lbs. of composite candles—I took that property to the police-station and asked Alford how he accounted for the things being</p>

I was not in uniform—Rogers lives in George Row, Bermondsey—he could go there from the wharf over South-wark Bridge, but I don't know whether it would be the nearest way—it was quite light at the time I saw him—I believe I have mentioned before to-day about seeing Baker, the watchman, come up the wharf—I heard Baker give his evidence to-day—I know Messrs. Wrightson's offices—they are opposite Billingsgate Market—I don't know what time they open—they are wharfingers, and those are the offices—I saw Rogers come up the wharf and go into the public-house with the others, but I had seen him before that—when they came out of the public-house Rogers walked as quickly as he could towards the bridge—I followed Frostick, and when I got on the bridge I saw, Rogers apparently waiting for him—Rogers called out to him that Alford had gone back to the wharf—I heard him say that—I did not say a word to Rogers about my being a police officer until the scavenger came to my assistance—at the station he pulled from his pocket the ten pairs of gloves, and I put my hand in and found the two pairs—I went to his house to make a search, but I found that Frostick had been there before me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at Woodford with my parents—I am the prisoner's wife, we have been married eight years last March—I separated from him in March, 1874, and have lived; separate from him since then—On 25th March this year I was living at 156 Fulham Road, carrying on business in the millnery and drapery line between March, 1874, and 25th March, 1875, I had seen him twice; the last time was about nine months before this happened between 2 and 3 o'clock; on 25th I was in my shop with my child and my sister Maude Bruce; when the prisoner came in—he said "You did not expect to see me"—I said "No, neither did I want to see you" he said "I wanted to see you I want to ask you some questions"—I said-" You have no right to ask me any questions, and 1 don't think proper to answer them; you don't keep me nor your children, and this is my father's house and you had better walk out"-my little girl, who is 3 years old, looked up then and said Papa, my papa, come home"—he said he should have a private interview. with me—I then walked through the work-room into the parlour at the back; he followed me and my sister also, I called my sister—when we got into this, parlour, he pushed my sister back and would have locked the door; he attempted to, but the key happened to be out—he looked at the door; his countenance then changed terribly, and I flew to the private door and screamed murder—the private door opens into a kind of yard leading into the street—the door he attempted to lock was the door leading from the shop—before I could open the door leading into the yard he caught hold of me and said</p>

               <p>"Now I have got you I will cut your throat, you," calling me a bad name—my back was towards the yard door—he put his left arm round my shoulder and drew a ready opened knife out of his breast pocket, out of his pocket on the left side—I don't know whether it was the pocket of his coat or his waistcoat—I am quite sure the knife was open when he drew it from his pocket—he drew it like that (<hi rend="italic">across the throat</hi>)—I put my hands up and my face down and my hands were very badly cut, and it cut my face; I have the scar now—he did not make any observation at the time—he raised his arm again and stabbed me over the right shoulder in the back—he then stabbed me in the left thigh, at the side—he did not say anything at the time he was doing this; I was trying to slip down out of his arms—I can't remember whether he did anything else to me; I heard some one come in then and he let go of me—I was bleeding very much and was faint—I was calling out murder while this was being done—it lasted a very few minutes—when he let go of me I crawled into the shop—several persons came to the door, my sister was one of them—the policeman and the doctor came almost immediately—I did not see what became of the prisoner—I remained at home for a fortnight attended by Dr. Godrich, and then the place on my back became very bad and I was taken to the hospital, where I remained a fortnight and three days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 140, Fulham Road—on Thursday afternoon, 25th March, about 3 o'clock, I was called to 146, Fulham Road and saw Mrs. Owen standing in the parlour behind the shop—blood was pouring from her mouth, from her hands and from underneath her clothes I had her at once laid down on the sofa and asked who had done it—the prisoner was then brought to my side by the constable—I asked if that was her husband—she said "Yes"—the knife was ultimately handed to me by the prisoner and I handed it to the constable—I examined it at the station, it was stained with something, I could not swear that it was blood—after laying Mrs. Owen on the sofa I cut the clothes off to examine the wounds there was a wound about 2 inches long extending from the left angle of the mouth, outwards across the cheek, and about one-eight of an inch deep—between the finger and thumb of the right hand there was an incised wound extending to the bone; there was also a slighter incised wound on the fore<lb/>finger of the same hand and also a small incised wound on the little finger of the same hand—on the inner side of the left hand there was a piece sliced off consisting of skin and some flesh, about 2 inches long and merely hang<lb/>ing by the skin—beneath the right shoulder blade there was a punctured wound extending to the ribs; that was about three-quarters of an inch deep, it was stopped by the rib no doubt, it was direct in as straight as could be—I should say that was a wound that must have been inflicted with some violence, it had gone through all the clothes in addition to the flesh; it was in a highly dangerous locality; if it had passed between the ribs it would have been a very serious matter indeed, it would have gone near the pleura and the lungs—there was also a punctured wound on the middle of the left thigh; that went very nearly straight in; as far as I could judge that was about 2 inches deep—I had no probe—there was a corresponding cut in the clothes—this knife is just the sort of instrument that would have pro<lb/>duced such wounds—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood, there was a considerable quantity of blood about the place and she was very faint—I took immediate steps to stop the blood; she remained under my care about a fortnight—during the latter portion of that time she had excessive pain in the groin—I examined it and found evidence of a bruise; a fall or kick would have done that—she was ultimately taken to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the stab in the back had not been arrested by the rib it might have penetrated the lung, which would have been very serious—the wounds were not dangerous in themselves, they might have led to danger—I have seen her to-day; she is in a debilitated and very nervous state, she has recovered from the wounds and is able to go about her usual occupation, she is somewhat disfigured in the face.</p>

I am a carpenter of 38, Sandford Street, Marylebone—on 26th April I went to the Zetland Arms with the deceased John Damereh and Harvey—I had only known the deceased two or three months, we had been working on the same job—he "was a countryman and I believe he came from Devonshire—Harvey was not a friend of mine, only a workmate—the deceased was older than—me, he was 5 feet 8 inches high the prisoner was in the same compartment of the public-house with us three—there was such a scramble that I cannot say what occured I heard the prisoner call us a Devonshire lot—there was a bit of a scuffle between two or three of us—I was sober—the deceased struck the-prisoner on the eye and it was bleeding—a policeman was fetched, and we were turned out of the house—I did not see what occurred outside—ten minutes afterwards I saw the deceased lying in the road and assisted, to take him to the hospital—I did not see him before, because I was getting into some unfinished buildings.</p>

About 1.30 on this morning I was in Paradise Street and heard cries of "Police "I went to No. 24 and saw the deceased looking out at the window—she said "He has set fire to me"—I said "Open the door"—I remained there ten minutes, and then Mr. Woodrough opened the parlour window and asked me if I wanted to come in—I said "Yes," and he opened the street door—the deceased was scream<lb/>ing while I was waiting for admission, as if, in distress—I went up to the prisoner's room, the first floor-front; it was not locked—I turned the handle and saw the deceased sitting on the side of the bed quite naked, and the prisoner sitting in a chair by the side of the fire, smoking—the deceased showed me her side which was-very badly burnt, and I sent another con<lb/>stable for a doctor—I asked her how it was done—she said-" He struck a match and set light to me"—the prisoner said "It was a fusee, I threw it at her"—I covered her up with a quilt and a doctor came and-ordered her re<lb/>moval to a hospital—I found burning clothing on the floor of the room—I extinguished the fire—the clothing was 4 or 5 feet from her, between-" her and the deceased—she had evidently been drinking and-smelt of it, and she was very much burnt; she appeared to be in very great pain, but the pri<lb/>soner never made any attempt while I was there to assist her in her distress—when the doctor came she said" What are you going to do with him?"—I said "We are going to lock him up-"—she said. "Don't do it we were larking"—the prisoner was the worse of the two as to drink—I took him to the station and came back and searched the room—I found a box of matches, not fusees, on the mantle shelf and this brass candlestick under the grate, broken as it is now—there was a quantity of candle fat on it and likewise on the stove; there was a fire in the grate.</p>

               <p>comfortable manner—his wife was on the bed, about 7 yards from him; she said that he had set fire to her by throwing a match at her—afterwards he said that it was not a match; it was a fusee—water had been thrown on her before I arrived, and the constable was taking the burning things off her, and he took off part of the cover of the bed and threw it over her, and then the other articles of clothing were rolled together to put them out—none of the bed linen was burnt—the deceased had very few clothes on, and what she had was burning—she had on a chemise; I am not certain whether she had a bed gown—I found that her left side was very much burnt indeed, and the doctor ordered her removal to the hospital—she was crying very much and speaking in a very excited manner—I said to the prisoner "You will be charged with setting fire to your wife and causing her grievous bodily harm"—he said "Oh, she is not burnt much; just look here where I have been burnt," showing an old scar on his arm—she said "Oh, don't take him away, he could not help it"—he walked downstairs very well; he had been drinking, but was far from being drunk—he went to the station, and after the charge was read over he said "Well, if I did do it was not intentional"—his hands were perfectly clean; there was no sign of his having attempted to extinguish the fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a mark on his arm; I can't say if it was a burn—I did not swear at the Police Court that it was a burn; I swore that the prisoner told me had got a bum on his arm—I said that it was scar; but it had the appearance of a burn—the prisoner took off such of the deceased's clothes as he could get off; part of her chemise and night gown—I do not remember anything else—she was not sitting on the bed, but I saw her sitting there afterwards, very nearly naked—she had got her things on when I went in, and the constable was tearing them off—she said "Don't take him away"—she did not then say that they were larking"; she did after wards, but she said a great deal before she said that—she said two or three times that he threw a match at her and set fire to her, and when she found that we were going to take her husband she begged us not to do it—I saw no matches in the room; I was there when it was searched—I did not hear it stated at the Police Court about matches being found—I saw the deceased put into the cab by Policeman 207—the prisoner did not carry her through the passage to the cab; he was up in his room—he followed her down; he went down quietly before me and I stayed up in his room he went down directly after she was carried down—I did not go downstairs while she went down—she was just at the door of the cab and I was at the bottom of the stairs when she was being put in—I did not see the prisoner carry her and put her in, but he might have carried her along the passage before I arrived.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Middlesex Hospital on the morning of 18th April, about 11 o'clock, I examined Mrs. Cole there—she was excessively burnt on the left side of the chest and abdomen, and on both hands—she had been attended to before I saw her—I continued, to attend her till her death, which took place on 30th April—I did not think her in danger at first and she continued to progress satisfactorily, but a change took place half an hour before her death—the unfavourable sign was difficulty of breathing, she was obliged to sit up in bed, and there was a cold clammy sweat, that is collapse—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was failure of the heart, taken in conjunction with the shock of the burns—the heart was healthy to the naked eye, but micro scopically there was fatty, degeneration—the lungs and the upper part of the intestines were congested, which I attribute to the burns—it extended-over the whole lung.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 3, Grafton—Street, Fitzroy Square, and was there in 1873—I am a dressmaker, and occupy the two parlours—in December, 1872, the prisoner came and took a room in my house—the whole house is mine—he had another man with him—I never knew his name properly; I think he was called Brunneau on his trial—he acted as interpreter to the prisoner, who did not speak English—they took the first floor back room, which they occupied, sometimes together, and sometimes one, and then the other—they said it was merely to write their letters and receive them—they came pretty nearly every day, one or both of them—I did not know where they lived—they gave the name of Blumberg, and a small plate was put on the door "M. Blumberg &amp; Co."—a quantity of goods came there in large cases by railway vans, sometimes everyday and sometimes not a thing—the prisoner said his name was Blumberg, and the cases were addressed to "Blumberg &amp; Co.,"—they would take them in themselves if at home—if not I took them in or somebody else, and delivered to them—sometimes the cases were too large or to heavy to come in, and they unpacked them outside—when I was near I could see the contents,</p>

               <p>generally marble clock cases, perfumes and different things—the things when unpacked were taken upstairs, and they were frequently having carts taking them away—I don't remember their being taken away before being unpacked.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Stratford, of 10, Belvedere Crescent, Lambeth—in March, 1873, the prisoner came to hire a room of me—he introduced himself as "Blumberg &amp; Co." and gave me a card—I have not got it—I gave it to a man I employed to put some shelves up, to find them by it—I asked for the card again, but I could not get it—the prisoner had another man with him, when he came, Brunneau, who was tried last year and sentenced (<hi rend="italic">See Vol.</hi> 79, <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 360)—they took the front kitchen, which they used as a sort of warehouse and paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—they had it until the October, of the same year, 1873—the prisoner always paid the rent—"Roberta" was the name I knew him by—cases came frequently, say every week or two, clocks and vases—they were taken away regularly by the prisoner, sometimes in cabs—I bought a clock of him when he was leaving, which I paid for by instalments, and he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>,) dated 27th September, 1873—he signed it in my presence—I saw him write all the bottom part of it—he only wrote the signature in those two receipts—he wrote "<hi rend="italic">Received</hi>" I saw him write.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor for the prosecution and solicitor to the Banker's Association—I was first made acquainted with any difficulty with reference to this branch, on Saturday 24th April—I went first to the London and County Bank, Lombard Street—shortly after I arrived Maturin was introduced into the manager's room at Lombard Street where I was sitting—Mr. McKewan said to him "That is Mr. Mullens the solicitor to the bank, we have requested him to make all possible inquiry into this matter"—I said to Mr. McKewan "I think the most convenient thing for me will be to go up to Henrietta Street with Maturin"—we left together, and after call<lb/>ing at my office, we went to Henrietta Street—I did not take any docu<lb/>ments with me—I had not been made acquainted with the case then, only that there was something for me to look carefully. into—when I got to Henrietta Street I was shown into Mr. Livermore, the manager's room, and he gave me a certain detail of the matter as far as it had trans<lb/>pired—Maturin was not present then—I saw Mr. South and took a state<lb/>ment from him and also from Mr. Lawrence, and then Maturin came in—I asked him to tell me how the cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. came into his hands along with the credit slip in Brown's writing—I took down this statement in writing and afterwards read it over to him, and he said it was correct; "Baylis gave me the envelope, between 11 and 12 o'clock. I opened it, read it, and threw it on my desk; contents, a memorandum, tore this up, credit him the cheque; went on with my, work. About a quarter to 1 o'clock went out to dinner after clearing up my desk, then seeing the credit I handed it over to the cashier, Mr. Lawrence, saying 'Will you, credit this to Brown, as he has got a bill or cheque' "(he said he did know which it was) "to meet; I did not examine it; I saw it was a, cheque and that is all. A little after 2 o'clock. I returned From dinner; Mr. Livermore spoke to me about where I got credit from; told him as above. I saw Brown, on the afternoon of 22nd April, he is a tailor in the Strand; he said "My acceptance has been returned again, and I have given a cheque for it. I will send up the first thing in the morning and again in the afternoon, before you close." I understand him to mean he would pay in money that morn<lb/>ing, and afterwards I was to mention it for him as he. would not like the cheque to go back. I did not see him yesterday. I did not go to him yesterday, or to-day; he has not written to me or 1 to him"—Mr. Liver<lb/>wure gave me the fragments of the memorandum which has been produced,</p>

Paddington, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Dublin 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the one that was improperly credited; Glasgow 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was improperly credited—Leeds 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then there is the 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which is being investigated now—I made the list 633<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—then there was a deduc<lb/>tion for the small balance there was on his account on 23rd April and I made the net amount 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Brown owes the bank that amount; he admitted that to be correct—he gave me a statement in writing of the way in which it came about; I have that statement here; it was made in consequence of a communication I had with Mr. Moss after he was committed for trial Mr. Moss sent me a paper signed by Brown and attested by Mr. Moss—I have had communications with Mr. Moss continually—he told me that Brown believed he was borrowing money from Maturin—he said that Maturin had represented himself to him as a man of considerable property</p>

I had a warehouse at 1, Bull and Mouth Street, where I carried on the business of a silk agent or merchant—I have since removed to 13, Worship Street—I was in Bull and Mouth Street for about two years—I was for a in England—I had my brother Adolphe as a partner in Bull and Mouth Street—I have known Painter about the City for about eight years, and have had business transactions with him for about two or</p>

               <p>three years—he carried on business as a tie manufacturer at 6,—Falcon Street, City, and required materials for his business, wholesale-in the beginning of the present year he owed my firm about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that knowledge is independent of my books—the debt was partly to my firm, and partly to the people I represent abroad, Messrs. Krabner &amp; Gobbers, and another firm—I cannot say exactly what the personal debt owing to me by Painter was—we were security for what was due to our manufacturers-taking all and deducting only from the amount that which was owing to our principals abroad, for which we had no liability, there was about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to us, partly for cash and partly for goods, unsecured—I heard of Powell's failure January last—he owed some money to Painter, and about this' time application was made to me by Painter for further transactions to send him in some goods to the extent of about 1,000t., I think—I said I couldn't do so until I saw how he stood, and then I asked whether he would give me a statement, which he had formerly promised: to let me have; a balance-sheet—it was just after Powell's failure that he promised me a balance-sheet—I said "Would you object to an accountant going through your books"—he said." Oh no, not at all"—I said "I will bring round Mr. Boyes"—he said "Yes, all right"—he made no objection to Mr. Boyes' name when I first mentioned it and I said I would go the next day and Mr. Boyes and I went the next day accordingly to 6, Falcon Street and saw Painter—Mr. Boyes first came to our place and then Mr. Painter was called over and we went together to Falcon Street-l, Bull and Month, Street is very near Falcon Street—I said "Now, Mr. Painter, here is Mr; Boyes, if you will let him look-through the books"—he said "I don't see why I should disclose my books to people, I am perfectly solvent if your like I will go through the books and make out a statement with your brother"—I said "All right, I am satisfied with that," upon which Mr. Boyes and myself withdrew and came away—this took place about the end of January—I-saw. Painter once or twice before I received this document in German (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went over some days afterwards and found Painter; and my brother in a small private room making out this statement—Painter was looking over the-books and had a ship of paper—nothing particular took place then, I simply wanted to speak to my brother—two or three days afterwards he brought me the paper and I think the day after Painter came over—between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening when I was writing my letters I took the statement from my drawer and I said "Now, Mr. Painter, is this statement right?"—he said. "I wish I could read German"—I said "I will translate it for you, "and I translated it for line—on the debit side there is "To credit, 6,891<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., losses: and failures, 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" <hi rend="italic">and</hi> there is a balance of 1099<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to square the account—then on the credit side (the assets side) "To goods, 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; outstanding account, 3,990<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; cash in hand; 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; per bills, 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; fixtures and working tools, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., house property 1,000, making a total of 10,191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the balance to the credit side is 1,099<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said "Now, is this right? I am going to send this to my manufacturers"—he said "Yes, that is per<lb/>fectly right" then he tasked me about the goods—he came next morning and looked some out and asked me. to send them in and I sent them in at different times when he sent over—there is a memorandum book, which I have not got here, but I-have the receipt book which shows that he received the goods, from which I shall be able to give you what he did receive and the dates—Davis is his man, a porter—when the porter came to fetch the goods</p>

               <p>he signed that—there are nine receipts here commencing 11th February upon some of them are the initials of Painter himself—I sent in a memo<lb/>randum of the goods as well, and also invoices or statements for goods which Callenburg delivered—I don't remember any particular occasion on which I saw Painter, between the 11th and 18th, when these goods were sent in—I might have seen him several times—the statement which I received induced me to part with the goods—by the statement I knew he was solvent, and that is all I wanted to get at; without that statement I should never have parted with the goods—about 2nd March, I received a notice of liquidation; up to which time I had no idea that my brother Adolph, had become a partner of Painter's—I subsequently on the 22nd March, attended the first meeting of creditors, and a further meeting on 6th April—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Painter's writing—I first saw it yesterday week, when my mother showed it to me on my return from the country—it is addressed to my brother Adolph, who is here—I never received any letters from Painter, between 1st February, and the time of his committal for trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know that my brother was a partner of Painter's until I received the notice of liquidation—I bad dealt with Painter for two or three years—he called himself "A, A. Painter &amp; Co." the "Co." was put on—there was never any other partner I was told—I knew there was a company about four weeks before I received hat statement—when I went with Boyes I heard that Trouquet was a partner—he was mentioned as a partner in the notice of liquidation, so there were Painter, Adolph Berliner &amp; Trouquet—the firm is "Berliner Bros."—it consists of myself only at present—Adolph does not belong to it now—I was carrying on business at 1, Bull &amp; Mouth. Street, and Callenburg was in my employ as a sort of helpmate; he was a school friend of mine who assisted me in my business—I did not pay him—he did little things in the business, sometimes wrote letters, sometimes entering goods, and sometimes sent goods out—he came over to learn the English language, and was glad to assist me voluntarily, and make himself generally useful—he kept books in English as well—I subsequently went to 24, Castle Street, and still carried on business at Bull and Mouth Street—Callenburg went to Castle Street—I had not much stock there, and it belonged to my manufacturers, not to me—I went as Callenburg's assistant—the business was hosiery and gloves—the. business of general agent means hosiery and gloves, and any other things as well, and cigars when we get agencies for them—I carried on business as a general agent in Bull and Month Street—Callenburg was not acting as a general agent when I was there—he was when I was in Castle Street; he did not take to Castle Street the whole of the business I had at Bull and Mouth Street—he did not take the silk agency—I earned that on at 13, Worship Street, which was my private residence; he did all the rest—I was living with my parents at Worship Street, but I did not give up Bull and Mouth Street then—I kept it on to answer my letters, and received people who did not know that I was at Worship Street—I am not in liquidation—I have not called a meeting of my creditors—I have not been served with a demand in bankruptcy—when I assisted Callenburg at Castle Street, he received the monies and sent them to the manufacturers, and he paid the expenses—I transferred all that business to him because I was in such a state I could not attend to those agencies properly, and so I asked the</p>

               <p>manufacturers to give the agencies to Callcnburg—there were no liabilities attached to it—Callenburg did not pay me anything for doing this—the place in Castle Street is still open—I believe Callenburg is here as a witness—I still assist him—I am not in Bull and Mouth Street now—I have a book showing my ledger account against Painter, but I have not brought it here—I can send for it—the cash included in the amount due from Painter was something like 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which my brother gave him, and which I did not know of till afterwards—he owed me in January about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides what he owed to my. manufacturers—I knew that 'at the end of January no interest was charged' for 'that money—I asked my brother for an explanation, and to my great surprise when I found the money was gone I understood it had gone to Painter—I believe Powell's failure was for something like 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know; I under<lb/>stood from Painter that he expected to have something like 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, but afterwards ho told me more—I believe he told Mr. Boyes at the time that Powell's failure was for something like 16;000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the amount for which Powell failed to Painter—it was not so much as 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the manufacturers seized the goods at Bull and Mouth Street during the time of our changing places—they had been left there as security, and I charged them at the Police Court, in consequence—the document in German, which has been produced is in my brother's writing—I suppose he wrote it in German, intending that I should send it over to the manufac<lb/>turers, but I did not do so—I simply sent a statement of the balance; the result of it—I translated it to the prisoner—I spoke to my brother about it, and he said he was satisfied with the prisoner's position—I did not blame my brother for this at the Police Court—I did not call him, for I did not know where he was—Mr. Painter was keeping him out of the way at that time—he came in when the case came on, but afterwards could be found nowhere—he was placed before me—he was sitting before me on purpose to get me excited at the time—it was the first time I had Been him since Mr. Painter had sent him to the country—they brought my brother there on Painter's side, as if going to swear falsely to excite me—they were show<lb/>ing him the sheets, and doing everything to excite me—I do not accuse him of this—anybody can well see that he has been deceived also by this man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the time my brother was at the Courts I heard Mr. Straight say he would call my brother to contradict me, that was the cause of exciting me; they never called him—with regard to the goods which were seized at Bull and Mouth Street, one of my chief manufacturers who was also in this case with Painter's creditors had come over, and to aid him in meeting some bills it was arranged that certain" goods should be left there as security—he also promised to give a paper in writing, that when those bills became due he would meet them—instead of that he came the next day, and took away the goods—of course I didn't want that, they brought up a lot of men and took the goods out—they didn't succeed in getting them all, and what were left I gave to my father as security—the summons at the Police Court was for improperly obtaining the goods—it would amount to that—the goods were taken away with great violence—I was knocked back in my room and my arm was injured—my father's liability on the bills was about 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—'the amount of the goods he took as security taken altogether would be about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth was left—he received no consideration for having incurred that liability—Powell's matter was mentioned before Mr. Boyes—it is included in the statement of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050072"/>
               <p>the amount of losses—that was a question I asked Painter at the time—I said "What are these losses for?' and he said "These losses include Powell and everything"—that was when I translated that item of losses 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "There will still be something more coming out of that"—that there was still something to recover to diminish that loss—I represented several foreign firms—the reason why I could not attend to the business of these foreign firms was on account of Painter's affairs which have brought me very heavy losses—there was a regular babble about it, and my credit became bad though there are some people who would give me goods to any amount—I had supplied Painter very recently with 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—Callenburg taking the business at Castle Street, was simply to protect my manufacturers—the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was taken out of the assets of my business and given to Painter was since Christmas.</p>

I am going on for twenty-two years of age—I have known Painter, since the end of 1868—I was partner with my brother Jacob Berliner in business at 1, Bull and Mouth Street, and there have been transactions between Painter and my brother in the present year—the account between them was at one time closed for three or four months—I remember hearing of Powell's failure—I went to see Painter as soon as I heard of it—he was not in, but I waited till he came, and I said I was very sorry to hear he had met with such a heavy loss, and asked him if it would effect him to such an extent as that he would have to pull up—he said "No"—I believe the account was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that there still remained in his business a surplus of about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we (Berliner Brothers) had delivered some goods which had been on order before that time, I do not remember his saying anything with reference to goods not then delivered—I went to his place for the purpose of making up a balance-sheet about the end of January—I was in and out constantly—I had not then entered into an agreement with him for a partnership—in making out this paper in the German, Mr. Painter gave me the figures—he could not write German and I wrote it for him—I went to his counting-house one afternoon, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I think it was about the end of January, I don't know exactly the day—I was there about an hour and I went again—I think it took us about three hours altogether—in giving the amounts of the outstanding accounts he took the ledger and gave them to me and I put them on paper—I took from him the figures he called out, and I gave him the figures to see if they were right—that was only done with outstanding accounts—the losses 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. included the bill which he had accepted to accommodate Powell-Painter said so—I believed he had a balance of 1,099<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or I should not have been his partner—he told me he had plenty of money to carry on the business and I said "If you can give me a balance-sheet to show that, I shall have no objection to join you," and accordingly when I got this balance-sheet I did—my becoming a partner was to be kept secret from everybody, because Painter suggested that it might injure us with the Tie people if they knew it, and I said "Yes, and moreover with other people, because they might have influence over other people in other trades"—the statement was given by me to my brother—I was not present afterwards when figures were dis<lb/>cussed between Painter and my brother—I continued with Painter up to the time of the liquidation proceedings on 3rd March, when he petitioned,</p>

               <p>although I never got a Sixpence by the business—after that I was very ill and thought the worry had been too much for me—my, head was a state of confusion, and I went to Nottingham—I was in in Nottinghamshire till about the commencement of April—Painter knew where I was and I had letters from him—I was subpoenaed by the defence when my brother was prosecuting Painter at the Police Court—I wanted to be called, but they would not call me—I saw Painter at his house at Hawley in Sussexs after the committal, when this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given, to me—it was on the 29th May on a Saturday afternoon about 5 or 6 o'clock—I went to fetch him from Hawley Station and he said he had hit upon a plan which would do a great deal towards getting him out of this mess—I asked him what it was—he said "Well, look here, I have written this letter to you and you must give me an answer to it; we must not be particular what we do now; I must get out of this mess somehow"—I said "Read the letter to me"—he read it and I asked him for the letter—he said "Here you are, put it in your trowsers pocket so that it may look a little shabby as if it were written in February"—I said "Very well"—up to that time I had received no letter from him in this form—he had not told me nor had I told him that there was a deficiency of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of a surplus of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not true that I prepared the balance sheet and that he had nothing to do with it—he took the liabilities himself from the ledger—he said if I were asked the question who took the stock from me I was to Bay it was Altree, a salesman in the employ of Painter, that was at the same interview—it was Painter who gave me the amount of stock—I never replied to that letter—I told him I would not reply to it—the Monday following my receiving the letter I communicated with my father and brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The letter was given to me when I was coming from Hawley Station with Painter, to Home—I was stopping at his house, I could not stop anywhere else—I stopped there till the Monday morning following—I think I paid dearly for it; I had been there about a week before he gave me the letter—I don't know when he took the house—he was" there in December and I went down then, and in January I stopped three <hi rend="italic">or Soar</hi> days I believe; I stopped there at "other times; I went down just before I got the statement upon which I became a partner—I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> it but I didn't <hi rend="italic">make</hi> it and I became a partner after it was written—there was an agreement between us; I have not got it; Mr. Painter, I daresay, has it; I don't know what he has done with it; I never had it—a solicitor named Barron. prepared the agreement—we went to him—it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> dated 1st February, but I didn't sign it till' three or four days after—it was spoken of in January, and I know it was dated forward two or three days—I would not consent to, sign it until I had seen the balance-sheet—it is not true that I went through, the books, I had not time to check myself—I didn't state that to Mason, I swear—I did not say "With reference to the item 'By stock,' 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I considered that that was the value of the stock at the time, but I now believe I over estimated it"—Painter gave me the figures—I didn't know who estimated it—those figures are my writing—I did not go through the books; I only wrote down what Painter dictated—I had known Painter for so many years that I did not have any suspicion; I toot his word for it; I had known him from the time he was a boy—I knew my brother had refused to send the goods to Painter until he had seen a statement—I knew a balance-sheet was to be made out—I left it entirely to Painter; I did not check it in any way; I swear I did not look to see whether there was stock—I might have said to</p>

               <p>Mr. Mason that I considered that that was the value of the stock at the time, but now I believe I over estimated it, but if I did it was wrong—I did not estimate the stock; I don't recollect ever Baying that I did—I wont to Mr. Baggs' office with Mr. Mason to look at the books—I did not say in Mr. Baggs' office to Mr. Mason, that I had estimated the stock and I believed now I had over estimated it—I don't know whether my statement there was taken down in writing word for word from my lips—there were two or three people writing—there was an English statement made besides the one in German—I swear I did not go and offer evidence to Mr. Mason—I was living at Rich<lb/>mondat that time—I have been living at two or three places since then and have visited Mr. Painter two or three times—I never went to Bull and Mouth Street and I did not <hi rend="italic">go to</hi> Castle Street or Worship Street—I was still a partner with my brother according to law—I never went to my brother or any of them from the time my brother made the accusation against Mr. Painter until I was brought to the Police Court—I wont to Mr. Baggs' office with Mr. Mason—Mr. Painter always knew where I was—he went with me to Mr. Mason; he took me—I was then living at Mr. Trouquet's—they subpecnaed me to the Police Court—I had made no statement before I went to the Police Court on the first hearing—I don't recollect what my brother said at the Police Court—I went to Mr. Baggs' office very often to see how the matter of liquidation was going on because I wanted my dis<lb/>charge to go abroad—I did not go to my brother when I went away—I have never spoken a word to him since the 3rd March—after I left the prisoner's house on the 31st May I went to my god-father, who is a retired gentleman living at Highgate, Mr. Neugas, 103 or 105, Junction Road—I don't know which, the odd numbers are on one side and the even on the other—I only stopped there till the evening and then he went with me to my parents in Worship Street—my brother lives there as well, and I lived there with my parents—I did not talk the matter over with him—I never speak a word to him except when I go down in the breakfast-room; I say "Good-morning" and "Good evening" when we dine—I never speak a word, and I won't until I can pay him back some of that money that I owe him—that is my prin<lb/>ciple, because I think I have wronged him in not telling him of this part<lb/>nership—I never said anything different to what I have said now—the defence would not call me at the Police Court—I gave my father a letter to give to Mr. Ditton—I don't know what day that was—it was about 11 o'clock on the 31st that I left the prisoner's—it might have been Thursday or Friday that I wrote the letter; that was the only statement I ever made for the purposes of the prosecution—I never told Mr. Mason that I should go to Spain if the prisoner were committed—I said that as soon as the liquidation. was finished I should either go over to Spain or South America—it is tree that I lent some money, about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on bills and' cheques "without, my brother's knowledge; I told him sometime after—we received bills from various customers in payment, which money I lent to Painter, which he said he could: pay me back in a few days, because be could get the bills dis<lb/>counted with our name on; it was wrong on my part; my brother was away in the country and I could not ask him; I did not tell him directly he came back—if a man is away three weeks in a business like that, where thousands of pounds are turned over, there must be some allowance made for memory—I didn't know anything about the value of the fixtures—I did not tell Mr. Mason that I estimated the value of the fixtures and fittings and also the lease—I will tell you how they were estimated, Mr. Painter said "The</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was some woman by whom I had a child—that is what I referred to, and when I was on friendly terms with Painter I told him of it in strict confidence—that is the only thing they can show up against me—these are my figures, and my name on these papers which have been handed to me—the way I got those figures was this, Painter said at first "We can put the name of each man. down by the-side of the figure, so that we know who we owe the money to;"—and then he said after a hit, "Oh, it is inking such a long while always writing the name, only put down: the figures"—I did it in that way by the direction of Painter—there; are some references of figures as if they referred to a book—those arc my figures—I wanted to check them—they are the ledger folios—there is a sum of 6,891<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. made up in figures—I do not find any reference to the losses 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Painter gave me that off another sheet he had—the 3,390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. amount of monies owing to the firm of Painter &amp; Co., appears here (<hi rend="italic">pointing)—I</hi> made no other paper than this—and that I wrote—Painter knew where I was, and corresponded with me up to the time of going to the Police Court—I did not go near Bull and Mouth Street after the 3rd March—I know nothing about the disturbance' on the taking away of the silk belonging to Gobbers &amp; Co—I have been by 1, Bull and Mouth Street, since the 3rd March, but never inside—I went to Worship Street once between the 3rd March and the 31st May (when I went with my godfather), to see my mother; when everybody else was out—I think it was in the commencement of May—I did not remain long—with regard to the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent Painter, he said he had payments-to make, and there were several large amounts coming due to him in a few days, and he could then give us the money—he never brought the money back—I was present at the first examination when Painter was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner with Alfred Cooper, at 5 and 7, Fenchurch-Street City, I have a mine in Devon for raising umber for colouring paper—I have recently added to that business that of a paper merchant, which latter business we have carried on for eight months or a year—I have known Algernon, about a year and two months—I knew them both at the same time—I had no-business relations with the firm of Bozzi, Dudley &amp; Co., Fish, Street Hill—I did know of such a firm-Granville Brothers, was the name I first knew—the elder prisoner afterwards joined in the name of Bozzi Dudley—Charles Granville and Stephen Granville, were the names in the. firm of Granville Brothers—I am not quite sure whether the younger prisoner had a share in the buisnesss, or whether he acted as clerk—he told me he was seventeen—we had some business rela<lb/>tions with Giranville Brothers, which were closed at the commencement of this year, January—they owed us money—when Granville Brothers ceased to exist we occasionally sent Algernon Granville to get orders for us—he was an ordinary clerk, and had been about three months in our service on the 29th April, he came to the office at 1 o'clock—10 o'clock would be the proper time—I asked what he meant by coming so late, and he said "I came very early, before you arrived, and went out to get orders, and I have taken a very good order, I have sold eighty-one reams of paper to Grimwade, on condition we let them have delivery to-day; I knew we had only got five reams of that quality in stock, so I have ordered the rest of Scott &amp; Anderson, and will send it in to day—I said I was very glad he had got the order, and it was entered in due course by myself—he knew previously that when we required it, paper could be procured from Scott &amp; Anderson, on our credit to supply our customers—we sent an invoice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050078"/>
               <p>to Grimwade—on the Thursday following, we had a communication from Grimwade—the invoice should be delivered as soon as we had the weights of the paper—we had not the weights on the same day, but the following Tuesday—we sent the invoice by post—Mr. Cooper posted the letter by particular request—that was the first statement sent in to Grimwade—on the Thursday night, 6th May, having received no reply to the invoice and letter we had sent, and the younger prisoner stopping away from business that day, our suspicions were aroused, and we went to Messrs. Grimwade, and resolved to go down to his lodgings, somewhere in Woolwich, to sec if we could find him, but Mr. Cooper found him by chance before that—I was outside Cannon Street Station, and Mr. Cooper went on to 26, Bridge Row, the address of Willis, Webb &amp; Co, and came out in company with Algernon—he left Mr. Cooper then, and "came with me up Walbrook, and I said "I want to know what you have done with our paper," he expressed surprise at first, and I said "You shall not leave me until I know where it is" after some hesitation he said that he would tell me the whole of the facts in connection with it—he said "You know about the 7th March, I brought an order purporting to be 'from Willis, Webb &amp; Co., for twenty two reanis-of paper which you supplied, and when the time approached, when the account was due, I brought you the money telling you it had been paid by Willis, Webb &amp; Co., in reality Willis, Webb de Co., had never had any paper, nor did they pay me that money. When I obtained the paper I gave it to my brother Charles, who sold it When the account was coming due I day after day entreated him to hand me the money to pay to you, but instead of giving it to me he only told me to get some more paper which he would sell, and give enough to pay this as I was afraid that to would find out the first affair I consented"—I said to him "But you didn't want 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of paper to pay a 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. account"—he said "But Charles said He Should have to sell it at such a sacrifice that we should want a lot to cover It, 1 so I got these eighty-one reams of paper and handed them to him. I told you I had sold it for three months credit, because within that time I could have paid you for it myself, and I hoped you would never be any the wiser for it"—I think that was the substance of the conversation—I asked where Charles Gran Ville Was, and he said be thought down at Putney—he told me the paper had been sold to Dinah Somers of Hounds ditch—Algernon had access to our forms—this (<hi rend="italic">marked C</hi>) is on one of one of our invoice forms—we had no idea such an invoice had 'gone out it is in Algernon's writing—we never had such a transaction as that with Bozzi; Dudley &amp; Co., and there is no entry of it in our books—this (<hi rend="italic">marked D</hi>) is Algernon's handwriting—he had no authority whatever from us to hare transactions with his brother Charles, and we were in utter ignorance of any such transaction the exhibit "G" is the original invoice from Scott &amp; Anderson for the seventy six reams of paper—we had the other five reams in the cellars of our office—we have paid Scott &amp; Anderson for it; they sold it to us for a month, but as we lost at the <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, they took a three months' bill for it—after the interview with Algernon he accompanied Mr. Cooper and myself to his brother's—we went to 56; Princes' Square, Kennington, where he had apartments, and waited till he came home—I said 1 had come to know what he had done with our paper—he immediately became very violent and wanted to know what I meant by coming there and asking an accusation, and then he threw off his coat and wanted to murder me, or something of that sort, he said—he is a rather bigger man than myself,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050079"/>
               <p>so I declined—I said "I have come about my paper"—he said "I don't know anything about your paper; I am a business man and know what I am about; every bit of paper I have, had from <hi rend="italic">Algernon</hi>, I have got receipts for and I will show you them"—he produced some receipts—there were two or more—there is only receipt here-to the best of my knowledge that is one, (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>) I said "You knew your, brother was our clerk and could not have all that lot of paper to sell he said "I did not know anything about it, he could have paper to sell for all I knew—I said "Do you mean to throw all the onus on your little brother and let us give him into custody?"—he said, that was no business of his Algernon had given his word before we went iu that he Would come out with me again. I said "Come along" and his brother said "Don't go, but he did come he came to our office every day, as usual until the morning of the examination at the Mansion House—then the detective officer came and took him-we applied for the warrant the next day after we went to kennington, but we could not get up sufficient evidence till the next Saturday when we obtained it—I did not enter into any particulars with the elder prisoner-here was such a transaction with Webb, Willis &amp; Co. as that to which Algeron alluded when with me in Walbrook—there were twenty two reams of paper supplied by us to that firm in March—the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that was paid the same day were ceiyed what we supposed was Grimwade's order—it was paid in a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the rest in gold-Algernon Granville told me he had met Mr. Webb in the street and he said "I am going into the country for a little while, and if you will come up to my office I will pay you that account and gave it to him—I have been several times then to Webb's place, and since the conversation in Walbrook—there is such a firm but I cannot find any one there my partner has been there perhaps a dozen times during the ordinary hours of business the value of the five reams Would be 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the average value is about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per cwt the brown paper trade is regulated by weight—12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt. would be a very low price-any man. would buy paper at that price who dealt in it—17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the the price we charged to Grimwade—<hi rend="italic">here</hi> it is 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MONTAGU WILLIAMS</hi>. I understood a little about the paper trade—I treated Algernon as a friend for some months, and when his brother shut up their place and bolted, we, wanted to give him a chance, of getting on and took him in to our employment-we should not have given him so much been of use to us our object in taking him in was we were ignorant of the paper trade and that he would be useful to us-we do not care about the paper trade Mr. Cooper is here we are the sole partners in a the firm-we carry on business at 5&amp;7, Fenchurch Street, and North Devon—it is one office in Fenchurch Street—it was in the evening that I met Algernon in Walbrook—I did not threaten to take him at once to Old jewry and have him looked up unless he confessed everything—I did mention the Old Jewry-do unfortunately know the Old Jewry—it is unfortunate to spend 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in legal expenses when one has lost 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. already—I did not do that in the Old Jewry, but it leads to it—I told him he should not leave me that night untill be told me what had, become of my paper or I Would give him to a police constable—I suppose a policeman would lock him up—I don't remember his saying "What paper?" and my saying" Grinwade's paper"—I will not say that we did not—he asked me to. go up some court to be out of the public</p>

I am a greengrocer living in Cleaver Street, Kennington Road. close to Prince's Square—Charles Granville gave me directions to go to Nine Elms Station, and take ten reams of paper from there to Houndsditch, which I did—I forget the number—there was no one with me—the next day I also went by his direction, to 5 and 7, Fenchurch Street, and took five reams from there to Houndsditch—there was no one with me.</p>

I am employed by Mr. Sorrell, of Mitre Street, Aldgate—on the 29th April, I saw the elder prisoner at the bottom of Fish Street Hill, he came to my employer and asked whether he would let him have the van to remove some paper from Trigg's Wharf—that was in the middle of the day—he gave my employer a card—that is the one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went with the van—when I got to Trigg's wharf I found both the prisoners there—I waited there some time before I could receive the load—I loaded sixty reams of paper, I think it was, and I was told by the elder prisoner to take them to Somers, of Houndsditch—after delivering some there, I took the rest to Swan's—I have not been paid for my labour—I have been down to Bozzi, Dudley &amp; Co., 46, Fish Street Hill, but found no one there—I went the next morning.</p>

I live at 31, Leigh Street, Burton Crescent—I have known the prisoner since about Christmas last—soon after Christ<lb/>mas he called at my shop and said "I am a tradesman in the Strand, I want to-purchase 4 tons of coal, I have dealt with your predecessor"—I showed him several samples of coal, he chose that at 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—he said he would have to take 2 tons in on the Friday and 2 tons the following Monday—he gave me his name and address, Mr. Briscoe, 277, Strand-after going through the books of my predecessor I gave directions to my carman—he returned without the money—I was unable to go out for a day or two, and I sent my son to 277, Strand, and a few days after the prisoner came to my shop again and said as there had been a noise about the other 2 tons he would not have any more coals, but he would come and pay me on the Wednesday—I did not see him again until 30th April this year in Drury Lane—I followed him, tapped him on the shoulder and said "How about the coals"—he said "Oh, you have not fulfilled your contract"—I said I should give him in charge for swindling me out of my coals—he laughed at me—I said "I shall certainly run you in," and I did—the price of the coals was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was induced to send them, because he said he was, a tradesman in the Strand, and dealt with my predecessor.</p>

I live at Lancaster Villas, Lower Norwood, and am manager at 22, Pall Mall, of the coal business of William Lee, trading as the Pall Mall Coal Co.—on 21st April the prisoner came and wanted some coal—I said "Have we supplied you before?"—he said "No, but you have supplied some of. my friends," "friend," he might have said—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "I am Mr. Henry White, manager to Mr. Kingwell, of 7, Upper St. Martin's Lane, and I want some coal to be sent there"—he mentioned that he was a wheelwright, and I said "Do you use our coal for wheelwrights' purposes; I thought you used small coal"—he said "But we must have the best also"—I then said "How much will you have?"—he said he would take 2 tons; I said "Will-you prepay the order or pay on delivery"—he said "I will pay on delivery"—I asked him what time they should be delivered, and he said at 8 o'clock on Friday morning—I said "You will understand the coal will not be left unless it is paid for at the time"—he said. "Yes, but let it be delivered at 8 o'clock on Friday morning"—the ticket was made out in due course and sent to our Camden Road depot for <hi rend="italic">delivery</hi>—these are the tickets; one is a counterpart of the other—if the coal was paid for at the time the carman would receipt the whole of that and leave it with the party who purchased the coal, and in this instance that ought to have been done, because the carman was not to deliver unless he was paid on delivery—the counterpart was brought back by the carman signed—the 2 tons of coal came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went round to Mr. Kingwell's, I think the same afternoon, but I could not see him—I saw his brother, but he could not inform me if any coal had been delivered—I went the following morning and saw Mr. Kingwell and he gave me the address of Mr. White.</p>

On 14th May last, I was in the service of Mr. Miller, and on that day was employed by him to drive a cart, containing a quantity of ice, to the Victoria Docks, on the way we go through the North Woolwich Road—I know the shop of Cassinello's father; I don't know the number—I only know the prisoner by his being in the shop—I had not seen him or sold ice to him before that day—he had once or twice before spoken to me about selling him ice—it was in the winter time—he said "When it gets a little warmer, I can do with a little ice"—I said "Not me"—I did not tell him who I was—he spoke to me because he could see what was in my load—I had not said anything to him as to whose service I was in—Mr. Miller's name was on the cart, large white letters, with red round them—on 14th May, I was going by the shop when somebody called me—I was very intoxicated and could not swear who it was—I was asked whether I had got a bit of ice, and I said "Yes," and then took two pieces in, and Cassinello carried two pieces in—nothing was said to me as to how much was to be paid for it—I came out and Mr. Clark, the ice merchant, was there with a policeman; I didn't know what I was doing at the time—Mr. Clark said something to me about selling ice—the prisoner was at the door and went and fetched back the ice and put it in the van—I ran away; about a week afterwards I surrendered myself to Mr. Miller.</p>

He died on 1st May, at my residence, in Warwick Street, Woolwich. He had been ill for the last nine or ten months. When he was first taken ill I thought it was from teething, as my other children suffered from their teeth at first. He gradually got worse and worse up to the time of his death. I don't know the complaint or disease under which he was labouring. Every care and attention was taken of him by myself and my wife. I called in no medical aid or advice. I am one of the Peculiar People and do not believe in it; I trust to the Lord. The child was prayed for and prayed over, and the Elders laid hands on him and anointed him with oil; by both the elders, Hines and Hurry. I thought the child had been seriously ill for some time past; I trusted in the Lord. I thought the child would have died before but for our trust in the Lord. I do not know the cause or disease of which he died. I did not treat him for any par<lb/>ticular complaint. He had every attention to his wants.")

I am a surgeon of 108, Blackman Street, Borough—on Saturday, 22th May, at 2 p.m., I was sent for and saw Ellen Conway in bed at 9, Little Suffolk Street—she complained of being violently sick and of having a headache, I treated her and saw her again on the Monday, she was then insensible, and she died shortly after, before 5 o'clock, because I went there again at 5 o'clock and she was dead then—she had not complained to me of any blow, I only had to treat her for sickness and headache—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Wednesday—there were no external marks—on removing the integuments there was inflam<lb/>mation and an infusion of serous blood over the left side of the upper part of the head, and on removing the bone the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> was very much in<lb/>flamed, and there was a large clot of blood underneath which had set up inflammation of the brain and the membranes were very much inflamed—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain caused by the clot which was caused by external violence I believe—I am able to say that external violence which at the time produced no immediate effect will afterwards cause the brain to become inflamed and insensibility to come on—I do not believe that this inflammation and clot could have arisen from internal causes the other organs were not particularly healthy, but there was no particular disease—I believe from the appearance of the stomach and liver that she was addicted to drink—it is consistent with what I saw that the external violence which caused this might have been as long ago as Whit-Sunday, 18th May.</p>

Me and Ellen Conway were in there drinking, having a drop of ale; then while I was in there Mrs. Conway crossed the road into the Old Justice, and while I was in there a costermonger came along and took up the dog into Mr. Carpenter's, the Rodney Arms. I took the dog away from him and took it to my door, and he came and took up the dog and rolled it up on the barrow in some sacks and I took the dog away from him and he ran away and left his barrow because I wanted to know his name. Mrs. Conway said 'Let the man have his barrow as he wants to get his living," She felt quite angry at me making the man's barrow stop. Me and Mrs. Conway got talking, and one word brought up another, and I was going to bring the perambulators in, she said I should not do it, so trying to get the perambulators in she tried to take them away from me and I didn't strike her. She went to her work as usual till the Thursday and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050111"/>
               <p>when I came home from dinner I found her lying in bed, and she said she felt very bad, and got worse on Friday and told me to go for the doctor and I sat up with her three nights. That's all I have got to say."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I left my employment I had my tea, and a costermonger came in from a beer-shop, took up my dog and took it away; and he came a second time and deliberately took it again. I followed Him and he ran away and left his barrow. Mrs. Conway was in the Old Justice having a drop of gin, I suppose with the two witnesses who had been in her company night and day; she could never go outside the door without some<lb/>one else to have a drop of gin. She said "Why don't you let the man go about his business; he has got his living to look after," and she seemed quite angry. I had taken in three perambulators previously and I took up-another. She said "You shan't take it in; they are my property." I said "It is 9.30 and it is too late to let them out any more." In the scuffle I took it up to lift it over her head. She was not so tall as I am and it did not touch her. I took that one in, and while I was doing so she sent a little girl for a policeman. I said "There is the policeman, what are you going to charge me with." The policeman came and I heard what she said to him and soon after that we had a drop more drink, and consequently when she was sitting on a chair close to the door she fell down between the chair and the door, where there was a broom and a square bit of hearthstone. I picked her up, undressed her, and put her to bed and next day she was outside and got drunk again, and the following day, and the following day again; and on the Saturday she got blind, speechless drunk and could not stand. She fell on her face over a piece of carpet and I undressed her and put her to bed. As to striking her I know nothing about it. They have done this to get possession of my house and home, and the same day while I was away they sold 15 or 16 perambulators, and there were a lot of people in the house. The little girl can prove that Mrs. Conway's son came and ransacked the place and said "Where is the bank-book." I had been to the undertaker for a coffin, and then somebody said that I went to the under<lb/>taker before her body was cold. They ransacked the house and took every<lb/>thing, and I had a little home like a little palace.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, of 27, Peter Street, Southwark Bridge Road—on 1st June, about 3.30 in the morning, I was awoke by the raising of my bedroom window on the ground floor; it was broad daylight and the sun was shining brightly—the foot of the bed faces the window—I saw the form of a man push back the blind with one hand, and he was in the act of stepping off the window sill on to the floor, the whole of his body being in the room—I called "Halloa," and he immediately decamped back through the open window, closing the window and then the shutters—the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt at all about him—I saw a constable within two minutes and gave him a description of the man—in less than twenty minutes afterwards I was fetched and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the street; I recognised him and he was taken—I had shut the window and shutters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050112"/>
               <p>the night before—the shutters were not fastened; the window was by an ordinary catch—nothing in the house was disturbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a blind to the window—I had never seen the man before; I was awoke by the raising of the sash—the aspect of my room is south-east.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—about 3.40 on this morning I saw a man's figure on the blind outside—I saw his hand move as if unfasten<lb/>ing the hasp of the window; I heard it go back and shortly afterwards the window was raised, and he put his head in and held the blind back with one hand; then I saw him put the remainder of his body in to get into the room—when Mr. Baker asked what he wanted the man made use of very offensive language and jumped back into the street, closing the window after him and likewise the shutters—it was very light; I could see very plainly—the prisoner is the man; I have not the least doubt about him.</p>

About 4 o'clock on this morning I received information and went and examined the window; it could be easily forced open with a knife; shortly after this I saw the prisoner in George Yard; I sent for Mr. Baker and he identified him—I said "I charge you with being in the Lord Clive beer-house since 3 o'clock"—he said "I don't know where it is"—I said "At the corner of White Cross Street"—he said "I have been running about all the morning calling people for the races."</p>
