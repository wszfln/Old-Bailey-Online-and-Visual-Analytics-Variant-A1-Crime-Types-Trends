I am the wife of Louis Harris, a jeweller, of 53, Commercial Road—on Friday night, 11th May, I went to bed about 12 o'clock; everything was safely fastened—about 2.30 I distinctly heard the parlour window at the back of the shop opened—that window opens into the yard—there were shutters inside the window; they were pulled down—I looked out of my bedroom window and saw a man standing on the parlour window ledge—I cried out "Police," and he ran from the window, walked to the bottom of the yard, got on the gate, and jumped down into the road—the prisoner is the man—the police came; I opened the front door and let him in—I then examined the window, and found the catch had been unfastened and the window pushed up to its very height—the shutters were still fastened, but had been tampered with—they are wooden shutters in two halves, with a screw in the centre—one side was a little raised, and there were marks—when the door was opened we found a large pair of steps was placed against the door; the steps belonged to me—they had not been there the night before—the prisoner was an entire stranger to me.</p>

I want to speak to you"—he ran away—I ran after him, 600 or 700 yards—a young man stopped him—I got up to him—he struggled violently to get away—I sent for assistance—he did not say a word—I searched him—I found on him four skeleton keys, with the wards filed out; also three ordinary keys, a key-hole saw, an iron chisel, a table knife, and a candle.</p>

On Thursday, May 10th, from 10 minutes to 15 minutes past 3; I was in Fenchurch Avenue, leading out of Lime Street; a man in Lime Street was carrying on a sort of mock auction, there was a crowd round him—in getting through the people on my way to the railway-station, I felt a</p>

               <p>pull at my watch pocket; on looking down I saw the prisoner's hand close against my left breast where my watch was—I said, "You vagabond, you have got my watch"—he said "I have not"—I saw his hand open and felt the watch fall from the chain and from his hand—the chain was not broken—I found afterwards that the bow of the watch was bent—I grasped my watch with my left hand and made a grab at him with my right, but I missed him and he ran away—I followed him calling "Stop thief"—he went towards Leadenhall Market; he then turned and came back again; my eyes were on him the whole of the way, I never lost sight of him—he was seized by the witness Crosier—a violent attempt was made to rescue him, but he was forced into a coffee-shop and detained till the police came, he was then to taken to the station.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 66, Holborn Viaduct—the prosecutor is my client—on 16th January the prisoner came to me with the prosecutor's card, and at his request I wrote a letter—on 17th January the prisoner and prosecutor came together—the prisoner made a statement in the prosecutor's presence, I made a note of it at the time, I remember the effect of it—it was that in consequence of a letter I had written, certain securities had been deposited at the Oxford Street Branch of the Capital and Counties Bank, and he should be able to clear them by Thursday—I had received no reply to the letter I had written, at that time; I did not for some days—on 25th January I received this letter from Messrs. Burchall and Co.; I showed it to the prisoner the next day. (<hi rend="italic">This letter was to the effect that Mr. Law's letter of</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th, re Alfred Fountain, must have been addressed to them in error, as they did not act for the executors or trustees, and that they had inquired of other firms whose names resembled their own, but that they knew nothing of the matter.</hi>) When I showed that to the prisoner he said he could not understand it; he thought it must be some mistake—the prosecutor was present—the prisoner said he was entitled to certain moneys under the bankruptcy of Lord Henry Lennox—I asked him for authority to go to the Official Receiver—I knew the day before that the prosecutor had lent the prisoner money—the prisoner signed this authority ("Please pay to my solicitors Messrs. Law, the amount payable to me under the bankruptcy of Lord Henry Lennox.") The prisoner said when that was received it could be retained, and Mr. Hudson could be repaid the money he had advanced—on 25th January I went to Somerset House to search for the will of Charlotte Fountain—I searched before and after the date February 1885, I did not find the will—on 25th January the bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought, and the prisoner said he had given that to Mr. Hudson to secure the moneys he had advanced—Hudson said he would pay it in, (<hi rend="italic">The bill was read as follows:—"</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th January.

I am a butcher of Brompton Road—on the last Friday in April the prisoner came in—I was very busy and my attention was called by one of my men—I went to the desk, and my young lady asked me if I would cash a cheque for a Mr. Walford, a customer of mine, of Cornwall Gardens—I said "I have no change, but I will back it and the young man can run over and cash it"—I was about to do it when my young lady gave me a glance and I looked at the cheque and found it was not Mr. Walford's cheque—I asked for my entry-book and found Mr. Walford's cheques were on Sir Samuel Scott's Bank—I said "Are you living in Mr. Walford's house?"—he was dressed in a gentleman's servant's clothes—he said "No, I am a friend of the housekeeper"—I said I should not cash it—he said he felt surprised, and that he would ran back and tell the housekeeper—he left—if he had been living at the place he said he was going to he would have turned to the left, but instead of that he turned to the right—I followed him up the road, and coming on one of my neigh-bouring tradespeople I had a conversation with him—the prisoner stopped whenever he saw me stop; I at last crossed the road and met him—he said "Oh, I have had the cheque cashed"—I said "Where?"—he said "Oh, a butcher's up the road"—I said "I am his butcher"—he said "I got it cashed at the corner of Sloane Street"—I said "How did you get it cashed?"—he said "It is immaterial to you"—I said "You tried to <hi rend="italic">rush</hi> me and I have a right to know"—"Don't touch me," he said—a crowd came and a constable came up—I asked the constable to ask him a few questions—I said to him "You knew this to be a downright swindle?"—he said "It is a swindle"—I said if he would show me the man that put him up to it I would exonerate him—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the constable took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in foreign stamps, principally spoilt ones—I live at Walham Green—my father is a salesman in Covent Garden Market—on the Saturday previous to the prisoner's arrest I saw him in Mr. Bennett's shop, 49, Holywell Street, Strand, where he offered some stamps to Mr. Bennett, who said that he did not care to buy, but that I might—on the following Monday I saw the prisoner in the same shop selling stamps to Mr. Bennett, and I bought some more stamps on the same terms as before—I recognised among them a stamp which Miss Fernley, who has a shop in London Wall, had lost previously—Mr. Bennett bought it—when the prisoner left the shop I followed him; he went into a public-house in the street leading to the Temple station—I fetched a constable there, but the prisoner had gone—one day later in the week I was in the shop again, when the prisoner came in—I asked him if he had a stamp, a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. green Nevis, that Miss Fernley described to me as one she had lost, and he said yes, he would bring it up—I went out and got a constable—I bought 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps of him the first time and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the second.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should call the dealing in foreign stamps a large trade—I sell to people who have a fancy for making collections—Mr. Bennett is a very large dealer—on 5th, 7th, and 10th May the prisoner came in and offered stamps for sale in the regular way of business—on two occasions I bought some—I only saw them as Mr. Bennett passed them through his hands—I heard from Miss Fernley of her loss about</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant, and reside at 201, I Commercial Road. On 21st April, about half past 10 p.m., I was driving I down the Fairfield Road, Bow; I had just reached the corner of Blondin I Street when I saw a number of people collected outside a public-house, I I don't know the name of it—I saw the prisoner strike the deceased about I the head and face with her hands—the deceased's husband came up and I separated them; he was knocked down by four or five young men; the prisoner then came from the pavement into the road and again knocked the deceased about the head and face, took hold of her hair and pulled her on to the flag-stones; whether her hands were entangled in her hair I could not say; the deceased came down on the flag-stones on her hands—a stout woman ran across the road and picked her up, and said "My God! the woman is killed," and sat her against the public-house, but she fell forward on to the flag-stones—I got out of my trap, and saw that she had a terrific wound in the centre of the forehead, and blood was flowing very fast—the prisoner went away; she did not run, she walked rather smartly down Lincoln Street; I got into my trap again, and followed her for about three-quarters of an hour, intending to give her into custody, when she quickly ran into a house—some boys told me her name, and I went to the police-station and left my address and the prisoner's—I found out from the boys that she lived at 13, Queen Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased's husband had separated them when I came up—he was six or seven yards from his wife when he was knocked down—he was on one side of the cellar-flap, she was on the other, from two to three feet from it—I have since looked at it and measured the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of 36, Blondin Street, Fairfield Road—the deceased, Annie Hannah Astell, was my wife, and was 40 years of age—on Saturday, 21st April, she was at work at home during the afternoon—she went out in the evening, about 10 o'clock, with Mrs. Dean, I remained at home—I afterwards went to the Caledonian Arms, at the corner of the street, with Arthur Wood—I found my wife and Mrs. Dean there, and the prisoner; I had half-a-pint of ale which I paid for—my wife was perfectly sober—there were four young men and another young woman there—some of the young men knew Wood, and they handed him a pot of ale to drink out of—he said u There is no harm in asking a friend," meaning me—they said "No"—my wife objected, and said if I had not got enough to pay for a glass she would pay for one for me—the prisoner was there at the time, drinking along with her friends; some bad language was used by them, and the landlord had to eject them—I and my wife remained—after several minutes my wife went out; the landlord persuaded her to go out at the back door-followed in a few seconds; when I got out I found that my wife had been struck—I accused the prisoner of striking her—she turned row and said "Yes, you b——, and I will strike you," which she did, on my left eye—I then made a blow at her, I don't believe I struck her; I made a blow at her in retaliation, and as I did so, someone knocked me senseless to the ground—when I recovered I found my wife standing up against the window, attended to by Mrs. Dean—I could not say what the state of her head was, I was hardly conscious myself—she was taken home, and then to the hospital—I saw her on the Sunday, and had some conversation with her about her injuries—she knew me; she did not know she was dying—the last time I saw her was on Tuesday, at 5 o'clock; she died at half-past 7 on Wednesday evening. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 10 when I went to the public-house—I had been to Hackney, and had several glasses before, and another pint after I came home—I had not had any words with my wife in the public house—I went to take my wife's part, to separate her from the prisoner, when I was knocked down—the blow the prisoner gave me was not a severe one, it did not hurt me.</p>

                  </hi>. I went with Mrs. Astell to the public-house—as soon as she came in there was a quarrel with the prisoner and some Young chaps, and the landlord put them out—I saw Mrs. Astell go out, I went out a little after her—the prisoner knocked her down—I crossed the road and saw nothing more—I took her home and then to the hospital—I did not see in what part the prisoner struck her, she struck her in the face first in the public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased had not her sleeves rolled up when she came out of the public-house—she did not offer to fight the prisoner; I did not see her strike her—the prisoner slapped her in the face in the public-house, and she knocked her down outside with her fist, I supposes—she did not fall down; she was knocked down—there was a fight between the two women.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner and her companions came in first, and then the deceased and her husband and Wood—the deceased was quite sober, so was the prisoner; the only one who had had a little drink was Abtell—the beginning of the quarrel was by one of the prisoner's companions asking Astell to drink—the deceased said "We don't want to drink with them, have you not had enough of them?"—soon after the prisoner commenced calling the deceased Astell, which she resented—the nails on my cellar-flap were iron nails, which project above the wood about three-quarters of an inch; they were put on simply to prevent boys dancing on it—the prisoner had another girl with her and four young men.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital on 21st April, when the deceased was brought there about half-past 11—she had a very severe wound over the forehead, and bruises over both eyes; the bone was lain bare—I attended to her—she died in the hospital on the 25th, at half past 7 in the evening—I made a post-mortem examination; the cause of death was inflammation of the membranes of the brain, due to a fracture of the skull which we then discovered—I have heard a good deal of the evidence in this case—I believe the violence stated caused the wound which caused the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have stated that in my opinion it was caused by a blunt object, such as a rough paving-stone—I have heard the nails described in the cellar-flap—the head of one nail would not do it, several might; that would be consistent with the wounds I saw; a blow with a fist would not.</p>

I never struck a policeman in my life"—that was prior to our telling him the charge—I understood that Wallis had told him the charge was for stabbing Sergeant cameron, on the night of 6th December 1887—he said "All right, I will come"—when charged at the station he said he was at home and in bed at the time, and he did not know till the next morning that his son was locked up.</p>

On May 5th the prosecutor gave me information, and I looked out, and on the 16th I saw the prisoner in Great St. Andrew Street with three others—I followed him into the Grapes public-house, had a good look at him, told him I was a police-officer and should take him for being concerned with two other men in assaulting Mr. Nichol—he said "I will go with you quietly"—I placed him with five men at the station, and the prosecutor and witnesses identified him—the other men were not old enough to be his father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the Magistrate that they were similar to yourself—two of them were close-shaved—I saw you a week after the robbery, but was not quite certain you were the man; your face was puffed up as if you had received blows—there was no blood on your shirt—I took you past the shop where the two witnesses were because it was the nearest way to the station—I did not take you round the bye-streets because of the mob which followed you, knowing I should be set upon and lose you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I heard nothing of this robbery till the 16th, and before I got to the station they had got five men there. There was nothing the matter with my face, it was in the same condition as it is now. They put a chair in front of me; I said "I will step away from that chair," out the detective said "Keep where you are," and said to the prosecutor when he came in, "Would you like a chair?" he said "Yes," and the Detective placed it in front of me.</p>

Daly who has pleaded guilty was in our employment, and had access to the room in which the cards were kept—the Government stamp is pasted over our covers, and to open them it is necessary to destroy the stamp—cards are not allowed to go out without a stamp—I missed twenty-one dozen packs of cards, and on 23rd April I noticed some of our cards in the prisoner's shop in Holborn, loose, not enclosed in any packet; and one packet with the Government stamp on them and ticketed with the price—I communicated with the police<lb/>cards which have been used, which are bought second-hand may be sold loose, they would not have this wrapper or the Government wrapper—I went to the prisoner's shop with Enright, and when the police came I went in and saw these packets of cards which had come from our place—there are about 21, and they were all on the table together in packets, but without the stamps.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant E</hi>). From information I received I went to the prisoner's shop, 186, High Holborn—the Wainwrights (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 179) lived at a lodging-house almost adjoining No. 186—it is a general dealer's shop—I told him I had a warrant to search his place—he said "Yes, you can do that with pleasure"—I said "If you have got any playing cards you had better produce them"—he went to the window and took from it these two packs, without any wrappers, and three packs with the Government wrapper on them—I said "Have you got any more?"—he said "Yes," and went behind the counter and brought this box containing seven packs and covers—I said "Have you got any more?"—he said "No"—I said "I shall have to search now"—I went into the parlour and found nine packs on a chair, under a coat—I said "Here are some more;" he said "Oh yes, I got them from a man who</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S.I practise at Crawley Heath, Staffordshire—on the evening of 13th October, 1883, I was called to attend the prisoner; she was unconscious, suffering from a lacerated wound of the chin, and a severe contusion over the left ear, with bleeding from the ear—that would indicate a rupture of the membrane—I attended her for two or three weeks; she suffered a good deal—I have not seen her since—there is a tube running to the ear from the throat, down which matter passes; so long as that passes away she would be in pretty fair health in all probability—if that is blocked up there would be inflammation of the internal ear, and probably from that inflammation of the brain—I have heard the evidence as to a second blow, and as to her frequent complaints of pain in the head; that might very likely unhinge the mind altogether, produce delusions, and perhaps ultimately insanity—she might be suddenly seized at any time—a person seized suddenly in that manner might act almost automatically, and I think would not be able to reflect upon the nature of what they were doing, in such a manner as would withhold an ordinary person from committing a crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was called I found her unconscious; if I remember rightly she regained consciousness during the time I was putting sutures under the chin, that took some time—that would show that there was some concussion of the brain; that might be caused by a fall or blow—it is a fact that very often actual injury to the brain by concussion may follow years afterwards; a second blow would of course add to the mischief—I have heard the evidence as to her frequent complaints of pains in the head—I should infer from that that there was probably some chronic action of the membranes of the brain—from her unfounded complaints of persons being unfriendly to her, I should infer that she was still suffering from the consequence of the injuries, that she had delusions—when a person is once shown to be the subject of</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior medical officer to the ear and throat hospital at Birmingham—on 29th September, 1884, the prisoner was under my charge—according to the notes it was reported to be for rupture of the membrane of the ear—I cannot remember how long she was there, there are several re-entries; this in September was a re-entry, so she had been there before, and unfortunately that has prevented my making further investigation into the history of the case—I remember that she was very sullen and showed signs of what I should call temper—I have heard the evidence as to the injuries she received, and the complaints she made—I quite agree with Dr. Standish as to what he says might be the results.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was rupture of the tympanum of the ear—that is reported in the books—as far as I can make out she was attended at the infirmary seven or eight months—I should judge from her symptoms that there was injury to the membranes of the brain—I perfectly agree with Dr. Standish's evidence.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I live at 20, Queen Anne Street—I have seen the prisoner on two occasions since she has been in custody, on 21st and 23rd May—I have heard the evidence as to her injuries, and her complaints of her head, but I have founded my conclusions from my own observation of the prisoner—I found that she showed evidence of an altogether unnatural tenderness about the head, which I understood was the result of two blows which she had received—if that tenderness was really set on foot by the blows, and had continued all this time in conjunction with other symptoms, it would indicate chronic inflammation of the membranes—she also complained of singing and ringing noises in the head, and also of attacks of giddiness from time to time, as well as almost constant pains in the head, apart from mere tenderness—all those things would go to strengthen the conclusion that she had chronic inflammation of the membranes of the brain—I talked to her about her past history, and also referred to this crime—I did not question her closely as to what she had done—she professed not to know or recollect what had occurred after she had taken the cup of tea, but she volunteered a statement that she had no reason for doing it; she did not know why she could have done it—that oblivion is a very common thing if there has been an access of anything like a maniacal or epileptic form—there was nothing about her to give me an idea that she had been suffering from fits—a person may have a tendency to epilepsy without any outward sign of it—if her father and relatives had suffered from that disease that would render it more probable that she might have a tendency in that direction—I think her attacks of giddiness were modified epileptic attacks—she complained very much of sleepless nights, and I found from the hospital reports that she slept very little; that would not of itself suggest epilepsy, but it would be in accordance with an inflammatory condition of the membranes of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to see the prisoner at the request of the Public Prosecutor to assist the Court—I had reports from the surgeon of the gaol and his assistant—I have not the least doubt that she is suffering from brain disease; her whole manner is that of a person so suffering</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188805280043"/>
               <p>—she said she had no reason for doing the act, and that she had no disagreement with the deceased after having the tea with her; that she turned round and went to sleep, and beyond that recollected nothing.</p>

It is a feature of epilepsy that the person may have a sudden attack, and will then do most extraordinary things unconsciously, and may commit any crime that would occur to them—I think the most important aspect of this case medically is the fact that she had been suffering for years with pains in the head, sleeping very little for a prolonged time, the condition of the family in which epilepsy was rife, and probably suffering from minor forms of it herself—she said "If I had known what I was doing I should not have hurt her; I did not know what I was doing"—I took those words down—she seemed to be quite genuine; she did not deny the act—she injured herself in the hospital in one of the fainting attacks—I examined the hurt; it was not an ordinary fainting attack, probably an attack of a different kind—if it is correct that she slept very little that would be accounted for by brain disease.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant T</hi>). On 7th March a complaint was made at Walham Green Station, and then I made inquiries—about 1 o'clock on 5th April I went to Richmond, and saw the prisoner in the street—I followed him for a long time and arrested him—I said "I am a police officer; I am going to take you into custody for stealing on 6th March a dog from a butcher in the North End Road, Fulham, which was afterwards taken to the Chelsea Railway Station, and sent on to Mr. Rodham, Rodham Hall, Wool-perton, Northumberland, whom you have been corresponding with from 18, The Terrace, Bedford Park, in the name of Soames Pager, and from whom you have obtained a sum of money; the dog was found to be useless, and sent back to you there, but you could not be found"—he made no reply—I took him to Fulham Police-station by train—he asked me again about the charge, and when I told him he made no reply—I told him a third time at his request, and then he said "My God, what a fool I have been; I have been led into this by other people"—he wrote this telegram and signed this receipt in my presence—this advertisement and these letters to Mr. Stanley and Mr. Rodham, and the endorsement on this cheque of Mr. Stanley and Mr. Rodham, are in the prisoner's writing to the best of my belief—this letter of 11th April is not in his writing; it seems to be a lady's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After the case had been at the police-court once or twice he asked me if I knew a man of the name of White, at Fulham—he said nothing about White when arrested; afterwards he said something about him—I do not know a man named White who deals in dogs—I took a pocket-book from the prisoner at the time of his arrest; it contains entries in the prisoner's writing—the prisoner did not tell me he had letters from White about the capacities of these dogs for retrieving purposes, nor that he bought them of White, and had receipts—I found post-office orders and various other things on the prisoner; they are here—Chelsea Railway Station is about half a mile or more, I should say, from North End Road—Walham Green is 150 yards from North End Road—Walham Green is on the Metropolitan, and Chelsea on the main line—I made no further search to discover who stole the dogs; I had no reason to believe that any one else stole them.</p>

Milne, 47, City Garden Row, City Road," and the number 58—I caused inquiries to be made about Milne, and Moye came to the station, and from what he told me I had the barrow and prisoner taken to Bishopsgate Street Station, where Milne and Moye identified the barrow.</p>

I am being robbed"—Penn, who was standing five yards off on the pavement, ran up and knocked Mercer down—I ran up and threw Penn to the ground, and held him with my right hand and Jones with my left—Jones dropped some money—some constables came—I directed them to look about—one of them picked up a shilling—Mercer said he would charge the prisoners—I took Jones, and other constables took Penn to the station—they denied the charge—Penn said "I don't know the female prisoner," and Jones said "I don't know the man"—I found in Penn's trousers watch-pocket this pawn-ticket. (<hi rend="italic">"Boy's boots, A. Jones,</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.<hi rend="italic"> 17, Pearson Street"</hi>.) They both said "I refuse my address and occupation"—this envelope was found on Penn.

I was on duty at a fixed point in Broad Street about 12.10 on Saturday, 19th April, when the prosecutor complained to me—I went to Lolesworth Buildings and saw the prisoner among about 10 women—they said "This man has been concerned, with two others, in robbing a poor man in the yard"—I said "Where is the man?"—a woman said "In my room, very near exhausted"—the prisoner said "I should like to see him"—I said "You can at your pleasure, if you wish," and took him to the room—the prosecutor at once identified him—I took him in custody—going to the station he said "If he had not seen me by myself he would not have identified me; if I had been placed with five or six others he might have picked out another man"—he was charged at the station, and said "Pay no regard to what they say, he is drunk, and so is the policeman"—I found nothing on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence said that he followed the crowd, and while inquiring of the woman, was taken and identified in the dark, when the prosecutor could not say whether it was he or the policeman, and that the prosecutor had said that he was robbed in Aldgate and then in Commercial Road.</hi>

I am a partner in the firm of Ainsworth and Lowry, of 14, St. Mary Axe—on 29th March the prisoner called and presented a card to me like this, with "377, Strand" written on it. (<hi rend="italic">A card of Mc-Caw, Stevenson, and Orr, Printers, Belfast</hi>.) He said he had come to purchase some cigars for the members of a theatrical company going abroad the same day, and would I send them at once—I said I did not know the firm, and asked him who sent him; he said "My principals"—he selected 800 cigars, of which he smoked one to try—500 were Partagas Conchas, and 300 Larranagas Regalia Longas—I asked him if he would pay for them on delivery; he said "No, we usually pay on the 14th," or 15th, I forget which; the 15th being Sunday the amount would be due on the 14th—they were to be sent to 377, Strand—on leaving he said "Oh, by-the-bye, you had better give me that card back again, it is the only one I have," and I gave it to him—I went to the Strand with a boy-porter and the cigars—I saw on the door and on the ground-floor the names "Mc-Caw, Stevenson, and Orr," the names he had given—the porter, Dawson, brought back this letter, "Dear sir, please oblige and forward 300 more of the Larranagas; if you can manage to send them about two it will be a favour. Yours truly, Mc-Caw, Stevenson, and Orr, p. p. G. R."—it is on paper with Mc-Caw's printed description—my firm is "late Leash"—the cigars were sent, and I received the receipts for them; the date on one is written by the person who received the goods, the other not—I went to 377, Strand on the 14th; I did not get paid—I have seen similar cigars in the possession of Mr. Roper—the first lot of cigars were delivered about 2 o'clock, the others when the boy had brought back the letter—these are similar cigars, a box of each kind—the invoice was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>defendant with a view of his becoming our agent—Mr. Davis is our manager—we wrote to the defendant on 1st February, "As previously explained to you any arrangement with the sub-agent or representative in London can only be made with Mr. Davis's consent and co-operation. We sent your letters of the 18th and 23rd to him, and we have had several communications from him, and yesterday one saying that he cannot complete an arrangement as proposed, he promises to write us fully on the matter. In the mean time it would be premature for you to be making any arrangement until an agreement is actually signed;" and on the 4th of September we wrote "We have your letter of the 3rd, and can only say that if you acted before the completion and signing of the agreement, you did so on your own responsibility. Our letter of the 20th was only a statement of main points. You overlook that we said there might be others, and that we asked you to see Mr. Davis. Anything and everything that is to appear in the agreement must be settled before we can consent to your acting for us or using our name in any way"—I never authorised him to obtain cigars in our name—I I never sent him to Ainsworth and Lowry—I did not know of their existence till after the occurrence—our firm were not desirous of making presents—I never authorised the defendant at any time to sign our name by procuration—the document to Ainsworth and Lowry asking for 300 cigars was not by my authority—he never informed me he was ordering cigars in our name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first communication with the defendant was with Mr. George Mc-Caw, in London, in September, 1887—the defendant had no authority to use our name—the correspondence was from about the 19th to the end of January or the beginning of February—Messrs. Allen and Sons, of Glasgow, are purely theatrical printers, we never executed a theatrical order till the last two or three months—Cham<lb/>berlain was employed by Allen and Sons—he is now in our employment in the same situation as the defendant would have had if he had satisfied us—he sent us a letter of prices for theatrical work—I was present at the Mansion House, but was not questioned—we should not have executed an order after telling the defendant not to act—if the negotiations had been completed, we would have taken an order—the defendant was under Cannot—they are not now on good terms—Mr. Davis is responsible for the prosecution, and he told me what he had discovered going on—Mr. Davis can sign "per procuration"—if Cannot did so inadvertently, without intention to rob, we should be content with calling his attention to it—I heard Mr. Davis censured by the Lord Mayor for swearing two informations.</p>

I am accountant to the Ocean Railway and General Accident Assurance Company, carrying on business at Mansion House Buildings, London—we gave a policy to Arthur William Philpott on 13th December, 1884—this was his proposal in which we asked the question as to former insurances, "Have you ever been insured against accidents?" he says "No;" and "Have you ever made a claim against any Accident Company, and if so what Company?" answer "No"—on 6th January, 1885, he alleged that on 29th December he had an accident; he says, in his claim, a carriage upset with him and two occupants, and that Mr. Thomas Aston Philpot, his father, was one of the persons, and a groom the other; those are the witnesses, and Dr.Waddell was attending him—we paid him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. compensation on that—on 12th August,1885, Dr.Philpott wrote this letter to us. (<hi rend="italic">This letter regretted to say that his Brother, Mr. Arthur William Philpott, had met with an accident while visiting him, and that the was quite unable to return home, and would be compelled to keep his bed for some time, and enclosed the number of the policy.</hi>) He made a claim and said he had sprained his ankle by falling down some steps on 5th August, 1885—he gave his brother, Dr. George Frederick Philpott, as his medical attendant, and Dr.Philpott gave certificates dated 15th and 21st August—we paid 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—before paying it we received this letter, signed,"Arthur Willaim Philpott." (<hi rend="italic">This said that a represent<lb/>tative of the Company had called and asked if he would forego his claim on payment of </hi>48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that he had consented, understanding it meant prompt settlement, but that he had not received the money.</hi>) Next day we sent the 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and got his receipt for it as full settlement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am London resident secretary of the Scottish Employers' Liability Co.-on 28th December, 1887, I received a proposal for the insurance of Arthur Percy Phillpot in consequence of that a policy was issued-before issuing it the ordinary questions as to whether the proposed insurer had been insured in any other office, or had any accident, were answered in the negative—the policy was granted to the defendant, Arthur William, in the name of Arthur Percy—I supposed that to be his real name-on 28th April this year we received notice of an accident by this letter—there is no date to-we got it about the beginning of May from our agent. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"Dr. Philpott begs to inform Mr. Andrews that Mr. Arthu Percy Philpott has unfortunately met with a serious accident to his arm and shoulder. Dr. Philpott would be glad if Mr. Andrews would call.") Mr. Andrews is the Company's agent-on 25th April I received this letter addressed to the Company. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"Gentlemen,—I am sorry to inform you that my brother, Mr. Arthur Percy Philpott, has met with an accident to his arm and shoulder. Will you kindly send the necessary forms to fill up. Signed, G. F. Philpott.") I sent a form, and received it back filled up—the accident was described as, coming out of the West Herts Infirmary on a dark night, and falling on the top step outside the door when slippery with wet—the form was accompanied by two certificates for fractured arm; one from Dr. Thomas, West Herts Infirmary, Hemel Hempstead, and the other from Dr. George Philpott.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR CHARLES RUSSELL</hi>. The certificate does not give the number of the policy; it accompanied the usual claim form—we should judge that the writer had the policy when sending that—the claim does not state that he was coming down the steps in the company of Dr. Thomas—I believe the fact to be so—it has been stated—it is not in the form—we did not ask that question, but I know it to be the fact—Dr. Philpott does not allege that he was present—we did not make inquiry by our agent about the accident; we sent a medical man to satisfy ourselves as to the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of the claim—we have not recognised it as an honest claim—we heard of these proceedings, and did no more.</p>

I was sent down by the Company as to the reality of the claim—the accident was on 17th April—in the case of a simple fracture the ordinary course would be to put the fractured limb in splints—I should imagine that cohesion would take place in from 10 to 14 days in a healthy subject—at the time I arrived it would have advanced about halfway towards recovery—I could not discover any existence of <hi rend="italic">crepitus</hi>—the arm was in splints—I did not remove the splints entirely—I saw Dr. Thomas—I did not know him before—he told me he was house-surgeon to the Infirmary; I forget the exact title; he was resident at the Infirmary, in a responsible position—I believe he certified both to the character of the injury, and as being present; I suppose the defendant had been spending the evening with him—he said it was a fractured limb—I could not say that was not correct—I cannot say how long I have known Dr. Philpott—I knew him previously at college—he was there some years, I believe—I asked Dr.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S., and practise at Willesden—on 31st October I was called to Florence Villa, and there saw Arthur William Philpott in the name of Somerset; he came into the room where I was—he complained of a great deal of pain in his ankle—I ordered cold water bandages, and told him to go to bed—he told me he was getting into a Hansom cab and he slipped off the step and caught his foot between the step and the kerb—I saw him every day for about a fortnight—he seemed to throw a doubt on my diagnosis of his case—he said he thought what he described as the small bone of his leg, must be broken—I told him if he was not satisfied by what I had stated, he had better call in another doctor—he spoke in that way several times, so much so that I really did speak to another doctor in the neighbourhood, and asked him if he would come in with me—he spoke to me about an insurance company; first of all he said he did not think he would make a claim, afterwards he said he would, and some days afterwards he asked me to fill up the insurance form, which I did, and I signed it as a sprained ankle—he then drew my attention to my having described it as a slight dislocation at the time—my inspection seemed to give him so much pain that I thought there might be slight dislocation.</p>

I live at Milner Street, Islington, and am a solicitor—on the afternoon of 1st May, about 5 p.m. I was walking up the City Road, St. Luke's, alone—I went to call at the Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, and as I entered the porch two men entered behind me; I found the swing doors were closed—I turned to ring the bell and felt a tug at my chain; on turning round I was tripped up; I fell and my chain was taken. I found afterwards my watch was in my pocket—I got up and ran after the prisoners towards the hospital garden gate—I saw one or two people running and others standing about—after I had run a yard or two I was tripped up and fell again—I got up and saw some men running up Regent Street, a small turning by the hospital; some person standing there gave me his name—my chain was broken away from my watch—I was considerably bruised as the result of the fall—I do not identify either of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. Johnson's potman—she spoke to me about 2 a.m. on 8th May, and I jumped out of bed and ran down with a truncheon to the next landing, looked out at the window, and saw three men about 20 yards from the house, who I now know to be detectives—two of them were in plain clothes, and one in uniform—I gave a long, low whistle, and a constable ran into the middle of the road—I went out and he was holding Hawkins by the throat—he had his truncheon up, and Gill was standing by him; I seized Gill—I afterwards saw finger</p>

On 8th May, about 2 a.m., I was on duty in Wilson Street—heard a whistle, and saw the potman at the Christopher Wren, looking out at the top window; he spoke to me, and I ran round the corner and saw the two prisoners and another man—I was in plain clothes—I saw Gill jump from the rails at the side of the door—Hawkins was standing against the door—I caught hold of his collar and drew my truncheon, and dared Gill to move—he drew a chisel from his pocket and said "I will do for you"—I said "If you move I will knock your brains out"—the potman then came out with a truncheon, caught hold of Gill, and said "You move and I will brain you"—another constable came up and secured him—he took a pipe from his pocket, threw it at me and struck my neck, trying at the same time to pull from the constable; he then struck me—going to the station he said "Whatever I get for this, I will do for you when I come out"—after he was charged I went back to the house, and found finger-marks inside and outside the fanlight, and this small piece chipped off the outside, as if by a chisel—the glass was dusty, and you could see finger marks on it and on the railings, and on the side of the door—a man could get his body through after he got the fanlight open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, of 77 Cornwall Road, Birmingham, I was appointed trustee to the prisoner's estate on 30th June, 1887—I attended the meeting of the creditors, and the public examination—the prisoner did not appear to be examined—I examined his affairs as far as I could—the amount of goods purchased in April, 1887, was 356<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in May, 343<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and in June, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. those are for watches alone—I did not find any books—what information I got was from a correspondence with creditors who supplied the watches; neither the prisoner or any one on his behalf has given me books, or any information connected with his affairs—I found no trade asstes—I took possession of his place in Hatton Garden and at Maida Vale, what assets there were claimed under this deed—I found</p>

"Do you know Mrs. Hunter?"—she said "yes"—I said "where did you get the tea that you supplied Mrs. Hunter with?—I said I got it from a third party"—I said "Give me the name of the third party"—he said "I can't, I shall get that third party into trouble if I do"—I said, "If you give the name of that third party, you are probably innocent of this charge, if you got it from him"—he said "I won't give the name," but going to the station, he said. "The name of the person I got the tea from is Johns and Co."—I said "why, the tea Johns and Co. have had is not enough to cover the tea you have given to Mrs. Hunter alone"—he said "Well, I have only had 1lb of tea from John and Co., and the rest of the tea I got from ready money purchases.</p>

"No, only a few needles"—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of breaking into a house and stealing some things that afternoon—he said "If that is all it is, I am a innocent as a child"—he was wearing this frock-coat under another coat—I asked him where he got it—he said "From Greenwich last pension-day, for half-a-crown"—he pulled it off at the station, and in a pocket of it I found these two pieces of jet chain, a piece of ribbon, and this handkerchief, which have been identified, and in the pocket of his overcoat were these two skeins of cotton—I placed him with other men, and Mrs. Easton identified him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrel buyer, and live at 4, Edward Place, Deptford—at half-past six on the evening of 3rd May I was in the Princess Royal, Regent Street, Deptford—Geal and six of us were there—the prisoner came in, when Geal, who had been playing dominoes, was just dosing off to sleep against the fire—the prisoner called my brother and went out—when he came in he sat down next to Geal, and put his hand into his pocket and pulled out bronze and silver, and put it into his own pocket—as he did so he dropped a shilling, picked it up and put it on the table, and said "Here is three pots of beer"—we said no, we would have nothing to do with it—he then left the house—we after-wards woke Geal up and spoke to him, and gave him the shilling, which was lying on the table for him—we did not stop the prisoner because we were frightened we might get knocked down—I knew him; he has been about Deptford all his life; he is a fighting man or something—I saw silver and bronze in his hand when he took it from the pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been in the house about a quarter of an hour before the prisoner came in—the other men had been in all the afternoon as far as I know—I knew the prisoner's name—there is no police-station near the Princess Royal; Lower Road and Blackheath are the nearest—the prisoner put his hand in the prosecutor's right-hand trousers pocket—he was sitting on the prosecutor's right side—I was on his other side—Robert Sitting is my brother—the other lads were playing dominoes sitting round the table in front of the fire—I said nothing to the Magistrate about the prisoner dropping a shilling, and saying "There are three pots of beer for you"—I did not hear the prisoner ask my brother to lend him money; he went out to the back and asked him—I did not go for a policeman, nor did I go to the station—I had a bag, and went</p>

               <p>other women—I remained there, and about 8 o'clock Tullett entered the shop without his coat, and I saw Pope looking through the shop window—Tullett saw me and left hurriedly—they went in opposite directions—I was standing behind a partition, and heard Tullett say "Is Mr. Purdie in?"—the woman said "No, but Mrs. Purdie is"—he said "Never mind about Mrs. Purdie; I want to see Mr. Purdie"—Mrs. Purdie said "He has gone to his club; he will be back in a minute"—I got the shop door closed, and then went into the shop, and asked Tullett and Pope to step into the shop parlour—I then closed the door and stood against it—Mrs. Purdie was inside—she pointed to Pope and said "You are the one who sold the things to my husband"—Pope said "What, me?"—she said "Yes, you, and the one with you"—that was Tullett, who made no reply—Pope said "You are not going to stop me; come away from that door, or I will murder you"—there was a struggle, and he attempted to put his right hand into his right trousers pocket—I seized him—a violent struggle ensued, and I received several blows—I took Tullett in custody—Sergeants How and Wright arrived after the struggle—going to the station Tullett said "I shall get five years for this; I know what you have got me for, that job at Greenwich, and I have got a wife and two children at home starving"—he struggled and struck me several times, but with assistance he was secured.</p>

On 25th March about 1.30 I was called to this shop—I examined it, and on the 27th I went with another constable to Mr. Purdie's, 1, Wellington Street, Deptford, a secondhand clothes shop. I saw his wife and went up to a bedroom, where I found on a table portions of watches broken up, which have been identified—the insides of the watches have been taken out, they have been identified—I found a quantity of other things broken up—I found this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and another on the table and some tools; pincers, three bradawls, a screwdriver, some watch glasses, two bottles for testing jewelery, and this machine for weighing gold; I went back at 8.30 and found the shop closed, I looked in and saw Divall struggling with Pope. Tullet saw me and sat down, Mrs. Purdie pointed to Pope and said "That is the man who brought the watches to my husband"—I told them they would have to go to the station; Howell took Pope and Divall took Tullet, who struck Divall, I took hold of him—he said "I know what you want me for, it is for the Greenwich job, why don't you take the right man?"—at the station Tullet said to me "On Sunday afternoon I was lying on the bed, and two chaps came and knocked at the door, and asked me if I could <hi rend="italic">fence</hi> some watches for them," that means sell them. "I said 'No, that is not in my line;' they went away, I went in and had my tea.</p>

I should not have given so much if I had thought they were not well worth the money"—I said "You will be charged with stealing and receiving them," he said "I did not steal them, I bought them"—I took him to the station, the charge was read over to him, he made no reply—at 8.30 I returned to the house and saw the prisoner struggling with Divall; Mrs. Purdie pointed to Pope and said "That is the man who brought the watches here, and that other one was with him"—I said "Have you any doubt about it?"—she said "Not at all, they are the two men"—I said to Pope "You will be charged with stealing a quantity of jewelery at a pawn-shop in Blackheath Road"—he made no reply, but at the station when he was charged he said "When?"Isaid "On Saturday night"—he said "I can prove I was at Greenwich, the Magistrate can prove that"—he then looked at Tullett and said "I am going to make a clean breast of this and tell the truth, about 4.30 on Sunday afternoon three men came to my house and called me out of bed, they showed me some watches and wanted me and Tullett to go and <hi rend="italic">fence</hi> them; they were in a white pocket handkerchief; I put them in my pocket and some time after I handed them back to one of the men, and said 'I shall not carry them, carry them yourself; he put them into his pocket, and I do not know what he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with them; I have not seen them since"—they were then charged, they made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bunston, a jeweller, 53, Tranquil Vale, Blackheath—on 26th April, a little before 6 o'clock, I was in the shop; an assistant was sitting at work—the prisoner came in, and asked to look at the engagement rings—I went to the window and took some out; one large case and two small ones—I showed them to him, and among them the one that I afterwards missed—he chose one, and said that he wanted a case for it—I told him he could have one of the cases I was showing him—he said they would not do; it must be a plain one, as he should want the initials and date on it—I told him I had not one, but I could get him one—he said that would do, and I was to let him have it on Friday—he gave me the name of Oakley, Blenheim Lodge, Blackheath Park—I fetched a book from the desk at the back of the shop to take down the address; I had to turn my back to the counter to get it—he gave me three initials and the date to be engraved on the case—I wrote the name and address in the book on the counter; I closed the book and walked round the counter to open the door to let him out;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188805280108"/>
               <p>I then turned back to the counter to put the rings in the window again, and missed a Mizpah ring from the small case; it was one of the rings I had shown him, and he tried it on his little finger, and it would not quite fit—it was worth two guineas—as I let the prisoner out he made a few remarks about a dog that was lying on the mat—on missing the ring I spoke to my husband, and he and the assistant left the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was in the shop three or four minutes—I showed him a good many rings, and as I showed them they were left on the counter—we only kept one Mizpah ring of that pattern; it had a diamond in it—the assistant was sitting at the other side of the shop at work.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the room immediately behind the shop reading the paper—my wife spoke to me directly after the prisoner left—I looked about to be sure the ring had not been dropped; I then sent my assistant to Mr. Oakley's—I followed him, and when I got there I saw the prisoner in a railway carriage—I said to him "You have been up to Mr. Bunston's, I believe"—he said "Yes"—I asked him if he would get out with me, as there was a mistake; something was missing; the train was just upon starting—he said "I have an engagement to keep in town"—I said "You will have to keep mine first"—I told him there was a ring missing—he said "I will give you my name and address if you like"—I told him that was not good enough; he had given me one already—he said "Who did you send up to Mr. Oakley to inquire for?"—I said "Mr. Oakley"—he said "I did not tell Mrs. Bunston to send the ring to Mr. Oakley; I told her to send it to Mr. Forbes, care of Mr. Oakley"—we went on to New Cross, and there got out, and I took him to Blackheath Road Station—he there gave the name of At Thomas first, and then Henry Bertram Thomas—he had a third-class railway ticket, but was travelling first.</p>

I am a jeweler, of 2, Albion Road, Woolwich—on 30th April I went to bed about 11.30, having seen my doors and windows fastened—about 3 a m. my wife aroused me, and I got up, and went to the bedroom door, and saw a man standing on the landing, about two stairs down—his back was towards me, but to the best of my belief it was the prisoner—he ran down, and I ran after him in my night-shirt to the street door—he was joined by another man at the foot of the staircase—they both ran through the kitchen and through the back yard, and got off the premises—I raised an alarm and the police came—I missed three watches, a watch-key, a token, two or three silver rings, three lockets, and four pairs of ear wires, most of which were in a glass case on the counter—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine; it was hanging in the window—I found this pair of boots, not belonging to me, in the back parlour, and the broken screw-driver on the kitchen floor—the kitchen window had been forced open—I noticed marks outside the frame, as if some instrument had been used—a door from the kitchen into the house had been forced open—the top bolt had been withdrawn and the bottom one doubled up.</p>

I am deputy at the lodging-house, 2, Rope Yard Rails, Woolwich—the prisoner has lodged there six months off and on—on 30th April, about 9 p.m., he went out with another man, and did not sleep there that night—I did not see him till next morning about 7 o'clock, when he was lying on the kitchen floor without his boots—I roused him up and said "Wellard, what are you doing here?"—he said "I could not get home all night; I slept at my brother's"—I said "Where are your boots?"—he said "I had to leave them behind or else myself"—the boots produced are his—I recognise them by this piece on the sole, because he was mending them before that, and I noticed the curious way he put this rough piece of leather on—I went away, and did not see him any more—I noticed next morning that he had two rings, one on each little finger—one was a chain ring, with a shield at the top—I asked him to show them to me, but he never took them off his fingers—I had never seen them before—he remained there till he was taken in custody on the 7th.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I live at 39, Bermondsey Square, and sell ice creams—on the Saturday before 30th April, I was with my barrow outside my shop—the two prisoners came up; two other men came up afterwards—the two prisoners pushed against me, and knocked me to the ground—one of them got hold of the bottom of my trousers and turned me over, and Williams hit me with his fist by the ear—Buckley was kicking me while Williams held me on the ground—they felt in all my pockets and took out all the money I had—I had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my jacket pocket in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in coppers in a pocket in my apron—I could not say who took the money—directly the two prisoners held me on the ground, the other two men came up and helped in knocking me about, and took my money away—the four were on me, and they were all holding me and searching my pockets.</p>

I told the same at the police-station as I have now—I accused the four of you—I did not understand the interpreter well at the Police-court—I told the policeman the four men robbed me, and I said "These are two of the men who have been robbing me, and knocking me about."</p>

I live at 162, Lime Platnitz, Lime Street, New Kent Road, and am a porter—on Saturday evening, 28th April, between 20 minutes and a quarter to 6, I came out of my place facing Collier's Rents, Long Lane, and saw a disturbance in the road, and crowds of people—I went and looked, and saw Buckley on the top of the prosecutor, pummel-ling him, using his fists and elbows—I saw Williams deliberately kick him, and two other men that got away were in the tussle with the others—they went away when the prosecutor was released—I shoved Buckley off the prosecutor, and as soon as the prosecutor was so released, he ran away, leaving his barrow and everything till the police came—before the constable came up another witness struck Williams off and shoved him</p>

               <p>away—then the police came, and the prosecutor could not be found, and we looked round and saw him a good step down the street, standing at a corner, and we called him up—the two prisoners were there, the constable, and the other witness; I told the prosecutor to give the prisoners in charge—they made him understand, and he said "Yes"—I went to the station, where he charged the prisoners with knocking him about and robbing him.</p>
               <p>

I am a labourer, living at 15, St. George's Place—on this evening I came out of doors, and saw the Italian sitting on his barrow—the two prisoners came along, and both knocked him down with their fists—Williams kicked him on the head after he got him down, and I took Williams away from him—I believe they would have killed him if it had not been for me—I believe about four minutes elapsed from the time they stopped knocking him about till the constable came—I did not hold Williams; they did not run away, they stopped there till the constable came—Buckley only hit him.</p>

I am a leather manufacturer, of 161, Bermondsey Street—I was present at part of this disturbance—I saw a scuffle taking place, a sort of fight, and the prosecutor seemed to break loose from them, and return to his barrow, as though going on with his business—then some one came and dragged him away, and began striking him—he seemed to defend himself, and then three or four appeared to be striking at him at one time—after that the man struggled away, and got to his barrow a second time, and then the same men dragged him away again, and made a great many blows at him, knocking him into the road—I thought I would leave and call the attention of the police on my way home—I cannot identify any one, but I have a strong impression, especially as to Buckley, being engaged in it—both men had marks; they were taken on the spot.</p>
