             . I am an officer of the Excise, on Tuesday the 16th of March between one and two in the morning, Mr. Motes and I was going down Virginia-street, at the corner o Trott's court , Mr. Motes saw a stick lie with the and under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050004"/> slap of the cellar-window, he said to me, here is somebody here; he went and pull'd open the cellar-door and call'd out, I see a man. We had cutlasses and lanthorns in our hands: I said to him, they shall not come up, so we clap'd the door down and I stood upon it; my friend stood close by me, and we call'd out, thieves! thieves! some time: I apprehend they made a push to get out, but I kept beating with the stick, and they went back farther into the cellar: then Mr Fontoloroy , who lives just by, handed me a musket out at his window; I took it, and said I valu'd no body: ( fearing thieves without before) By this time we had alarm'd Mr. Wilson, another neighbour, who with Mr. Fontoloroy came to us; when they came they ask'd where the thieves were, I said in the cellar; then the door was pull'd open. I and Mr. Fontoloroy went down into the cellar; the first that I saw was the prisoner Horner; I took hold of him, saying, Come along. As I pull'd him there was assistance on the stairs that took hold of him and led him up. I went farther back in the cellar , then I saw White with a Pistol in his hand, who held it right against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it charg'd?</p>
               <p>Shrumsher . It was drawn before the Justice; it was loaded four fingers deep; there was in it a large slug, and above twenty shot.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you seize him?</p>
               <p>Shrumsher . I told him, I did not care for his pistol; and Mr. Fontoloroy , who was by my side with his musket charg'd in his hand, told him, if he did not drop his pistol, he would shoot him; then he lowered the muzzel of his pistol, but did not drop it: We took hold of him, and brought him up. When he was up in the court, I saw a great clasp-knife lying by his foot, but did not see it fall. Then I saw something in his hand; said I, what have you got here? He held it fast; says I, I will have it, which was a bottle with gunpowder in it; then we tied them, and took them to the Watch-house, and sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fontoloroy . I was alarmed this Night between 1 and 2 o'clock by the cry, Thieves , &amp;c. I step'd out of my bed, and took a gun, that I keep loaded by me for my safety. I threw up my sash , and said, I would shoot him dead, thinking some honest body had been overpower'd, by hearing the noise of sticks: said I, Where are they? One of these Gentlemen of the Excise said, Here are thieves in this cellar; when I found they were in the court, I went to the stair-case window, and put up the sash, and said, who are you? They said, we belong to the Excise , &amp;c. I gave them my gun ready cock'd and prim'd: said I, keep them in, I will be with you presently ; then I ran up, put my cloaths on, and brought a bayonet and a sword with me ; when I came to Mr. Rogers's cellar , there were there two gentlemen belonging to the Excise: said I, here is a sword for one, and a bayonet for the other: said I, give me the gun , and I'll warrant you we'll secure them. So the last witness and I went down both together ; the first we saw was Horner , I kept my gun presented towards him: said I, Surrender, which he did without any great trouble. We took him up stairs , and the persons there secured him; then we went down again, and we look'd in the first cellar ( for it is a double cellar under the whole house) then we turned on the left hand, and went into the other cellar, and on the right hand side in the farther corner stood White; we had lights with us , I could see, by the light of my lanthorn , his pistol directed to us; as we came in at the door I sprung myself forward, that he should not take hold of the muzzle of my gun; he seem'd hesitating ; I threw my piece back with my right hand, and, with my left, took hold of his pistol, and took it out of his hand; it was loaded as before described ; in his other hand he had this piece of a sword or tuck. It is a dangerous weapon, I know not what to call it. The bolt of the door was found in the morning in the cellar; there was another piece of iron found, it is an instrument made use of to splice roaps with, and with which, it is very probable, the door was wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. I was one of the persons that followed these two last witnesses into the cellar, I saw all their instruments after taken, and found they had been poysing to coleway open the door with the instrument last mentioned .</p>

I gave him some; he asked me, if it was all ? I told him; it was not; he asked for more, I gave him a thimble, a knife, and some other things; he said, what must he do with that trumpery? and gave it me again; then I gave him all I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be by the coach side?</p>
               <p>S. Barker. About ten minutes, within two yards of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain this is the man?</p>
               <p>S. Barker . The moon shone in his face directly, and I know him to be the man. I am very positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again?</p>
               <p>S. Barker. Yes; as I was going through the Park to Chelsea on foot, he was going into London, and I towards Chelsea; it was between the two centinels boxes, on the Mall, my Mamma was with me, I asked her, if she knew that man? Says she, that is the man that robbed us, &amp;c. We stopped, and looked at him, and he looked back again . We went on to Chelsea. I told the gentleman with me, there we had met such a person .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this?</p>
               <p>S. Barker. I was along with Mr. Matherson, and saw him again in Jew's Row; I said, there is the man that robbed me. Mr. Matherson said, be sure what you do. I said, he is the man. Says he, here a man's life at stake; he said, get out of the coach, and be fully convinced. I got out , and went towards the prisoner, and asked him, if he knew where Mr. Bates the baker lived? He told me , a little higher. I went from him, and said, if I had not seen the man, I should have known him by his voice. This was Feb. 25.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what did you remark of him to know him by?</p>
               <p>S. Barker. He has a remarkable look about his eye. When he robbed me he had a white duffel coat on; and he had the same on in the Mall , and the same handkerchief ; and likewise , when we took him, he had the same.</p>
               <p>Cross examined .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner before you was robbed ?</p>
               <p>S. Barker. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many passengers was in the coach?</p>
               <p>S. Barker . There was my Mamma, myself, a servant maid, and a little master. Mamma and I sat with our faces to the horses; Mamma sat on my right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side the coach did he come to?</p>
               <p>S. Barker . To my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear the prisoner is the person that robbed you?</p>
               <p>S. Barker . My Mamma and I took our oaths he is the person before Justice Ellis.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the colour of his horse?</p>
               <p>S. Barker . I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you see the prisoner in the Park?</p>
               <p>S. Barker . I believe it was betwixt 1 and 2 in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him on the 25th of February, did you then have him seized?</p>
               <p>S. Barker. A gentleman went for a constable, and took him up in Chelsea then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>S. Barker. I lived then in King's Road, Chelsea .</p>

             . I can only repeat the same that has been already said by my daughter, which I am ready to do. On the 13th of January, between the hours of 8 and 9 at night, we were attacked in the coach going to Chelsea ; the prisoner at the bar rid by the coach, and looked in. My daughter said, I wish that man has no ill design upon the coach; he was drinking at the Turnpike, as the coachman told me, when we went by; he rode by us, said I, I wish he would ride slower, and guard the coach; by and by my daughter saw him turn, he rid up to the coach, and, with an oath, demanded her money. She then gave him some things , a thimble, a knife, and some little oranges , with some money. He said, what can I do with these? So, with an oath, gave her them again. I think I heard my daughter say thank'y; he asked her, if that was all? She said, No; two or three times he asked her: At last she said, she had no more; and added, if he doubted it, she would get out of the coach, and he should search her; he felt her hand for rings, and stripped her glove off her hand to see. In the interim I pulled off my glove with my ring in it, to shew him my hand, which I did, and said, you may see I have no ring. He asked me for my money, and the other woman : She said, she had but a few half pence . He asked the young gentleman for his money : Who said , pray don't shoot me, I have no money . After a time, he said to the coachman , you may drive on.</p>

            . I went from London to Chelsea on the 25th of Feb. with Mrs. Frankling and Mrs. Barker; all of a sudden Mrs. Barker seem'd to change countenance; says I, what is the matter with you all on a sudden? Says she, Mamma, there is the man that robb'd us; said I, look out of the window, and see: She looked out, and said, that is the man. Says I to Mrs. Frankling, it is a matter of very great concern to take away a man's life. She and her Mother looked at him some minutes, she said, I am sure he is the man. Said I, you are to be certain; you had better get out of the coach , and I'll go along with you. Said she, if I can hear his voice, I shall be more sure, if possible . Said I, I shall not assist you till I find you are sure . She went, and asked him, if he knew where Mr. Bates , a baker , lived? He answered her, somebody else answered her too, and said , you'll see bread in the window. She said, when she was past him, I am sure that is the man; I know it is his voice, who robb'd me. That's all I know.</p>

             Mar's in Chelsea: I was in the coach the 13th of Jan. when it was robb'd; I and my young master sat with our backs to the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good sight of the man that robb'd you?</p>
               <p>S. Hardy. I could not see him very plain; one of the wooden windows of the coach was drawn up on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you were stopp'd?</p>
               <p>S. Hardy. It might be about 8 o'clock; St. Clement's clock had struck 7 before we came from the Strand .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the prisoner at the bar is the man?</p>
               <p>S. Hardy. I do not believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man that robb'd you say to you?</p>
               <p>S. Hardy . He ask'd me for my money and rings; he felt of both my hands for my rings .</p>
               <p>Q. Upon feeling your hands , had he a hand like the hand of a hard working man, or was it soft ?</p>
               <p>S. Hardy. A very soft one; and, by the light of the moon, seemingly white; I did not take him to be a working man. I said before Justice Ellis, when the prisoner was taken up, I could not swear he was the man; and I do not now think he is the man; the same I told the Justice then: The man that robb'd us was with us about ten minutes. I did not hear him swear at all. I think the man that robb'd the coach was not so lusty .</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd ?</p>
               <p>S. Hardy . He had on a light duffel coat , almost new, and a dark brown wig.</p>
               <p>Cross examined .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face that robb'd the coach?</p>
               <p>S. Hardy. I saw but one side of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it for matter of light?</p>

            . I drove the coach that day: I am the owner of it. I have known the prisoner at least seven years; there were but few days, these three or four last years past, but I have seen him two or three times a day. I verily believe he is not the man that robb'd the coach. I am positive he is not the man. I had a view of the face of him that robb'd the coach for a little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his voice like the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Clark. It was not. I told Justice Ellis I believed the prisoner was not the man; and that he was a man of a fair character; I cannot say I know the guilty person; but I am satisfied this is not he.</p>
               <p>Cross examined .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never make any declarations you knew the man that robb'd the coach?</p>
               <p>Clark. The last time my coach was robbed was the 24th of February last. One person I believe robbed it three times: Then his horse was very much tired. When I came home, I said , I had been robbed again; and , I added, I would have been hanged if I could not have brought him into that place in an hour's time. That man , who robbed the coach , was no way so big as the prisoner, nor his voice, nor manner of behaviour . My coach has not been robbed since Mudget was taken.</p>

Before they left my lodge they took down my bed, and took off one of the sheets, and doubled that one up so that I could not go to bed without shoving that down before my feet into the bed, and the next day the 13th, they came again, and I examined them about their playing that trick with my bed; and then Mr. Shafaley bringing the oil and minuting it down in my pocket-book, [which was shewed .] I always enter things down in this book as I pay for them, from these things I well remember the night.</p>

Mr. Turberfile was going by at the same time, he seemed not to understand what they were upon; he turned about and after observing them said, Are you at that Sport; then have at you. I believe he did not strike them; they took to their heels, the prisoner ran towards the New Church, there he stumbled and fell, Mr. Turberfile was foremost, and I close behind him; so by that means we secured him. We had more assistance come by my calling out Watch! Watch! the watch was drop'd down betwixt the prisoner's legs. Mr. Hussey took it up; the buckles and strap were brought to me by two different hands who picked them up the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Turberfile . I know the prosecutor from that night ; I was passing by at the time I saw three men up against the wall together, I suspecting they were at no good went up and asked them what they were about, the prisoner and one other ran and left the prosecutor; one ran up Eagle-court, and the prisoner ran towards the New-church. I cannot swear this is the man I took, I was not at the Justice's the next day; the watch was found on the ground between his feet where I took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man that was robbing the prosecutor is the man that stumbled and fell, and him that you took?</p>

I am a watchman, I heard the cry Watch, at little Drury-lane end, I ran down the lane with my lanthorn and staff, and saw these four gentlemen and the prisoner; he had a bloody nose: Mr. Fleming gave me charge of the prisoner, I charg'd four of them to assist me; the prisoner much oppos'd going with me, I was obliged to give him some blows to quell his obstinacy ; so we took him to the Watch-house.</p>

What do you want, friend? says he, your money you dog! he began to grabble in my right-hand pocket; but my right-hand being a little lame, I put my money on my left side: in this time the watchman was knock'd down and his light put out, he was crying out for mercy, there were two upon him: he knowing the prisoner at the Bar, inadvertently said, Macklocklin , I did not use you so when I had you two days and a night in custody for knocking a man down, and when I lent you my hat to go before the Justice; he speaking that word, they made him cry out more and more, O Lord! O Lord! have mercy on me: Said I, pray gentlemen don't commit murder; I have money, take it, it is in my left pocket; so the man that knock'd me down, put his hand in my pocket and pull'd out my money ; by my intreaties they seemed a little softned , the other two left the watchman and came to me, so they all had a hand in robbing of me, they took my watch: said I, take it and welcome; the prisoner came to my buckles , he began with my left foot, and the other two took out my right shoebuckle .</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Tribe. One guinea in gold, and 16 s. in silver; the man that knock'd me down took that, they got off me and left me lying against the bank; they had haul'd the watchman at a distance from me, and pull'd him by the legs into a ditch: said I, you have been so good as not to hurt me, pray be so good to help me up; one of them gave me his hand and helped me up: I was no sooner on my legs but one of them (I suppose the prisoner) took me a violent blow on my head and said, Deliver! and took off my hat and wig: I said, gentlemen, I thought I had delivered: said he, Deliver your all you dog? said I, I have a disorder in my head , and I am fearful of catching cold in my head ; I am afraid of an ague, &amp;c. Said I, please to give me my hat or wig, I should be oblig'd to you: one of them held his hand in my wig towards me, and said, D - n you: said I, will you please to give it me? he said nothing: said I, shall I be so bold to take it? so I took my wig and put it on my head; then I asked him for my hat also: one of them said, D - n you, you will ask for all again presently? No, said I, gentlemen , I will not; please to give it me, and I shall be obliged to you. With that they made a grumbling and went off towards White-chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you light enough to discern the prisoner's face?</p>
               <p>Tribe. I could see them coming to me by the light of the lanthorn; but when the light was out I could not. I can swear to the prisoner's face, and by his short hair, and that remarkable lock behind.</p>

            . As I was going to light Mr. Tribe home the 29th of March, about eleven o'clock from Mile-end to Bow, we went 'till we pass'd the Plough, it was half way between Mile-end and Bow, there came one man up. I got near the ditch to let him pass me; when4 he came just to me he ask'd if that was the way to White-chappel; I said, It is as straight as you can walk: I turned my head about , and the prisoner at the bar gave me a blow on the side of my head with something he had in his hand; I took it to be a hanger; I knew him before, as having him in my custody, as mentioned before; it was about six weeks before this: after I was down the other man took me by the legs and dragg'd me into the ditch , and the prisoner jump'd on my breast: I said, Why do you use me so barbarously; I did not use you so Maclocklin when I had you in my custody two days and a night? &amp;c. Said I, You cannot expect a great deal from a poor watchman: they took one shilling and fourpence from me; it was the other man that took it; they searched my pockets and took an old knife; the other spoke I believe in Irish ; they took my hat and wig, and left my hat with another man that was lying bound in the field that same night: When they left us, we went on; I got my lanthorn done up and I went back again, going along I found Mr. Tribe's hat in the field ; they had left it there.</p>
               <p>John Hill. I am a constable; I was going round the parish to collect my money, I went into the house call'd the Three Mackerels , there was the prisoner, I took him there: Said the prisoner, The watchman was very much abus'd, and I did it; this was the 31st of March: I say, said he, I am the man that did it; I went and call'd the watchman that was abus'd and secur'd the prisoner: the watchman said, That is the man that abus'd me and stamp'd on my breast .</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence . Last Friday when I came in to the place where the gentleman was, I said to the landlord, Let us have a pot of beer: I had not been at Mile-end for five weeks before that :<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050011"/> said the landlord to me, Here is a thing lodg'd against you, and I am very sorry to hear it; said he, There has been a man robb'd and a watchman beat, and it is laid on you: Upon me, said I, How can that be? I have been out of Mile end these five weeks? With that Mr. Hill came and looked at me very earnestly, and ask'd my name; I told him, he goes and brings a watchman and another gentleman, and I had a house full of them about me, and they took me up; I have witness to prove I was in my lodging that night by seven o'clock, and in bed before nine.</p>

            . I have a deputation from the Customs to seize prohibited goods. On the 22d of September 1747 I was stationed out of Statnham Bay , just by Pool: I was under the North shore, I examined a Cutter I suspected to be a Smuggler; after quitting her, I had fight of the Three-Brothers; I discovered her to the Eastward , after discovering her she put before the wind at N.N.W. I gave chase with all the sail I could make. I chased her from before five in the afternoon till about eleven at night. After firing several shot at her, I brought her to, and took charge of her. I went myself on board, and found she was loaded with tea, brandy, and rum. The tea was in canvas and oil-skin, over that the usual package for tea intended to be run; there was a delivery of it, forty-one hundred three quarters gross weight, in eighty-two parcels; there were thirty-nine casks of rum and brandy, eight and four gallons casks, slung with ropes, in order to load upon horses, as smuggled brandy commonly is; there were seven persons in the Cutter, I cannot say any of the prisoners at the bar were there. I carried these goods to the <placeName id="t17490405-36-crimeloc160">Custom-house at Pool</placeName>

            , Esq; I am Collector of the Customs at Pool. On the 22d, or 23d of September Captain Johnson brought a vessel, whose name was given to me to be the Three-Brothers. She had burden two ton of tea, thirty-nine casks of brandy and rum, and a small bag of coffee. The tea was put in the upper part over the Custom-house all together, except one small bag, which was damaged, which we put by the chimney. We made it secure; but it was took away.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us an account how?</p>
               <p>Milner. On the 7th of October, between two and three in the morning, I had advice brought me, by one of the Officers, that the Custom-house was broke open; the staples were forced out of the posts, about five or six foot farther there was another door broken; at the door of my office the upper pannel was broke in pieces, as if done with a hatchet; by which means they could more easily come at the lock, which was broke, and another door, leading up into the ware-house, was also broke in pieces. So that there was a free passage made up to the tea ware-house, and the tea all carried off, except what was scattered over the floor. Most of the bags having been opened about an inch or two, to see what a condition it was in, and one bag of about five or six pounds, and the bag of coffee. They never attempted the brandy and rum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body ever come to claim the brandy and rum?</p>
               <p>Milner. No, it was condemned in the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tea in such sort of package as the East-India Company have?</p>
               <p>Milner. No, Sir, it was pack'd as is usual for run tea, and the brandy was in small casks all slung.</p>

             that set all our names down; this was about three or four days before we went to Pool, we had no arms with us at that time. The Monday after we met at Rowland's Castle ; they were all there, except Kingsmill and Fairall; they were armed , when they met, with blunderbushes , carbines, and pistols ; some lived thereabouts, and some towards Chichester. So we met there to set out all together: When we came to the forest of Bare, joining to Horn-dean , the Hawkhurst gang had got a little horse, which carried their arms; we went in company till we came to Lindust ; there we lay all day on Tuesday, then all the prisoners were there: Then we set out for Pool in the glimpse of the evening, and we came to Pool about eleven at night .</p>

             staid there to look after them. We went forward, and, going along, we met a lad, a fisherman going to fish, we kept him a prisoner: When we came to the Custom-house, we broke open the door; there were two men who lay in the under part of it, we took them prisoners too; then we broke open the door of the inside; and , when we found where the tea was, we took it away: There was about thirty seven hundred , three quarters. We brought it to the horses, and slung it with the slings, and loaded our horses with it; the horses were, as near as I can guess , two or three hundred yards off the Custom-house. We sackt it in what we call horse-sacks to load; the five prisoners at the bar were there. Then we went to a place called Fording-bridge , there we breakfasted, and fed our horses. There were thirty one horses, and thirty men of us; the odd horse was for the East-country men to carry their arms .</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners assist in breaking the Custom-house?</p>
               <p>Raise. I saw Fairall and Kingsmill carry tea from the Custom-house to the horses. When we came to a place called Brook , there we got two pair of steelyards, and weighed the tea, and equally divided to each man his share ; it made five bags a man, about twenty-seven pound in a bag ; the two men, that held the horses , had the same quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all arm'd, are you sure?</p>
               <p>Raise. There were twenty of us all arm'd at Rowland's Castle .

               <p>Q. How came they by their arms?</p>
               <p>Steel. They had them from their own houses , as far as I know . I do not remember one man without; some had pistols, some blunderbusses ; all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050014"/> the Hawkhurst men had long arms, flung round their shoulders. Fairall, alias Shepherd, had a hanger. We went from Rowland's Castle ; when we came to the forest of Bare, we were joined by the Hawkhurst gang, this was of a Monday night, there were Kingsmill and Fairall, they had got a little horse, to carry their arms, that would follow a grey horse one of them rode on; there were about seven of them. We went from Dean to Lindost , and, when we set out from thence to Pool, we were all armed; we all look'd of our fire-arms, to see if they were prim'd. Shepherd, Staymaker, and Glover, were arm'd just before we came to Pool. There was one Willis and Stringer came and met us about a mile out of town; one of them said, it was impossible to be done. We all turned our horses about, and were going back again. And the East-countrymen said, if we would not do it, they would go and do it themselves. Then came Stringer to us, and said, it might be done very easy. We turned our horses again, then we came to a little lane, and every man got off, and tied our horses up to a rail, which was put along a Common. There were thirty-one horses, we left them under the care of

             and Perrin; we, every man, went into Pool, except them two; we went to the Custom-house, and broke it open. I, and another, went to a Key, to see that no-body came to molest us. When I came back again, the Custom-house was broke open; they said, it was done with iron bars. They were carrying the tea when the other man and I came to them, we found the strings, and tied it together, and carried it away to a gravelly place, where we laid it down . Then we fetched our horses to the place, and loaded them, and carried it away. Then we went to a place called Fording-bridge , we baited our horses, and refreshed ourselves. We loaded, and went to a place called Sandy-hill ; but, at a place called Brook, before we came to this place, we got two pair of steelyards , and weighed the tea, and it came to five bags a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the tea to your horses, or did you bring the horses to the tea?</p>
               <p>Steel. We carried the tea to a plain place convenient for loading. Then we brought the horses forward to be loaded.</p>

            . I remember the time this tea was seized upon. I was at the consultation in Charlton Forest ; there we concluded to go after the tea; this was at a noted tree that stood in the forest, called the Centre-tree. I do not know whether either of the prisoners were there. I was not at Rowland's Castle, I was, with others of the company, on a Common just below.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the prisoners at the house you was at?</p>
               <p>Fogden. No, not one. At the forest of Bare there were, I believe, all the five prisoners . We met together at a lone place there; we staid there till these Hawkhurst men came to us; then there were thirty of us in number.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all armed?</p>
               <p>Fogden. To the best of my knowledge they were all armed.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you meet there?</p>
               <p>Fogden. We were going to fetch away the tea that had been taken from us, and lodged in the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050015"/>Q. How did you go to take it? Fogden. By force; we went from thence to Lindost ; we got there in the night, just as it was light: We staid there till near night again; then in the night we went to Pool, and went to the backside of the Town, and left our horses in a little lane. I never was at Pool before this, or since; I believe we left our horses about a quarter of a mile out of town. We left them to the care of two men, Perrin and Lilleywhite. Then we went and broke open the Custom-house. I saw the door broke open with two iron bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get them?</p>
               <p>Fogden . I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the tea lodged?</p>
               <p>Fogden. It was in the top of the ware-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it away?</p>
               <p>Fogden. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the prisoners at the bar concerned in it?</p>
               <p>Fogden. They were there, and did assist as the rest, except the two that held the horses. We brought the horses to a place near, and then carried the tea to them. It was a very narrow lane where we stopped first, and we brought the horses up to a more open place for loading.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners at the bar help you load?</p>
               <p>Fogden. Yes, all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put an equal quantity on each horse?</p>
               <p>Fogden. We distributed it as near as we could. There was one little horse, that carried the arms, had not so much as the other horses had on them. Every horse there was loaded with tea; from thence we went to a little town called Fording-bridge ; at the next place we stopp'd, we weigh'd the tea with two pair of steelyards ; for we thought it was not equal, some was shattered out of some of the bags. Then we divided it as equal as we could; they were quartern bags, each prisoner had five bags.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Lilleywhite first?</p>
               <p>Fogden. In the Forest, I never saw him before .</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there before or after you?</p>
               <p>Fogden. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any threats, if any should discover this affair, what should be done to them?</p>
               <p>Fogden. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Lilleywhite arms when left with the horses ?</p>
               <p>Fogden. I believe he had not.</p>

I know his brother-in-law Richards; and that Glover was about two months with him. Richards is a notorious wicked, swearing man, and reputed a great smuggler; and I can't help thinking he was the occasion of Glover's acting in this.</p>

             . I have known Glover of a child; he was a sober young lad; I never knew him otherwise, or did I ever hear him swear an oath in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear he was a smuggler?</p>
               <p>Housal . Never before this. He lived with his father till the year 1744. His father dying, he followed his business till Aug. 1747. He went in the beginning of June to that wicked brother's house, and was there about two months. He went after that to live <rs id="t17490405-36-deflabel162" type="occupation">servant</rs>

             . I have known Glover these twelve years and upwards. I believe he never was guilty of smugling before this, his character is exceeding good. I never knew him frequent bad company, or guilty of drinking or swearing an oath.</p>
               <p>Woodruff Drinkwater. I have known Glover ever since he was born; I never heard he was reputed a smuggler either before or since, exclusive of this time, his temper is not formed for it at all, far from it; after his father died he was left joint executor with his mother , (left in narrow circumstances) he often came to me on any little occasion for five or ten guineas; he always kept his word; after his mother married again, there was some difference in his family, he went into the country, and I was very sorry for him at his going to Richard's house, and I cannot think he was voluntary in this rash action.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edmonds. I have known Glover ever since the 9th of April last he came to me, and was entered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050016"/> into his Majesty's yard at Deptsord , the day following; he bore a good character before, and during the time he has been with me he has behav'd very well and sober; he obtain'd a good character of all that knew him; I have had as good an opinion of him as any man I know; he was with me 'till the day he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dearing. I live in the parish where this young man was born, I go there for the summer season ; I have known him about eighteen years; I being informed of this bad thing, made me come to London on purpose to say what I knew of him: we in the country had great reason to believe that bad man Richards had corrupted him , he was a well behaved lad before this happened: his uncle came to me, and the young man came and begg'd of his uncle that he would see out for some business for him in some way or other, adding he could not bear to live with Richards; I had just hir'd a servant or I had took him: just after this bad affair happen'd, and he was unfortunately drawn into it.</p>
               <p>The Revd. Mr. Blackden. I live at Slendon in Sussex , the prisoner Glover was my servant, I knew him and his family before; he behaved exceeding well with me as any could, and if he was discharg'd from this I would readily take him again; he attended in religious service publick and private constant; I never heard an ill word or oath from his mouth, or any thing vulgar.</p>

               <p>His defence. I was down in that country, and a person desir'd me to take a ride with him, I agreed upon it, not knowing where they were going; I had no fire-arms, nor was any way concerned.</p>
               <p>Fra. Wheeler. I have known Lilleywhite about six years, he always bore a very good character; a worthy young fellow, he was brought up in the farming under his father, who is a man in very good circumstances, he minded his father's business very diligently: I have known him refuse going out upon parties of pleasure, because he has had business of his father's to do; he married since this affair happened to a woman of fortune; I never heard him charg'd with any such crime as this before.</p>

The prisoner was well dress'd, so I did not ask her about it; when the girl return'd, I ask'd her who had been in my room; saying, my waistcoat was gone: the prisoner said, I hope you don't suspect me? when she got up out of the chair I saw my waistcoat hand down, some part of it below her cloak,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050017"/> I took it from her directly, and she offer'd me 5 s. not to expose her.</p>

The prisoner came into our room and I was alone, she desir'd I would go and fetch her a dram : said I, I cannot go, and I told her the shop was just by, and she might go; for, said I, there is no body in the house but my self: No, no, said she, I must not go out; I may as well have it here that you may drink some: I refus'd going; then she said, Go, huffey , if you don't I shall make you; at last she gave me a penny, and bid me go for a penny worth of anniseed; then I went and met my master; he ask'd me where I was going; said I, For a dram for a gentlewoman that came in a little time ago: After I came back, my master went to the closet, and said he missed his waistcoat, I said, no body had been there but that gentlewoman, (she was drest very well or I would not have gone out for her.) When she got up the waistcoat hung down longer than her cloak from under her arm, and my master took it from her : she went to run out from him and he stop'd her; she said she would give him a crown not to expose her, but he did not let her go; then the neighbours came in and they took her up.</p>

               <p>Fletcher. We went to attack them, they drew up into a body; we ask'd them what they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050018"/> got? they said, nothing for you: we then answered, we would have it all; but there were too many in number for us to take the whole quantity; there might be 200 casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they obstruct you in seizing it?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. Yes they did, by offering to fire upon us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner fire-arms?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he endeavour to obstruct you?</p>
               <p>Fletcher . I did not hear him speak a word: I saw him with two casks, which I took to be brandy, he came up in the manner the others did, and drew all round in a body together , with an intent not to deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. They said they would fire upon us if we molested them: the prisoner was at the right hand of the company, the fire arms were on the other side, and I was within four yards of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner carry away any of the casks that were seized upon the other horses?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. I believe he did not; there was much carried away by the country people.</p>

They bid me cross over to the Rounds. When I had got through the rails, the prisoner was come behind me, and got hold of my cloak, and pulled it, and almost throttled me; then the two men came to me, one of them cut my pocket off; there was in it eleven shillings, and some half-pence, and a silver thimble; I cried out as well as I could. Then John Sergant, the other witness, came up to my assistance. He got hold of the prisoner, she dropped the cloak, and he brought it to me again; he had hold of her; the two men came to him, and told him, if he did not let her go, they would murder him; this was between 8 and 9 o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>M. Perry. I was coming down Chick-lane, and I saw her, I knew her again. I went to the Castle at the bottom of the Lane, so I sent for the man, to see if he knew her again; I was sure it was the same. The Constable, that took her up, is here.</p>

             . I was coming from White-chappel; coming down Long-lane, at this time, to go to Holborn, I heard a woman, when I was at the end of the Lane, cry out in Smithfield, I ran and got over the rails, I saw a woman, she said, she had just been robb'd by two men and a woman, and there they were right before me. I followed them, and overtook the woman just by the bar, she dropp'd the cloak, I took it up, and had hold of her; says I to the prosecutor , is this the woman, says she, it is. I had her in hold about three minutes and an half, or thereabouts, the two men came to me, one with a stick, the other with a stick, and a knife in the other hand; they swore, D - n your eyes and limbs, they would cut my throat, if I did not let the woman go. I let her go; the prosecutor shewed me her pocket where it was cut off at that time, it was as it is now. The prosecutor told me, she was going towards the New-market. We went into an ale-house, and I gave her directions, if ever she found the woman, where to send for me. Last Monday a porter came for me: I went to her; she told me, she had seen the woman, that robb'd her, standing at the end of an Alley in Chick-lane! Said I, stand a while, and we will see if she appears again; we could not see her then, we went away , and came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050020"/> again, and we saw her at the Portobello ale-house. We got a Constable, he was afraid to go into the house, it bore so bad a name . We staid till she came out, then we took her. I can swear this is the woman I laid hold on going through the rails in Smithfield that night.</p>

            . I am the Constable, I took this woman, the prisoner, up upon Saffron-hill between 11 and 12 last Monday. I was afraid to go into the Portobello, it being a house of bad repute. I at last sent a person in to drink a pint of beer, to see what men were in the house; he came out, and said, there were no men in there; we resolved then to go in, as I had two or three men with me. As we were going, we met the prisoner coming out, with two men with her. I secured her, and had her before Justice Fielding, who committed her.</p>

We gave her two old sheets and a tablecloth. She was to give us half a pint of gin for a piece of flowered linnen. She keeps what we may call a Bawdy-house. In looking over the things, she found a mark on one corner; she took a pair of sizors, and cut it off, and flung it in the fire; saying, Why did you bring it thus? Do you know the danger you expose me to? We told her we did not see it.</p>
