                  </hi>. I call myself Baron de Gourelli, and I was convicted in that name last October at this Court, and sentenced to five years' penal servitude, which I am now serving—I was arrested on October 16th, while staying at the Covent Garden Hotel—I had then a quantity of clothing and luggage, and after my arrest I was sent to Holloway Goal on remand—while there I heard the name of Mr. Cudley, a solicitor, of Chancery Lane, and in consequence I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to him—I got no answer, and in consequence I wrote this letter on October 8th. (<hi rend="italic">Asking Mr. Cudley to call and see the prisoner at Helloway, so that he might communi<lb/>cate with his friends</hi>). Soon after I sent that I received a telegram in the name of Cudley, and a few days after the prisoner came and saw me—he represented himself to be Mr. Cudley's clerk, and said that Mr. Cudley had received my letters, and that he had come on Mr. Cudley's behalf for instructions for my defence—I made a statement to him about my own case, and he took a note of it—I made that statement to him believing him to be the clerk to the solicitor who was going to defend me—I think he said the cost would be £20—I gave him the names and addresses of some of my friends—at that first interview I</p>

Dear Sir,—I gave authority to Mr. W. Mason, who came to see me at Holloway and Newgate, stating to be your representative, to take away some luggage from two hotels, and I shall be glad if you will let me know whether you will keep the luggage for me till I am discharged. Kindly also let me know how much money you have paid out for me, so that I may know where I am about it"—the Governor of Lewes Prison told me there was no answer to the letter—I left at the Covent Garden Hotel a coat, several suits of clothes, linen, boots, a hat, etc., worth, I should think, about £30—I was dressing well at that time.</p>

On May 29th I was in Edgware Road, and saw the prisoner on an omnibus—I ran after the 'bus, and the prisoner slid down the rail, and got into the roadway—I jumped at him, and he ducked down and threw me over his shoulder—he then ran away into Upper Berkeley Street—I blew my whistle, and cried "Stop thief"—he knew me—he was stopped by a gentleman, who struck him over the head—I came up, and said, "You know me, Mainstone; I shall take you into custody for stealing £20 and some clothes"—he said, "That is all wrong; it is not so much as that"—we took him to paddington Police-station, and read the circular over to him with his description—he said, "I am in a nice mess now. If my wife had met me I should have gone straight"—I searched him and found on him £6 10s. in gold and 2s. in silver, an umbrella, a watch and chain, two <hi rend="italic">People</hi> newspapers, and a knife.</p>

I was present when the prisoner was charged on May 29th—he made no reply—he gave an address 23, Crickleton Road, Maida Yale—I went there and found this port<lb/>manteau, which has been identified by Bolton—when I returned to Rochester Row I said I had only found one bag—he said, "If you go to Cannon Street Hotel you will find the other.

He had stayed there five days, and the porter had lent him his keys, and nothing had been stolen, and on the Sunday he asked the porter to lend him the keys to get his umbrella. Whilst in the storeroom a civilian came in, who he thought was lodging there, who said he had seen the porter, and he would give him back the keys, so the prisoner came out, leaving him in the store-room. The prisoner had not gone far when the same man came up; he had two portmanteaux and overcoat. He said he was going to Paddington Station, and so they walked together, and the man told the prisoner that he was hard up, and asked the prisoner to lend him</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The prisoner said it was rather a strange request, but the other man said he was willing to leave the bags and coat as a security.

               <p>3.30, I went in the public-house after I had done my work—I saw the prisoner standing against the door of the house—he asked me to have a glass of ale; I had really forgotten the other circumstances—we went inside; I think I called for a glass of ale and a drop of ginger-beer for the prisoner—he said he had clearly altered his mind about what he was talking the day before; that he was really terrified of his wife, and he would like someone to knock her on the head—I thought he was quite foolish, and that he was not right, till he began telling me some other stories—he said, "My wife is very fond of sherbert and water"—I said "Yes"—he said, "On one occasion there was some acid they used in the office; I mixed it up with the sherbert and water, and told her to drink it up quick, but she happened to smell it, and said, 'It has a funny taste, you taste it and I threw it into the fireplace. If it had come off it would have been a pure accident"—that was the first time I got alarmed in the matter—after that, he rambled in his state<lb/>ments, and then he said, "Now, look here, £7 would do you a bit of good, would it not?"—I said "Yes"—he said, "Well, look here, if you meet me in the morning about eleven o'clock I will give you the key of the house; there will only be one lodger left; it will be very easily done, because there is no notice taken of lodgers going in and out. You can walk upstairs and attract the attention of Mrs. Poole, and the matter will be very simple"—he said while I went in and killed his wife he would go for a walk—after that I determined to inform the police of the matter—I pretended to agree with him—he mentioned incidentally that he would be on duty at nine o'clock at night—I waited, and saw him at nine o'clock—he had a glass of ginger-beer, and the house was very crowded, and nothing passed with the exception of "Good evening"—I communi<lb/>cated with the police on that day, and after that acted on their instruc<lb/>tions—I saw him next on the Sunday, May 30th, about eleven a.m., in Lupus Street, about twenty yards from Claverton Street—he beckoned me across the road, and put this letter in my hand—I afterwards handed it to the police. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was read as follows:</hi>—"I find it impossible to come out this morning, but will be out about 3 this afternoon. I will then give you the key. There is a party in now, but will be out about 2 o'clock. There will only be the servant in with her. The <hi rend="italic">misses</hi> has ginger hair. I will leave steps in the first floor front room, not second floor, and a stool, so if it comes off rest her head on stool as if falling off steps on stool. Go in quietly, and come out not seen.</p>
               <p>"Accident' by falling off steps. You will find door wide open; will leave rest to you. Meet me in Rutland Street")—he said, "Read that; I think it is a finer "or "better scheme than the other."—At 2.20 that afternoon I went in the "White Horse" and called for a glass of ale; the prisoner called me out; he had a boy of about 5 years old by the hand—he pointed across to a butcher's shop, and said, "There is the key of the street door"—it was lying on the window sill of the butcher's shop—I went and took it up—I afterwards gave it to the police—this key resembles it—I believe it to be the one—the prisoner said nothing more.</p>

               <p>saw him with a glass of ale, but nothing out of the way—when he made these propositions to me he seemed an altered man; his eyes seemed shifty, and he was looking down and up at me again, and that sort of thing, far different to his expressions on any other occasion—I thought he was in drink on the first occasion because his breath smelt of spirits, and he spoke in a very low tone of voice; and what struck me as peculiar was his drinking ginger-beer, at the same time—when he asked my advice about the servant girl and I told him he would have to put up with the consequences he got very excited and looked very wild for the moment, and made rambling statements—I said to him some<lb/>thing like "We will think it over, and I will see you to-morrow"—I did not want any further conversation; I thought he was not right in his head—on the second occasion, on the Saturday, he said, "I have come to the conclusion it will be better to kill my wife than her/' meaning the servant girl—I thought then he was not in his right mind—his manner was the same as it had been the night before, but more subdued—he said, "There will only be a clergyman in the house, a lodger," and I was to walk upstairs at 11 o'clock in the morning (Sunday), and that he would be there and give me the key of the house, and I was to open the door and walk upstairs and attract the wife's attention, and when she came up I was to commit the deed—he said, "It is only a matter of just knocking her on the head"—on the Sunday morning, when I met him at eleven o'clock, and he handed me the letter, he was alone—he looked to me as if he had been doing some cleaning—he was not dressed—he handed me the letter down the street—there were not many people about—he only just told me to read the letter—I did not read it in his presence, because he told me to pass on, it would not do to be seen together, and I passed on—that was about a hundred yards from his house, in Lupus Street—when he put the letter in my hand he said, "I think that will be a finer thing; it is a fine scheme on my part, and will come off all right"—when I met him in the afternoon, with his little boy, it was about a hundred yards from the house—I did not speak to him then—he told me the key was on the ledge of the butcher's shop, on the same side of the way, about half a yard from where I stood—it is quite possible the boy may have heard what was said—the prisoner was holding his boy by the hand—it was on the Saturday that he said if it came off well he would not mind giving me £7—he never gave me anything—I am a corn porter—I earn 8s. 6d., 9s., or 10s. a day—I do not know if I earn more than the prisoner—he has always behaved as a gentleman—he knew where I was working, and that I was in respectable, straightforward employment, getting good wages—I said nothing about sherbert and water before the Magistrate, except that I called it one of his rambling statements—I be<lb/>lieve I told the police officer about that statement—I did not know the prisoner's name—we were not exactly friends, only nodding acquaintances.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been servant to Mrs. Poole, at 10, Claverton Street, for about four or five months—she takes lodgers—at times the prisoner had intemperate habits—he used to break out occasionally—when in intemperate fits he behaved quietly 'towards his wife, but she could not bear to see him in drink; and knowing he was a postman and had letters it put her about, and she did all she possibly could do to get him to give up drink—he did not ill-treat her in any way—they quarrelled occasionally when he was in fits of intemperance—at other times he was very kind to her and helped her a good deal—there was a pair of ordinary house steps; one step had been broken away for a long time—on the Sunday morning those steps were in a small ante-room on the ground floor; the prisoner put them there on the Saturday morning when Mrs. Poole had finished cleaning the dining room—I saw them in the ante-room at 8 or 8.30 on the Sunday morning—all that Sunday morning the prisoner was at home, and had dinner in the middle of the day—I had no knowledge of the steps being taken upstairs again; there was no occasion for them to be taken up—on the Saturday I saw the prisoner writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the London Stock Exchange at 6, Copthall Court. In March last I had been to Madeira for the benefit of my health, and at the beginning of April came home on board the steamer <hi rend="italic">Teuton</hi>—the prisoner was among my fellow passengers, and I made his acquaintance—in the course of the voyage I cashed a cheque for a fellow passenger in the prisoner's presence—I after<lb/>wards gave him my card, and said, I should be glad to see him at luncheon when he was in the City—he called on me on Saturday, April 23rd, about 1.30—he passed the usual compliments and said that he wanted some money on a country cheque—I said, "I suppose you only want £5 or £10"—he said, "More than that; £30"—he opened a cheque book and expressed surprise that there was no cheque left in it, and said he would write the cheque on paper—I furnished him with paper, and he drew this cheque on a country bank—I got six £5 notes from my banker and gave them to him—we walked downstairs and had a little refreshment, and I left him about 2 o'clock—I sent the cheque to my bank, and it was returned on the 26th marked "Refer to drawer"—I went to the Albemarle Hotel that evening, but the prisoner had left that morning—I wrote him a letter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it and the envelope—it was afterwards produced at the Police-court. by a gentleman appearing for him—I got no answer—on May 25th I applied at the Guildhall for a summons—I got his address from Messrs. Forward—I had consulted my solicitors, and I afterwards got the warrant—on Sunday, June 12th, I was in the Frascati Restaurant, Brighton, and the prisoner came in with a lady—I went out and informed the Brighton police, and he was taken into custody—I did not speak to him—I believed that his cheque was of equal value to money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I met him on the way home from the Canaries to Madeira—he did not give me his Devonshire address, I got it from Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am special manager to the Salisbury branch of the Wilts Bank—the prisoner was a clerk there at a salary of £90—in February this year he was away on leave in consequence of a bicycle accident—he had an account at our bank—I produce a certified copy of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189806200047"/>
               <p>it, by which it appears that on April 7th there was a debtor balance against him of £29 10s—that included the letter of credit which he never received—we had received this letter from him on March 11th from the Grand Canaries—(<hi rend="italic">This requested the bank to send the prisoner a letter of credit for £25, stating that it would slightly overdraw his account, but that he expected to return to England in a fortnight and return to business.</hi>)—in consequence of that, a letter of credit was sent to him on March 28th, and his account was debited with it—if that had never ex<lb/>isted there would still have been a debit of £4 10s.—I think when he forwarded the last letter he did not know that we had sent out a letter of credit to him—we credited him on June 14th with £5 8s. 6d. for salary—there was then a credit balance to him of 18s. 6d.—I produce a copy from the bank books of cheques presented and dishonoured—the first is April 10th for £5; then on April 18th there is one for £20, and on the 26th one for £30; on the 28th one for £15 payable to self—that was drawn on the 26th—all those cheques have been returned dishonoured—we received this letter from the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated April 22nd, stating that he had that day heard that the bank had returned one of his cheques while he was abroad, that he had written to them asking leave to overdraw his account, and receiving no reply considered that they had consented; requesting them to see him on the next Tuesday to settle the account, sending in his resignation and requesting that his pass-book might be made up.</hi>)—he never returned to work, but he came and saw the General Manager.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The result of his not getting the letter of credit was that he was £25 wrong—we received the letter of credit back—Mr. Linton saw the General Manager, and it came out that he had never received the letter of credit, and we sent a telegram—I know now that it is true that he had not received it—he was paid his salary for six weeks, but being away he was credited with it—his aunt or his mother paid in money for him from time to time—his relatives were in the habit of supplying him with money, £90 was not all he had to live on—our dishonouring the cheques was not a question of banker and client; it was banker and clerk; the whole ques<lb/>tion resolves itself into his receiving the letter of credit—I could not tell what the cheques were for, and, therefore, I thought it was better to re<lb/>turn them, out of kindness to him, as a proper check to him—he has always behaved well—he has been in our service eight years—he is en<lb/>titled to the reversion of a large property on his aunt's death, and that was known at the bank—we did not send him notice of the overdraft because we did not know his address—he did not receive information from us that the cheques had been dishonoured.</p>

The account was a very small one—he often took his salary in cash—there is nothing to show in his pass-book that he ever at<lb/>tempted to cash a cheque for £30—I cannot find a single occasion that he has attemped to draw a cheque over £11 before this—when he went to the Canaries he must have got money from his relatives—I cannot find any attempt to draw £30 in a lump.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head manager of the Salisbury Bank, head office, the prisoner came in April, a day or two after this letter, in reference to his not returning and to the state of his account—inquired as to the letter of credit, and he said he had not received it—that was the first time I had heard that—he expressed regret that I had dishonoured his cheques—I reminded him that no arrangement had been made for an overdraft, this letter asking for a letter of credit is addressed to me—he said in it, "I am afraid it will somewhat overdraw my account, but if you will kindly permit me to do so till my return home in a fort-night' time, I shall be grateful"—the matter was referred to me by Mr. Hill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This mischief arises from my thinking he had got the letter of credit when he had not—if that letter of credit had been need he would still have overdrawn his account by £4 10s.—he asked for the letter of credit, as he could not have notes sent to him, because it was not safe to trust them to the post—his relatives were in the habit of sending him money—had he wished to arrange for an overdraft there would have been no difficulty about it, if I was satisfied with the application—I was aware who his relatives were, and what expectations he had, and he knew that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi> The extent to which we should have allowed him to overdraw would entirely depend on circumstances—on the second paid account there is a debit balance of £27 10s.—that includes the £25—I should not have honoured his cheque for £30 without notice.</p>

Allen called upon me—he has also been convicted—he was then a stranger—in consequence of a conversation with him that</p>

               <p>evening, I went with my friend Mr. Gregory, an actor, on to the Embank<lb/>ment side of the Charing Cross District Station, through Villiers Street—I saw Allen outside the station—Mr. Gregory stayed behind and I went and spoke to him—he offered me some pawn tickets and asked for money—he showed me my pocket-book and a visiting card—I gave him either £5 or £10 and received the pawn tickets and other property—I took the tickets to my solicitor, Mr. Wallis—they were handed to the police and subsequently produced in Court, when I gave evidence against Marling, Saunders and Allen, who were convicted in this Court—I also gave evidence against Cliburn—on the trial of Marling and Saunders the visiting card-case was produced and identified by me—I have since destroyed it.</p>

Allen owed me some money, and I went with him that night thinking I should get it, but all I got was a glass of beer"—I searched the rooms at 126, Clarence Road, after I had taken him to the station, haying left another officer there—I found betting books, memoranda, and these two photographs, and three cards with the names and addresses on them—one is a trade card; also two £5 I. O.

                  </hi>. I am a job master, of Listen, in Suffolk—on June 5th, 1884, I was appointed with the prisoner as a trustee of the settlement of Mr. and Mrs. Whistler, which had been made on February 7th—Mr. Henry Peacock who had been appointed trustee was dead, and I took his place—Mr. Temple Lay ton Haig, of Southampton Street, was originally the solicitor, and the prisoner was his managing clerk—in July, 1894, there was a sum of £700 in the hands of we three trustees at the Chancery Lane Branch of the Union Bank on deposit—Mr. Henry Peacock communicated with me by letter, in consequence of which I signed this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on August 1st, 1891—it was signed at tint. time by Mr. Henry Peacock—I signed after him and forwarded it to the prisoner—I did not see the prisoner about the transfer—Mr. Peacock said it was to be invested on mortgage—I saw the prisoner from time to time between 1894 and 1897, and I once asked him if the money was all right—he said, "Yes"—he was then staying with me in Suffolk—it was in August, 1897—he did not say what he had done with it and I did not ask him—Mr. Haig disappeared at the end of last year—I then consulted my solicitor about the trust fund, and then came up to London and consulted Mr. Mills, of Chancery Lane, my solicitor's London agent—I saw the prisoner in Mr. Mill's office, and in his presence on December 23rd Mr. Mills said to him, "Is the trust money secure?"—he said, "Yes"—Mr. Mills asked in what way the money was invested—he said, "There is one mortgage for £500 and one for £200—Mr. Mills asked the names—he said, "I do not know," or "I cannot tell"—Haig's name was not mentioned in connection with the deeds—Mr. Mills asked him whether he had the deeds—he said, "They are intact in the deed-box in Haig's office"—I had no further conversation with the prisoner—he did not say when he had last seen them.</p>

               <p>Haig had bolted—I had not seen Haig with reference to the trust when the prisoner was not present—I did not say at the Police-court., "I saw Haig several times in reference to this trust"—I have seen Haig during the last twelve months—I have seen him and the prisoner together—I have never spoken to Haig about it when the prisoner was present—the prisoner went with me to Collins's office in reference to this trust—I was one of Peacock's executors—he died in January, 1897—I have seen Haig and the prisoner together two or three times in connection with Peacock's case, and never heard any conversation with Haig as to the other trust—I went to Collins with the prisoner—I wanted a fresh solicitor, and he introduced me to Collins—I knew that some of the papers were in Haig's hands—Collins was appointed by me receiver on Haig's estate—I do not remember that he told me that all Haig's papers were in Collins's hands, I cannot remember one way or the other.</p>

I am secretary and manager to the Alliance Assurance Corporation, 24, Moorgate Street—on November 25th, 1889, I bought from Mr. Whistler his life interest in the settlement in question—accounts were furnished to me every six months by Webster and Haig—I advanced the money personally—I received interest from Webster every half-year—this account shown the sum of £200 on mortgage at 5 per cent., and £500 on deposit—I produce an account furnished to me in 1897, a letter received in 1897, and the account accompanying it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In September, 1895, I had an account forwarded to me showing in the first place the £200 as lent on mortgage at 5 per<lb/>cent, but that £500 remains on deposit—the £200 still remains at 5 per<lb/>cent, on mortgage, and the £500 on deposit appears to be changed to a mortgage at 3 1/2 per cent.—these are Mr. Haig's figures—at that time I thought there must be something very strange, for it is very seldom that the interest on so small a sum as £500 is 3 1/2 per cent., and it immediately roused my suspicions, it was too little on so small a property—I had not previously received any letters in Haig's writing—I had a conversation, with Haig as to the investment of the money—Haig and I had an inter<lb/>view as to how the £700 should be invested—it was I who suggested that the money should be invested in the Law Fire Insurance Company, as we thought it might be made more productive than lying fallow at the bank—we should get about 5 per cent. at the Law Fire Office, and then there was a question of the Law Guarantee—that is ordinary shares liable to fluctuation—it is a long time since I saw Haig—I received from Haig the interest on these two supposed mortgages.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Springett's Register,</hi> Mansion House Place—the prisoner was in my employ as canvasser one month—it was his duty to bring orders on a commission of 20 per cent, whether we were paid or not—on March 4th he produced this written order, purporting to come from Mr. Dodd (<hi rend="italic">Ordering a quarter-page advertisement to be inserted for one year.</hi>)—he brought me Mr. Dodd's address, 4, Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—that is the prisoner's writing, I know it well—the advertisement was inserted in the following issue, and on March 4th I paid the prisoner by cheque £3 12s. for two advertisements, and he gave me this receipt—Dodd's was £1 16s.—on March 5th he brought me this: "A. Wingate, cabinet-maker. You can insert my advertisement for one year, to occupy half-page.—A. Wingate"—I paid the prisoner commission on that, believing it was a genuine order—on March 24th I received a proof of an advertisement of Urch and Co, and the block, initialled as approved of, and gave the prisoner a cheque for £3 10s., believing it to be a genuine order—the order is lost—I sent in a quarterly account to each of those three people, and they were all repudiated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I remember at the inquest, when the Jury had retired to consider their verdict, the foreman returned into Court, and asked Dr. Webster that if medical aid had been provided, whether it would have prolonged the child's life—I suggested to the doctor that he—should go into the Jury now, and I went in with him—I then asked Dr. Webster to be recalled, and asked if the neglect to provide; medical aid had accelerated death, and the doctor hesitated sometime and then asked if yes or no was required of him, and I told him to answer to the best of his ability—I don't remember his asking that the word should be emphasised in his reply.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's statement before the Coroner was read as follows:</hi>, "I live at 55, Oriental Road, Silvertown—the deceased, Hilda Ruth Marsh, was my daughter—she was thirteen months old—during her life her health has been fairly good—she has never had medical attendance-there was no doctor present when the deceased was born—I have refrained from calling in a doctor on account of my religious belief—last summer she suffered from diarrhoea—she then had home comforts, and hands were laid on her, and she was prayed over—she was ill perhaps about a week or nine days, and regained her usual health from that time and until Tuesday, the 3rd inst, she had not had a serious illness—on that day she was taken very suddenly, I considered, with a violent cold—my wife called my attention to the child at dinner-time—milk was given her and a little cornflour—I considered her very ill, and asked Mr. Benton, one of the Elders of the Church of the Peculiar People, for the prayers of the Church—on Wednesday she seemed no better, she was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> kept in bed all day—the room was kept warm—deceased was very prostrate and rather stuffy in her breathing—my wife put flannels on deceased's back and throat—deceased did not improve, and eventually died on Monday, the 9th inst, at 3.25 a.m—the first day or two of her illness she had a little of her usual pap given her, cornflour and milk were also given her, and a 1 mutton broth, which she did not appear to relish, and a little weak brandy and water, with a few drops of the juice of a lemon—on Friday, the 6th, I noticed a change for the worse, and again went to Brother Benton, who came to the house, and anointed the child in the name of the Lord with oil, which he rubbed into the chest, he also prayed over her—after</p>

               <p>Brother Benton had gone I thought she revived a little; she, however kept very prostrate and weak until she died—I have two children living and I have lost one, which died nine years ago—a boy, who was six months'old—he died from bronchitis and convulsions—no inquest was held, no doctor was called in—my wages are 38s. per week, and I am in regular employment, and have been for years."</p>

P.—I was present when the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> was made on the body of the child on May 10th—apart from the disease which caused its death it looked a healthy, well-nourished, and well-cared for child—I saw nothing to accelerate its death—death was caused by failure or the heart's action consequent upon double pneumonia—that is, inflammation of the lungs affecting both sides—pneumonia is a disease for which there are certain recognised treatments—I should say that 95 per cent, of healthy children would recover, and in double pneumonia perhaps half might—when I say that this case had gone very for I am referring to just before death—single pneumonia may develop into double pneumonia in spite of treat<lb/>ment—it is generally a development of single pneumonia—it is less likely to supervene if the child is properly attended—the temperature of the child was very high—it is part of our treatment to reduce that as much as possible—that may prolong life, even if it does not save it—part of the treatment to lower the temperature is by direct application of cold by giving ice, and by giving medicines—the flannels would have no effect in reducing the temperature or retarding the process of the illness—I think the child's life would have been prolonged by proper medical treatment—I can say nothing about the death—if medical treatment had been called in there was a possibility of saving the life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I considered that this case was a serious one—if I had been called in there would have been more chance of life—the sooner the doctor is called the better—the examination showed that both lungs had been affected much about the same time—in double pneumonia there are certain periods when changes occur—from the 3rd or 4th day up to the 9th—if you like to say that the crisis comes on the 6th or 7th day it would be correct—the warm flannel would be a benefit to the child—in saying that 50 per cent recover from pneumonia, I did not refer to children only—I can give no average for children of thirteen months—I did not say that I could have saved the child—all had not been done that skill could devise for the child—I do not think pouring; oil and rubbing the child's chest would do any harm or any good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At a crisis medical aid would not be more necessary—that is the <hi rend="italic">critical</hi> time—I should think from what I saw, and what I know of your people, that everything bad been done for the child's comfort except medical aid.</p>

A feverish child would have to be fed in a different way to a healthy child—a child of two and a-half years is certainly more liable to become ill than when it is older—I remember the foreman of the Jury coming back into Court after they had adjourned—I do not remember <hi rend="italic">the questions</hi>—he asked a he question, but I think the Coroner stopped him—we went to the room where the Jury was, and the question was repeated in the presence of the whole Jury—when I said that the lack of medical aid would have accele<lb/>rated death, I asked that the word "might" should be emphasised—I asked the Coroner if "Yes or no" was required of me.</p>

I live at 31, Buxton Road, Walthamstow, and am a brewer's drayman—I knew the deceased man Byham; he was in the same employment as I am—before April 23rd I did not know the prisoner—on that afternoon I was with Byham at Peckham unloading a dray—the prisoner came up and asked Byham if he wanted to fight—Byham said he did not want to fight, he had not time—he then asked me and I said I had no time, it was getting late, it was about 5.15—the prisoner then went back to Byham and hit him and knocked him down, and he looked like a dead man—the prisoner ran away, and I chased him and overtook him—I did not speak to him then—I think he struck Byham on the forehead—I do not know if the prisoner was drunk, but he seemed rather strange in his manner—Constable Levitt held the prisoner—I went back to Byham, he was walking to the station with two constables—he said he had a dizziness over his eyes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, and surgeon at the London Homoeopathic Hospital—I attended the deceased man—I first saw him on May 5th—he was then absolutely unconscious, and paralysed on one side—I came to the conclusion that it was due to com<lb/>pression of the brain, and I considered an operation should be undertaken to remove the compression, and it was done that same afternoon—the operation of trepanning—it was on the right side of the head—we found a large collection of blood, which, of course, was removed by the opera<lb/>tion—the result was that he slowly recovered consciousness, and to a large extent the use of the paralysed side—he progressed favourably for about a fortnight, then inflammation of the brain supervened, and he relapsed into unconsciousness again, and died on May 25th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>—there was a collection of matter at the seat of the injury, where the clot was, and in trying to find the source of hemorrhage, I found a small vein had been lacerated, and the brain injured behind—blood had come forward and collected on the side of the head—the ruptured vein would not be on the same side of the head as the point of assault—the shock to the brain inside the hard scull might rupture it—it is generally oppo<lb/>site to where the actual injury had taken place—the organs were perfectly healthy—I assumed that there had been an injury, which had ruptured a small vessel, which had not bled extensively, but little by little, so that the symptoms had been slow, and it was only when the hemorrhage became enough that he regained consciousness—it would be possible that he would not know the nature of the injuries he bad received—the cause of death, in my opinion, was compression of the brain and accumu<lb/>lation of blood, caused by the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The locality of the clot does not necessarily indicate where the blow was—the ruptured vein was the origin of the mischief—that would not necessarily show where the blow had been given—such a ruptured brain as in this case could not have been caused other<lb/>wise than by violence—from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination it could not have been caused by any thing else, because the seat of the injury and the state of the brain would exactly show that it was the result of the injury and</p>

               <p>not disease—if from disease there would be a condition of the vessels which would show there had been hemorrhage—I think the deceased was about five foot six inches—not particularly heavy, he was not as big as brewers' draymen generally are—I think the brain was too seriously injured to recover itself—we were agreeably astonished that he got so well as he did, considering the extensive hemorrhage—we found the place from taking into consideration all the man's symptoms, and then we found he was paralysed on his left side—we carefully considered how the symptoms came on. We had some little difficulty in finding that the hemorrhage was on the left side, we were fortunate to find it—I think I said before the Magistrate, "Either a blow from the fist or a fall on the flags might have caused the injury"—trepanning is getting a more recognised operation than it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, of 104, Farrington Street, Old Gravel Lane—on May 22nd I was near the Elephant and Castle, and the prisoner Kemp invited me to go with her to Red Cross Court, where I paid 3s. for a room—we were not long there before there was hammering at the door—I opened it and she struck me on the head with a teapot and Riley came in and struck me with a piece of iron—I felt a hand in my pocket and lost a purse and £2.15s.—Kemp then disappeared.</p>

I am a labourer, of 31, Mowbray Buildings—on May 22nd about 2.15 a.m. I saw Spillan in the passage of 15, Red Cross Court—the two prisoners had got him, and the male prisoner put his hand in his trousers pocket, and threw him out into the court—his head was bleeding and covered with tea-leaves—they bolted the door, and I went with Spillan, and got a policeman.</p>

Early on the morning of May 22nd I was on duty in High Street, Borough—Spillan came to me bleeding from a wound on the left side of his head—I went to 15, Red Cross Court, knocked three or four times, but was not admitted—I got in through the I shutter and saw nobody in the room—I went to the rear and heard foot-steps going out—I went over three or four walls into 21, and found Kemp apparently asleep—I told her she was wanted for robbery and assault—she said nothing, but when I got into the court she said, "I smashed him on the b—head with a teapot"—I took her to the station, and then went and found Riley in High Street—I said, "I want you"—he said, "Take me."</p>
