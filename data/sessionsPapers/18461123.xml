Apply, by letter, Free, Mr. Craven, 29, Little Pulteney-street, Golden-square")—in consequence of that I wrote to the address—on the Monday the prisoner came to my house, produced my note, and asked me if I wrote that—I said, "Yes"—he said he was the person who wanted to borrow 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took him into the room where my mother was, and asked him what his security was?—he said they were tea-warrants, and took them from his pocket-book—we said we did not understand them—he said if we would allow him he would explain them to us, as to the value of them—he said they were for tea which was lying in the docks, and that the warrants were worth 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said they were equal to bank notes—the warrants specified the weight of the tea—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—he said the tea was sold at the grocers' shops at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—that they were perfectly good, and that on the prompt day he had drawn the warrants for the true weight of the tea; and as to the payment, there was nothing to pay on them on getting the tea—he said he was a tea-dealer, and that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was nothing to speculate with him, as we had alluded to the interest—he said, oh, he could make 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-day by it, and if he was obliged to sell the tea he must sell it at a reduced price, which would hurt the trade—I at last advanced him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and signed a paper which he wrote—I do not know what became of it—I did not have it.</p>

Clarke and Co., of Arthur-street, tea-dealers—I obtained these warrants from Mr. Knight, Miss White's solicitor—I took them to the East India China Tea-warehouse, and examined the tea—it is Bohea, which is very common tea—it is Bohea tea, which has undergone a process to dye it, to make it appear green, but in fact it is black tea—it is common black tea disguised.</p>

I was in Bishopsgate-street—I saw the prisoner—he was very drunk—he staggered up against me and said, "It is all through the d—d watch"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "Have you not heard of the watch that was stolen by the Blue Coat School?"—I said, "Do you mean to say you stole that watch?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—I said. "What have you done with it?"—he said, "Pawned it"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "In Hackney-road, at Mr. Cotton's"—I went and ascertained that he had pawned a watch there, but it had been redeemed the day afterwards.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, the 14th of Nor., I heard a violent knocking outside the shop window, which was of plate-glass—I ran out and saw the prisoner Gibbs just leaving the window—the prisoner Ire<lb/>land at that moment had his left hand in the window—I seized him, looked to<lb/>wards Gibbs, and saw him being stopped by two gentlemen—then he dashed this gold watch from his band violently on the stones—he was taken in custody by some gentlemen—I saw no more of him at that moment, but several persons were scrambling to pick the watch up—I held Ireland some time, and then my next door neighbour took him into his shop, and a gentleman picked up a third watch from the iron gutter, across the footpath, just beyond the window which was broken, and over which Ireland had been standing while I held him—the second watch had been picked up in the scramble—it was thrown down by Gibbs—I did not see that watch pass from Gibbs's hand, but I did the first—and the third was in the gutter—all three are the property of Mr. Mott, and had been in the window by the pane of glass, which I found a large hole in sufficient to put an arm through.</p>

On the 9th of Nov., from half-past three to four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down Lud<lb/>gate-hill with my friend Mr. Sutton, and we were hustled in a mob—I noticed the prisoner in the crowd—there was a great number of them, and he was pressed by the crowd next to mer-a girl on my left side called out that her arm was broken, which naturally made me shrink from her, and the moment I did so I felt the prisoner put his hand into my pocket, and draw my watch out—I seized him to get hold of my watch, which was in his hand, but he passed it to another, and I saw it pass to another—I collared him, and they tried to get him away—he tried to bite me while I held him—I suppose a dozen of them pressed me and tried to separate me from my friend—as I called out for the police the mob drowned my voice, they would not let me be heard—it was some minutes before I could get a policeman up to me—they were not far from me, but the crowd would not let them come—a po<lb/>liceman in plain clothes came—I refused to give him to him—two other policemen came, but the mob would not let them come near me till they pro<lb/>duced</p>

Vallance and Co., to put an advertisement in the news-paper for the recovery of what I had lost—I did not see it before I read it in the paper—it was correct except the word "lost," which they adopted—I was arm-in-arm with my friend—one was as near to the wall as the other, for we could not walk along—we were stationary—we were stopped from going on for several minutes on account of the crowd surrounding us—we were pressed on all sides—my friend was on my left, the woman was on my left, rather before us, on his left—the prisoner stood on my right—my watch was in my trowser's fob—it had no guard to it—my attention was attracted to the young lady with the broken arm—I have mentioned that before, but do not know whether it is in my deposition—the prisoner was pressed next to me by the crowd—I will not take upon myself to say I saw the watch abso<lb/>lutely in his hand—I felt it leaving my pocket, for it was a very large one* and as he took it underneath, I snatched at it—should hardly like to swear I saw it in his hand, but I felt his hand, and saw him pass it from me—I saw his pass his hand along, and another snatched it underneath as he passed it behind—I did not see his hand in my pocket—there was very great pressure—his hand was underneath my coat when I seized it—it was the coat which I have on now.</p>

I was informed he had money in his possession, and did not know from whom he had received it—I think I had that information from Hoyle—the amount was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was always remarkably correct as I thought, in the ready money accounts—there</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 16, Fitzroy-square.

Mr. Alfred Bailey, a stock-broker, had an office on the same floor—I was in the habit of transacting business for him in his absence—I have acted for him many times—In Jan. 1842, his clerk Godin applied to me and I went into Mr. Bailey's room, where I found a person who I understood to be Mr. Edwards—I cannot be certain, but I fancy the prisoner to be the same person—I believe him to be so, but it is a long time ago—I cannot speak positively—I never saw him before or since till this evening—he wanted to sell 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. long annuities by the request of his wife, as the stock stood in their joint names—this paper (<hi rend="italic">A.</hi>) was pro<lb/>duced to me—I said that was not sufficient authority to do the business without the wife, it was out of the usual course to sell stock standing in the name of the wife—both are required by the bank to be present, or a power of attorney procured—I stated that to the person—the man said he had come from the country expressly for the purpose, and brought this, which he con<lb/>ceived sufficient authority to enable him to sell the stock without the presence of his wife, it was not convenient for her to come, and he thought the authority sufficient—I said it could not be done, and if there was any</p>

               <p>urgency about it he had better make application elsewhere—I believe I took him with me to Mr. Smee, the chief accountant at the Bank, to know if this was sufficient authority, but I may have gone alone—I saw Mr. Smee, who said, "Let him write a request to make the transfer without his wife"—the person attended at the Bank and wrote this request himself on the back of the paper (A)—I attended at the Bank the same day, and sold the stock on account of the person who wrote that request—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the transfer</hi>) I identified the person making this transfer as George Edwards—I took him to be George Edwards on the representation of the young man, Mr. Bailey's clerk, who was under age, and the Bank would not allow him to identify—I presumed the young man knew him—the stock was sold to Clement Smith, stock-broker and jobber—I received the purchase-money from him, which I believe was 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and which I paid the person I identified, and who I understood to be George Edwards—I gave Bailey the commission and ren<lb/>dered him an account of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 31st regiment of foot, and have been so seventeen weeks. I was formerly clerk to Mr. Bailey, a stock-broker, of Lothbury, for two years and two months—I am twenty years old—I was in Mr. Bailey's employ in Jan. 1842—he is occasionally out of town—Mr. Crompton was in the same business, and lived on the same floor as Mr. Bailey—when Mr. Bailey was out of town Mr. Bullock transacted the business, and when both were out of town Mr. Crompton acted for him—I remember a person coming in Jan., 1842, to effect a transfer of some stock—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man—he came to the office when I was there by myself, and said he wanted to know whether he could sell some stock without bringing his wife there—that is a very Unusual occurrence when stock stands in the name of man and wife—he produced this note, pur<lb/>porting to be from his wife—I am not aware that he told me what the stock was—I read the paper myself—I cannot tell whether he produced a stock receipt—I do not know that he told me why his wife was absent—I fetched Mr. Crompton, who came into Mr. Bailey's room—this paper was lying on the table—I am sure this is the paper—I believe I looked at it while he was conversing with Mr. Crompton—he told Mr. Crompton he came from the country, and was rather urgent about having the stock sold—he said his wife: could not come from the country, either from indisposition or being in em<lb/>ployment, I am not certain which—he showed the paper to Mr. Crompton—I relieve Mr. Crompton said he did not think it could be allowed without laving a power of attorney to do it—at the same time, Mr. Crompton said he would take him over to Mr. Smee, the chief accountant—he took him there—I did not go with them—they may have been absent half an hour—I do not think they returned together—the same person came back again to stay till it</p>

               <p>was finished—it is necessary for the stock-broker to go to different places to sell the stock, and in the mean time the man remained at the office with me—I do not suppose he was there more than three-quarters of an hour after that—Mr. Crompton returned before the three-quarters of an hour—they went over to the Bank together to finish the transaction, but not directly—I do not recol<lb/>lect that they returned after they came from the Bank—I had an opportunity of seeing the man for three-quarters of an hour—the transaction was very peculiar, which induced me to take notice of it—I noticed the paper—I noticed the man coming, and I thought a great deal of it altogether, on ac<lb/>count of its being unusual—I did not see the prisoner again till last Thursday week, in custody in Newgate—I instantly recognised him—he was shown to me among others—I had a recollection of him before he was shown to me—there was a curious look about his eyes that I noticed, and I recollected his having whiskers, and he was rather a tall man by the side of me—the prisoner is dressed differently now, but, looking at his features, I have no doubt in my own mind of his being the man—I have no particular doubt, but I will not swear as if I had seen him a week ago, but, on my oath, I do believe him to be the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bloomsbury-street—in 1828 I, with others, set on foot a society called the Royal Standard Benefit Society—in Nov., 1835, the prisoner joined the society in the name of Henry Hitchcock Barratt, and continued a member till Jan. 1842, when he was excluded for non-payment—while he was a member I had communications from him, and have seen him write on other matters not connected with the benefit society—I believe this letter(A), except the signature "S. Edwards," to be his writing—this demand to act on the other side of the paper decidedly is—it is still more apparent—the signature, and the whole of it except the memorandum at the bottom, is his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold-beater, and live in Eccleston-street—I know George Edwards and his wife—I have known Mrs. Edwards for the last twenty years—her maiden name was Sarah Swift—I have known Edwards since he has been married, which was in 1840—my father is a builder—I remember Mrs. Edwards coming to my father in the spring of 1840—I do not recollect what month it was—I believe my father went somewhere with her—I knew her when she was cook to Mr. Handley—she went there as cook, it may be a week or a month after she came to my father—I was then living at Eccleston-street East, Pimlico—in Jan. 1842, the prisoner called on my father—he told me he was butler to Mr. Handley, of Newark, and had come to bring Mrs. Edwards' compliments to Mr. Couldrey, my father—my father is laid up, and has lost his sight—the last time I saw Mrs. Edwards was on the apprehend<lb/>sion of the prisoner on the 19th of Sept., at Greenwich—the prisoner was with her—they represented themselves then to be Mr. and Mrs. Jones—the prisoner gave his name Joseph Jones—in April, 1845, I saw Mrs. Edwards, went with her to the bank, and took her to Mr. Peppercorn, a stock-broker, to purchase some stock—in consequence of what passed between us, Mrs. Edwards gave a description of a person to the Bank porter, in my presence, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Bailey's office, in Lothbury—I communicated what I heard there to Mrs. Edwards, and she immediately left the neighbourhood—she left on the Monday following, to go to Newark—I saw her off by the train—on the 4th or 5th of Aug. this year I saw her again at my house—the pri<lb/>soner came with her—it was not the first time I had seen him, but the first time I had seen them together—she introduced him to me as her husband Joseph Jones—I recognized him as the man who represented himself as Mr. Handley's butler three or four years back, and came with Mr. Handley's compliments—I said, "Why, you are Barratt"—he said, "No, my name is Jones, I am not Barratt"—Mrs. Edwards replied, "This is my husband; his name is Joseph Jones"—that was all that occurred at the time—I went to Norwood next day—I saw a gold watch in the prisoner's possession last Aug., and recognized it as belonging to George Edwards—in consequence of suspi<lb/>cion, after Mrs. Edwards told me, in the prisoner's presence, that her husband was dead, I made a communication to George Edwards's daughter—Mrs. Ed<lb/>wards had told me, in the prisoner's presence, that her husband had been dead two years, and pointing to her finger with a ring on it she said, "This la the only man that put that on"—I afterwards accompanied them to Norwood and Greenwich, to look for a beer-shop—in the course of that day Mrs. Edwards addressed him by no other name than Jones—sometimes she addressed him as B., not Mr. B.—she merely used the letter B.—I did not know what that meant—that was besides Jones or Joseph—I have seen the prisoner write seldom, but enough to form a judgment—I received a letter from him on the 28th of Aug. this year, and acted on it—this signature, "George Edwards" to this transfer corresponds with the writing of the letter I received—to the best of my belief, I believe the letter produced (A) to be his writing, except the signature, and should say the demand to act on the other side is his.

I went with Brannan and Bryant to the Wheatsheaf public-house, Edgware-road, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, and found the male prisoner in company with other men, in front of the bar—I took hold of him, and told him he must consider himself in custody for casting counterfeit half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, at Westminster—he said, "That be d—d and b—, let us have some gin before I move a step?"—he then resisted very much—we took him away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he would have jumped out if we had not pre<lb/>vented him—he attempted to put his hand into his right-hand pocket—I searched him at the station, and found a shilling, a sixpence, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, (good money,) a knife, and a latch-key—I left him at the station, and went about eleven o'clock with Brannan to a house in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, with the key which I found on the prisoner—I saw Mrs. Hollis in the front parlour—she gave me information—I went up stairs with her—she pointed out a room, and called "Mrs. M'Donald" several times—there was no answer—the door was fast—I forced it open—there was nobody there—we searched the room in the presence of Mrs. Hollis, and found a work-box on a chair, and in it was this galvanic-battery—on the table I found a jar containing fluid, which is now in this bottle—the battery can be placed in the jar—on the same table was a jar with powdered plaster of paris—I found a saucer with a quantity of wet plaster of paris, two faives covered with plaster of paris, on the table, a brush full of plaster of paris, and two leather bands, which are used in making moulds—on a shelf I found four bottles containing different liquids—on the floor I found a washhand-basin, quite wet, containing plaster of paris, and four packages of copper-wire were hanging on a nail—while I was there the prisoner Wright came into the room—she appeared drunk—she attempted to put her hand into her bosom—I immediately laid hold of her hand, and took from her bosom two packages containing twenty-three counterfeit four-penny pieces—she had a basket containing a pair of women's new boots, and several other articles—I took from her pocket a box, with 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 5 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in it—after the search she was left in my care in the room—the rest of the officers went down stairs—after Brannan returned he produced several moulds and a bag with two counterfeit half-crowns in it—I took her to the station where Anderson was.</p>

Butlers' name is the prisoner's writing, "Next Saturday"—these receipts on these bills of Dixon, Butler, and Brusiotti's are the prisoner's writing—I gave the prisoner into custody—there was nothing said to induce him to make any statement—he stated that all the money he had received, he had paid over to Warwicker, who was a villain and a scoundrel, and we should find him so.</p>

I am book-keeper to the prosecutors—it was my duty to keep the casebook correctly, and to receive the money from the prisoner and other persons who collect—on the 7th of Nov, I gave the prisoner a paper with Butlers' and Dixons' account on it—I had on the previous day, when he went out, directed him to call on Messrs. Brusiotti—he brought back the list, and gave an account of what he received—I put that in the cash<lb/>book—I went through the original list and I asked him what the Butlers said—he said, "They said they will pay next Saturday"—(this was on the 7th of Nov.)—I came to Dixons' account, and he said, "No account"—he wrote that down—I told him to write it, to prevent any dispute—I had some tima previously asked him about Brusiotti, and he told me they would not pay till the account was more—he did not pay me these sums.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever had any notion of leaving Messrs.

               <p>were all new ones—these two are Victoria sovereigns—I cannot swear whether the other was a Victoria sovereign, but it was similar to. these—it had a crown on it—the prisoner was discharged from the Compter that morning—he had been gone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I obtained the cash—he returned in about half an hour or three<lb/>quarters of an hour after I had placed the money on the desk for some money which had been taken from him when he entered the prison—I gave him the money—it was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this took place in the room where the money was—having got his money and signed a book, he went away—he signed the book on a little platform just behind the desk, about one yard from where the money was—he had not been gone more than two minutes when I missed a sovereign off the governor's desk—no one had been in the room but him and myself, from the time I laid the money on the desk till he went out—he could see the money from where he stood—I went after him with Evans, a turn-key—I found him at the White Lion, in Fleet-lane—I left him there with Evans, and I went for a policeman—when I came back I told the prisoner I had lost a sovereign off the governor's desk, and charged him with it—I requested the policeman to search him—the prisoner said he had a sovereign in his waistcoat pocket, and he produced it on the table—he said, "Be positive"—I said, "I am positive it was on the table, and it was gone"—some females in the room said, "Can we make it up with paying anything"—they appeared to be all in company together—the pri<lb/>soner was taken—the sovereign was in his left hand waistcoat pocket, and some other money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 17, Duke-street, Smith-field. I carry on business on my own account—I have lived there fifteen months—I have been in the parish and the neighbourhood three years—I held a situation in Aldersgate-street for thirteen years—I recollect on the 10th of Nov. my brother, the prisoner, was coming out of the Compter—it was arranged that I should meet him at the corner of the street—I met him, and we went to a house in Fleet-lane, where we had arranged to meet, as it was arranged my brother should not go home to his father—when we got to Fleet lane, my brothers George and John were there, my mother and sister, my wife, and my brother George's wife—a subscription had been raised between us on behalf of my brother when he was coming out—I subscribed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., John 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and George gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was a sovereign—my brother George had it—I saw him give the prisoner a sovereign.</p>

               <p>words that passed, but we bad a quarrel for about two minutes—I put on my hat, and said I should go out—the cloth was laid, and she had sat down—I was going to leave the room, and I heard her scream out "Murder!" and felt something slightly at my throat—I did not think what was the matter—I turned, and the knife fell from my neck on the floor, and I saw the blood streaming on the floor—I was taken to a surgeon, and then sent to St. Thomas's Hospital, and was attended by Dr. Clark—I am an inmate there still—I do not think my wife did it intentionally—I think she threw the knife in the heat of passion at the moment—I do not think she knew what she was doing—she screamed "Murder!" as soon as she saw the blood—when I turned round she was in the act of rising from the chair—the moment I saw the blood I went down stairs as quickly as I possibly could.</p>

I was informed a man had been brought in with a severe wound in his neck—I went across to the surgery and saw the prosecutor, and one of my colleagues was on the spot endeavouring to staunch the blood from the wound—he had succeeded temporarily in doing so, by putting his fingers in the wound—we conferred together, and thought the only means of saving his life would be to perform an operation, which consisted in making a wound lower down in the neck, and passing a ligature round the trunk of the carotid artery—as his fingers were bloody it was agreed I should perform the operation, which I did—there was not more than a spoonful of blood lost in the operation, and that caused the cessation of the blood—in my opinion, if he had been left to himself, he would unquestionably have been dead in two or three minutes—a cutting instrument, more or less pointed, would have inflicted the wound—a table-knife would very probably have done it—there is no question but such a knife as this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—would have inflicted the wound,</p>

I am a cab-driver, and live in Chapel-street, Totten<lb/>ham Court-road—on Saturday afternoon, 3rd Oct., about five o'clock I went into a coffee-shop in Mill-street—the prisoner was sitting there—I asked him to let me pass him—he refused—I tried gently to pass him—he pushed me out—I said, if you do not let me pass, "I will give you a slap in the face"—he said, "Do it"—I told him to put down the knife—he had an eating knife in his hand—he was eating when I came in—he put the knife on the table—I struck him slightly on the face with my open hand, and went back a few paces, and he took up the knife and followed me with it in his hand—there was a man named Morriss there—the prisoner made a deliberate thrust at me with the knife, and stabbed me in the side, between the ribs—I was taken to a doctor's, and then to the hospital—the prisoner went with me.</p>

"I said I did—he said, "They have robbed me of my pin"—I gave information to Templeman—he and another policeman pursued them up Shoe-lane—I proceeded a short distance up Shoe-lane with the prosecutor, and met the prisoners in custody being brought back—they were the persons I had seen with the prosecutor on Holborn-hill—the prosecutor was perfectly sober—I believe I have seen Anderson before in female attire, but I could not swear it.</p>

I saw the prisoner An<lb/>derson on Monday evening, the 16th of Nov., at the station, and I had seen him three times before of an evening in female attire, within three weeks of the 16th of Nov.—he was dressed perfectly like a woman, going about under the windows—I supposed it was a woman going about to cut windows, by "starring the glaze"—the first time I saw him to take notice of him, was the last week in Oct.—I was coming down from St. Martin's-le-Grand, and met him, and when I went up again I saw him at the top of Newgate-street, on the right<lb/>hand side, at the end of Cheapside—he was under my notice about ten minutes—once when I met him I made a stand, and he turned and looked into a window—I looked at him right in the face—I saw the prisoners at the police<lb/>station in female attire—I cannot say that Anderson was dressed in the same attire that I had seen him in—it was a dark bonnet and dark cloak—there was a general resemblance in the things—I am quite sure Anderson was the person I saw before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a frame-maker, and live in Pear Tree-court, Clerkenwell. Gear was my apprentice and Carr my journeyman—Wilkinson had been in my employ previously—on Monday, the 2nd of Nov., I missed some mahogany boards—I went to Wilkinson's lodging, in Wingrove-place, Corporation-lane—I went to his shop again on the Thursday, and saw five mahogany boards there belonging to me—I went up to him and asked him if he knew any person in my line, who was out of employment—he said if I would step down stairs, he would tell me—I said, "No, you seem to have plenty of work and plenty of wood—I wish you to tell me where you pur<lb/>chased it"—he said, "If you come down, I will tell you"—I said, No, I knew enough that they were my property, and I should give him in charge—he fell on his knees and begged I would not, for the sake of his friends and his family—I told him he did not consider my family, that he had been rob<lb/>bing me through thick and thin—he told me he bought the boards of <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, (meaning my apprentice and journeyman,) and at the station he said he thought they were their property—I gave him in charge for having that property, knowing it to be stolen—I took a policeman, and went imme<lb/>diately back to my shop—I found Gear down in the court—he was going to cut up some boards—when he saw the policeman, he ran into the shop—the policeman and I followed him—when we got into the shop, Gear was coming towards me, and Carr following him—I told them I was satisfied they had been robbing me, and I had found out where the stuff was—I gave them in charge—a key was found on Gear—the policeman asked him if it belonged to me, and he said it did—I thought it was my street-door key, but it was not—it will open my shop—I am certain these five boards found at Wilkinson's are mine—I know them by the grain of the wood, and the shape of the log—I have part of it now on my premises.</p>

Between one and two o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of Nov., I went to the prisoner's room, and found the bed had not been used—he had been in my service about a month—I found my street-door was unbolted, and the policeman produced the key of my street-door—I found a candlestick with a rushlight in it, burning on the kitchen stairs—this shawl and table-cloth are mine—when I lost my table-cloth there was a mark at the eorner of it—I thought it was an ink mark, but it was a black pencil mark—I am quite cer<lb/>tain they are mine.</p>

I am a fly-driver, and live at Richmond, in Surrey, On Saturday night, the 14th of Nov., I had to take a fare from the Richmond Railway station to Teddington—in passing through the Cross Deep, near Pope's villa, by the Branch road, I was stopped by the prisoner—he asked for a toll of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I refused to give him—I asked him what it was for—he said, "For the corporation of the lord of the manor of Twickenham"—it was the second day of Kingston fair—another fly came up about the same time—that fly did not pay—I went on to Teddington, put down the gentleman, and received half-a-crown—I bad an opportunity of seeing the prisoner at the time he stopped me—there is a gas-lamp right opposite, in the middle of the Branch road, where the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was demanded—it was a little after nine o'clock—when I got back to the same place it was about ten, and about thirty yards from the place where the man bad first stopped me a man caught hold of my horse's head and stopped it, and the prisoner jumped up on the splinter bar, caught hold of my collar, and pulled me off the box down to the ground—I laid right on my back—while I was laying so, he said, "Deliver up your money, or I will blow your b—y brains out"—he did not mention any sum, but while he was saying that he put his hand into my pocket, and took out 2 shillings and the half-crown—he and the other man walked away up the Branch road—I had not seen that man before—the prisoner was in liquor both times—at the time he demanded the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I saw a horse there—it had a collar on it—no one was riding on it—I gave information at the Rich<lb/>mond station—I did not get the money back—a police-constable was sent with me to Twickenham, to try to find out the person—we went into the tap-room at the Horse and Groom—that was very near twelve o'clock—the prisoner was there, with his head on the table—I recognised him by his dress, and when I saw his face, I knew him again to be the same person who demanded the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the first time and took my money afterwards.</p>

I was the first of the police that examined the window—I found that something had been passed through between the shutters, and lifted up the bar—they would admit of a knife being passed between, which would lift up the bar—I saw some footmarks close to the window, coming from towards the fields—they were only one person's—they were women's feet, and I traced the same marks from the field to the garden—there is a small flower-border in front of the window—there were marks on that border—I discovered the marks on the dung against the wall—a person could have got over the wall by getting on the dung—the descent would be five or six feet—it would not be easy to get up again—the marks were towards the wall and towards the kitchen window—the dung was in the field—in the field I found the kitchen knife, which Mr. Jones identified—on the 30th of Oct., about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I went to the prisoner's lodgings—I found her undressed—she had just got out of her bed—there was another young woman in the room also undressed—I asked the prisoner if her name was White—she said it was—I said I had come from Ealing to apprehend her for a robbery at Mr. Jones's—she seemed agitated, but said nothing—I thought she was going to faint—I then commenced searching, and on a box, which the prisoner said was hers, by the side of the bed, I found this paper parcel directed to Mr. Jones, Ealing, and containing deeds and papers, a miniature of a gentleman, a desk seal, a knife, and a pocket-book—I found this desk under the pillow of the prisoner's bed—the desk contained a pocket-book, eighty-six pieces of ancient silver coin, and sixteen pieces of gold coin, and two memorandum-books—this ivory-handled pen-holder, with a gold end, I received since from Mrs. Glover—the desk had been broken open, and the private drawers under are also broken—I have lost the coins this morning—they were ancient coins, gold and silver—I found no sove<lb/>reigns in the desk—I found on the prisoner a purse, containing one sovereign, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you ascertain that anything had been inserted between the shutters to lift up the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I found something pressed between the shutters, and the paint was jagged off the bar—when the shutters were open I could see something had been pressed against the paint of the shutters—there were two persons in the room, and two beds—the other bed was made, and turned up—I do not know if they both slept in one bed—she might have said, "What do you want?"—she gave me her purse on my asking for it—I thought there was something in the box relating to this affair—I searched the box—this parcel was on the outside—I had the coins in the fellow box to this—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to one</hi>)—it worked a hole in my coat-tail pocket—it was done up in a paper parcel—I did not miss it till I came into I Court—the coins must have shaken out of the box, and come out separately—I rode to Oxford-street on horseback</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 22.) I assisted Laxton in the search I drew over the cloth at the head of the bed, and found the writing-desk—I found part of a stock receipt in an old tea-caddy on the mantel-shelf in the same room—I asked whose the tea-caddy was—the landlady said, in the pri<lb/>soner's presence, that it was the prisoner's, and she had come into her room, and found the paper just dropped from the fire burning, caught it up, put it out, and put it into her tea-caddy—the prisoner made no reply to that—she said the pri<lb/>soner was in the room with a child of the landlady's at the time she took it up—the prisoner said nothing to that in my hearing—I then took the prisoner into custody—she said at the Paddington railway station, "I hope Emma will not loose her place, as there is nobody to blame but myself"—she shortly after<lb/>wards said, "They cannot say I took anything but that"—I then said,</p>

               <p>"Anything you say I shall have to state against you"—she said, "Never mind, I do not wish to conceal anything"—she afterwards said she had folded up the papers and directed them, with the intention of sending them to Mr. Jones, but did not do so—I had not seen the parcel at the time—it is directed—the window shutter appeared to me to have been opened—the inspector pointed out a trifling mark on the under side of the bar, such as would be made by lifting it up by a knife—there was a very small piece of the shutter chipped.</p>

I live at 20, Crown-court, St. James's, Pall-mall—the pri<lb/>soner lodged with me—I recollect Wednesday, the 21st of Oct.—it was a very wet morning—I have only one room for myself and my lodgers—the prisoner came in at eight o'clock that morning very wet—she had not slept in the house the night before—she had told me if she was not at home at ten o'clock not to expect her—she went out about the middle of that day—that was the. Tuesday—about a week before that she had said she had a writing-desk, and would go and fetch it—when she came in that morning she put a writing-desk on the table, and took a hammer and chisel, and broke the lock open—she then turned her back on me—I could not see what she took out of it—she was very careful in her living—I saw her destroying paper when I went out on an errand for her, leaving my child, who is four y tars old, in the house—she gave the child some papers to burn—as I came back into the room the paper (the stock receipt) was burning, and fell out of the fire—I took it up, put the fire out, and put it into my tea-caddy on the mantelpiece until I got a person to read it—I thought it was a love-letter—when she came in on the 21st she was wet, fatigued, and very dirty—her shoes were all over mud, and her stockings and clothes all wet—after that, on the same day, and the day after, she brought in some parcels—she wore what she brought—she brought in clothes I had not seen before, and got them made—she had a muff and some boots, and new dresses—that is all I know about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Norfolk-street, Strand—at half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 24th of Nov., I was in a cigar-shop—I put my purse into my pocket, and went on to Cockspur-street, near the National Gallery—I was looking into a shop there—I had my umbrella in one hand and a cigar in the other—I found some one had hold of my arm—I looked round and saw it was rather a low-looking woman—I shook her off, and passed on ten or fif<lb/>teen yards to another stall, and looking in at that window I found the woman had followed me, and had hold of me again—it was the prisoner—I shook her off rudely the second time—I passed on—she still followed me—I rather suffered her than otherwise—she walked by my side and talked to me—I was hardly thinking of the woman—I recollect her asking me to treat her—I told her I had no change—I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was there—that aroused me from my reverie, and I was about fifty feet out of the thoroughfare—as I looked round my purse was whipped from my pocket—no one was with me but the prisoner—she ran and I ran after her, but a man ran from the thoroughfare into my arms and pinioned me down—I afterwards took the prisoner myself—the purse was not found—she had an opportunity of passing it—I am sure she was the only person near me when it was taken—she was the only person within ten feet of me—it contained twenty-two sovereigns in one side of it, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other—it was a long travelling-purse.</p>

On the 27th of June, I was standing near Mr. Gale's, the tobacconist's shop, in High-street, Kensington—the prisoner's wife came up and said something to me—the prisoner very soon after came up to me and went towards the Coach and Horses public-house, where there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he could not get in—he then came across the street and asked me how I was—I said, "Very well, how do you get on?"—he said he did not know hardly—my mistress came up, put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hand, and said "Take him down to the Prussia public-house and give him a pot of beer"—I had had no quarrel with him before that—he said in the public-house that he had come with the inten<lb/>tion of taking Stephen Hayes' life away"—I said, Do not do it; never be guilty of such an action as that; he is a poor man with a large family; take and give him a good hiding, but do not take his life away"—(there had been a quarrel between Hayes' wife and the prisoner's sister—the sister had told the prisoner about it)—I took him away from the public-house after having a pint of beer to drink, and his wife and me and my wife went together—I took him across the street as far as the King and Queen—two men came and treated him to a pot of beer—I went back to my own room in a very few minutes—the prisoner came there—I then lived at No. 6—he came down the courtjumping about, and asking if there was any rascal who belonged to Stephen Hayes—Hayes came into the court and met the prisoner, and the prisoner struck him—I went and parted them, and Hayes then ran away to his own room—the prisoner then said, "Hayes did not have it; what Hayes did not have you shall have"—he then made towards me, and then struck me—I defended my<lb/>self as well as I could, and struck him—I tried to throw him down—he got away from me, and went across the street to the wall, went two or three yards from there—he only went across the channel about a dozen yards, and came back again and. stabbed me in the side—I did not see any knife when he and I were struggling together—he did not strike me with the knife before he went across the channel—he then returned and stabbed me—he did not go into any house—I was taken up the stairs to my own room—I said I was struck with something—I found part of my entrails protruding—I was taken to Dr. Merriman, then to St. George's Hospital—I was there ten months—I am an Irishman—the parish of Kensington have supported me and my family ever since—I have been laid up ever since, and unable to attend to my work—last Saturday six weeks I was obliged to come home from my work with one of my guts coming out—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>crowd—we had been fighting three or four minutes when this happened—neither of us had been knocked down till he stabbed me—I did not knock him against the wall—the crowd pushed us, and he went against the wall—we had not been fighting live minutes when I received the stab—I saw the person who stabbed me, but I did not see the knife—I do not know whether there was a great crowd—there are always a good many people where there is a row—it is merely from the position in winch he was that I judge it was him who stabbed me.</p>

The prisoner had been in my service as a pot-man—he was discharged on the 13th of June—in consequence of my house having been broken open several times within a short space of time some persons were on the watch—on Thursday, the 12th of Nov., I was the last person up in my house—I shut up the place and went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—I saw it all shut up safe—about three o'clock in the morning the policeman rang the bell, and I went down stairs—there is a flap leading into the cellar, in the passage or a sort of lobby—it was down when I went to bed, and when I came down I found it lifted up—it prevented the lobby door from opening—I examined the house—there was no mark of violence on the outside—there is a wash-house there—from the ap<lb/>pearances, I should say a person had got out of the house by unbolting the wash-house door, and going up the steps from the wash-house into the back yard—there is no communication between the back yard and the cellar—the wash-house is on the same floor with the cellar—a person could get from the wash-house to the cellar, and from the cellar to the wash-house, from which there are steps leading up into the yard and over the wall into other yards and get away—I examined the doors of the spirit and the beer-cellar—I found them open—I had left them locked—I examined the bar, and missed from there half a crown's worth of farthings, a glove, and some screws of tobacco—I know the paper the farthings were wrapped in—that paper was produced by Edwards, the officer—the farthings were safe the night before—they must have gone between half-past ten o'clock at night and three o'clock in the morning—I had in my spirit-cellar a cask of unsweetened gin—the officer produced this bottle of unsweetened gin to me—I have tasted it, and it cor<lb/>responds with mine—this glove was produced to me—it is mine, and was in the bar—these parcels of tobacco are in paper which corresponds with what I had put the tobacco in the night before, and this is the paper the farthings were in—I have a perfect recollection of it—I have not a doubt this is the paper I put them in—the house was searched, and there was no person in it—the prisoner was in my service long enough to be acquainted with the pre<lb/>mises, and the ways of getting in and out—he was with me from March till June.</p>

I was in my parlour that evening—I heard a noise of glass, and went to my door, which is in Suffolk-street—directly I got to the street door I saw Baker in the act of rising—Mr. Jones was, 1 think, at his elbow at the time, but, coming out of the light, I could scarcely tell—I examined the other side of the wall in my premises—the man had got up by the door-way, which has three pieces across it—the wall is about one foot above the door.</p>

On the 4th of Nov, the prisoner was given into my charge—Mrs. Topley handed me a bottle of wine—the prisoner was sober—on the road to the station she asked me what she had done—I said she had broken Mr. Tapley's window and stolen a bottle of wine—she said she was not aware of it, and she could not have done it—I have seen her loitering about there, and about ten minutes before this she took some oysters out of a tub and put them in her lap—a person went up and asked her for the oysters—she swore she had not touched them, at the same time dropping them out of her lap—some people think her not of sound mind—I think she does it to escape being given in charge—she robs everybody about there—she does it openly, at broad day-light, before anybody—I believe she drinks—she tells me her mind is perfectly sound, only when she gets drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live with my father, Edward Henry Firmin, who keeps the Rising Sun beer-shop, Larkhall-lane, Clapham. On the 10th of Nov., in the afternoon, I was in the shop—the prisoner came and asked for a glass of ale on trust, as she had no money—she sent me to ask my father a question—he was in the tap-room—I opened the door, looked through a little hole in the tap-room, and saw her go to the till—I saw her with the till open, and her hand in it—as I came back she returned her hand to the till, and I heard the till shut—she sat down, and seemed confused—I did not take any notice of it to her—I went into the parlour, and when I came hack to the bar I saw her at the till again, and a penny in her hand—she shut the till, and sat down again—I went to my father, to tell him, and on looking through the hole again, I saw her go to the till a third time—I then flung the door open—my father got up and came out—she had a handful of halfpence in her hand, over the till, which was wide open—she dropped some into the till, and some out—my father took a penny and two halfpence off her lap, and as she went away I picked up four penny-pieces and halfpence, which fell from her apron—she was given in charge—there had been about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till before she came in—I had been to it just before she came in, and put (6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into it, and there was about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before that, and afterwards 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

On the 7th of Nov., about ten minutes past three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Dover-road, and saw a female on the opposite side of the way, with a child in her arms, on the step of a door—I was about to cross to her—she coughed, to give a sort of signal—I went and put my hand against the gate of Mr. Collins's premises; hearing a noise inside, I went and spoke to the policeman to watch the part of the premises in Trinity-street—I returned, alarmed the landlord, and found the prisoner lying on the ground inside the skittle-ground, which is inclosed with a wall—his right hand had a mark on it of having been cut—the wall encloses the premises, it joins the house—after he was taken to the station I saw a stocking with some blood on it quite fresh—it was found close to where he had been lying.</p>

The last witness was brought there on the night of the 3rd of Nov.—I examined a wound on her throat and neck—it was on the right side—I found two incised wounds, one about half an inch below the other—they were each about three inches in length, and about half an inch in depth—they extended over the right carotid artery—that is a very dangerous place for a wound—it could not be more dangerous—the artery laid about a quarter of an inch deeper—if that had been cut, her life would have been gone very soon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at 22, Wellington-place, Hackney-road. On the night of the 8th Nov., about twelve o'clock, I was in Blackman-street, coming from New-cross, and close to Union-street—there were about twelve or fifteen men on the pavement—I was walking at a pretty brisk pace, but eased my pace as I came close to them—they opened a pas<lb/>sage to let me through—I got a shove on my right side, and before I bad time to look round, my hands were pinioned behind me by four or lire peo<lb/>ple, and I was held by my shoulders—I was surrounded by the whole of them—I directly found myself fast and could not move, and felt the money going out of my pocket—I had a purse taken out of my left-hand breeches' pocket with twenty shillings in it, all in shillings, a white handkerchief, which was on top of the purse, was taken at the same time, and out of my right-hand pocket, from seventeen to nineteen shillings, in half-crowns, shillings, and I believe sixpences—I called out for the police as loudly as I could, and directly received a blow on my head from some hard instrument or other—it was not a fist; it cut me—I still called out—my hat was knocked off, and I got another cut over my lip from the same instrument—it was something harder than a man's fist—I was then let go, and saw a man picking up a hat—I do not know if it was my hat—I ran towards that man as far as Union-street—I felt blood running down my face—I lost sight of him there—running up Union-street I heard a rattle—I did not run further, but waited till the policeman came to me—I had a pocket-book in my coat-tail pocket—the coat tail was torn, but they did not get the book—my trowsers were torn below the pocket in getting the money out—the prisoner Smith is the man that was engaged at this side pocket or else holding me at the time, the other I believe to be the man who I got the two blows from—I am sure he was close to me—I am sure they were both of the party, and close about me—Smith was on my left side and Pearson on my right—Pearson gave me two blows—the prisoners were left and right of me at the time I was robbed—the blood ran down into my eye and blinded me—I could not distinguish anybody after that to speak to them—I was taken to St. Thomas's hospital-one of the prisoners was brought to me, but I could not recognize him at that time, as my head was so bad from the effect of the blows—the doctor thought my skull was fractured—when I saw Pearson at the Police-court I had no doubt he was the man who was on my right hand, and struck me—I remained in the hospital about half an hour—my lip was cut right open—it required being sewn up—I went about two days after to have the threads taken out.</p>

I keep the Horse and Groom in the Walworth-road—I have resided there six years—I have known the prisoner nearly the whole time I have been there—about eighteen months ago he left a parcel at my house—I was not in at the time it was left—when I returned home I discovered the parcel—it is now in the possession of Mr. Haynes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) this is the parcel and the letter that came with it—it was in the middle of the summer of 1844—I do not know the handwriting—it is directed to Mr. Thomas Jack<lb/>son—I saw the prisoner after the parcel had been deposited, on many occa<lb/>sions—I have once or twice told him to fetch the parcel away—he said the man would call for it—no one ever did call for it till after I named it to Mr. Haynes—a day or two before we appeared at the police-office—the prisoner came to my door in consequence of two men that I turned out of the house—whether they went and told him, I do not know, but he came and created a disturbance—words passed between us—he said I was a rogue, a thief, and a swindler; that I had robbed my creditors, and I had stolen goods in the house—I said, "If I have, I have only one parcel, that don't belong to me, and that is the parcel you left here; and if stolen, the sooner it is out of my possession the better"—in consequence of that I communicated with Mr. Haynes, and gave up the parcel to him—the prisoner never said anything to me about the letter, after I had communicated with Mr. Haynes, but while the parcel was still in my possession two persons called on me—I did not give the parcel up to them—I cannot tell whether I had ever seen either of those persons with the prisoner.</p>

What have you done with the shilling?"—he said, "I have neither key nor shilling"—I searched his pockets, and found some plums, but no shilling—the seat he sat on had a great quantity of things stuffed in it—I opened it, and I found a letter addressed to his mother—I said, "I can bear this no longer," having lost so much, which he was aware of—I sent for a neighbour, who is a parochial constable—he came and searched, but nothing could be found—he searched the seat, and close down by the pri<lb/>soner's heel I discovered a purse—I said, "Here is the secret—here is the key and shilling"—the key was taken out of the purse and applied to the till—it</p>
               <p>fitted the lock—I then said I could account for the valuable property he brought in from time to time, which he could not have purchased—he had no wages.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and lodge at the Mitre coffee-house, Old-street-road. On the 3rd of Nov. I was near the Royal Exchange a man came up and asked me something—I walked with him to the Crown public-house—the prisoner and an old man came in there—(they did not appear to be acquainted)—the old man pulled some cards out of his pocket, which he called pictures—the party who was with me asked me where he got these cards from—they began to take some of the cards off and wanted me to have them—I said I would have nothing to do with them—the man said he had been at a brothel and these were for sale—the man with me pro<lb/>posed to go to some gardens, and we all went to the Yorkshire Stingo—they went up into a room and had the gas lighted—they had not been there long before they began to play at cards amongst their three selves—I had six so<lb/>vereigns and some silver—I did not tell them what I had got, but they got</p>

               <p>to know it by one of them pulling out a number of sovereigns, and the old man had a pocket-book with a great number of notes, or what looked like notes, in it—the other two said to the old man, "If you think you are in bad company we have got money"—I said, "have got tome money".—I took my hand out of my pocket carelessly—I do not know what I pulled out—I might have pulled out a couple of sovereigns and some silver, or it might be three or four sovereigns—they were playing at cards, and they asked me to play, but I would not—at last I was persuaded to bet two sovereigns—(they were playing for three or four)—I lost six sovereigns, and one which the man who went with me lent me, which was seven—the man then asked for his sovereign back—I had not got a sovereign, which he knew—they all said, "You must pay him, you will win it back"—I had to go and pawn my gold watch and chain to pay the sovereign—I pawned it for eight sovereigns—I went back and went up stairs—I took off my coat and put it down with the eight sovereigns in the coat pocket—I sat down—the party I had to pay the sovereign to stopped down stairs—I went down in a few minutes, and when I came up again I saw my coat had been disturbed—the prisoner and the old man were gone, and the money had been extracted from my coat pocket—no one had been in the room that could have taken them but the prisoner and the old roan—I went after the prisoner and found him in a road I do not know the name of—I watched him till I met an officer—I then went and asked him how he came to leave so abruptly—he said the old man was going to give him some ale.</p>

               <p>(A <hi rend="italic">translation of the letter was here read as follows:</hi>)—"My dear Parent,—I pray you to have patience until to-morrow. I was ignorant yesterday that it was a féte day to-day, and that Mr. Myers would not come, therefore I am without money; but to-morrow I will ask for some money, and be able to give you some the day after to-morrow. I will see a tailor for myself, and will speak for you at the same time. Tell me where I am to address him. You can send Leónidas to<lb/>morrow. I will remit him something, as I hope to receive myself. All yours, per E. <hi rend="smallCaps">GUIGUES</hi>."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the reason why you prayed him to have patience till to-morrow? A I had no money for myself—I did not know he had this bill in his posses<lb/>ssion at that time—I only knew that he had it when a person told me that it</p>

               <p>had been presented for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was only told of that on Friday, and the following Monday I received a writ—when I was in Paris there was no charge against me of having committed forgery—nothing at all—I have been in several places in Belgium after I led Paris—I did not go to any place when I got three or four piano-fortes—I was never charged with it—I do not knot a person named Lischtenthall, who deals in pianos—I never gave my own father into custody in London, nor charged him with anything at a police court—he came to my house while I was out, and made a noise—Mrs. Gui<lb/>gues was obliged, for the preservation of the peace, to call in the police-officer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Explain what this bill of exchange is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As I was very short of money, I made the bill for the purpose of trying to procure money, as I was always in hope of getting a partner that I might <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> my business—I accepted this bill, and gave it to a Mr. Coombs, to have money raised on it—I never got any money on it—Coombs gave it me back, as be could not raise money on it, and I put it in the cupboard in my own place, and it has been stolen from my cupboard—I have never seen it since—I gave my wife directions to write this letter, because the prisoner wrote a letter to me, which is now in my lawyer's hand—I can send for him now—this letter was written about the 20th or 25th of Sept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for using such language as "Pray, have patience till to-morrow," to a man to whom you owed nothing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was only by good nature that I wrote him that—I had not had notice at that time that the bill was over-due, or was in anybody else's hands.</p>
