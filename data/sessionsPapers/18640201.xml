                  </hi>. I am not in any business now—I was a wine merchant, but retired in 1858—previous to that I had formed a con<lb/>nexion with the lady who is now my wife—that connexion has lasted about six years—I have two children by her; boys, who are now living—there was a suit in the Divorce Court; a divorce was obtained, and when the three or six months had elapsed, I married the lady, and am now living with her at Slough—we have lived there since April,1859—my household consists of two female servants, a coachman, a groom, and a gardener, generally speaking—the ages of my boys are eight and ten—I was desirous of obtaining a tutor for them, and applied to an agent named Johnson, through whom I was in<lb/>troduced to the defendant, whom I understood to be a clergyman of the Church of England—I should have accepted whoever suited me, whether he was a clergyman or not—I first saw Mr. Birch in May, 1862, thing—I think—I had several interviews with him, during which the position in which I was living or had lived, was not referred to, either by statement from me or, inquiry by him—I made no statements to him misrepresenting my position—I think the utmost I said was that we were very plain people, meaning that there was no show or display in my establishment—I subsequently engaged him to come into my service at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, a furnished cottage and other advantages, for which he undertook the education and that case would be especially short, as one was in extremely delicate health, but to take charge of them also during their hours of relaxation, and if either of us wished the connexion to cease, a month's notice was to be given—he was put in possession of the cottage, on my own grounds, the garden, fur<lb/>niture, and so forth—he is a married man—he went on without any objection to be found with him for four months—he and his wife dined at my table frequently, whenever I asked them—he became by degrees more and more five or six hours at a stretch, and I coaxed him as much as I could, as I did not</p>

               <p>feel in a position to scold a clergyman—about three months afterwards he applied for the chaplaincy of the Union—I introduced him to a gentleman, Mr. Nixon, who was, I believe, mainly instrumental in his obtaining that position, and he obtained it—I received this letter from him about the period of the Prince's visit to Eton (<hi rend="italic">This letter was read under a protest from</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>, <hi rend="italic">who contended that there being no date to it, it might have been written before the defendant went into the prosecutor's service.</hi>) "The Cottage, Friday morning,—My dear sir, As really the whole of this day will be given to festivities in connexion with the Prince's visit to Eton College, I propose that the boys shall have a holiday. Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS RICHARDSON BIRCH"</hi>—The date in reality was the Friday prior to the 6th of June last year—I answered that letter—I had previously spoken to him on the sub-ject of the boys—I kept copies of my letters; the copies you have there are fac-similes—I never contemplated their being produced in Court, and I have not put "Dear sir" in many of them, but the body I engrossed word for word—I sent that letter by my servant, who is not here, but prior to that I had sent a message (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that the letter was not evidence, the de<lb/>livery not being proved</hi>)—within an hour after writing that letter, I received this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)"Dear sir, In reply to your letter just received, I have only to say that I must request an interview with you here to morrow evening, at an hour I leave to you to determine, when the matter of our engagement as well as other circumstances shall be most fully discussed." Signed, T. R. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRCH</hi>"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN DIXON RIGDEN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here proved the service of a notice on the defendant to produce certain letters without dates, but</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he would not pursue the matter further</hi>)—Up to the time I received the letter, proposing to give the boys a holiday, I had had no quarrel or unpleasantness with Mr. Birch, nor had he even alluded to me with any other feeling than usual—I do not know when he had last dined at my house—I afterwards wrote him a letter, and received this reply the same night; it was the day after the Prince's visit to Eton College," Saturday night Dear Sir, I acknowledge the receipt of vour cheque, more formally to be recognised on Monday; on that day I am fully resolved that a full unreserved declaration shall take place of everything. Signed, T. R. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRCH</hi>"—I saw him after that, and he was almost as abusive as he is in that scurrilous letter—he stated that I had taken him into my occupation under false representations—I had made no representations of any kind to him—I subsequently took another tutor, named Lott, who remained with me two months, and I subsequently hired a gentleman named Sharpe, from whom I received the letters which are the subject of this inquiry—prior to my giving the prisoner notice, he never in the most distant way asked me any questions as to the terms on which I was living with the lady; in fact he wished to remain a month longer than I wished—we are perfectly quiet people—I have the anonymous letter here, and have not the slightest doubt that it is in Mr. Birch's writing, as also the other one written to Mr. Sharpe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. Q. When did you retire from business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In 1858—I was in partnership with my father and brother; not with any one else—I knew a gentleman named Barlow, about 1848 or 1850—I was never in partnership with him, nor had he anything to do with the business I was carrying on—he was not a partner with my brother or my father—I knew him by his occupying the upper portion of the house in which my business was conducted—I can hardly say I visited him as a friend, but I was intimate with him, and was occasionally at his house—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010005"/>
               <p>introduced me to his wife, who had two children at that time—I do not know their ages; girls about ten or twelve, I believe—I visited them on friendly terms, and then eloped with Mrs. Barlow, if you choose to call it so—she left her husband's protection—I did not commit adultery with her in 1848—I am unable to tell you when it was; it was while she was under her husband's roof—I subsequently took her from her husband and herchildren, and lived in adultery with her for several years—the two children, that were the pupils of the reverend defendant, are the fruits of that adulterous intercourse—her divorce took place, I believe, in March, 1861, I think, and I married her immediately I could, which was in March, 1862, I think; if the gentlemen here are acquainted with the law, they will say that I did not lose one day; Messrs. Jennings and Son were my proctors, and assured me that that was the earliest date—when I engaged Mr. Birch as my tutor, I did not tell him the circumstances under which I had been living—I said nothing about it—I never gave him to understand that the children were illegitimate or the contrary—I told him I had a wife and children—I did not tell him that I was an Oxfordman, or a University man, or that my wife was a lady of high family, the daughter of a colonel, or that she was so virtuous she could not mix with any of the people round Windsor—I lead a quiet life; if it is necessary that the court should know it, I have had proffers of visiting, but I do, not visit—I am not acquainted with the residents of Slough and its neighbourhood—it is not true that no ladies visit at Herschell House; no ladies living in the neighbourhood visit at my house; that is at my wish—the defendant's cottage was close to my house, and he frequently dined with me on Sundays—he dined with me eight or ten times, whenever I asked him, and' his wife eight or ten times also—when the children were ill was not the only time his wife dined with me—the defendant behaved himself tolerably well for four months—giving the boys a holiday was not the only fault I found with him; he neglected them entirely—their hours were nominally from 10 to 12, and after that he let them play by themselves, and they got into the stable-yard, where I was anxious that they should not be—I had not a governess in the family when he was there; I had just before—I never imputed misconduct to her, or heard any misconduct mentioned—Mr. Birch did not complain that the children hadlearned certain facts respecting that young lady from me, and remonstrate with me about it, nor did my wife or any one—I gave her an excellent character—Mr. Birch never complained to me that the children had used improper language with reference to that young lady—I never had any con<lb/>versation with him about the circumstances of my family—I do not know, and do not care to know, whether he knew what had occurred prior—he never, in the most distant way, asked me about these rumours, or threatened to resign if I did not give him an answer—he did not resign—I dismissed him; there is a copy of the letter—he did not ascertain from me, the state in which I had been living with Mrs. Taylor, till I gave him notice—that was a written notice, and he and his wife left upon it—he wished to remain a month longer—I did not turn him out—I threatened that in the event of his not leaving my cottage on 6th July, the rental of it would be extremely high, and on that he went—he said that he should consult his solicitor whether he was not entitled to remain a month longer—I gave him notice in June, and he objected to go at first—he had an impression thatas I did not give him notice then, he was entitled to remain till August—he left on 5th July, but objected to do so at first—I first knew Mr. Johnson in May, 1862—he got me Mr. Birch, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Sharpe—I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010006"/>

Reverend Sir,—For the present, in common justice to a stranger, all are quite willing and ready to believe that you do not know that you have entered into a sink of the greatest crimes and infamy, and vilest disgrace, or else are going to do so; if you still keep your engagement you will receive, and deserve it too, the contempt of all decent people who are not in the Church, and the greatest disgust of all the gentlemen who are so. Inquire of the police of this borough, also of Eton and Slough. If, likewise, you can make up your mind, and think it right to do so, you can apply about those dreadful things of the house at Slough, to the ministers there, namely, the Rev. Mr. Cree, Rev. Mr. Birch, and the Rev. Mr. Sykes. Counsellors to one whom we think needs counsel."—<hi rend="italic">The letter to Mr. Sharpe was as follows: "</hi> Slough,</p>

               <p>October 23rd, 1863. Rev. Sir,—I am grieved to say that the duty which your letter calls upon me to perform, is one of a most painful character. When I entered upon the tutorship I need scarcely say it was in perfect ignorance of any one of the said circumstances of the family about which you inquire, or rather it was under a tissue of misrepresentations as to the social and moral condition of it. About three weeks after my arrival here, I was elected chaplain of the union. When the chairman in full board had told me, as he expressed himself with great pleasure, that I was unanimously chosen with an increased stipend, he added that it was with extreme sorrow and regret be found I stood in any relation to Mr. Taylor, and inquired whether I was willing to resign. I was allowed a certain time for examina<lb/>tion of the alleged facts against Mr. Taylor. During that period I received several anonymous letters, referring to law reports in which occurs the case of 'Barlow <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Barlow and Taylor.' I also received a newspaper containing a report of the Consistorial Court proceedings in that lamentable matter. The far greater part of the ladies of this place, while saying how happy they would be to receive the visits of Mrs. Birch, assured me that it was utterly impossible to visit her; and many gentlemen, while calling on me, apologised for not bringing their wives or daughters to the cottage, No respectable persons visit at Herschell House. When Mr. Taylor, after six serious entreaties upon my part, declined to tell me whether, even then, he was married to the woman with whom he lives, and who is the mother of the boys, my late and your prospective pupils, I quitted the cottage. Since that time I have been most credibly informed that there are other facts in this case to which I should be ashamed to refer in writing. The most injurious circumstance of my life is my ever having stood in the connexion with them which I have so unhappily done. I am quite startled at their audacity in again address<lb/>ing themselves to a clergyman, but suppose that even their shamelessness has not gone so far as to again address themselves to one who is married. I am, Reverend Sir, yours faithfully, T. R. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRCH. "</hi>

                  </hi>. I formerly practiced as an accountant, but do not now—in the early part of December, last year, I was called in by Mr. Wain<lb/>wright, who was about to become a partner of the prosecutor's, and went there to go over his books—I found that the amount of gross profit was very small—I was desirous of ascertaining whether that arose from an ex<lb/>penditure made for opening out the business, or from forced sales—I made an estimate as to the rate of profit which the prosecutor said he always got on his goods, and found that if that rate of profit had been obtained there was a deficiency of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called the prosecutor's attention to it, and asked him whether there had been any forced sales—he said there had been none whatever—I was subsequently called upon by the prosecutor, and Mr. Wainwright, to attend a private meeting at the White Hart hotel—the prisoner was present, and he was asked, in the presence of Mr. Wad<lb/>dell and Mr. Wainwright, to account for this apparent deficiency in the stock of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Waddell told him that he held him responsible, inasmuch as he had had the stock in his care, and had kept the books for some time—the prisoner said nothing in reply, but he ultimately said, "I think, Mr. Wad<lb/>dell, you are treating me in a very unfair way indeed, in putting me in this position before Mr. Ogan and Mr. Wainwright, when you know I have fre<lb/>quently sold goods by your orders at the best prices that I could get"—Mr. Waddell made no reply whatever to him, and Mr. Wainwright and I then left—the prisoner referred to a stock-sheet, which had been taken on the 1st November that year, and that list was said to represent stock to the value of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the stock being taken by myself, it was found only to amount to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some odd pounds—I said it would be much more satisfactory if that stock-list could be found, as any deficiency of stock could then be traced</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemical colour manufacturer, at Jubilee-street, Mile-end—I formerly had an office in Leadenhall-street, and carried on business under the name of Wilson and Fletcher—I have known the prisoner for about three years—I was formerly a creditor of his, and after<lb/>wards took him into my service, at a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that was in July, 1862, during the existence of the partnership between myself and Fletcher—I think the dissolution of that partnership was gazetted in March or April, 1863—the actual dissolution was before it appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, I think, in February—the prisoner continued as clerk up to the time of dissolution and afterwards—some time after the dissolution with Fletcher, the prisoner expressed a wish to become a partner, and made a communication to me—he told me his uncle was desirous of assisting him here in England, and for that purpose he would advance a certain sum of money, and he hoped on that account I would take him into partnership—I stated that if the sum of 1,580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was forthcoming, I might then, on certain terms, do so; 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his share in the business, and 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of my loss on the old estate, which I had taken up and paid a</p>

Dear Wilson, When I got up last Friday morning, I had no more idea to leave London than you had of leaving Europe. I went over to the factory, looked round, &amp;c., and then walked to Leadenhall-street. I had expected a remittance for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the last few days previous to cover some liabilities which were falling due out of my old estate; and expecting this remittance, I had in the meantime drawn sufficient from the bank to pay these bills, meaning to repay the sum on receipt of the money, which I expected daily. I would not have done so, however, but for the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had previously paid into the business, and thinking it no barm to withdraw part of the sum for a few days. On that Friday morning, I learned that I <hi rend="italic">would not</hi> receive the expected remittance, and at the same time a letter from your bank arrived, saying they had the day before returned a bill of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. unpaid, on account of insufficient funds, we having no right to draw under a balance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This news, coupled with the knowledge of further liabilities which I <hi rend="italic">then</hi> saw no hope of meeting, fairly took away my breath and benumbed my reasoning powers. I walked about the streets for an hour or two, having no heart to stay at the office, vainly trying to think what I could do to make every<lb/>thing right; the more I thought, the more disheartened I got. The fact of some of your bills falling due on that very Friday, and the fact of not sufficient funds to meet them on account of my inability to repay, <hi rend="italic">at once,</hi> the sum I had withdrawn, almost drove me mad. There was already enough besides to do so. My dear uncle had made himself liable, on my account, for a considerable sum, and the payment of this will all but ruin him. You have no idea what I suffered, and what I suffer still. I walked about on that dreary Friday not knowing which way to turn; I had not the heart to face you; I knew you could not forgive me, and, what is more, that I did not deserve it. In my despair, the thought forced itself on my stunned mind to leave England, and <hi rend="italic">before I fairly knew where I was,</hi> I was travelling away to France. Sick at heart, I travelled, and travelled, and travelled without stopping, till I came here. I arrived at Barcelona last night, and I cannot rest till I have despatched this letter to you. I am <hi rend="smallCaps">NOT</hi> a bad man, for all that you must think so; circumstances were too strong for weak me and overpowered me. I can hardly hope that you will judge me or my doings rightly, but, on the contrary, that you will despise me as one unworthy of your friendship. I pray and beg that the power may be given me to make good everything towards you; and I shall not be myself again till this is accomplished. I mean <hi rend="italic">work, and can work;</hi> and this, dear Wilson, makes me hope that to accomplish it may not be out of my power. You may, perhaps, resent my calling you still 'dear Wilson,' but for the world of me I cannot do otherwise. A. Oppenheim.")—The prisoner had no authority to discount bills at any "other place than the Bank of London—he had no authority to discount with Mr. Hermann—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are bills of exchange drawn by me; they amount in the aggregate to 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have the pass-book here—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to my credit on 5th June, and a country draft of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is entered in the cash-book—it may have been payable in London—this is the cash-book kept by the prisoner—the last entry appears to have been made on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June</p>

Oppenheim, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I know there are a great many irregular entries there—I have looked over many of those items—I find two entries here of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I can only explain as to those entries that moneys have been withdrawn and paid in a very irregular manner—I am attributing to him that he has taken 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of those huudreds represents half of the produce of that bill; I can't say which, inasmuch as they are both on the same date—it is one of them, whichever you like—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of those two items represents 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the cheque—it was a cheque, I believe—the other 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represents money that was given to him and accepted for another of my cheques—I think I can find that one—this is the cheque, I believe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated June 8th—I am sure it is the cheque for the money that is entered in the cash-book as June 4th—the prisoner did not get the money for that cheque from the bank; he exchanged it with some one else; I believe, with a Mr. Werner—I don't know whether he is here—I believe some one is here to speak to this cheque; I can't say positively—it is entered in the pass-book on 8th June, therefore it is clear that some one else presented it at the bank—that person will be here—I can't say which of those two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in by the prisoner, because they are entered in the same manner—in his second letter, he speaks of a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-bill being returned by the bank on the 4th—116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid in on the 4th, but I think that was money that came from customers—money is continually being paid into the bank—money was paid in on 4th June—there were the two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I spoke of—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi> of that was paid on 26th February I think, and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th March—I believe those were the dates—the date of the authority to the bank was the 9th March—I went abroad on that day—I gave him power to draw, because I was going abroad—I was gone a fortnight or three weeks—when I returned, I was at the manufactory, not at the office—I scarcely went to the office at all—the factory is about a mile and a half from the office I suppose—I went to the office occasionally—I partially attended to business for the space of a month, or five or six weeks, after I returned from abroad—this memorandum is in my handwriting—I believe I prepared this after I came back—during the four or five weeks I was at business after I came back from abroad, I did not revoke the authority to him to draw on the bank—it was withdrawn after his departure—I drew cheques myself as well, at that time, concurrently with him when he was away, sometimes one drew, and sometimes the other, for a short period; cheques and bills too—I was very little at the office indeed—I gave the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills to the prisoner for repayment of the money—I told him it was in repayment—it was repaid as so much cash that I had previously received—I mean to swear that—I have since taken steps against Aubenheim, and received some money on these bills from him—in consequence of the prisoner's departure, and my discovery of the means by which he had raised the money, I consi<lb/>dered that Aubenheim was not entitled to have drawn those bills, and took proceedings against him—I treated him as a rogue—the money I paid for the bills was the payment of the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have received a very small sum of money from Aubenheim, not above 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not charging the prisoner with taking that 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but with drawing certain sums of money from the bank—the private ledger is here—125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or some sum in florins, was received over in Worms—I had the account handed to me by my agent, which you are at liberty to inspect—Aubenheim paid a certain sum in florins, which I suppose would amount to 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; two of these bills were accepted on 15th April, and the third was arranged to be accepted—I have</p>

               <p>ordinary way with other sums of money—when he was on a journey, he sent up the cheque, on his own private bank it appears—I was not aware of that at the time—I was not aware of it until you mentioned it to me at the Mansion-house—on looking at my papers, I found it was so—it appears it was not part of my journey-money—he could not enter it at the time in my bank, because he was away—it was entered by Colter, my clerk—he is in Court—I am not aware that Mr. Scobell is in Court—I believe that sum was sent us as an ordinary remittance on a journey—if you ask me why I think he sent a cheque on his private account, I should say that he had a design in it—on my oath the prisoner did not tell me, a few days before he went on that journey, that he would pay another cheque of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards the partnership, and that cheque was not sent up for that purpose—I don't know what it was sent for—I have entered it in the private ledger, not in his private account—I can give no other explanation of that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. except that it was an ordinary remittance—I had no means of distinguishing it—I saw a letter of mine to the prisoner at the Mansion-house—I don't know where it is now—I handed it back to you—I then admitted, as I do now, that the cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was irregularly paid—it ought to have come up with other moneys—I was not aware that it was on his private account—he remitted the journey-moneys in various ways—he was in Scotland at this time, and if he received a lot of Scottish notes, he would send me them up—I did know then that he had a private banking account—my pass-book would not show it—it would show 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than I ought to have; but the prisoner would balance his account when he came from his journey—I was not in the habit of looking at the books at that time—that sum of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was marked "private" by the prisoner—I should expect him to balance his account when he came home, and if that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deficient, I should certainly call upon him to account for it—when I came to examine the journey-account, I found it correct, without counting the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was a surplus—I have taken no active steps in repaying or receiving—he has taken a very large sum—there was another sum of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in on 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I have every reason to believe that that came from a Mr. Hermann—I can only say it was paid in—I know nothing of another sum of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd on June 1st—the two sums you previously called my attention to of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each I have entered in this private ledger as on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June—I have given the prisoner credit for those—that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 25th May, I believe was drawn in one note, and was paid to a Mr. Chineworth by the prisoner, for what purpose I don't know—I have not included that sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on those five bills—that is a mere rough account made up at the moment—all the sums I charge him with are not included there—I did not know of them all at the time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an account prepared—the total is 918<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I have to his debit, that is the balance; in making up that sum I do not debit him with the three bills for 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not find it here—the item at the top of the page, which is 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is a sum composed of other small sums brought over—I have made this out since I was at the police-court, not under the advice of my solicitor; it was a regular account prepared—my solicitor had several times asked for accounts—he told me I must prepare an account to include all sums—there are sums in there we had no knowledge of at the time—that account was simply a record from the cash-book; it was prepared for my own guidance—these are items read out to me by Mr. Scobell—I wrote at his dictation; he had the books before him—it does not include all the drawings charged against the prisoner when he was at the Mansion House; it was produced because</p>

               <p>you wished to have it—it was not prepared with care or accuracy—it did not include all the drawings I then charged him with taking—I did not strike a balance, because at the time that was done actions were pending on some cheques, which I have had to pay—this had nothing to do with the actions at all—I was only saying that at the time it was prepared, in June, these payments were not absolutely made which I have subsequently in<lb/>cluded—I have since included the payment of a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated somewhere about June 8th, a post-dated cheque—there was another cheque dated June 8th; I have no doubt it is here; it may have been June 5th—yes, this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and is dated June 1st—here is another one dated May 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>; that was paid on May 30th—there is an entry there of that—there is also an entry on June 1st, of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the day book is here—that cheque for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is dated May 30th, and entered here June 1st—the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques have not changed places, because the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid till some time afterwards—it is quite possible, for this reason, that at the time I made that account it was not entered in the bank account—if a cheque is given on May 30th, it is very probable it would only be paid in on June 1st—there is only one cheque on May 30th, and one dated June 1st here—this one, dated May 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seems to have been retained by some one, and then paid in on the 30th—I charged the prisoner with stealing special sums, amounting altogether to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I have repaid the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the prisoner paid in by the bills, and therefore he had no right to draw out this 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under any circumstances—he says, in his letter, that I had 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his, and I say it is not true—I say I repaid the sum lent by Auben<lb/>heim by the bills—I have not charged the prisoner with so large a sum as he has taken, and therefore the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before mentioned has been virtually deducted—he has not specially had credit for it in that document you have there, but I have another one prepared which shows it—I believe the prisoner is a bankrupt; he has petitioned the Bankruptcy Court—I knew that, per<lb/>haps, about three weeks before he was charged at the Mansion House—he gave me notice where he was through his attorney—for a long time the matter was in Messrs. Mullen's hands; they simply had notice that he was about to petition the Bankruptcy Court—I don't remember whether his address was sent or not; it may have been—I went immediately and in<lb/>formed Mr. Mullens—it may have been three weeks after that that I took proceedings in the police-court—during that time I believe there was an ex<lb/>amination in the Bankruptcy Court, but I did not take any notice of it—it would have been rather an awkward thing to have been made a partner with him in the Bankruptcy Court, but I did not fear that—on my oath I con<lb/>sulted Mr. Mullens as to criminal proceedings immediately after the pri<lb/>soner's departure—after I had been swindled I tried to get the money back the best way I could, and for that purpose I sued Aubenheim—two of the bills were abroad upon which I took criminal proceedings—there are entries of the payment of the prisoner's salary continually, on account—here is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have the private ledger here—there was no entry made at all from the cash-books until after his departure—it had never been posted; it could only be eutered in the cash-book—it is only posted from the cash-book to the ledger—there was no entry made of these sums—he drew sums from time to time corresponding nearly with the amount of his salary, and, of course, as I was away very much, these sums could not be made in regular weekly payments—I have other clerks and servants—I have a wages account in this ledger of them—there is no wages account of the prisoner's; he was in a confidential position with me, and he was desirous that the amount of</p>

               <p>his salary should not be exposed—the wages of the others are entered weekly; the men paid at the factory, and the lads in the office—you will see entered here 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as half a year's salary of the prisoner's—this is the account, from June to December, of the amounts paid to him; it was not made up after<lb/>wards—I don't care whether it is called a drawing account, or what it is called—it is written there, "A. Oppenheim, drawing-account"—that was not written with the intention of being legally discussed afterwards; it does not appear anywhere else—when the balances were drawn it was included with the other amounts—it appears in the general balance—that was the settlement at the end of the half-year—it is carried to another book, in which my balances were kept—I have not that here; it was my private balance—this was all during my partnership with Fletcher—I can show you that sums were drawn after the dissolution, but they were not entered regularly because it was not posted—it was the prisoner's duty to post it, and he did not—he left before the six months were out—I can only show you that these sums have been taken; they are chiefly in the prisoner's own handwriting—it is not spoken of as salary or wages, it is simply entered, "Oppenheim"—that is a ledger in which I have made private memoranda—I see here an entry on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January, "Oppenheim 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." then "Oppenheim 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have put those sums into that account which you have before you—I have extracted all the sums I have found from the day-book—that account was read to me by Mr. Scobell, and I simply wrote what he read—the prisoner has been credited on that paper with the amount which was due to him for salary—there is no other entry of salary or wages than that which I have described—there has been no settlement since December 1862.</p>

Oppenheim's drawing account," and not a figure was written on that page until after his departure—I swear that those two pages were written up to 1862, certainly, and all the rest written after his departure, after I found him to be a rogue—there is "A. C. Fletcher's drawing account" just in the same way, and that is balanced up; he was not a clerk—I put my own drawing account in the same manner—I do not know the legal impres<lb/>sion</p>

               <p>a passenger on board—the name of the first mate was John Carswell—the steward's name was <hi rend="italic">Aboo</hi>—he was a Malay—the cook was a Chinaman; I do not know his name—there was also a boy who attended to the lamps; I don't know his name, but we called him <hi rend="italic">Cassa</hi>—Michael Anderson was the carpenter—there was a Frenchman, an able seaman, called Candereau—the prisoners were all seamen, able or ordinary, on board—some short time after sailing there were some complaints by the captain about some of these men being deficient in their duty—I never saw the captain use any violence—I have heard him call them names, "<hi rend="italic">Coolies</hi>," and "Sons of bitches"—the men complained about the food and water, which was attended to directly and rectified—I heard Blanco make one complaint, and that was attended to—he did not think that the scale of victualling and articles was enough, and wanted more—I remember about the commencement of September Carlos being wanted on deck—the mate and I went and asked him several times to come on deck—he would not come, and the mate took hold of him and pulled him out of his berth—he said he was sick, and wanted his watch below—all the watch stopped below with him—they were Marcelino, Marco, Watter, Blanco, and Chaucis (<hi rend="italic">Lopez</hi>), Carlos, and two others; I don't re<lb/>member their names—the mate and I brought Carlos <hi rend="italic">aft</hi> on to the quarter<lb/>deck—all the rest turned to their work but Carlos—he would not turn to, and the mate ordered me to bind him fast to the rigging—I made him fast, and he remained bound for about five minutes—the captain then came up out of the cabin, and inquired what was the matter, and gave me orders to loose him, and he gave him some medicine, and he went below and turned into his berth for the day—some days afterwards I remember a quarrel between Carlos and Blanco—I and the mate interfered to stop them from fighting—the mate and Carlos struggled together, and the mate gave him a blow; I can't say for certain where, but he gave him one, I think—I re<lb/>member the night that the captain was killed—I had the first watch, from 8 to 12—Mr. Carswell, the chief mate, relieved me at 12—his watch lasted from 12 till 4 in the morning—when I was relieved I turned in—there is a house on deck, divided into four compartments—the prisoners lodged in one compartment, on the port side; the fore compartment; not all the crew; these eight prisoners, and Powell and Williams—those ten occupied the fore compartment, on the port side—on the starboard side, were the carpenter, Candereau, a seaman, and the boy Early—on the starboard side aft was the cook's galley, and on the port side aft the boatswain's store—on going down the companion ladder, the first berth on the port side was the mate's; the next was the captain's brother, and the next aft was mine—the captain occupied all the starboard side himself—the main cabin was between, with a sky-light opening on to the poop—I turned in at 12 o'clock the night the captain was killed—I was awoke by a noise on deck, about 3 o'clock—it was a noise like a beating or hammering on the companion—I instantly ran out of my berth and tried to get on deck to see what was wrong—I could not get on deck for some person lying on his face on the companion ladder, with his head parallel with the top step—a number of persons were beating him on the head with hand-spikes or capstan bars—I recognised one of them to be Blanco—at the same time I received a blow that hurled me right down the companion again into the cabin—I took hold of the man they were beating, and tried to pull him away, but I was not able to move him—I then called out to the captain for assistance, but got no answer—I went into his berth, and found that he was gone—I then went into the main cabin; I trimmed the light, which was very dim, and I found</p>

               <p>the captain lying dead, and a pool of blood round him—his night dress was all full of cuts on the left side—I then went into the captain's brother's berth—I found him gone also—I next went back to the companion, and examined the man who was lying in the companion, and found it to be the captain's brother by his dress—I then went into my berth, and locked the door—the noise was going on all this time, for about three-quarters of an hour—the noise ceased about five minutes after I went into my berth, and they kept calling me several times on deck—it was some of the men; who it was I don't know; I did not recognise their voices—at the end of about three-quarters of an hour a great many of these men came down in the cabin—Lyons was spokesman; there was Blanco, Duranno, Santos, Chancis (Lopez), and Carlos, and some others—the parties that I have mentioned circled round my cabin—there were some behind them—I could not see who they were, but these I am sure of—Lyons called me out of my berth—I asked him what he was going to do with me; if he was going to kill me—he answered no—he said they had killed the captain and the mate, and the captain's brother had got away somewhere; they did not know where—he said, "I do not know where"—he meant to say that he had got away somewhere, or stowed away—he did not say they had killed him; he had got away from them, or something to that effect.</p>

               <p>in English, but he spoke in Spanish—I understand a little Spanish—I ob<lb/>jected to divide it out; I said I did not want to have any share in it—Lyons said I should have a share in it, and to divide it out amongst them—I objected to do it, and said they could do it without me, but Lyons insisted that I should do it, and I shared it out in seventeen parts—I put my share into the writing-desk, and never saw it after—the four that were the chief actors in gathering up the money gathered out the clothes as well—they did not ask me to divide them; every one took what they liked; I don't know exactly who took them; all that were in the cabin, I believe; I did not take much notice of what they did—I saw the captain's watch put into the writing-desk where I put my money; I don't remember who put it there—they put it there, they said, to sell it afterwards, they could not divide it—I saw chests of boots and shoes broken open, and each took what they liked out of them—I do not remember who helped themselves to those; I don't remember any names; all that were down there—they had not left the cabin—I don't know what became of the cap<lb/>tain's brother—the cargo consisted of bottled beer, wine, iron pipes, and bale goods—there was some champagne; that was broached—I saw cases of it knocking about the deck, and bottles of it, and all sorts of cloth and merchandise—who were the actors then I don't know—some few days after this had happened we saw a ship standing in the same course that we were—I asked Lyons if I might speak to her, as I wished to compare longitude—he said he did not think these men would allow me to speak to any vessel or hoist any signal, but he would go forward and speak to them, and see if they would allow me—he went forward, and came aft and said I might speak to her, but not to say anything about what had occurred—I steered towards the ship and spoke to her; she turned out to be an English ship from Liverpool, called <hi rend="italic">The Friends</hi>, bound to Buenos Ayres—Carlos told me to say the ship's name was <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi>, and not to say where we came from, or where we were bound to—I gave the ship's name as <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi>, from New Dieppe, bound to Valparaiso, forty-seven days out—I did that because I was afraid for my life; I gave that fictitious name because I was afraid if I did otherwise I should meet with the same fate as the captain and the mate—the other men were all on the quarter-deck at the time—after <hi rend="italic">The Friends</hi> had passed there was a great noise amongst these Manilla men, the Spaniards, and two Greeks—they were talking in Spanish—I could not understand them properly, but they looked very threatening, as if they were dissatisfied about something—Lyons told me that those who did not understand English thought I had told all about what had occurred—they did not actually do anything, but they were standing talking to one another, and casting very threatening looks at me—I remember on 30th September Watter being on deck; he took a knife to the steward, and cut him through the fleshy part of the arm, and put a cut in his right side about three inches long and half an inch deep—next day I was called in to the steward's berth—Blanco, Watter, Chancis, and Lyons were standing outside the door; Duranno was also there—I had got the steward to get all the captain's papers into his berth for safety—he had done so, and they were tearing them up and heaving them overboard—the steward was a Malay—they asked me if I knew anything about the papers and the gold watch—I said, "No"—Chan<lb/>cis spoke—he said they were looking for the gold watch they had lost—I told him I did not know anything about the watch—we made land on the morning of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> October—we were about ten miles from land when we first sighted it—when we sighted land I could not get the crew to speak to me;</p>

               <p>they did not seem as if they required my services any more—they tacked the ship and stood off all day—when they had got about thirty or forty miles from land they scuttled the ship—about 8 o'clock at night Blanco came down into the cabin, and ordered me on deck—when I came up on deck I found they were <hi rend="italic">clewing</hi> up the sails and getting the boats over—I asked Lyons what he was going to do with the ship—he would not speak to me—about ten minutes afterwards Marcelino passed close to me—I asked him what they were going to do to-night, or if they were going to kill me—he said he was not, but he thought Blanco was—that was all that passed then—about three-quarters of an hour after that I got into the boat—there was the cook, the steward, Frank Powell, Watter, and the boy Early; that was all that were in that boat—the other part of the crew were some on board and some in the boat astern of the ship, made fast to the ship—the boat in which I was pulled away from the ship, about a hundred yards—we were called back by somebody from the ship; I could not recognise the voice—Powell, the cook, Early, and Watter were pulling—nobody in the boat wished to go back with the exception of Watter; he ordered Powell to pull the boat's head round, which Powell did not wish to do, and Watter used he oar to him and made him do so—the boat was then pulled back alongside the ship—Lyons spoke in English, and ordered us to come on deck—I did so—when I got on deck I saw Lyons and Duranno throwing bottles of champagne down into the boat—I heard the steward singing out some time afterwards in the water; he was singing out-to Lyons for help—he was in the water swimming—he never came ashore—I then went into the boat astern—I was ordered in by Lyons and Blanco—I stayed there about an hour and a half—several things were passed into the boat, but by whom I don't know; it was dark, and I could not see—after that hour and a half Lyons, Duranno, Chancis, and Blanco got into the boat; they were the last to leave the ship—the others were in the other boat; some were in the boat with me while these four men were on board—I saw the ship go down; she went down the very minute these men left her—I did not see the cook land ashore, or the lamp-trimmer, Cassa—we steered for land, our smaller boat being towed by the larger one—we landed at 4, P.M. on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> October—when we landed Lopez said I was to say it was an American ship from Peru, laden with guano, for Bordeaux, in France; and that she had foundered 500 miles out at sea, and that they had been in the boats five days and five nights; that the captain and the other sailors had got into another boat, and we had lost them during a heavy breeze of wind, and which way they went they did not know—I did not state that to anybody; I never got anybody to inquire of me; there was no one to speak English to—that night we stopped at a farm-house of a man named Corria; he afterwards drove me to a place called Rocha—that was on the 5th—I found out that there was a man in the camp who could talk English; that was some miles distant—I and Can<lb/>derean got into a cart—we found a person named Manuel Ramos, a store<lb/>keeper, who could speak English—we had to go twenty-one miles—none of the prisoners knew I was going, nobody but Candereau—we made a com<lb/>munication to Ramos—after that I went before the Naval Court at Monte Video.</p>

               <p>about the quantity of water allowed—I did not hear the captain say, "Drink salt water then"—the watch on deck were allowed the privilege of sleeping under a sail on deck when we did not want them, so that they could lie down and rest themselves there—they were supposed to be always handy, but sometimes they would not be awakened all night in warm weather—I never heard them complain that they were not permitted to sleep in their berths, but were compelled to sleep under this sail—Lyons was the man that spoke the best English on board; next to him Carlos—I am not aware whether Carlos usually talked Spanish among the crew; I think they always received our orders in English; they always understood us in English—Lyons and Powell gave them orders in English—the orders were given to Lyons and Powell by the captain, the first mate, and myself, and by them translated to the others—that practice continued after the death of the captain, as far as the navigation of the vessel was concerned—when I wanted to communicate anything to the crew I communicated to Lyons.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any distinction made either in speaking of the men, or in addressing them, between the blacks and the other men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were never styled "blacks"—all that I heard the captain call them was" coolies "and" sons of bitches"—I suppose coolies would be termed blacks—I don't remember who he was addressing when he so styled them—the quarrel between Carlos and Blanco was after Carlos had been tied up to the mast; I don't remember how long after—it was not a severe struggle between them—the mate and I interfered, and stopped them—they had not time to struggle much; one had got a knife, and the other a hand-spike—I don't know what it was about—I don't remember ever seeing Carlos quarrelling with any of the other coolies—I cannot say it did not occur, because I did not see it to my knowledge—the captain used to talk to the coolies in Spanish—I don't know what language they spoke among themselves—Spanish was the general language that was spoken on board amongst them—Carlos slept in the same compartment with the blacks; I have seen him there—I never heard of his objecting to sleep there; not that I remember—I never remember his speaking to me about it—he did not tell me that he did not wish to sleep in the same compartment with the blacks—he was not in my watch—I won't say he did not complain, but not to me that I know of—I have been about eight years at sea—white men do generally object very strongly to be put in the same compartment with the blacks—I do not remember that Carlos very seriously objected to being put in the same compartment with them after his quarrel with Blanco—the captain was pretty kind to Carlos—he exhibited great humanity on the occasion of his being tied up; he desired him to be taken down from the mast—he was not tied up; he was standing quite comfortable—he was tied to something—the captain desired him to be be loosed, and to turn in, and to have medicine given to him—I don't remember that the captain's brother was kind to him—I never saw him show any kindness to him—I left the watch on deck at 12 o'clock—I do not know whether Carlos was at the wheel at that time—I never took particular notice—it was Carlos who told me to go to the River Plate or Buenos Ayres—that was on the morning of the 10th of September—he told me that in the cabin, close to my berth door, the morning that the captain was murdered, after I had been three-quarters of an hour shut up in my berth—it was dark at that time; it was not quite day-light, just—I don't remember how many men were down there; I have mentioned how many I saw—I was very much alarmed and excited—I am sure it was at that time that Carlos told me to go to the River Plate—he told me to go to the River Plate, that it was a good country, and there were plenty of Spanish people there—I mean to say that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010050"/>
               <p>he told me that in the cabin that morning—I remember his speaking to me about it on one other occasion on the quarter-deck; I don't remember how many days it was after the 10th September, I am sure it was not Lyons who told me to go to the River Plate—I remember saying to Carlos, after something had been said about Buenos Ayres, "If we go there, I shall be punished first, as I am in the command of the ship"—I don't remember the date of the month that I said that; it was some days after the 10th; it was after they had requested me to navigate the vessel; it was said on the quarter-deck; I believe we were alone—I don't remember that he was then complaining about the blacks; he might have done so—he said that Buenos Ayres was a good place to land, and all that, because there were no English authorities there, or anything of the sort—I don't think I said, "I shall be punished first if we go there;" if I did say so just now, I did not under<lb/>stand you—I remember Carlos saying something like, "No, we shan't be punished, as we had nothing whatever to do with the murder"—I might have used words to the effect that if we went there I should be punished first, as I was in command of the ship—Carlos might have mentioned in reply, "No, we shall not be punished, as we had nothing whatever to do with the murder;" I can't give you a decided answer whether he did or not; I had too much to think about—I can't say yes or no, whether he did say so—I went ashore in the boat with Carlos after we left the vessel—if Carlos was in the other boat which left the vessel, and then went back, I did not see him—it was Carlos who told me to call the ship the <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi>—he was then on the quarter-deck—some of the blacks were there; I don't say that they were close to him—they were within a few paces of him, within hearing—I don't know whether they had been speaking to him before he told me that; I was looking at the ship; I don't know whether he came by their orders or not.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have mentioned that a number of men came down on the morning of the 10th, and Lyons asked you to navigate the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not direct the ship's course for Buenos Ayres exactly that day; at least I did not do so directly; I did it that day—we were originally bound for Singapore—on the morning of that day Carlos told me to navigate the ship for the River Plate—he spoke to me afterwards about its being a good place to land, but I can't say how long afterwards; it was some days; I don't recollect his words exactly—he was talking about the place; that it was a good place; that there were no English people there, they were all Spanish, and they could get away, or something of that sort—I don't remember what I said in answer; I very likely agreed to his words then—it did not matter what they said to me, I said yes to it—the quarrel between Blanco and Carlos, when the mate and I interfered, was about 1st September—that quarrel had nothing to do with Carlos being tied up; the quarrel was some days after that.</p>

               <p>heard persons calling from the ship to the steward to come on deck—on that same afternoon, before I scuttled the ship, Lyons told me to fasten down the hatchways and everything that was loose on deck—he told me to use long nails—I did not fasten the things down—I cut all the lashings off, so that they might float—I did not use long nails; I took them as short as possible in order that if anybody was below they might come up—I remember our coming up with a steamer—the prisoners were very frightened if the steamer should see them—Joe Catalan [<hi rend="italic">Lopez</hi>] said if the steamer should see them, the best thing was to jump overboard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">English names, and speaking the English language. In addition to that, there is a piece of evidence furnished by the prisoners themselves on this subject, viz., their request that the ship may not be taken to any place where there were English authorities; which would imply that such a place would be one where they would be most in danger. I am of opinion, therefore, that there is abundant evidence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">whether it is inevitably proved is another matter</hi>) <hi rend="italic">upon which the Jury may find that this was a British ship. As to the other objection, that there is no evidence that the Flowery Land, named in the certificate, is the Flowery Land in question, that is for the Jury: we have it that this particular ship was a British ship, in addition to which it has been held over and over again, that identity of name is abundant evidence of identity of the thing. The only thing I was about to look at further, was whether there was any statement in the certificate of who the captain was; I do not see it; but it is a matter of perfect indifference, because, independently of that, there is abundant evidence, to my mind, that the ship is the ship named in the certificate, and independently of the certificate, there is other evidence upon which the Jury might well come to the conclusion that this was a British ship.

I went to cut a bit of tobacco to put in my pipe, when the cabman asked me who would pay him. I said, if he drove me where I told him, I would pay him.

On Saturday, 10th January, I was on duty near Wych-street—I saw the prisoner in the Strand about half-past 12, with two other men and two women—I was in private clothes—I watched them, and they went into Wych-street—two or three minutes after<lb/>wards I went into Wych-street, and saw a crowd of several persons—I saw the prosecutrix lying on the ground, and the prisoner running away—I ran after him some distance, and lost him in the neighbourhood of Clare market—I saw him again about an hour afterwards in a pie-shop by Temple-bar, with three others—I took them all to the station, brought the prosecutrix</p>

We went into Wych-street, and there was a disturbance. I saw people run past me, and a female and another constable in uniform. The female said something about being robbed. I walked home towards Clare market, and afterwards came back again. Do you think, if I had committed such a crime as this, I should have come back to the place? I met my friends again, and went to the pie<lb/>shop with them, and was taken.</p>

I am a detective city officer—about half-past 7 on the night of 5th January, I went into the Three Cranes public-house, in Watling-street, and saw Fearn sitting on this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and Moore on his right-hand side whispering to him—I waited there some time, at last they separated; Fearn going in the direction of Southwark-bridge—I followed him, took hold of the parcel, and said, "Fearn, I shall take you into custody for receiving that parcel from one of Mr. Olney's servants; the little man with the plaid scarf on"—Moore at that time was wearing a plaid scarf—Fearn said, "For God's sake don't take me, you will ruin me; I shall lose my character"—he repeated those expressions several times on the way to the station—he said "It is a very bad job for me"—I told him that I had seen them together many times before, and it had been going on for some time—when we got to the station I left him there for a little while and returned to the Three Cranes, thinking to find Moore, but he had gone—I then went back to the station, and said to Fearn, "I-am about to put a question to you, you can please yourself whether you answer it or not. What is the name of that little man you received the parcel from?"—he said"Samuel Moore"—I said, "You knew he was employed at Olney's in Watling-street?"—he said, "I did not know he was employed there, but I knew he was employed in the neighbourhood"—previous to this, I had seen the prisoners together in Fountain-court, Lawrence-lane, where money has passed from Fearn to Moore—the parcel contained twenty-four packets, each packet consisting of a dozen reels of cotton.</p>

               <p>was about to take him in custody for stealing a quantity of cotton from his employers the previous night, which he had given to a man named Fearn, in the Three Cranes public-house—he said, "Whoever has told you that I gave Fearn anything in the Three Cranes, has told you a lie"—I said, "I make a mistake about the Three Cranes, it was in Queen-street, "to which he made no reply—I took him to Bow-lane police-station, where the charge was entered—I asked him if he had a box at Mr. Olney's place, having ascertained that he boarded on the premises—he told me he had, and I should find the keys of it in his trousers pocket, hanging over it in his bedroom—I went to the bedroom, and found the keys as he had stated—I opened the box, searched it, and found one dozen sets of charms and half a dozen clasps, and in a purse in the box I found this address, "Mr. E. Fearn, 39, John-street, Urfur-street, New Kent-road"—that is Fearn's address—I returned to the station, showed these things to Moore, and asked him if he was aware they were in his box—he told me he was, and he considered they were his; he found them in the sweepings at the warehouse—I was present at the Mansion House when Moore was charged with this offence—he asked, in my presence, if he could pay for those articles—I believe he asked Mr. Olney to be merciful to him, or something of that sort.</p>

I live at Union-place, Limehouse—on 26th December the prisoner and four more, came into my place, and wanted to send out for some beer; I objected, and so did my wife—I afterwards went out for some beer, in order to get them to go quietly out of my place, and before much of it was drunk, the prisoner said that me and my brother could be bought for a shilling—after repeating that several times, he tried to throw me into into the fire, but found he could not, and my friends shoved him out into street—he challenged me to fight, but I was not let out—he then went away—I called at his place two nights afterwards, Monday the 28th, between 8 and 9 o'clock, but he was denied, and I went away—I had not gone very far when I heard a step, turned round, and saw the prisoner, who struck me on the eye with a piece of iron, which knocked me to the ground insensible—I knew nothing more till I found myself at home in bed next morning.</p>

I am single, and am sixteen years old—I live at 31, Nelson-street, Boundary-street, Cock-lane—I know the prisoner—I was with him on Christmas evening, from 8 till half-past 12—we took a walk round Whitechapel, and then went to the Bird-cage public-house, Gibraltar-walk—we stayed there till the house closed, and then went down Charles-street to Cock-lane—he saw me home—I am not sure whether I saw him the next day, or the next, or the next—I don't think I saw him again until he was in custody; a young girl told me, when I was at work, that William Gullings was taken on suspicion of breaking into Mr. Tatham's house—I knew that was false, because he was with me—I gave my evidence before the Magistrate.</p>

l</hi>. altogether—the ear-rings and pins, brooches and lockets were not sold by weight—Mr. Clark said he would buy a lot of keys to attach to the Alberts so that they should not be known, because the Alberts had no keys—the sale took place by candle light—the outside shutters were sometimes closed when I went there, and sometimes when we went there he would close them—I went backwards and forwards to Levin—Clark's wife was in the parlour at the time the goods were sold—when Levin told Charters that he had a brother-in-law at Brighton who would buy the jewellery, Charters said that he did not want him, he had plenty of men in London who would buy, and he had a man in London who would buy any amount—on the Monday when he sold him the ear-rings, Charters gave Levin a seal and key and a turquoise pin; they came from Mr. Cherrill's—I remained at Levin's a fortnight, and when I left I went to New Norfolk-street, Commercial-road, and stopped another week with Charters—after that I went home and surren<lb/>dered myself—I am now suffering imprisonment—on the Thursday, the day after I left Levin's, I went with Charters, and he asked Levin for the jewel<lb/>lery and money—Levin said that he had thrown it over the bridge—Char<lb/>ters said, "You don't mean to tell me that you have thrown 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stuff and 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. away—after a good deal of talking, he gave him 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and offered him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods—he said he had not got them, he had thrown them over the bridge—I never saw Mr. Cherrill's goods again after that.</p>

LEWIS</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on behalf of Levin, objected that in this Indictment Levin was charged with receiving, whereas by common law two persons could not be charged with stealing and receiving, but only under the Statute</hi> (24 25 Victoria, c. 96), <hi rend="italic">that there must either be Counts charging a substantive felony, or Levin must be charged as an accessory; the Count either charged him as a receiver accessorially, or charged a substantive felony, and it did not charge the former because it did not disclose that the goods were stolen by any principal: it alleged that he received goods which had been before then feloniously stolen, which goods might have been stolen by Charters, but not received from him: and the Indictment not showing who was the principal to whom Levin was accessory, was therefore bad. Next, if the Count amounted to anything, it was a Count charging Levin as a receiver substantively; therefore the prosecution must be put to their election, there being no Statute by which they could charge the substantive stealing by one person and the substantive felony of receiving by another person in the same Indictment: and further, that as the Count was in fact intended to be accessorial, there was nothing to connect the goods in the second Count with the goods in the first: it simply said that they were stolen; they might have been stolen by some<lb/>body else, and Levin was entitled to know who did steal them.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. T. ATKIN<lb/>SON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted, that as the articles in the first Count were repeated in the second, the Indictment saying</hi> "<hi rend="italic">the said two leather bags" it was not necessary to add the words "so stolen.</hi>" <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAWTHORNE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, stated that the words of the Act were, "knowing the same to have been stolen," not "to have been so stolen" which under the</hi> 92 <hi rend="italic">Section were unnecessary; that by Lord Campbell's Act the receiver might be indicted with the thief, or separately; that there was enough on the face of the Indictment, to identify the goods in the second Count with those in the first, and that the word "</hi> so" <hi rend="italic">had been purposely left out by the Legislature.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in reply urged that there must be some connexion of the property, and that though Mr. Hawthorne's argument would be good were there only one prisoner, it was not so when there was more than one, and contended further, that there was no evidence to go to the Jury, as Levin was charged with receiving the said leather bags, and other articles, that the word</hi>" said" <hi rend="italic">might only apply to the leather bags, and as an accessory after the fact, he must be told what property he was charged with receiving: also that there was no evidence of his receiving any bags. Lastly, there were four witnesses who were all accomplices either in the stealing, receiving, or disposition of the property, and as the evidence of one accomplice must not be allowed to strengthen the evidence of the others, they were unconfirmed. The only corroboration was that Levin denied knowing Charters, whereas he did know him, but that corrobora<lb/>tion not being on a material point, was no corroboration at all.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE RE<lb/>CORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">left the last point to the Jury, and</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a painter's foreman, 8, Francis-terrace, Barking-road—on 25th December, my family consisted of my wife, a boy, two girls, and a female servant; up to that time we had been living very comfortably together—I did not know the prisoner at all up to that time—we were living in the house by ourselves—the house was furnished—I went out on the morning of 26th to my work and returned at 1 o'clock, and left again—I did not dine at home—when I left at that time, everything was in the same condition as it generally was; nothing at all to excite my suspicion—on my return in the evening, I met my servant, and in conse<lb/>quence of what she said to me, I went on to my house, and found that my wife had gone; the curtains in the sitting-room had been taken down from the window, and the toilet-covers were taken—I went up stairs, and found the drawers had been opened; all the wearing apparel, bed-clothes,</p>

               <p>clothes, and everything, had been taken away—I went to my box, unlocked it with my key, and there was nothing in it, except the empty cash-box—40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and silver, and a bank-book representing 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the savings<lb/>bank at Limehouse, had been in that cash-box—I also missed three watches, three chains, and two rings; my clothes were also gone; I had nothing left, only what I stood upright in—the children's beds were entirely stripped; they had nothing except a bundle of rags; the pillow-cases were taken off—the drawers I spoke of had contained my wife's wearing apparel, and also linen, sheets, blankets, table-cloths, and towels; the cups and saucers, plates and dishes, knives and forks, were all taken away—the furniture was left, and my children were left; they took away the baby-linen—my youngest child is two years and a half old, and the eldest nine years old—I com<lb/>municated this to the police, and after getting some information, I went off to Ireland—I arrived there on 31st December—I found my wife on that day at some lodgings in Newry—she was occupying two rooms, a sitting-room and a bedroom—the bedroom was in front—the things were hanging up in the other room—I found one coat of mine hanging up, and the other things were all packed away in boxes in the bedroom—I took a policeman there first—I found my wife in the bedroom where the things were—the boxes were in the bedroom, and the other things were hanging round the other room—she was taking tea—the things were taken charge of by the police, and my wife was taken to the station—I found Evans' address on the black box—the prisoner was then sent for from the barracks—I saw him brought into the station, and I saw my gold-plated watch and chain in the policeman's hands—the prisoner was searched there, and nineteen sovereigns and a purse taken from him—I did not swear to the purse; my wife had a purse similar to that—the prisoner was taken into custody; he was remanded for eight days, and ultimately sent over here—nothing was said by the prisoner at that time in my presence—property and money to the value of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was taken away, besides the money in the savings-bank—I had seen the watch and chain which were taken from the prisoner safe on the 24th, early in the morning; they were then in the box where my cash<lb/>box was—I also saw my money safe at that time, because I took out a five<lb/>pound note, and made my wife a present of it.</p>

I am assistant to Mrs. Jane Phillips, of Stratford, pawn<lb/>broker—Mr. Bressey's is twenty-five doors off, and Brayshaw's is almost five minutes' walk—the prisoner came to our shop on the night of Tuesday, 29th December, about half-past 5—he brought a ring similar to those pro<lb/>duced; it was a <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi>—he held out the ring in his hands to my young man and said, "I want five shillings"—I took it out of my young man's hands, thinking it did not look genuine—I said, "I believe it is brass"—he said, "You fool; you ought to know brass from gold"—I rubbed it on a stone, and found it was silver—while I was doing that he said, "Give it me back, I have had five shillings on it hundreds of times, and I can get it again;" and he walked out of the shop—I followed him, and went round to Mr. Bressey's, and gave information to the assistant—I saw the prisoner, and detained him—he then had a ring of similar character on the small finger of one hand—Mr. Bressey showed him the ring he took, and the prisoner offered him all the money he had; I think, one shilling and eleven pence, and said if he would let him go, he would let him have the rest—I saw him searched at the station-house—there was no ring found upon him then, but there was a spurious chain—that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one—it is what is called a <hi rend="italic">"duffing</hi> chain."</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I was called on to attend the deceased on Monday evening, the 10th, about 6 o'clock—he was fast asleep when I went into his room—his sleep appeared perfectly natural, and I aroused him—he complained of severe pain in the front of his head, and said that on Saturday night, January 2d, he was in a public-house, and had a quarrel—next morning, Monday, between 9 and 10, I was informed of his death—I made a post mortem examination, and found on removing the scalp that the temporal muscle on the right side of the head had a quantity of extravasated blood—I removed the cranium, and found evidence of his having some old disease of the top part of his forehead—on examining his penis there was a cicatrice of an old chancre, from which I was led to believe that he had had syphilitic disease of the cranium, one part had closed up, but at other parts the skull was much thinned—on re<lb/>moving the membrane covering the brain, there was a large clot of blood extending all over the right side of the brain—the membrane of the brain was very much inflamed; one half of it, and there was a quantity of fibrin thrown out upon the surface of the membrane, proving that the inflamma<lb/>tion was not recent—the vessels on the surface of the brain were much congested, but the brain itself appeared perfectly healthy, and there was no effusion of serum or blood in the ventricles—he was a fine, strong, healthy man, and I think from the history and the post mortem appearances, he may have bad slight concussion of the brain followed, by severe inflamma<lb/>tion, and that the sudden bursting of one of the vessels caused a large amount of blood to be extravasated, and consequently the convulsions and death—I think the effect I describe would be produced by a blow, from the condition of his skull, which was not strong enough to receive any amount of force—it is impossible to say whether a fall and striking one shoulder on the ground, shaking his body would produce it—I do not think it would be possible to produce it by a shake if the head was not strong—I think from the post mortem appearances, that a blow with the fist near the eye might have that effect—I did not give him laudanum—his taking ten drops of laudanum could not possibly have affected him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the immediate cause of death the extravasa<lb/>tion of blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—when a vessel is wounded, particu<lb/>larly where there is disease, the blood flows out and covers the surface of the brain—if it had been a small vessel the blood would have oozed out slowly—I examined it most minutely, and could not find out the vessel—if it was a large vessel it would cover the surface I saw in a few minutes—the in<lb/>flammation had possibly existed for a few days: more than one—if I had not heard any of the evidence, I should say, from the appearances I saw, that the injuries had been inflicted nine days before, and it is possible, and I do not think it was a more recent injury, because a person may receive a blow on the skull and the symptoms of inflammation might not set in for some time afterwards—in some cases it has not occurred for some length of time afterwards—I do not think the vessel might have burst at the time the blow was given—if that large clot of blood had been on the brain when I saw him at 6 o'clock, I think there would have been some evidence of its being</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010106"/>
               <p>there, but there was no particular indication of his having had any severe injury to the brain; his pupils acted properly—I cannot say whether there was any concussion of the brain; I was not present when he received the injury—I do not mean to say that the blood was oozing nine days—I think the vessel must have burst some short time before death—I do not think it had burst when I saw him first—I do not think a shock would be sufficient to break the walls of the vessel, and the clot was only on one side—I think the cause of the extravasation of the blood was first the slight concussion of the brain, and then severe inflammation, and one of the vessels having been inflamed, must have given way with the force of the blood, and caused the extravasation—if laudanum is administered in sufficient quanti<lb/>ties it produces slight congestion of the brain—it produces heavy sleepi<lb/>ness—that is its effect on the brain—I do not think that a small dose would have that effect—I heard nothing of his having laudanum until the inquest—I think I should have recommended it if I had known as much while he was alive as I did after I opened his head.</p>

I heard nothing more about it till last Monday week, when I heard that Corporal Hewson had been locked up. I spoke about it to the men in the room at Captain Miller's, and told him how it had occurred. About an hour after that the constable came down; he asked me if I knew anything about a revolver and knife. I said I did, and I took him to the shop where I sold the things.</p>

He asked me to sell them for him, and he would give me half the money. I took them to Evans; he tried to sell them, and could not I got them of Evans again, and gave them back to Holding; he came to me on the Friday evening, and gave me eight shillings, and two or three days afterwards he said to me, "Do you think the person who I got these from will miss them?" I said, "I don't know; if you have not got them honestly, I would rather give you the money back again." Now, in the Court here, he has offered to give me money to say nothing about it.</p>

               <p>opening the scalp the vessels behind each ear were congested with black blood, which I attribute either to a blow or some such violence—a blow would undoubtedly have caused it—it must have been by the fist or some blunt instrument—I cannot say that it would be likely to be occasioned by a fall, because there would have been more abrasions and cuts—the brain was perfectly healthy; there was no lesion and ho effusion, but the vessels at its base were very much congested with black blood—it is undoubtedly my opinion that death was not produced by natural causes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 11). On 12th January, shortly after 11 at night, I was temporarily employed in the service of the London and Brighton Railway, on their line in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe, at the junction between the two lines—I was accompanied by a constable, named Thorne—about half-past 11, I saw two persons pass along the line from Whitepost-lane towards the junction—they stopped against a brick-pillar, and I lost sight of them, but could hear them whispering together—shortly afterwards one of the railway servants came along with a light,</p>

               <p>they then went down the embankment till he had passed, and then returned to the back of the pillar—at that time I was close to the pillar, and within a yard or so of the prisoner—I said to him, "What do you do here?"—he mumbled something that I could not understand—I caught hold of him, and called out to my brother constable, "Come on"—the words were scarcely out of my mouth when the prisoner said, "You b——, I will give you 'come on;' " and stabbed me in the face several times—Thorne came up close, to us, and the prisoner struck him over my shoulder, saying, "You b——, I will let you have it"—Thorne did not come to my assistance, and I called out to him, "Stab him; what are you doing of?"—I struggled with the prisoner, and received eight wounds in the face, one on my finger, and one just through the front of my hat—Thorne got hold of the prisoner on the left side, struck him with his staff, and secured him—the other man ran away immediately—I secured the prisoner—as we passed along the line towards the station the prisoner said, "You cannot hang me to<lb/>night for this"—we took him to the station, and he was charged—I went to a surgeon, and had my wounds dressed—during the struggle with me, when Thorne had got hold of the prisoner, I heard him throw something away with his right-hand—after he was down the prisoner said, "Are you an English<lb/>man?"—I said, "There is not much English about you"—he said, "No; I am Scotch"—I knew him before, but did not know it was him at the time I took him in custody, but knew him directly I got him to, the light at the station—Dr. Tilby, the divisional surgeon, dressed my wounds—I bled very much; my over-coat was covered with blood.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 245). I was with Gage on the night of 12th January, in plain clothes, on the embankment of the London and Brighton Railway, near Rotherhithe—I saw two persons go along the line from Whitepost-lane towards the junction; when they got there, I lost sight of them for a moment—I was creeping along in front of the sergeant—I heard them talking for some time, and I laid down; presently, I saw a servant coming along the line with a light; they then came down and concealed themselves behind a pillar till he went by; they then went from behind the pillar on to the line—the sergeant passed me and went up to them, and in about half a minute he called out, "Come on"—I went up to assist him, and found him and the prisoner struggling together—I did not see the other man after that: he was gone—directly I came within arm's length, I was struck with something on the nose (I did not know it was a</p>

               <p>stab at first), which stunned me for about half a minute—it penetrated the side of the nostrils—when I recovered myself, I heard the sergeant say, "Why don't you stab him?"—before I got the first blow, the sergeant said, "He is stabbing me"—I took out my staff, got hold of the prisoner, struck him on the back of the head twice, and he fell down on his knees—he was resisting up to the time I struck him—on going to the station, I was nearly choked with blood; my mouth was full—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found a piece of candle, a small knife, and about thirteen pounce in money—about an hour afterward, I returned to the spot where the struggle took place, with a lamp, and found this screw-driver, and a cap, which the prisoner owned—going to the station, he said, "If you are Englishmen, behave as such: you can't hang me to-night for this"—he said that two or three times—the next morning, as I was taking him to the Police-court from the station-house, he asked me if my head was tore—he said, "If yours is not, mine is. I wished you had killed me; I am sick of this"—he then asked me if Wright had been hanged the morning before at Horse<lb/>monger-lane—I said, "Yes," and he said, "I wish it had been me, instead of him."</p>

I am divisional-surgeon of the M Division of Police, at Rotherhithe—on the night of January 12th, the two constables came to me—I found a considerable quantity of coagulated blood upon Guge's clothes and face, and blood was copiously flowing from eight punctured wounds on his face—this screw-driver is an instrument such as may have made the wounds I saw—nearly all the wounds, which I probed at the time, went to the bone—all the wounds were on the face.</p>
