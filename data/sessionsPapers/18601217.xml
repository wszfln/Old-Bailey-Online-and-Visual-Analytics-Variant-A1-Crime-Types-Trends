                  </hi>. I am an attorney and solicitor, carrying on business at 3, Finsbury-chambers, Bloomfield-street, London, and reside at 36, Newton-street, Hoxton—the prisoner is my wife—I married her on the 24th December, 1850, in New York City—I was introduced to her at No. 1A, Douane-street—she was not living at that time with her parents, they resided in the country—I afterwards came to England with her, in February, 1851, and continued to live in England with her till 1856—we lived at several different places in London and the country—in 1856 we were living at 39, Grafton-terrace, Kentish-town, that is where this matter occurred—I was absent from my residence, generally speaking, from nine till late in the evening—on the morning this matter happened, I had left rather earlier than usual, about half-past eight, and I did not return at night till about eleven o'clock, that was on the eleventh of July, 1856—when I returned I found no one in the house but a child I had by the prisoner; she was two years and four months old—I lighted a candle, and went out to get some beer for supper, from an adjacent public-house, as I had had no dinner—when I came in I found the prisoner and a person who passes as Mr. Moore, just returned from the street, evidently out of breath, as if they had been running, with neither hats, caps, bonnets, or shawls on—I remonstrated with the prisoner upon her conduct—she became very violent as usual—I</p>

               <p>told her I hoped that now she was a married woman, she would not repeat the conduct she was guilty of before she was married—she then deliberately unbolted the two bolts of the door which communicates with the kitchen, and leads into the wash-house, where there was no light, and returned from the dark into the light room, with something in her hand—I was eating some bread and cheese at the time, and noticed that she had something concealed in the folds of her dress, and from my former experience I imagined that she had a knife—I said to her, "You have got a knife"—I got up with the intention of closing with her to prevent her using it, when she immediately threw something, what it was at the time I did not know, which completely blinded me and caused me much agony—it came from her right hand—it was some burning fluid, which went into my eyes and all over my face and clothes, and burnt my neck and face dreadfully, I could not see anything—I put my head into cold water immediately afterwards—when I recovered, I went in search of a police constable, and brought him in—I saw him take a bottle out of the grate—it was summer time, and then was no fire in the kitchen—Alice Young, who calls herself Mr. Moore, pointed out where the bottle was—Mr. Bailey, the surgeon, came to me—I believe Mr. Moore fetched him—he attended to me—I was confined to my bed for about six weeks—I then used to go down stairs on to the sofa in the middle of the day—I have never been able thoroughly to attend to my business since—it has very much affected my sight—I cannot see at all by sunlight, or any strong light, or by gas—the sight of the right eye it nearly gone—I have never been able to see thoroughly with it since—if I close my left eye I can hardly see distinctly—it was not at all affected before that—my left eye was also affected very much for some time—the liquid went into the side of the left eye, but it went all over the right—I think I was attended by Mr. Bailey for about six weeks, and then, at the recommendation of a friend, I went to the Ophthalmic Hospital, in Gray's Inn-road, and became a subscriber—I am still attending there, and am under the same medical care—I did not go to the police court after I recovered myself, in consideration of the child—I said I would forgive her—the matter was taken before the police court while I was confined to my bed, but I said if she would behave herself better, and let that be a warning to her, I would not press the matter—she came back to the house—I may be allowed to say that we never had any sulphuric acid or other burning material in the house, because we had no saucepans, or coppers, or anything of that kind to clean—I never had bought any, before or since—I believe this indictment was preferred in August—between the time this happened, and the preferring of the indictment, something else happened; she found I was not quite blind with the left eye, and she said, "I have put one eye out, and now I will put out the other," and she called me a d----English son of a b----which was a term she frequently used—that was while I was lying on the sofa—I consulted with Mr. Jones, he is my brother, but I have changed my name, by the Queen's license, on coming into some property—this indictment was preferred, but even after that I said, if she would leave the child with me and go away I would not follow it up—she did go away, and left the child with me—that was in September, 1856—I saw her next on the evening of 7th February, 1857—she came and opened the door to me on my return home, about half past seven or eight in the evening, she then had the child in her arms—my mother was at that time keeping house for me—the prisoner asked me whether I would forgive her altogether, and allow her to return to live with me as my wife—after some demur and long conversation she</p>

               <p>promised to pledge her oath upon the Bible—I told her I could not adminis<lb/>ter an oath to her—she said she would be a dutiful wife, and made every promise a woman could make, and then I consented that she should stop—she remained exactly thirteen days—my mother, I ought to say immediately took her departure, because she was frightened at her—at the end of the thirteen days she took herself off, having received some telegraphic despatch from some man or other, and took away with her everything she could lay her hands on, she also took the child—that was not while I was absent—she had packed up everything during my absence—she said she must go to America, and she would take the child to show to her parents, and her brothers, and sisters, and return immediately—I objected and protested against her going and taking the child, but she went—I next saw her on Sunday, 22d August, 1858, and again on the Monday following—I don't know of my own knowledge, whether she remained in England any time then—I next saw her on Sunday evening, 4th November last, under the following circum<lb/>stances—a knock came to the door, the servant opened it, and the prisoner flung the door wide open and came into my parlour, accompanied by the same Alice Young—they both conducted themselves in a very improper manner, sitting on the table and using most insulting and degrading remarks to me; she called me every sort of name she could possibly think of—horrible expressions, the usual expressions—she called me a d----English son of b----, half-a-dozen times, and such expressions as that—I requested them to leave quietly, they would not—I then went for a police constable, but he said he could not remove them unless there was some breach of the peace—in the presence of the police constable, I first turned out Alice Young and then my wife—there was a great deal of resistance, but no force was used more than was necessary—she threatened to pay me another visit, and I then gave her notice of this prosecution, I did that on the 7th December.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The last matter you have been detailing was in 1860, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, last month—I did not say that my wife came back to England on 22d August, 1858—I said I saw her then—I have heard that she subsequently went to America and returned this year, but I do not know it of my own knowledge—when I married her she was eighteen years of age, less twelve days, she did not behave in every respect as a kind wife to me during the early part of her married life; quite the reverse—she did not do all the menial work when we were living in Grafton-terrace in 1852—we were in furnished apartments there, with attendance—it is not true that in consequence of my misfortunes she did the menial work, and even washed her own clothes while we were living there—I have a cousin named Jones of Stonehouse—I struck my wife on one occasion—that was while we were living in Grafton-terrace—I think the blow blacked her eye—I did not make her promise, as my cousin was expected that evening, to say that she had slipped on some orange-peel—I told him all about it, and he said she richly deserved it, and that if I had killed her it would have served her right—that was in 1852, I think; about March—she did not, in consequence of that, go before a magistrate and have me summoned—I mean to say most distinctly that she did no such thing—I can't recollect what she threatened to do, at this distance of time—to the best of my belief she did not threaten to do any thing of the kind—I did not beg her to forgive me that time, and say I would never do so again—you are mixing up another transaction altogether—I never struck her but once—she assaulted me on another occasion very severely indeed, and to protect myself from her violence I laid hold of her to keep her down, and</p>

               <p>on that occasion she threatened to take out a summons, but I do not know whether she did so—I am not sure whether I was served with a summons or not—I do not recollect being served, but I know I did not appear—to the best of my belief the matter was only talked about—to the best of my belief I will swear that I was not served with a summons—I think I dared her to take out a summons—to the best of my belief she did not take it out, but it is more than four years ago, and I will not say postively—there was something at the beginning of 1856—in 1857 I was living at Kingsland—I was arrested for debt then, and confined in the Queen's Bench prison—I was there from September, 1853, to the beginning of February, 1854—during that time she certainly behaved very well, and that was the only time—she behaved remarkably well, and acted as wife ought to do—after leaving the Queen's prison we went somewhere in Southwark, I forget the name of the street; we then removed to 76, Amwell-street—we were living at 39, Grafton-road at the time that a girl named Isabella Stevens was living with us—she was not a servant—she was the daughter of a former landlady, and came more as a companion than anything else—I think she was about ten years of age at that time—my wife never charged me with indecent conduct towards that girl—there is not a word of truth in it; nor was she sent out of the house by my wife upon that; nothing of the kind—my wife was always discharging servants—she never could keep the servants—no servant would stay with her—Mr. and Mr. Moore are not here to-day—I have used every exertion to bring them tare—it was I who introduced Mr. and Mr. Moore to my wife—Mr. Moore was a client of mine—he told me he was thinking of taking a house in our neighbourhood, and would I allow him and his wife to come and reside with us for a few weeks until he could find a suitable house—at that time I believed them to be man and wife—I don't know how many months they lived with us—it was until I found out that Alice Young was not Mr. Moore, and then I gave them notice to quit—they left, I think, the day after the assault I have spoken of—I did not, one night, while they were with me, beat and ill-treat my wife so as to cause her to scream out, and make Mr. and Mr. Moore interfere—she beat me with a bludgeon, and I closed with her to take it away, and then she hallooed out—she went to the window and called out for the police—that was a very common thing for her to do—she would attack me, and then directly she thought I was going to strike her in return, she would call for the police—on the night of this alleged assault, Mr. Moore came home with me—Mr. and Mr. Moore were both present when it took place—they never gave evidence before the Magistrate upon it—I believe they were not called upon—they were there, but Mr. Long was quite satisfied—I was examined upon this charge—I preferred the charge against her in order to get her bound over to keep the peace—that was a month afterwards—she was present when I made the complaint before the Magistrate, and she was bound over to keep the peace—I did not say that I would abandon the charge because I did not believe she knew what was in the bottle, and that she had no intent to hurt me; nothing of the kind—I saw Alice Young on 4th November—I have seen both Mr. and Mr. Moore since—I knew where they were residing, and both myself and clerk and another person also have been there—I saw them both in the early part of this present month—I have not seen them within the last week—I think the 7th was the last time I saw them—my clerk went and served the prisoner with this notice, and I went to find out where Moore was living, as I heard he had faied and was moving—I went to serve him with a notice to appear, and on that night</p>

               <p>I saw them both—I found he was keeping out of the way, and Alice Young has gone away into the country—I have made every possible exertion to subpœna them; three of us have been trying, even as late as this morning—it was a kind of washhouse into which the prisoner went to get the bottle—I believe Mr. and Mr. Moore had a charwoman about once a week—I don't know what her duties were, or what she made use of for the purpose of cleaning things—I understand that it was Mr. Moore who brought the surgeon to me after this occurred, but I could not say—I can't say whether my wife went to get the leeches—Alice Young put them on, and behaved very humanely and kindly—the child was taken to America against my will—I had no control over so young a child—she went away on the evening of 20th February, 1857—she took the child contrary to my wishes—I went with her down to the railway-station at Euston-square, and all the way I was riding in the cab with her I was requesting her to return, and I wrote to her after that, a letter dated 6th March, requesting her to return; I got an answer back on 7th May, refusing to return (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this has the prisoner's signature; the other part is in my writing (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 17th February, 1857, and was an undertaking by the prisoner upon being permitted to take the child to the United States, that it should be returned on attaining the age of seven years, and in the meantime she should be brought up in a manner befitting her station and expectations</hi>)—I repented of having consented to that document, and urged her to put an end to the transaction, and let me take care of the child—I did not mind about her going away, but I wanted possession of the child—this letter is in my hand writing (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 6th March, addressed to the prisoner in the United States, expressing the writer's distress of mind at her having left him, and imploring her return</hi>). I still say the child was taken away contrary to my wishes—I could not control her—I regretted her going—she wrote an answer to that letter, refusing to live with me any longer—in 1857 she did return, and appealed to me to forgive her—this letter dated, 8th February, 1857, was addressed by me to Captain Waite, of the ship Enterprise—that was the day she came to my house; and this other letter dated, 14th February, 1857, addressed to Captain Waite, is also in my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">These letters, being read, contained expressions of thanks to the captain for his care of the prosecutor's wife on the voyage</hi>)—while I was in the Queen's prison I did not deny to the governor that the prisoner was my wife—the deputy-governor ordered her out of the prison, and also a girl who was waiting on me there—that person passed as my wife—this was in August, 1858, when I was there for contempt of court—previous to her return in 1860, I had written to her brother, begging her to return, and I will explain why I did so—I had heard about 4th October, from a brother freemason, that she was dead—I made every possible inquiry, and could not ascertain anything about her, except things which were not pleasant to my ears, and knowing that no straightforward letter would receive an answer from her brother, I wrote a letter for the purpose of eliciting an answer, and I got one both from the brother's wife, and from the prisoner herself—it was such a letter as would elicit a reply—letters had been sent before which were not answered—I did not ask Mr. Miller to write, and try to get my wife to return after I had written that letter—that was in July I believe—there was another letter sent—when she came back to my house I was living in Newton-street—she found me living there with another woman, and with two or three children—the woman was passing as my wife—I turned the prisoner out into the street on that occasion myself.</p>

I am a surgeon of 12, Southampton-street, Kentish<lb/>town—on 11th July, 1856, I was sent for to the prosecutor's house at 11 o'clock, and found the prosecutor suffering from a number of spots caused by fluid on the face, and violent inflammation of the eyes, suffering great pain, and in a great state of excitement—that injury would be caused by strong sulphuric acid—a bottle was given to me with a small quantity of fluid is the bottom of it—I examined it by looking at it only; it looked like strong acid, probably sulphuric, and appeared as if it had been used for cleaning grates or metal utensils—I attended the prosecutor for about a month—I thought at the time that he had lost the use of one eye—I examined his eye this morning and found a little remains of the fluid; both eyes appeared to be weak.</p>

I am clerk to Robert Eason Henderson, a hosier, of 61, Alderman bury—the prisoner came into my master's service on 5th November, this year; not exactly as an errand boy, but to make himself generally useful—my master had a cash-box, which I locked up in an iron chest in the cellar, when the business of the day was over—the prisoner might have Been me lock it up there, I do not know whether he has—on 29th November, Mr. Henderson locked the cash-box, and gave it to me—I put it in the safe, which I locked, and hid the key between some goods in the cellar—I did not positively know what was in it—I did not see the prisoner there then—a night or so before that, I had locked the safe up as usual, and the next morning I was busy, and told the prisoner to bring up the books and cash-box, and I told him where he would find the key—on the 29th, I had put the key in the same place as when I had told him before—he comes to work at 9 o'clock—I was there on the morning of the 30th—when the prisoner came to work that morning, he did not remain above five minutes—the moment we entered the building, he walked down into the cellar—at</p>

I was married to the prisoner on 5th May, 1858, at the Scotch Church, Sydney, Australia—Dr. Laing officiated—I was married at Dr. Laing's house—I don't know what they constitute a church—there is no congregation held, I think, at the place where I was married—it is Dr. Laiug's private residence—I have heard of people being married at private residences—Dr. Laing, his sister, and another person were present—the form of service gone through was not exactly like the Church of England service, but similar: a long ceremony, rather longer than the Church of England service—I have never before heard the marriage service in the Scotch Church performed—the prisoner put a ring on my finger in the course of the service, and the minister then said, "Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder," and long prayers—no one gave me away—I do not think the prisoner was asked whether he would take me to be his wife—I do not remember whether the prisoner said anything when he put the ring on my finger—I lived with him after that for about six weeks in the colony, and then I went to England alone, and he joined me here some months afterwards—that was by agreement with him—when he came home the first time I was very ill, I had just got out of my confinement—he stayed with me two days, and then went a voyage; then he came back, and I joined him in London, and he came with me to my father's house, living with me as my husband—he represented himself as steward of a mail steamer—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the certificate that I received, at the time of the marriage, from Dr. Laing, immediately after the ceremony—the prisoner represented himself as a single man.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you, as you and the prisoner were standing, he would have to reach over you to throw anything into the Wardour-street box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he would; there was not a person of the name of Lancashire at the table where I was sorting—he was at the back of me—I can't say whether he was nearer to the prisoner than to me—he was not far from either of us—I don't think he was sorting at the table I was sorting at, that morning at all—I did not remain at the same place where I was sorting letters next to the prisoner, until the whole of the</p>

               <p>sorting was over—I went and collected my letters up for my own walk and left the prisoner in the same place—he would throw the packet into the Wardour-street box, it would then have to be collected along with other letters and taken to the table for the Wardour-street carrier—I saw the packet safe in the box, and subsequently looked at the table of the carrier and missed it—about a quarter-of-an-hour elapsed from the time I saw it safe in the box and my missing it at the table—after that not a minute elapsed before I made a communication to Hayes—I should not think more than two or three minutes elapsed between the time of my making a com<lb/>munication to Hayes and the introducing of the prisoner to Mr. Tull in his room—I was inside the comptroller's room at the time the prisoner was called in—it would not be the prisoner's duty to go out of the room in which he was sorting, into any other room, while the duty was on—he might have gone out for a moment if he pleased—I was present when Mr. Toll made inquiry of him—he asked him if he knew anything about a missing packet, and he said, "No, nothing at all"—Mr. Tull then said the better way would be for him to empty his pockets; and on that the prisoner immediately did empty his pockets, and he exclaimed, "Why, there is something here"—he had on the same coat he has on now—it had a pocket to it inside (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position</hi>)—I have no such pocket myself—some coats have and some have not; it is just as the men like when they have their coats made—I saw the pocket when it was turned out—it was a large pocket, and there was a small place torn at the mouth of it—when he turned the packet out of his pocket, and Mr. Tull asked him how he could account for it, he said, "For the life of me, I can't tell how it got there"—after the I boxes into which the letters are sorted are emptied, there are baskets provided for the purpose of collecting the letters from the sorting-boxes and taking them to the different tables—the usual way is for the letter-carriers to place the newspapers on their arm, and the letters on the top, and carry them in their arms in the best way they can; sometimes they may have large bundles to carry, and sometimes not so large, it all depends on the walk</p>

CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the letter-carrier who has to deliver both the letters and newspapers, take the letters from the newspaper table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I myself took the newspapers from the newspaper table on this morning—the boxes are divided on the table—after the letters are put into the Wardour-street box, it is the Wardour-street letter-carrier who takes them out of that box—the letter-carrier has to deliver both letters and newspapers, the letters were being sorted at one table, and the newspapers at another—when the letter-carrier has set up his letters, he fetches the newspapers which have I been sorted for his walk—the pocket in the prisoner's coat was at the side, and went right to the bottom of the lining—I cannot tell whether his coat was buttoned at the time.</p>

               <p>consequence of which I looked at the letters I had, and found no packet at all—in order to make sure, I went and looked in the box—I could not find any packet there, and I then went to the inspector and told him there was such a packet, and that it could not be found—one part of the office is used for sorting letters, and another for sorting papers—sometimes by accident letters will get amongst the papers—I got my letters from the usual place that morning—I took them myself from the Wardour-street box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintending sorter at the western office—a communication was made to me by Hayes, on the morning of 7th December, in consequence of which I went straight to his box to satisfy myself that there was no packet in any corner of it—I then turned my eye round and missed the prisoner—I had placed him to do that duty, to see that nothing was left in the boxes; if there had been any it would have been it duty to take them round to the different letter carriers, to save their time and facilitate their duties—not finding the prisoner in the office, I went and looked for him in the letter carriers' department, and met him coming up the stairs from the kitchen, he was coming towards the office with his hat In his hand, as if about to leave—I asked him if he had seen a man named Tucker, merely as an excuse—he said, "No"—I then brought him into Mr. Tail's, the comptroller's office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Vincent, of 45, Cable-street, St. George's—on Saturday-night, the 8th of this mouth, I was standing at my door about half-past 10 or 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner go by—he went into the prosecutrix's house—he had been in the house about five minutes when I heard a great row—I went and saw the prisoner on the stairs, and a young lady on the stairs with a candle in her hand, in her night dress—about a quarter of an hour afterwards the prosecutrix came up the street, and the prisoner ran into my passage after her—she asked me would I come round to her door with her—I said I did not like to do so—she took the key and opened the door, and said to the prisoner, "Get out of my place, you won't pay any rent for me, and won't keep me, I will go to my landlord"—I told her her landlord's place was closed—the prisoner ran out with the knife in his hand, and I saw him stab the prosecutrix with it—before doing so, he said, "I will give you your rent in blood."</p>

I am a gentleman—I live partly upon my private means, at Hornsey-rise—I know the prisoner, and I know Herbert Anthony Manley—he is my brother-in-law—I married his sister—I married her in the name of Augusta Anthony Manley—I remember the marriage of Herbert Anthony Manley with the prisoner on 28th November, 1852—I was present at the marriage—prior to that I went with Mr. Manley to obtain the license—they were married in the name of Herbert Anthony Manley and Helen Morris—her father is a respectable man, and foreman of the plasterers at Messrs. Cubitt's—after their marriage I was present when they started for Melbourne—I accompanied them to Liverpool—they went off in the ship <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>—shortly after they had left I received a letter from the husband—I spoke to the prisoner about that letter upon her arrival in London about two and a half years afterwards—the letter was from Lisbon, and contained a communication respecting the prisoner—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had two letters from him from Lisbon—I after<lb/>wards received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is dated April 30th, 1853—I received that about two years afterwards—it was detained at the Post<lb/>office for want of postage—I know his hand-writing very well—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner from Lisbon, dated May 28th, 1855—I it is addressed to "Mr. Kirtland, bill-office, Bank of England"—I was I at that time a clerk in that office (<hi rend="italic">This letter contained an inquiry whether Herbert was in England, and expressing a wish to come to England in two or three months</hi>)—I answered that letter, and about a month or six weeks I after, I saw the prisoner at her sister Janet's—she asked me relative to Herbert—I told her we had not heard from him—at that time I had not received the letter of 30th April—I told her we were very anxious about him, and I asked her the cause of her leaving him at Lisbon—she said she I left, him at Lisbon and had gone off with a Mr. Price, and Mr. Price had kept her for the period of two and a half years—I forget the exact purport of the conversation, it is so long ago—it implied that she had left Herbert and gone off with Mr. Price—it appeared to have been a pre-arranged matter between them—she said that the vessel put into Lisbon from distress, and remained there about a month or five weeks to refit—in point of fact she confirmed my brother-in-law's letter—she said that she made a pre-arrangement with Mr. Price,' and that, as the vessel was leaving the Tagus, the whole of the passengers were dining at Mr. Price's house and she left the dinner table, taking my brother-in-Jaw's watch away with her, which it appears she has since given to Mr. Richards, that they searched for her everywhere without success, that the vessel was leaving the harbour and my brother-in-law was carried on board by his fellow passengers in a state bordering upon madness—she told me all this—I afterwards saw her in June, 1856—I had then received the letter of 30th April, 1853—I spoke to her about the letter—I told her that we had heard from him from Melbourne, and that he was alive and well at that period—I gave her the date of the letter, and told her that it had been delayed at the Post-office—I did not read the letter to her—to the best of my belief I did not see her again before her second marriage—I did not hear of the second marriage until she told me of it, after receiving a letter—I received this letter from her, dated October 5th, 1857, from Kildare-terrace, Bayswater (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "Helen Anthony "and contained merely a request for an interview, to ask the, advice of the witness with respect to the settlement of some property, the postcript was as follows:</hi> "If you write, address Mr. Archer, as I have not gone by the name of Anthony since I left Buckingham-street")—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith and engineer—on 19th September I was tent to the prisoner's father's house to do some repairs in the kitchen, the shop, and the counting-house—I had been engaged there previous to that—the prisoner, who was there, kept taking away my tools and hiding them, all the morning—I told him that I was losing my time, and he said, "My</p>

               <p>father is master here and he will pay for it"—about 12 o'clock I complained to his father, and shortly after that I went down into the kitchen and saw the prisoner there; he said, "You are a b----y sight too fast, and I will pay you for it before you go"—I made no answer—I finished my work I about a quarter to 3 or 3 o'clock, and had got my tools out on the table and was cleaning my basket out, when the prisoner took a wood chisel and pot it between the bars of the fire—I had a screw-driver in my hand and touched him on the shoulder with it, and he threw the chisel down and said,"You b----y b----r, I will do for you now," and immediately ran away<lb/>two of the apprentices were there at the time, and one of them told me that if he said anything he would do it; he cautioned me—I felt rather frightened at going up stairs—I finished packing up my tools, and the eldest apprentice went up stairs and halloed out from the top, as he was going up stairs, "Now you young b----r, it is not him coming, it is me, do not throw anything"—I went up stairs a few minutes afterwards, and as I was going up I felt something strike me in the face, I put my right hand up having my basket on my shoulder; my eye was very painful—I was blinded and could not open either eye, and while I had my hand up, another handful came and smothered my hand—I cried out and asked the eldest apprentices to take my basket; they led me down stairs and got some water—I was taken to my father's, and afterwards to St. Bartholomew's hospital, where remained seven weeks all but one or two days, during which time my left eye went away; it is quite gone now—I am a married man with two children the prisoner's father is a master builder, at 4, Salisbury-court, Fleet-street; his house is at Kennington—neither the prisoner nor his father have expressed any regret to me, or rendered me any assistance.</p>

I do not want to get Ted into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> because we were both larking, and it was both our fault"—I said, "Make it as light as you can for Ted; do not let his father beat him if you can help it"—I said that to Joe—I could tell it was he by his voice—I did not give as a reason for that that we had been larking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was done deliberately, according to your account; he said that he would do for you, or pay you out; then, why did you not wish his father to beat him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you think I should like to have heard of that boy being three parts killed? I know what a passionate man his father is—I swear that I have never said we had been larking, and that it was my fault—nothing of the kind—this gave me great pain in my eye—I cannot say whether Richardson, the other apprentice, was present, because I have not been accustomed to his voice—Miller did not say to me, "What can you say? what did you tell the people at the hospital?" nor did I reply, "I told them the truth"—Miller did not say "Well, the best way is to speak the truth now; his father is sure to hear of it, and you had better tell it;" nothing of the sort—I did not suggest that the father should be told that it was an accident—I only spoke those words that I have said—when I went to Mr. Ingle's, my master's, I saw the prisoner's uncle, James Cooke—he is a clerk where my father works—he was tipsy—he is nearly always tipsy—he was tipsy in Court yesterday—I cannot say whether he was at work when I went back to Mr. Ingle's, but I saw him, and he said to me, "Halloa <hi rend="italic">Stokey</hi>, what is the matter?" although he was tipsy—I did not say."I think.</p>

I do not know which was the word, and then Edwin took up one of his chisels and pretended to put it into the fire, but did not: that was in play I should think, and Stokes took up his screw-driver and hit him across the back as hard as he could—the lad ran up stairs, and Stokes was going up stairs with his tools when Stokes hit him—he said, "Well, Ted, I did not mean to hit you so hard as that;" and I said, "If it had been in earnest, I should have hit you," but of course it was in play—the lad did not say before he went up stairs, "You b----b----, I will do something for you now," nor any such expression—I will swear that I did not say to Stokes, cautioning him, "What he says he will do"—I left Stokes in the kitchen and went up stain—I saw the lad as I went up—I did not call out to him,"Now you b----r, it is not him coming, it is me;"—or any expression of that kind—when I got up stairs the lad had got some fine stuff in his hand—I said, "Edwin, what are you going to do with that? he said, "Leave it at Stokes, to make him in a mess"—I said, "There is some softer here which will make "him in most mess;" and he took some of that—that was the same kind of stuff only softer—shortly afterwards Stokes came up stairs with his tools, and the stuff was thrown—I found that some had gone into his eye, and I went to him and took him down into the kitchen—I wanted to take it out, but he would not let me, because the pain was so great; he said that he should go <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>—could not wash it he was in such pain, but afterwards I helped to wash some of it out, and so did Edwin, he came into the kitchen and helped to wash it out—Richardson was in the kitchen when the stuff was thrown, and when the larking took place, and putting the lad in the tub, and also when Stokes packed up his tools—Stokes then went to his father, and to the hospital—he returned in about an hour for his tools—he told me that he had been at the hospital, and said, "Has Mr. Cooke been here?" I said, "No;" Richardson was present—Stokes said, "What can we tell Mr. Cooke; because I do not want to get the boy into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, for it was done larking"—I said, "What did you tell the people at the hospital?

RIGBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you any relation to Mr. Cooke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His brother married my mother, after my father died—it was in the shop where I first saw them larking—I was painting Mr. Cooke's office against the gate, where Stokes was laying the gas on—he was at work in the office part of the time and part of the time down below—8th shop is thirty or forty feet long, and ten or twelve feet wide—the gates are on the left-hand side as they go in—it is a work-shop—the counting-house is on the left-hand side—you cannot see from the counting-house all that takes place in the shop—I com<lb/>menced painting on the Monday morning, and finished at about half-past 1 o'clock on Wednesday, before Stokes came back from his dinner, after 2 o'clock—when they were larking I was making up some white-wash in the shop—it was about ten minutes past 2 when Stokes came back from his dinner—they were playing together between an hour and an hour and a half—I did not take particular notice—the work that Stokes was engaged on was fixing some gas fittings down below, and altering a burner in Mr. Cooke's office—but he finished his work before dinner, and when he came back he brought a gas glass which he wanted to sell Mr. Cooke, and he lit all the gas in the shop, which, I suppose, was to waste his master's time and make an afternoon of it—it was fine stuff that they were throwing at each other, and also white<lb/>ning—on my solemn oath, Stokes threw things at the prisoner and played with him, that I swear—I cannot say that I asked them to leave off—the boy was no dirtier than he always is—he was very dirty when Stokes put him in the tub which had blue-black, of which we make white-wash, in it—the tub stood about this height from the ground—it made him in a black mess because he had on a white smock—Stokes was whiter than before with the mess he was in—there was a table in the room, where the prisoner put the chisel in the fire, and Stokes lent over it when he hit him—it is between two feet six inches and three feet wide; he had to stretch across—the boy was sitting in an arm chair, and pretended to put the chisel into the fire—Stokes hit him over the left shoulder, and he had the mark for a fortnight—I am quite certain it was the left shoulder—I told your friend it was on the back, and it was on the back of the shoulder—when I said, "He hit him across the back," I meant the same thing as hitting him on the left shoulder—it was as hard as he could hit him—the boy cried, but not much; he did not seem much put out about it, but as soon as it was done he went up stairs—I heard him crying, and saw tears in his eyes—I am quite sure he did not then say to Stokes, "You b----, b----, I will do for you now"—he never spoke to Stokes—he said nothing at all; I am quite sure of that—I did not caution Stokes that if the prisoner said he would do a thing, he would do it: I am quite sure of that—when I went up stairs I found the prisoner about ten feet from the top of the stairs, with the stuff in his hand by the side of him, waiting, and I called out to him—I said nothing to him before—I saw him as I went up—I did not call out to him not to throw at me—I did not say, "Do not throw, it is only me"—nothing of the kind—I said, "Edwin, what are you going to do with that?"—he said, "Throw it at Stokes to make him in a mess;" and I said, "Here is some softer here, that will make him in more mess"—my age is twenty last November—I saw him after he came—I was present when Sergeant Bell found some alpaca in the corner of a box under the bed<lb/>stead where they were sleeping.</p>

               <p>back from the hospital—I asked him if had been to the hospital—he said, "Yes," and asked me if Mr. Cooke had been in—I said, "No"—there was about a pailfull of this stuff on the premises—he asked me whether we had been at work with the stuff, because we use it in our trade—I gave him a piece of it to be analysed at the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the fine stuff kept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was standing in some iron cans—we had not been mixing some that day—this had been made up many months—I know the nature of it; it is lime and water—it is all lime—the boy was struck on the back of the shoulder: I did not see the mark—he hit him with the iron part; it was between eighteen inches and two feet long—the fine stuff is what we do ceilings with, but some people call it patty—all this pelting was with fine stuff—it will brush off when it gets dry—when the prosecutor came back from the hospital I believe his father was with him, but I will not be certain—I saw nobody lift up the boy by the legs—Richardson did not do so—they were all at play together, and in as good humour as could be; all larking together—I did not see the prisoner taking tools away and hiding them—I saw him take nothing but the chisel—I did not join in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an apprentice to Mr. Benjamin Cooke for ten months—I was there on the Wednesday when this matter occurred—down stairs in the kitchen—I heard them larking up stairs and running after one another and things being thrown about—Stokes came I down into the kitchen while I was there and lit the gas—I will not be sure whether they both came down together, but they were both there—Miller was not there; he was in the shop—he afterwards came down when they were down—Stokes was chaffing the lad about his father and mother, and he said when he was taking up his tools to go away, that he expected Edwin had prigged one of his chisels—Edwin took a chisel off the table and pre<lb/>tended to put it in the fire, and Stokes rushed across the table and hit him with a large screw driver as hard as he could on the shoulder—I did not hear Edwin say, "You b----b----, I will do for you now"—he went up stairs, and Stokes followed him—I did not caution Stokes about his going up stairs, or say that if Edwin said anything he would do it—Miller was up in the shop, but he was down stairs when Stokes hit Edwin—after Edwin went up stairs Joe went up—Stokes went up two or three minutes after Edwin—I did not hear Stokes say anything—I was in the kitchen making some whitewash—soon afterwards Stokes was brought back into the kitchen when some stuff had been thrown—I think Edwin went up first after the blow with the screw-driver; I will not be sure whether it was Edwin or Joe, but Stoke, went up last—Edwin went up directly the blow was struck—when Stokes came down in great pain Joe and Edwin came down into the kitchen—Stokes would not let us assist him for half an hour he was in such pain—I wanted to examine his eye and to wipe it out—he afterwards went away and returned in about an hour for his tools—he then asked us whether we had been working at any job, where he could say that a piece fell in his eye, as he did not like to get the lad into trouble—he said, "No, all we can do is to tell the truth in the matter, as the father will be sure to hear of it some day," and that he believed it was done in game—the prisoner is a good tempered well-behaved lad, I never saw him otherwise—I did not hear Miller say after he left the kitchen, "Now, you young b----r, it is not him coming it is me; nor at any time during the day did I hear the expression, "You are a b----y sight too fast, and I will pay you for it before you go."</p>

I am the wife of Francis Edwards, of 12, Ampton<lb/>place, Gray's Inn-road—the prisoner was in my service on 6th November—on that day, about half-past two o'clock, I was in the kitchen—she was on her knees scrubbing the kitchen floor—I heard a cry like the cry of an infant—I asked her if she heard that noise—she said, "No"—I asked her a time or two and she said, "No" each time—then I asked her if it was her stomach—she said, "Yes"—I heard the noise two or three times—in consequence of that and other matters I noticed, I asked her, in the course of the afternoon, if she had not had a miscarriage—she said, "Yes"—from five o'clock to half-past I sent a message to Mr. Watkins the doctor—he arrived at a quarter to seven—next day she said that when I heard the noise in the kitchen the child was born, and that she put it into the pail-nothing further—when she was scrubbing the floor she had a pail with water in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 21, Euston Road—on 6th November I was called in to see the prisoner—I examined her—she had been recently delivered—I inquired of her what had become of the child—I found that she required medical attention at once, which I paid to her—after that, in reply to repeated inquiries, she said she had placed the child in the ash pit—I went there at once and found it there—it was exceedingly cold, perfectly black from the cinder dust, but alive—it was lying on its side; the head turned round towards the knees; the knees turned upwards, and the cinders lying in a heap over it, the feet being four inches below; the head being near the centre of the heap, was about ten or eight' inches below—the dust completely covered the head—the whole body was completely concealed from sight—I took it out—it was still alive, and lived till about 6 o'clock the next morning but one—I found, on poet mortem examination, a clot of blood on the brain, and to that I attribute the death—that clot of blood might be from various causes—I think the death had not arisen from being put under the cinders—I had no reason to suppose so—it received injury by the exposure to cold, and from having no food, rather than from inhaling any dust—I carefully passed my finger along the throat, and there was not the least dust.</p>
