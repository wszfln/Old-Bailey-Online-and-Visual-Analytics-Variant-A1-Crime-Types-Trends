I ran to the Tenter Grounds, in Moorefields, and there he (Fellows) came to me with the Hat, which I kept all Night in my own Custody, and next Morning I pawn'd it, next Door to the two Horns, near Shoreditch Church. The Prosecutor Nix appear'd that Morning against Austin, before the Justice, and being positive to him he was committed. Three or four Days after this, I was taken up for another Robbery,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173806280003"/> and then I made my Information. We went out together with an Intent to rob who we could; for Austin and Moreland having been out together a whole Fortnight, Night and Day, they had spent and made away with all we had to live upon, so we resolved to go out upon the Highway to get what we could.

            . I am the Officer that took Moreland Fellows, and the Evidence Miller. He told me the Prosecutor went into a Shop in Bishopsgate-Street, for a Half-p'orth of Tobacco, and they seeing him pull out a Handful of Silver and Half-pence, and thinking him to be fuddled, they resolved to follow him and rob him. Accordingly they dogg'd him into Widegate Alley, where he went in at the Gingerbread Baker's to light his Pipe; from thence (he said) they follow'd him into Smock Alley, to rob him.</p>

            , Constable. A Quarter before 11 o'Clock at Night, the 23d of May, the Prosecutor brought the Prisoner Austin to my House, and charg'd him with robbing him of his Hat. I ask'd him if he could swear he was the Person that stole it? No, says he, but he was one of the Company, and he attempted to trip up my Heels, so I lay'd hold of him. I went with him before Justice Dennet the next Day, and there he swore he saw him take off his Hat, and give it to another, who ran away with it.</p>

The Prosecutor told him, he had lost his Hat; the Officer asked him if he could lay the Felony to him? No, says he, but he was one of the three, that threaten'd to trip up my Heels, and so I seiz'd him.</p>

            . I live in Three Tun-Alley, and saw the Constable, the Watch, and the Prisoner Austin together, between 11 and 12 o'Clock at Night, the 23d of May. I went down with them to the Tower Jail, and there the Prosecutor said, he was not the Man that took his Hat off; but next Morning before the Justice, he swore he did take it. He said indeed (the Night before) that he was one that belonged to the other Fellows, and before we went to Justice Dennet with him, one of their Company came down, and propos'd making the Matter up, and the Prosecutor seem'd willing to do it.</p>

They told me the Man was in Custody; and while I was talking to them, the Barrel was brought to me, and had been taken out of the River; for the Prisoner (it seems) had thrown it over Board. The Mark upon the Barrel was mine, and I believe it was my Property. I lost nothing by the Goods, but sold them for the same Money, as I should have done, had nothing of this happen'd.</p>

            . I was coming in a Boat past Smart's-Key, and saw the Prisoner there, with a Barrel in his Arms. He was coming into a Boat with it, and tumbled down, Barrel and all, into the Boat. My Waterman said, - There's a Thief. I made him shove back, and then the Prisoner heav'd something over board. Upon this we took him, and carry'd him ashore. In his Boat we found two Pieces of the Head of the Barrel, and some of the Raisins. In two or three Hours afterwards, the Barrel was taken out of the Water, and we compar'd the Pieces we found in the Bottom of the Boat, with the Breaches in the Head of the Barrel, and they fitted: Part of the Mark was upon the Pieces, which flew out when he fell with the Barrel, and part was upon the Head of the Barrel itself. We found, by comparing this Mark, with that upon Mr. Gordon's Barrels, that the Goods belonged to him, so they sent for him, and he own'd them.</p>

The Reason of my desiring to go back was, that I thought some Body might come by, as we were going up the Road, and then I would have endeavour'd to have taken them. I am sure the Prisoner is one of the Men that robb'd me, - he is a Black, and 'twas he that walk'd on my right Hand, when I went back to look for my Hat.</p>

Yes, says he, I have been a Month in the Hospital, and was discharged from thence about a Fortnight ago, and the People of the Hospital can be Witnesses for me. <rs id="t17380628-5-verdict30" type="verdictDescription">

            ) came to me, and desired I would make haste Home, and bring one of my Company with me, for a threatening Letter was sent me. When I came Home, the Prisoner stood within the Shop; I took a slight Glance on the Letter, and then I double-lock'd the Door, to secure the Prisoner. I then asked the Prisoner if he knew what he had done? He said, No. I search'd him immediately, for fear he should have Pistols, or Knives about him, - that is, - I clapp'd my Hands upon his Cloaths, - I did not put them into his Pockets. When I found he had nothing about him, I took him into a little back Room, behind the Shop, and read the Letter to him. All that I could get out of him, was, that he knew nothing of it. I told him, if he would let me know who were his Accomplices, I would be favourable to him, and he should not go to Jail; but he told me, he was so strongly sworn, that he could not say any Thing. Upon this, I sent for a Constable, and would have sent him to New-Prison; the Prisoner told me I could not send him to Prison, without first carrying him before a Magistrate. For this Reason, I desired the Constable to carry him before a Magistrate, but he did not think proper to do so, least his Comrades should be near, and do me a Mischief, so he was carry'd to Prison. The next Morning we had him to the Elephant and Castle, in order to his going before the Justice, and there he wrote this Note (producing it) to send for his Friends; some Persons now in Court, saw him write it; and upon comparing it with the Letter he brought me, the Hands agreed. I charged him immediately with having wrote the Letter himself, and had him before Mr. Justice Poulson, where he confess'd he wrote the Letter he brought me himself.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner about two Years and a half; and always observed him to have been seiz'd with a rooted melancholy Desperation. Some Time or other in the Month either of November or December 1735, he wrote a Letter to me, full of the most melancholy desperate Expressions, declaring himself to be a Person devoted to eternal Destruction, and abandon'd of God. I endeavour'd to answer all his unreasonable Objections, and I thought to some good Effect; but soon after, his old Melancholy return'd, which I imagin'd was occasioned, because he had never been baptized; being descended of Parents, who were of the People call'd Quakers. As far as I can remember, he mention'd this, as the Reason of his Melancholy. On the 29th of February, 1735-6, he was baptized, and about a Month after, he received the Holy Communion, - after he had been instructed in the Principles of the Christian Religion. In the Month of April or May following, his Melancholy recurr'd in such a Manner, that he made two Attempts upon his own Life, by endeavouring to drown himself in St. James's Park. When I came to know the Cause, I endeavoured all that lay in my Power, to give him ease; and I thought I had succeeded; but he was continually in a melancholly way after that. I forgot to observe that the two Attempts of Self-Murder, were about a Year before the unhappy Affair of Mr. Rawlinson, in the Months of April and May, after his receiving the Sacrament. That Affair was under the Cognizance of this Court about a Year and a Quarter ago; I was not then in this Country; but that was the Effect of his Melancholy, for he express'd himself, that it was better for him to be cut off by the Hand of the Civil Magistrate, than to be his own Executioner. After he was acquitted of that Affair, we thought he behav'd pretty soberly, and we were in hopes his melancholy Distemper would wear off; but it recurr'd again in the Month of September 1737, to a high Degree, as appears by this Letter, which he sent to Mrs. Corse. I did not see him write it, but as far as I can judge of any Man's Writing, I can judge of that Letter, and I have all the moral certainty in the World, that 'tis his Hand. I had it from the Person to whom it was sent by the Penny Post; and I believe, was the Letter read, the Court would see some of the oddest Expressions that ever were heard; and I have all the moral Reason to believe, it was the Effect of a rooted, desperate Melancholy. Since the Writing of this Letter, he has made use of melancholy Expressions to me, and has said, he was weary of Life and wanted to be out of this World; this was this last Spring, but I cannot ascertain the particular Time. As for the Lad's Character, I can say, that I have always known him to be sober; never guilty of any Immoralities, except those that were the Effect of his downright Melancholy. And as for his Accomplices, I have all the Reason in the World to believe he had none, for he never kept any bad Company.</p>

I have seen him often, and he behaved well, but would use these Expressions. Another Time he said he would go and drown himself in St. James's Park; but a Thought came into his Head, and he would not do it at that Time.</p>

            . I have been intimately acquainted with the Prisoner about four Months, by living in the House with him; and he behav'd always very circumspectly, when he was out of these Flights; but sometimes he would fly out, and I would advise him to throw of those Flights; he used to say he could not, and wish'd he might die, that he might no longer carry about with him this Body of Sin. Before this Accident happened, he was blooded, and lost a Porringer full of Blood, and would have been blooded again, and have lost more, but the Man would not permit it. About three Weeks or a Month ago, he told me he was going to be bad again, but desired I would not let his Friends know; and I (foolish) kept the Secret. 'Twas but the Day before this Letter was delivered,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173806280007"/> that I was singing a Verse of the 138th Psalm to him, and he wish'd I could sing him into Heaven with that Tune, for he was weary of his Life; and about a Fortnight before he attempted to hang himself.</p>

            . The Prisoner has made Shoes for me near a Twelve-month; and I have taken him out among my merry Shoe-makers to divert him; but he has not been able to bear it. He has told me he was tempted to destroy himself, once to hang himself, another Time to drown himself? then to starve or bleed himself to Death. He brought me Home a Pair of Shoes that Afternoon he did this Thing, and I knew he was going into one of his Flights. Sometimes he was capable of doing his Business, and sometimes he was not.</p>

            . I have known him two Years, and never knew any Thing by him, but what was solid and sober, except when he was in those Fits. I have heard him over and over express despairing Words, - Words of deep despair, and that he should surely perish. I have begg'd of him to mind his Duty to God, and not to concern himself so much about sacred Things. At some Times he would have some glimmering of Hope, but oftener would be in despair, and say he was sure he should be damn'd.</p>
               <p>Ivel Northam. The Prisoner has lodged with me sometimes, at his own request, I have had Conversation with him; he was always melancholy, and afraid of his Damnation. One Sunday I was talking to him, and he said, - is it not better for me to leave off all Religion, than to be such a scandal to it as I am. I gave him good Advice, and he said, he wish'd he could take it, but (says he) I am a hard hearted Creature, and shall split upon the Rock of Despair at last. The Day after he was taken, I went to him in Prison, and I said,

            , as you stand before the great God, declare on what Account you sent this Letter; was it for the Money? No. Was it to hang yourself? He answered, 'tis better to be executed by the Laws of the Land, than to murther ones self. Why, says I, what Proof have you of your being damned? Because (says he) he that believeth not, shall be damned. I then asked him where the Man liv'd, that he had carry'd the Letter to? He would not tell me. I beg'd of him for God's Sake, - for my Sake, who was his Friend to tell me; at last he only told me it was to an Ironmonger; but he desired none of his Friends would trouble themselves, but let the Law have its Course; and he should rejoice (he said) if he was then in the Cart, and was going to Tyburn; and that he had been often tempted to take off somebody's Hat, in the Streets, that he might do the Work effectually.</p>

            . I could say a great deal more; but that I think is of no Effect, - but he used to run after the Romish Priests, that are disputing about Transubstantiation, and the Infalibity of the Church. I perceived a great Disorder in the Head, and heard odd Expressions; and I would have you consider, whether the Person is not prejudic'd, and has not Interest into the Case, for this Day I asked him at Hick's Hall whether his Bill was rectify'd, and he told me, if one Bill would not do, another should, - and therefore I think he is partial. As to the Prisoner's Prosession, I can't tell what it is he has so many Notions running in his Head about the Roman Priests. Sometimes he goes to one Place, sometimes to another. I have been at St. Ann's Church with him, and other Churches beside.</p>

            . The 14th Day of this Month, between Twelve and One o'Clock at Night, I lost two black Geldings out of a common Field in Gloucestershire. The Prisoner is my Neighbour: I can't swear I found them upon him, but one of them I found in this Man's (Davis's) Possession: he was selling him in Smithfield. I seiz'd him, and carry'd Davis before my Lord-Mayor. While I was doing this, the Hostler at the Rose-Inn came to me, and asked me, if I had not lost another, I told him yes, I had lost another, with a Star in his Forehead, two white Heels behind, and a white Foot before. Upon this, I went with him to the Rose, and he brought out my other Horse to me. A little while afterwards, as he and I were coming from a Coffee-House, where we had been to see for the Prisoner, we met him in the Street: Neighbour, says I to him, 'tis an odd Thing you should take my Horses away! He had not a Word to say for himself, but was ready to sink when he saw me.</p>

             The Prisoner brought the Horse to my Stables, and ask'd me if he could be put up? I took the Horse in, the 16th of this Month, and baited him; 'twas a Cart black Gelding, with but one Eye. The Same Day I bought the Horse of the Prisoner, in my own Stables, for 4 Guineas and a half; I gave him half a Guinea earnest, and was to pay him the rest in a few Days. He told me he bought this Horse and another in Wiltshire, and I said, 'twas hardly worth his while to go so far, to buy two such Horses; I brought them up with me, says he, only to help to make up my Charges. When we had agreed for the Horse, I carry'd him to Smith-field to sell again; and there Hinton found him out, and claim'd him. I know nothing of the other Horse.</p>

The Prisoner came to my Master Davis's Stables, at the George in Hedge Lane, and asked me to put up his Horse, and give him a Quartern of Oates, a Rack full of Hay, and a Penn'orth of Beans. I went for the Corn, and when I return'd, I found my Master and the Prisoner bargaining for the Horse, - a black Gelding, blind of an Eye. I did not see the Horse in Mr. Hinton's Possession.</p>

            . The Prisoner brought a black Gelding to my Master's, - the Rose Inn, in Smithfield, the 16th of this Month, and order'd me to put him up, and bait him. After some little Time, he order'd him into the Market, to be sold; and he rid about the Market accordingly. I heard that Mr. Hinton had lost two Horses, and had found one of them again; so I went and told him, I believed I could help him to his other Horse, and he went with me to see him, and claim'd him.

            . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner; the Gown was found upon Irish Peg. When the Girl was before the Justice, she own'd that Peg gave her 6 s. and 6 d. for it, and told her, that she would buy of her whatever she should get. This Accessary is out upon Bail; for Mr. Warrener, (Justice Farmer's Clerk) said, the Thief-takers would never let him alone till she was bail'd.

            . On the 29th of May I had six Gowns stole out of my Shop, all at once; upon which I went down Rosemary-Lane, to describe them to the Shop-keepers, and there I saw the Prisoner delivering the Gown out of her Apron to another Person, in a Hugger Mugger Manner. I charg'd the Prisoner with having got my Goods; D - mn your Eyes (said she) did you see any with me? I told her yes, and went for an Officer; when I return'd, she was gone; but I found her in Harris, the Thief-taker's House, who is her Bail. She was eating with Harris's Wife, and as soon as she saw me, she d - mn'd my Eyes, and ask'd me what I could prove against her? I told her, I had seen my Goods upon her. But what (says she) can you prove upon me now? I took hold of her, and tho' she beat me and bit me, I got her into an Alehouse; and there she said, I should not have the Gown, unless I gave her the Money; at last she sent for it, but would not deliver it, till I had paid her for it. Then she went out, and returned with Harris the Constable; now d - mn you (says she) charge him with me, or I will charge him with you. Harris asked me if I had got a Warrant? I told him no; then lay down the Goods, says he. I did so, and he bid the Prisoner take them up, which she did, and fell to tearing it, and wiping the Table with it, telling me it was her own, and d - mn her Eyes, she would do what she pleas'd with it. When she was before the Justice, she cry'd and begg'd for two or three Days Liberty, that she might find out the Thief. I gave a Week, and at the End of that Time she brought the Girl to me. I look'd at the Girl, and said, I was sorry if she was guilty, for I have Children of my own. The Girl is a poor Match-Girl, and 'tis not likely she should have such a Gown to dispose of fairly, for 6 s. 6 d. The Prisoner I have seen standing in the Street with common Thieves; and she liv'd with a noted Thief, one Fosset, and sold the Goods he stole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You know you have got two Husbands in the Lane; pray do you know that I have as many Husbands as you have laid in the Indictment?</p>
               <p>Draper. Not so many Husbands, - but a hundred Fellows. You had two but the Night before.</p>

            , Constable. I took Charge of the Girl, and had her before the Justice, where she own'd she stole the Gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Girl came down the Street, with the Gown upon her Arm, and said it was to be sold. I bid her 5 s. 6 d. and 6 s. for it. At last I told her, if she would bring any Body to say it was honestly come by, I would give her 6 s. and 6 d. for it. When I offer'd it to Sale, I ask'd no more than 8 s. and 6 d. for it. The Girl told me she liv'd in East-Smithfield, and that her Mother was just gone down Rag Fair; she went after her, to bring her to me, and I follow'd her, but the People told me, I need not scruple it, for the Girl was very honest. When they claim'd it, I offer'd it them for 6 s. and 6 d. - I was not willing to lose so much Money; but I did lose it, and a Shilling beside, for the Discharge of the Warrant. The Husband of the Woman beat and abused me, and when they were inform'd I was going to Law with them, they arrested me for 4 l. 10 s. I got Bail, and the next Day they took me up upon this Affair.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Sturt. The Prisoner bought this Gown in Rosemary-Lane, and that's a Place to buy such Things in. She agreed to give the Girl 6 s. 6 d. for it, if she could tell her whose it was. The Girl said 'twas her Mother's, and that she liv'd in East Smithfield, and was just gone down Rosemary-Lane. The Prisoner offer'd it me for 8 s. She said it was worth more for the Credit and Service 'twould do. My Husband is an Instrument-maker in Rosemary Lane.</p>

            , Constable. I had the Prisoner before Mr. Justice Farmer, and she was discharged at the Request of Mrs. Draper. She said then, - We are all Dealers in a publick Way; and they do buy of Children that are sent out with Things I have seen Children of 8 or 9 Years old sell Things of considerable Value. When she was taken up a 2d Time, she said, - we are all subject to buy Things in this misfortunate Way, I have done it myself; and I should not have troubled myself about it, if Mr. Andrews had not sent me a Letter, to inform me he had Orders to sue me for an Assault; but if any one attempts to put out one of my Eyes, I will put out one of theirs.</p>
               <p>John Brown. The Gown to be sure is worth more than she gave for it; and our Dealers won't give above half Value for Things 'Tis worth more Money than I can 'praise it to; in our Business I think 'tis worth about eight Shillings. <rs id="t17380628-14-verdict73" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>- Birkenhead. I had a Warrant from Justice Wroth, to execute upon the Prisoner, and Mr. Pike (the Deceased) being <rs id="t17380628-16-viclabel81" type="occupation">Headborough</rs>

And so I got a Warrant for him, and gave it Mr. Pike, and when we went to the Prisoner's House, - there he stands, - that's the Man, - he said G - d d - n you, I will murder the first Man that comes in. The Door stood a little o'jar, and I saw him within, and said to Mr. Pike, - there's your Prisoner; I was got into the House; Mr. Pike was just behind me; and he (the Prisoner) cry'd out, G - d d - n your Bl - d I will murder you both, by G - d; then he made a Motion with his Hand, - I suppose he had the Axe in it, but I did not see it, and Mr. Pyke said, - he has done my Business. God forbid, says I, and I was so surprized, that I could not take Notice of what he had in his Hand, and the poor Man bled prodigiously. I only saw the Prisoner make a Motion, - Truth is Truth.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was any body near you, when the Thing was done?</p>
               <p>Birkenhead. I can't say, - the Mob came so fast upon us: I can't really say, - the Street-Door was open, but the Prisoner's Shop was shut, 'twas between 9 and 10 o'Clock. After Mr. Pike was hurt, we came to my House, and there the Wound was wash'd with Vinegar and Loaf-Sugar; from thence we went to the Cock, and Justice Worth was there, and Doctor Godman, and he dress'd the Man's Head.</p>
               <p>Councel. Whereabout was the Wound, and how did it appear?</p>
               <p>Brickenhead. I can't say where it was; I did not look upon it, - I don't love to look upon Wounds, but I clean'd his Wig. And I am sure the Door was open, when we went in, - as sure as that God made the World.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did the Deceased tell the Prisoner when he went in, that he had a Warrant?</p>
               <p>Brickenhead. I can't say I heard that. I heard him say something, but I can't say he told him that. I saw the Deceased several Times before he died, and he always complain'd of a Dizziness in his Head.</p>
               <p>The Warrant was read.</p>
               <p>Birkenhead. Pike was a Headborough in St. Luke's and this happen'd in that Parish.</p>

I observ'd the Stroke to fall upon his Head, and he said, he had done his Business, and flung the Blood out of his Neck with his Hands.</p>

            . I am a Surgeon and an Apothecary, and serv'd my Time in the Country with a Practitioner in both Ways. The Night the Coroner's Inquest sat upon the Body of the Deceased, I went in and call'd for half a Pint of Two-penny. Hearing the Jury had brought in their Verdict-Natural Death, I desir'd to see the Body, and upon searching the Head, I found a Wound, and a Caedes on the left Side of the Sagittal Suture. There was a Caedes, a simple Fracture, the Skull was broke; and there was the Print of the Weapon just upon the Cranium. I pointed to the Place, and said, I believ'd that Blow was the Cause of the Man's Death. The Cranium was not crack'd, 'twas not a Fissure, but the Skull was dented inwards. I improperly call'd it that Night a Fissure, but it was more properly a Caedes, and the Periostium must be broke to be sure, and this will occasion an Inflammation, and St. Anthony's Fire, if proper Care be not taken. I believe he died of the Blow. The Body was all mortify'd and black, when I saw it, and the Man had been dead 3 Days.</p>

The Wound was heal'd up before I came to him, but I think he died of the Disorder in his Head, for his Head and Face were swell'd to a very violent Degree with the St. Anthony's Fire.</p>

            , Surgeon. On the 25th of May, the Deceased came to me, and I examin'd the Wound. I remov'd the Blood, and the Hair, and found a superficial Wound, I applied a Tonsil of Lint, and put on a common Plaister. I saw no more of him till Saturday se'ennight, or fortnight after; I was then sent for by Order of Dr. Hall to bleed him. When I bled him, he had a violent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173806280012"/> St. Anthony's-Fire upon him, and after I had blooded him, I look'd at the Wound, and it was well. The next Day I was sent for to bleed him again, and found the Tumor on his Head and Face began to subside; but then he began to complain of a Difficulty in Breathing: I took my Leave of him, and the next Day he died. After his Death, I laid the Skull bare, in the Presence of Mr. Hicks of Hatton-Garden, and we found no Injury done to the Skull. As to the Gentleman's Remarks on a Caedes, I don't know what he means; a Caedes is when a Print of the Weapon is left. We never had any Symptom of a Fracture of the Cranium, nor of a Concussion upon the Brain.</p>
               <p>Councel. You never open'd the Cranium, to see if the Brain was injur'd. Cannot the Brain receive an Injury, without any outward Appearance of Hurt?</p>
               <p>Mr. Godman. Yes; but then there will be the Symptoms of that Injury, Vomiting, Drowsiness, &amp;c. I can't take upon me to say the Blow was the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>Councel. You can't say it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hicks. I inspected the Skull, when 'twas laid bare, but I saw nothing of any Fracture or Depression. The Skull was not laid open, because it is judg'd to be unnecessary where there has been no Bleeding at the Nose, or Ears, no Comus, nor any of the Symptoms of a fractur'd Skull. I never saw the Man alive, but upon Enquiry, I could not find he had had any such Symptoms. I can't say the Wound was the Occasion of his Death; it might bring on sooner the Symptoms of the St. Anthony's Fire.</p>
               <p>Mr. Snowd was of the same Opinion, and he imagined Mr. Robinson might mistake a Suture in the Cranium for the Caedes, which he said he saw. And tho' it was not impossible for a Blow on that Place to cause Death, yet in such a Case the Symptoms must have come on sooner.</p>

            . On Friday, after the Wound was given, I was sent for to the Deceased, and found him in a violent Fever, and an Inflammation was begun on the lower Part of his Face, Jaws, and Cheeks; and he had all the Symptoms of a St. Anthony's Fire. I gave him proper Remedies, but the next Day the Swelling was increas'd, to so violent a Degree, that he could not see out of his Eyes, and his Face was as big as two Mens. His Fever was decreas'd, because the Humours were flown outward. On the Wednesday he could not be persuaded to keep his Bed, but went out of one Room into another; and that might throw in again the Humour, which should have perspir'd off. So his Fever increasing again the next Day, Doctor Hall was call'd in, and he order'd Bleeding and Blistering. The Wound was cur'd before I attended him. He complain'd of a violent pricking Pain, and a shooting in his Head; and said, he had had a Blow from the Prisoner, but I did not hear him say that was the Occasion of his Death.</p>

On the 29th of May, at Night, my Shop was shut up fast; the out-side Bar was put up by another Person, and I key'd the Pins. About 2 o'Clock, as I lay a Bed, I heard a Tugging at the Shutters, and I said to my Daughter, who was a Bed with me, that some Body was getting into the House. I listen'd till the Watchman came by, and then I was satisfy'd; for as the Noise did not cease when he came along, I thought 'twas some Cats might be lock'd into the Shop. So I laid myself down again to sleep, but presently I heard a Bounce, open flew the Casement of my Chamber Window. O my dear, says I, they are coming in at the Window! Lord have Mercy upon me, says she, and so they are; and she got up and shut the Window again: Then there was a little sort of a Silence, but in a little while we heard the Noise again; then I got up, and went up Stairs to call a young Man that lay in the House, and as we were going down Stairs, a young Woman knock'd at the Door, and told us our Shop was broke open. We found the Bar broke, the inner Bolt unfasten'd, and three check'd Shirts, two white ones, and a Table cloth, were taken from the Shelves next the Window.</p>
               <p>The young Woman that knock'd at the Door told us, she saw the Man draw the Things out of the Window, and she described him to us; she said he had a green Waistcoat on; a red Jacket, and a Pair of Towsers. My Washerwoman hearing this Description, directed us to a Cellar where such Out of-the-way Fellows resorted, at all Hours of the Night, and told us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173806280013"/> there was one of them that she knew answered the Description.</p>

The Thursday after the Robbery, Mr. Richardson told me there were some House breakers conceal'd in a Cellar; so I went, and with difficulty got the Door open, and took the Prisoner and this Griggs. When they were before the Justice, Griggs desired he might be admitted an Evidence; and the Prisoner pray'd likewise that the Justice would make him the Evidence; for (said he) I can hang five for the Scamp; that is, for Robberies on the Highway; and he mentioned one or two, that he had been concerned in, in Stepney Fields, and said, that Griggs had only been out with him in Housebreaking. When the Justice had admitted Griggs's Evidence, the Prisoner told him he had not put all their Facts into his Information. The Prisoner was admitted an Evidence himself about 2 Years ago.</p>

             On the 15th of May, I heard that Mr. Goodwin was robb'd, and that the Highway-man was at the Half Moon, I went up thither, and finding his Horse to answer the Description that was given me of him, I took the Prisoner, and found 3 loaded Pistols upon him. The Horse was advertised, and Mr. Storer came and claimed it. The Prisoner all the Time he was in Custody, insisted upon it, that the Horse was his own, and that he had bought it for 2 Guineas at Fulham Bridge.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Goodwin. On the 15th of May, about 7 o'Clock in the Morning, I was attack'd by a Highway-man upon <placeName id="t17380628-18-crimeloc95">Hounslow Heath</placeName>

I believe the Prisoner is the Man; he was mounted on a Horse about 15 Hands high, that went at a great Rate, and had Leather Bags behind him. He came on the Broad-side of me, and would hardly give me Leave to put my Hands in my Pockets, but was in great Haste, and search'd me himself. I had Leisure to view the Horse's Back-side, and when my Neighbours had taken the Prisoner, I went to see the Horse, and knew him again. Upon this Sir

             committed him. The Horse and the Bags being advertised, Storer came and claimed the Horse, and one Gauntlet of Stockbridge own'd the Bags, and that his Name, (almost worn out) was upon them. I can't recollect every Particular of what the Prisoner said when he was taken at the Half-Moon, but the Substance was, - he desir'd to speak to me alone. So old, as I am, I did not think it right to be left alone with him; for tho' they had taken from him 3 loaded Pistols, and some Powder and Balls, or Slugs, yet I was doubtful whether he might not have-a Penknife; but the Constable assuring me he had no Weapons we retir'd, and the Man fell into a great Agony, and put me into one too; for there were some Circumstances in his robbing me, that made me pity him. He told me he was Heir to 5 or 600 a Year, and that he had a Brother a Clergyman at Stamford, whose Name was Sawyer, and he was sure I would let him go, if I was to see his Brother, or any of his Relations at Reading. I thought this might be his first Flight; for I remember'd, when he came a Broad Side of me, and thrust his Head and Pistol into my Chaise, he trembled, and could not hold his Pistol still. I thought at first he did this in Terrorem, and to make me dispatch, but before he had done with me, I perceiv'd his left Leg to shake, and then I concluded he was but a young Beginner, and was frighted. I thought he came out from under a Hedge, on the North Side of the Road, where the Soldiers lie in wait for a Prize, - Highway-men, I mean, - but he said No, he did not come from thence, I came by you when you was smoaking your Pipe in the Chaise; - by the same Token, I remember he broke it, and I had a good Mind to have thrown it in his Face. I had a Guinea in my Pocket wrapp'd up in Brown Paper, and he own'd to me that he took it so wrapp'd up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Reason have you to believe I am the Man?</p>
               <p>Mr. Goodwin. Several. First, my Man swears positively to the Horse that he rode to the Half-Moon on, and I believe it to be the same. Another Reason is, his Manner of dealing with me. I don't know that he swore above an Oath or two. My Man carelesly look'd over his Shoulder while he was rifling me, and he damn'd him, and told him he would shoot him, if he did not put his Head aside. I reason'd with him, and told him, - none of you Gentlemen ever offer'd to rob me before, tho' no one has travell'd Hounslow-Heath more than I have done. That's nothing says he, I am in Want, and Money I must have, and you can draw Bills for more. So he did not leave me a Farthing, (tho' I had two Turnpikes to go thro') except one 6 d. which had dropp'd between us to the Bottom of the Chaise.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173806280015"/>Prisoner. What Habit was I in?</p>
               <p>Mr. Goodwin. Yes; that is another Reason I believe you are the Man. 'Twas in the Summer Time, and he had a great Coat on, that was too big for him; while he attack'd me, he shook, and his Coat Sleeve being too long, he turn'd it up. In my Conscience I believe him to be the very Man. When I saw him at the Constable's House, at Belfount, his Coat was put upon him, and his Hat, at my Request; and he appear'd to me, when his little Hat was pull'd over his Eyes, just as he did when he robb'd me. He told me I should have my Money again, if I would let him go. I told him I could not answer doing that; and that he had a good deal of Confidence and Assurance, to rob me within a Mile of the House where he lay, and to return after the Robbery in the same Habit into the Town.</p>

               <p>* Note. We are obliged for want of Room, to refer the Reader for the Form of this Indictment, to Cross's Trial; Sessions Book, No. 5. P. 89. Erratum, in that Indictment, line the 13, for Car. read Cross.</p>
               <p>The Councel for the Prosecution observ'd to the Jury, that the Indictment charged the Prisoner with three Sorts of Offences, viz With making and forging the Note. With assisting in the making and forging it; and with uttering and publishing it, knowing it to be forg'd and counterfeit; every one of which Species of Forgery was by a late Act punishable with Death. And tho' all the three Offences were charged upon the Prisoner, yet, if he should be so unhappy as to fall under the Proof of any of them, it would be equally fatal to him. And that whoever consider'd the wild Havock, Forgery was capable of making among the Properties of Mankind, would cease wondering that the Law should so severely punish it, and rather be surprised that this Punishment was not annex'd to the Crime, by the antient Laws of the Land; for if the Breach of other Laws of Society is punish'd with Death, how much less punishment is that Crime worthy of, that tends to destroy all Commerce. It was farther observ'd, that this Species of Robbery was the very worst that a Man could be guilty of, for a Person might guard against private Robbers, by caution; against publick ones, by Strength; but against Forgery, no Vigilance could protect; no Strength could defend. And, That it was matter of Concern, to see One so young in Years, capable of being charged with a Crime of this Nature, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

Accordingly I carry'd it as I was order'd by the Prisoner, and gave it to a Gentleman in the Shop: He shew'd it to others, and they all seem'd to be in a little sort of a Study; after which they told me, I might go, but they believ'd the Note was not good. I desired them to give me the Note again, and send somebody with me to the Coffee-House, where the Gentleman that gave it me, waited for my return. They did not send any body with me, so I came alone to the Coffee-House, but the Gentleman was gone, and had left Word that he was gone to the Faculty Office, in Doctor's-Commons. I went thither, and enquired for him by the Name of Caesar (because that Name was put on the Back of the Note) but I could not find him. About 2 or 3 Hours after, my Father told me a Gentleman wanted me at the Horn and Feathers, in Carter Lane. I went thither and told the Prisoner the Note was stopp'd; then stay here (says he) 'till I put my Shoes on, and I will go back with you.

            . I never saw the Prisoner before Tuesday the 27th of June last, between 11 and 12 o'Clock in the Forenoon, he came into Child's Coffee-House, and wanting a Porter, I cal'd Holloway to him, he asked whether we knew him? I told him yes; then he call'd for Pen and Ink, and wrote something upon the Paper, which he deliver'd to the Porter, after he had asked him his Name, and the Number of his Ticket. I believe it was the same he wrote upon, which he gave the Porter, but he had several other Papers in his Case. When the Porter was gone, I knew he was to bring Money, for he was no sooner out of the House, but the Prisoner asked me what Time the Faculty-Office would be shut up? I looked at the Dial, and saw it wanted 20 or 30 Minutes to 12, and told him the Office would shut up at 12. Upon which he got up, and said, - if the Porter comes back, tell him I will be here again Presently, but he went away, and I saw no more of him. When the Porter returned, I told him the Gentleman was gone to the Faculty-Office, and about 2 o'Clock, Sir Francis's Man came down with the Note. I directed him to the Porter, and heard no more of it till Wednesday Morning, then I heard the Man was taken, and saw the Note.</p>
               <p>Holloway. I was present when the Prisoner was taken. He was found the same Evening between 10 and 11, at the Fountain Ale-house in Cheapside. Nothing passed between us till we got him to the Compter, but there I asked him how he could send me with such a Note? He said he believed the Devil was in him; and now he had nothing to do, but to make Friends to Mr. Thomas Hill, and he had Friends who would make it up at any Rate. His Mother, (he said) lived 60 Miles off in the Country. We found him out very easily; Mr. Leaver told us his Name, and where he liv'd, and when we saw him at the Fountain, he seemed in a Hurry, and said, - for God's Sake don't discover me, I will go with you</p>
               <p>Mr. Burbeck. When he was before Mr. Alderman Barber, he own'd he sent the Note; but he said he found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope your Lordship will indulge me in asking the Porter a Question or two. Was the Note folded up, or open, when I deliver'd it to you?</p>
               <p>Holloway. He opened it, and shew'd me what it was for; then he folded it up, and gave it into my Hand. 'Twas open when he bid me go to Sir

             for 120 l. and come back presently, - he would stay for me. As I went along I open'd it, and look'd at it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says, when I was taken at the Fountain, I seem'd in a Hurry; I had Opportunity to make my Escape. Ask him whether I did not come to him voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Holloway. As soon as I came into the Room, and call'd for Mr. Newington, he got up, and said here. He met me in the Room, and said, for God's Sake make no Noise on't, - or some such Words.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I own I gave the Note to the Porter, but I found it on Ludgate-Hill, after 10 o'Clock, in this Pocket Book, and I immediately put it into my Pocket, and carry'd it into St. Pauls Churchyard before I looked at it. I took all Occasions to inspect the Papers, to see if any Reward would be offered for it, and not finding it to be advertis'd, I sent it by the Porter.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did you advertise it?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No.</p>
               <p>Then a Gentleman produc'd a Letter which the Prisoner had sent him to borrow a Coat, and the Prisoner desired it might be compared with the Note, in Order to shew that the Hands were not alike; but it was observ'd, that if the Prisoner wrote the Note, he would necessarily disguise his own Hand, and endeavour to imitate Mr. Hill's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Studley, Mr. Hunt, Mr. Hilder, Mr. Gosling, Mr. Warnet, Mr. Godman, Mr. Vaughan, Mr. Leaver, and Mr. Graves, gave the Prisoner a good Character; some of them he had liv'd with, and had been entrusted by them, in particular, by Mr. Leaver with 9000 l. and that he discharg'd his Trust honestly. <rs id="t17380628-26-verdict133" type="verdictDescription">

He ask'd me where the Woman was, that I came in with? I told him I did not know the Woman that was with me; I saw you had a Guinea and some Silver in your Pocket last Night, says he; upon this I turn'd out my Pockets, - but all my Money was gone, except a few Halfpence, which were scatter'd about the Floor. The Landlord said, he knew her, but while we were talking about her, she came in, and he secur'd her. I don't swear to the Prisoner; the Landlord told me, she was the Person.</p>

            , Constable. Knowing the Prosecutor, and hearing of this unfortunate Story, - that he was at the Horse-shoe, in Russel-Court, Drury Lane, I went to the House, (the Landlord's Name is Rarisom ) and there I found the Landlord, the Prosecutor, and the Woman sitting together; this was about 9 or 10 the next Morning. They were all jangling together, and I would have had her confess'd the Money. Instead of that, she deny'd she took any Money from him. The Landlord said, that the Prosecutor shew'd him a Guinea and some Silver, when he came in, that he might not be afraid of his Reckoning. After a good many Words, she desired them to walk out, and she would speak to me; for I am an Antient Briton, and she is the same. I persuaded her to confess, and at last she pull'd out a Pair of Mittens, with 6 s. and 6 d. in them, which she confess'd was the Property of the Prosecutor, and said she had no more. Then I carry'd her before Justice Hilder; and after he had examin'd her, she was search'd by his Maid and another Woman, and while her Rags were some off and some on, 6 d. dropp'd from them, and another 6 d. was taken out of the Crown of her Head: But this Money, she said, was none of the Prosecutor's. Upon this the Justice committed her to the Gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Money I had about me, was my own; I never was in Jail before in my Life. When they took me, I was frighted, and did not know what to say, or do. If I had had more Money about me, I should have let them have had it all. <rs id="t17380628-32-verdict162" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Burwood. I had been to see a Consort on Board a Ship, and came back very much in Liquor. So being in Liquor, I met this Woman about Eleven o'Clock (last Friday 'twas a Week ago) and she carry'd me to her House, over against <placeName id="t17380628-33-crimeloc166">Gun-Dock</placeName>

About Five in the Morning I'waked, and miss'd my Bedfellow, that Party, there at the Bar, - and I found another Woman a-bed with me. My Watch and all my Money was gone, and another Party was in Bed. I am pretty sure there was but one Party a-bed with me at a Time. I am sure I had the Money with me when I came into this House; for I call'd at Mrs. Gaskin's as I came along, to change a Guinea, and she had no Change.</p>
               <p>Gaskin. Aye, my Name is Gaskin.</p>
               <p>Burwood. I came from Mrs. Gaskin's between 10 and 11 o'Clock, and Mrs. Gaskin's House is not above half a Mile from the Prisoner's, and I am sure I had my Watch and Money there.</p>
               <p>When I miss'd them in the Morning, I never spoke to the Party that I found in Bed with me; but I got up and went down Stairs, and asked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173806280019"/> Prisoner for my Watch, telling her, - I thought the Money was enough, - without taking Watch and Money too. She told me, - truly I pawn'd my Watch over-night for a Guinea. To whom? says I: Why to myself, says she, as for your Money, I have none of it. - As to what we drank before we went to bed, - there was I, and there was she at the Bar, - and the other Party; - we had a Sneaker of Bembow a-piece. The Prisoner told me, I should not have my Watch again, unless I paid her a Guinea; - but I paid her none, - I went to the Justice and took a Warrant to search for my Watch; and had her before the Justice; she told the Justice I had pawn'd the Watch for a Guinea to her, I told her I would give her the Guinea to have my Watch again; and then she said she must go Home and fetch it; but upon searching her in a publick House we found the Watch upon her. She said I deliver'd it to her as a Pledge, but I am sure I never pull'd it out of my Fob, while I was in her House. As to the Reckoning, there was 3 Shillings to pay, and as I had but three Guineas and one Shilling in my Pocket, I paid the Shilling for the first Bowl when it came in, - for 'tis the Custom of those Houses to make People pay as Liquor comes in, but as I had no more Silver, they trusted me 'till Morning.</p>

            . Mr. Burwood is a Lodger of mine, and lay out that Night. When he came Home in the Morning, he told my Servants what had happened last Night, but he did not care I should know it. So he went to Mr. Edwards, the Headborough, and made his Complaint; and they got a search Warrant, and a Warrant for the Prisoner. When she was before the Justice, she insisted upon it, that the Watch was pledg'd to her, and refuss'd to deliver it without Burwood paid her a Guinea: He agreed to that, and Justice Cross's Clerk and the Constable went with her to fetch it; but 'twas a rainy Day, and they turn'd into an Alehouse, where the Clerk felt under her Arm, and there was the Watch.</p>
               <p>Headborough. This is the Watch that was taken from her Person. When the Prisoner made his Complaint to me, I went with him to Justice Cross, and he granted us a search Warrant, and a special Warrant, and I went to serve it, at the Prisoner's House. I asked her if she had not got the Man's Watch? She told me yes, and that the Man had pawn'd it to her for a Guinea. He refuss'd to pay the Guinea, so we carry'd her before the Justice, and he committed her. She said she knew nothing of his Money, but she offered me the Watch to keep, 'till he paid the Guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Between 10 and 11 o'Clock that Night, I and another young Woman met the Prosecutor; and he asked if he should go Home with us? When we came Home, I asked him for Money: He said, he had no more than a Shilling and Two: pence Halfpenny; the Shilling he gave to me, and I fetch'd him Liquor for it. I asked him if he had any more Money (when the Liquor was drank.) He said no; but he pull'd out his Watch, and deliver'd it to me on the Bed-side. Next Morning between 4 and 5, he waked, and asked for the Watch. I told him I had it, and would give it him for a Guinea he had pledg'd it for. He made no Answer, but went out; and returned with another Man: I told them again, that there was 20 s. due upon it. Some of the Money was for Liquor, the rest I charge for his Night's Lodging. <rs id="t17380628-33-verdict167" type="verdictDescription">

I did not mind the Loss of any Thing but my Peruke, - for I was afraid of catching Cold, and getting deaf; therefore I desired to come into the Watch-house; the Watchmen opposed me, - Bl - d! says I, I will come in, with that they sent me to - the Round house; and because I would not pay the Watchmen a Shilling a-piece, they bound me over. The Watch was advertised, and I got it again; and the Constable got the Cane. As to the Prisoner I know nothing of him.</p>

He asked 3 Guineas upon it, I knew him to be a poor Fellow, and wonder'd how he came by it; therefore I asked him how he came by it? He said he bought it at Mr. Hulet's in Eagle Street; I step'd to Mr. Hulet's, and he told me the Prisoner had bought no Watch of him. The Prisoner followed me to Mr. Hulet's, and gave me ill Language, and would have had the Watch by Force from me. I told him before Mr. Hulet, if he could give any Account where he had it I would return it. Then he said he won it by Gaming at Temple-Bar, and would have it from me, and struggled with me for it, till we both fell down together; then I offered a Shilling to any one that would fetch a Constable, upon which he went away, and got clear off; but the Watch being advertised, the Prosecutor had it again. Some time afterward, the Prisoner was seen by Mr. Cross in the Street, he gave me Intelligence of him, I went up and took him, and sent for the Prosecutor.</p>

As for my Hat and Wig, he knew nothing of them. Now I can take an Oath that I had no Woman with me that Night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Margets The Prisoner was brought before me, and behav'd as impudently as ever I saw any one in my Life. He told me the Prosecutor had got a Whore, and fell down in a Sirreverence, and that after he had pick'd himself up, and the Woman was gone, he went to the Place where he fell, and treading upon his Cane, he found that and the Watch. He cursed and swore very much, and a more impudent Fellow I never saw in my Life.</p>
               <p>Defence. I was going Home that Night about 12 o'Clock, and in Newport Street, I had Occasion to ease myself, and the Gentleman came down with a Woman, and d - mn'd her for a B - ch, he wanted to ease himself, and bending down, he fell backwards. She helped him up, and I saw her pulling at something all the Time. I was almost blind then, and I am quite blind now; so when they were gone, I went over to the Place, and groping about, I trod upon the Cane, and stooping down, I found the Watch and the Cane link'd together. Next Morning I went to this Pawnbroker's to get some Money upon the Watch, and he stopp'd it.</p>
               <p>Jury. He says he was almost blind, how could he see the Prosecutor on the other Side of the Way? He says, he went over the Way, and feeling for the Cane, found the Watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not quite blind then. <rs id="t17380628-35-verdict174" type="verdictDescription">
