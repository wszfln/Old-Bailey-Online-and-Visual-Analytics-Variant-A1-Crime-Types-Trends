               <p>Q. I want you now to confine your attention to the carpetting and canvas. - I see them and examined them at the police office, Hatton-garden, on the 9th or 10th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at the police office? - I found Mr. Good, the prisoner. Some things were produced, I examined them all over, and I really believe them to be the property of Mr. Leader.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where they were taken from? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these things present? - They are.</p>

               <p>Q. How long ago do you think these things have been lost? - Some of them between two and three years ago.</p>

            As to this carpetting and this canvas, when do you apprehend that may be lost, if it was ever lost at all? - We cannot say to the time when it was lost, because we have a great deal in at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot say when this was lost at all? - I cannot notice it particularly, we have such a quantity, and such a number of hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Till this was found you did not even miss these things? - No, we have frequently missed things, but never that in particular.</p>

               <p>Q. What led you first to suspect the prisoner? - From missing sundry articles we believed the prisoner not to be honest, and going to search his premises we found some property in his house; we suspected the prisoner about three days before we searched his house.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the carpetting that you produced at Hatton-garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you it from? - I took it in of the prisoner, he pawned it with me, I knew him, I had it of him on the 20th of July 1793; this is the duplicate I wrote for the carpet at the time I took it in. When they came to enquire, they produced the fellow duplicate of that, which I gave to the prisoner; I have had the things in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was the 20th of July, last year? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards are there in that piece of carpetting? - Better than four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long he had it by him you don't know? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Lucas. This is a pattern which we use a great deal of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sort of carpetting of which you missed any? - We missed a great deal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At that particular time did you miss it? - I cannot say, having such great quantities.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that that ever was in Mr. Leader's possession? - I, don't know that positively; we cut a great deal of that pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen it in my house, you would not have suspected it to have been Mr. Leader's at all? - I don't know any thing about that. Of course you being a gentleman, I should suppose that you came by it honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark on it? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. For ought you know, it might be lost in the year 1791, if it ever was in Mr. Leader's possession? - I don't think we used that pattern so long as that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I don't know what the articles you charge this man with are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did you find some baize, canvas, leather, silk, worsted and cotton lace, some skeins of thread? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these things? - In the prisoner's house; I was present with one of the men of Hatton-garden office; it was on the 9th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now about these things. Did you miss them at all? - We missed a skin of leather, which led to a discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that you missed? - No, we did not find that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you missed nothing but that skin of leather? - We missed green baize about a week or a fortnight before we searched his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. A month perhaps? - I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Or a year? - Not so long back as five weeks, I cannot say to a day, but it is not more than a month or five weeks; I don't know particularly that we missed any other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever know that you have lost any thing but a skin of leather and some baize, and the skin of leather is not in the indictment? - It is not. We have sometimes lost so much as half a hide of black leather.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you employed to search the prisoner, and to search his house - I was. I found these things in his house; here are some candles marked with a particular mark, which Mr. Lucas identities, marked with a red string; here is thread, an hussiss, lace, and some bits of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. These you found in the prisoner's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was the prisoner at home when you searched his house? - No; his wife was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. She is an ailing woman, is not she? - She is.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a daughter, I believe? - I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. In short you found a great deal of what you would consider as mere waste and rubbish? - Mr. Lucas said it corresponded with some that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not answering my question.</p>
               <p>Court. The jury will judge what they are.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Amongst the great many things you found, some of which are of very little consequence, tell us whether you can identify them? - This lace I can, it is a crest lace of Mr. Whitmore's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you tell me when it was in your possession? - It was in our possession about two months before we found these things in the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110006"/>Q. What may be the value of it? - It is of no great use.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have made your carriage then these bits are throwed about the shop? - They are about the workmens boards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you fix any value on it? Would it sell even for a penny, at the piece broker's? - I should imagine it would; it certainly is worth a penny if it is worth any thing; it would make a pin-cushion, therefore it is worth something.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not any workmen have leave to take away such things as that? - If they asked for it, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose they did it without leave? - We should reprimand them for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you suppose they took a pin? - I don't say that. Here is another crest that was for Sir

               <p>Q. Will you look at the candles that lay there, and tell us whether these are the candles that you delivered to Mr. Leader's house? - Yes, they are the same, I know them by the cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they different to those that you fell in the course of your business? - Yes, they are particularly marked; I have some of the same in my pocket, which, I believe, will march; we sell none of that sort to any body else; there should be eleven threads in the largest ones, that is ten white and one red; and the smallest ones seven threads, six white and one red.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you positively say that these were made by you, for Mr. Leader? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you tell me how many threads other tallow-chandlers put in their candles? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that you make no other of that kind, but for Mr. Leader; but your neighbour tallow chandler may make others just of the same sort? - He might; but I believe they will match in size, length, and every thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. They are a common size for candles? - No, they are made of a particular size, and particular length.</p>
               <p>Q. Which any other person may make as well as yourself? - Yes, if they have orders for them; they are never made except for some manufactory or some brewhouse, it is done particularly as a check for a manufactory where there are great many workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know when you made these particular candles? - Yes, in March last.</p>
               <p>Jury. But should this man, or any other of Mr. Leader's, come and say to you, pray let me have some of the candles, such as my master has, would not you let him have them? - No, I would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to say they were delivered to Mr. Leader in March last? - No, they may be belivered some of them in May, and I have delivered some of them later.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const to Lucas. Do you happen to know whether there were any can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110007"/>dles lost? - We have so large a quantity that we cannot miss them; they are kept in a large box, in one of the counting houses, which this man bath access to; we deliver every, man a candle night and morning, and the pieces that are left we get up every night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Lucas. Pray who was the partner of Mr. Leader in March last? - Mr. John Coilingridge and myself.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose them? - The 9th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you had seen them before you missed them? - I do not know when I had seen them before they were lost; my wife can inform you.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in your house? She came to visit me and my wife, on Sunday the 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her? - About three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stay with you till the 9th of October? - She said she was out of place, and my wife said, Betty, you are welcome to my apartment, until you can get a place; on the Tuesday following she came, on the 30th, and continued till the Friday night, when she said she was going to her mother's; then she came again on Saturday, and staid till the 9th of last month, which was the day she committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you missed the things? - On the night following, the Friday night, as the 9th was the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how the prisoner came into your house? - She came on the 28th of September, she came on a visit, and staid to tea and sup; accordingly she told me she was out of place; I told her she might be at my place and do some needle work, and eat such as I eat, and I would pay her for her work, till she got a place. Accordingly she came on Tuesday, and continued till Friday, and slept with me in the bed. On Friday night my husband said he was very ill with a cold, and he would stay at home; she went out that night to sleep and came the next morning at seven o'clock and staid till nine, and while I was in one apartment and she was in the other, she found the means of opening my place and took away these things; one gown she had pledged.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known her? - About three or four years; I knew her to be a servant, and I knew her mother to be a very honest woman, as I always thought, and I have no doubt but what she is at this time.</p>
               <p>Court to Steward. Was there any body with her when you took her? - There was a young man that she had hold of his arm; I do not know nothing of the young man; I lost him in a moment. I produce a key, which was found on her, and which, she told me, she had opened the box with.</p>

            What did he give you or it? - Levy offered twelve shillings, and Clinch wanted fifteen shillings, and so we left him in the house, and he agreed with any wife, and took them away, some part of them; I was not present when they were sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go? - I went along with Clinch home to his mother's, and the officers took us, and so I never came back again, they took us coming out of Clinch's mother's.</p>

            We have heard that you have been in courts of justice before? - And so has every one here; Clinch hath been a convicted man, and that other hath been an evidence before.</p>

I ought to state that to you, that you find this Moses had immediate intelligence of these people being taken up, from the wife of Smith, she went to him immediately and told him; therefore it is not very unreasonable to suppose that whatever property he might have, that might serve for a conviction to himself, that he would dispose of it, as he had time to do it.</p>

            Was it the prisoner? - I believe it was. When that I had satisfied myself on looking on him I then run off to call for assistance I run out to Half Moon alley, and before I was out of the alley I saw a man, I heard him follow me, the moment I retreated I heard somebody run after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your first account was that you saw a man stand by the side of the woman; where was the other? - His face was in the cupboard, a pilsering the cupboard, I saw his clothes. When I got from the house I run into Half Moon-alley, and called for assistance, somebody came to my assistance in a short time, I run up Mr. Morris's yard, when I got assistance we searched every where and did not find any body, I then came back to search the premises again, I was at the polishing shop, and somebody says, halloo! we have got him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at that time? - I was in the polishing shop, on the same spot of ground, backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? - A looking glass manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was at the back of your premises? - Yes, at the back of the ground, the front of the house faces the work-shop, I heard a voice say, halloo! I then came down into the yard, and see somebody have hold of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that person here that had hold of him? - I cannot say whose custody he was in, there was a number of people with lights, I cannot recollect whose custody he was in, and when that I see him I said, that was the man, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it that this man was brought back? - About a quarter of an hour, I cannot say, it might be half an hour for what I know, I sent for Mr. Sapwell, I said, I had been robbed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110020"/>search that man, which he accordingly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found on him? - Yes, there was a watch and other things.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the watch? - I know what I gave for it, it may be worth two or three guineas, I gave five guineas for it, I have had it about a dozen years.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have had it so long as that, do you think it would sell for that? - I think it is worth three guineas to any one.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the chain, what is that worth? - The chain is of very little value, it is a common steel chain, worth two-pence or three-pence; the seal is worth about a penny; as to the spectacles I gave five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110021"/>shillings for them to Mr. Long, they would very likely sell for two shillings; the clasp knife one shilling is the worth of that, the three silk handkerchiefs they are worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a capital offence according to the amount of the value, therefore you must put a value on them; do you think these handkerchiefs worth no more than a shilling a piece? - No.</p>

I told him I could get one for nine pence; he said he could get one and a cutlass. Accordingly he came to me the next day, (I lived in Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row) he came to me, and we discoursed on matters, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110027"/>we agreed to go together; we went several nights on Craydon-road, and met with no success. There was a hole in my room that looked in these peoples room, and we saw some boxes in it, and we thought there was some property in them that we could make money of, (I live over their heads, and there was a crack in my room that I could see into their room) with that we agreed to break it open, and we had nothing but the chissel and the poker, which I used to stir the fire with, and we broke it open, and we broke open three boxes in the room; and we took the articles to Mr. Davis, the man that used to buy the property of us, we took them to him, in King's headcourt, Petticoat-lane; we asked four guineas and a half; he would not give that; we agreed to let him have them for forty-five shillings; that is the money he gave for them; and then we came away and divided the money between us. That is the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner.

               <p>Q. Are any of those things here? - Yes, some of them; I took some of them and pawned them; there is a cloak and muslin handkerchief, as I pawned them in the Minories for eleven shillings.</p>

            Was you alone? - Yes, I was alone. Presently the door opened, the steps were let down in a great hurry, up jumps a person in a great hurry, and put a pistol to my head, said, that if I did not deliver all that I had -</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he asked for your money. - He demanded my money with the horridest oaths and imprecitions that ever I heard; I put my hand in my pocket, and I gave him all I had in my hand; he went to the light and see it was silver, and he came back again, and said, give me more; I put my hand in my pocket and gave him some more; he said again, give gold, or I will blow your brains out directly; I gave him all I had, I told him I had no more; he said, give me your cloak; I said, take it; he said, give me your watch; I said, take it; he says, you have silver buckles in your shoes, give me your shoes; I said take them; he took the right shoe, and I gave him the left. He shut the door, he went and robbed the coachman with the same behaviour, and then he took away the shoes and buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose by this he was on foot? - Yes, he was on foot. I heard a voice say, give the gentleman his cloak, do not take his cloak; with that he comes to the door and opens it, and throws my cloak in, cursing and swearing again, and then takes my buckles out of my shoes, and throws my shoes in through the glass of the carriage, that it broke the glass all to pieces, cut my face, and broke the second window, he threw them with such vengeance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea that the prisoner was the man? - I know his voice and his appearance, but I do not know his features; I have no doubt of his being the man, but I cannot swear to his features.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light, or how? - Being the 7th of October, six weeks ago, it could not be dark about half after six; yet it was so dark, that I could not distinguish persons near; the reason of that was, it was between the shades of high trees.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he stay with you? - I cannot tell, because I was in such a state as I never was in before; I could not count the time; three or four minutes perhaps.</p>

            When you say you saw him by your bed side, you mean the impression was on your mind? - Yes, his behaviour was so dreadful; I have wounds in my face, but whether it was by the glass or with his pistol, I cannot say; such was the confusion of my mind at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watch again and the buckles? - Yes, they were found in the hands of the pawnbroker; and I have seen them, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner in custody? - They came down to me on Saturday morning, to let me know that they had taken him on Friday night, after he had robbed me on Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in custody, what was your belief then? - The same as it is now; I knew him the moment I see him, but his features I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man you did not see at all? - I did not see him. They told me at the office where I was, that such was the character of those that robbed me, that it was well I made no resistance, if I had I should have been dispatched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the gentleman whether I was the person that opened the chariot door? I never robbed a man on the road in all my life.</p>

            Tomliuson was by when you received them? - Tomlinson came to my house, and told me of them, and I went with him to a room in Spitalfields, and Stacy and Tomlinson sold me them buckles and watch, when I had them I went home with them, and I took the chases and tongues out of the buckles the same as they are now, before I sold them at Davidson's shop, in Houndsditch, and the watch I put in pawn for fifteen shillings, at a pawnbroker's shop in Whiterow, because I could pawn it for more than I could fell it for; On the 17th of October I went along with the officer to fetch it out and I delivered it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Court to Coombes. Where did you go to get the watch? - At a pawnbroker's, the name of the street I do not know.</p>

               <p>Court. I hope bad as you have been, that you are now going to speak the truth; if you take away that man's life you know how much you increase your guilt. Tell us the truth? - As I told you before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110030"/>when we committed the robbery, that I told you just before, we were obliged to move, we went to live in Spitalfields, and we went out on the road many nights, but this night we went to Edmonton-road, and in Edmonton we saw a carriage, and we thought it was not a fit place to rob it, we jumped up behind the carriage, till we come in a fit place, I had a cutlass in my pocket and Tomlinson a horse pistol, then it was agreed that I should jump down, and stop the horses, while he robbed the passengers, whoever was in.</p>

            Whereabouts was it? - It was between Edmonton and Enfield, about a mile on the other side of Edmonton. Then, as we agreed, I jumped from behind the carriage and catched hold of the horses head on the right hand side, and John Somlinson, as soon as it was stopped, went to the door and demanded the gentleman's money; and he robbed him of his watch, and a pair of shoe buckles, and seven shillings in money, as he told me, then he forcibly pulled the gentleman's cloak from his back, and it fell down on the ground, and as soon as Tomlinson had shut the door, I thought he wanted nothing else; I told the coachman to drive on, and he called to me, d-mn your eyes, I will rob the coachman; I said, I would not rob the coachman; he says d-mn your eyes, you are no man to go and leave me, I told him I did not want to leave him; so we went to the coachman and demanded his money; the coachman threw out a crown into my hat, whether he threw any thing into Tomlinson's I cannot tell, I was then going to make my escape across the fields, as we were going by, we see the gentleman's shoe lay on the ground, he took it up and threw it through the glass of the coach. We got home to Spitalfields about one, o'clock that night; in the morning, Tomlinson, or one Greaves, that was in the room, went to Mr. Davis's, and he came, I was in bed at the time, and I produced him the property from the bed, and I asked him thirty shillings for them; and he agreed to give me twenty shillings, and Tomlinson had half the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the gentleman's cloak? - Tomlinson took it off the gentleman, and it fell down on the ground, and he afterwards threw it in the carriage, before we left the place.</p>
               <p>Q. The buckles and the watch are the same that you gave to Davis? - I can swear to the property if I see it again, I know the watch by the upper rim, the tortoiseshell is all knocked off, or wore off.(The buckles and watch shewn) This is the very same watch, and these are the buckles, but the tongues and chases is knocked out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man's character is so bad that he would swear any thing to save himself, he received four hundred lashes at Chatham, and deserted two nights afterwards, he is a deserted, in every regiment within fifty miles of the country. I am innocent of every thing that is laid against me; I never robbed a man on the road, never broke a house open, in all my life; if his shirt was stripped up, the marks would be seen on his back.</p>
               <p>Stacy. You seem very willing to convince any person that what I say is false.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you ever tried here, in the Old-bailey? - I was once, it was on suspicion of robbing my lodgings, but I was innocent of it, and cleared.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner was you robbed? - On Sunday evening, the 28th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, me and my wife went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any body with you? - No, only me and my wife; we returned home a little after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the windows? - They were all shut up, and the doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark when you returned home? - It was quite dark; I found the doors just the same as I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any violence after you came home? - After we had been home, we thought we heard some body in the shop; we were sitting in the parlour, by the fire; the shop and parlour is all on one floor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in you shut the door after you; you saw the house was shut up? - Yes; there was a light in the room but not in the shop; and when I heard a noise in the shop, I saw the prisoner at the bar in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see him in the shop? - Through the sash of the door; when I saw him I got up from the chair and pursued him; I suppose he heard me get up from the chair; I went to the shop door and see a man with his back towards the house, in the street, against the wall; then I went to him, and I said, my lad, what business had you in the shop? he said, he had not been in my shop, he did not know where my shop was; so I went and put my hand into his coat pocket, and forbid him to move from where he was standing; he then made a jump and dropped the cocoa, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cocoa drop? - Yes, I see it drop; with that I picked up one of the parcels and pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see both of them drop? - Yes, I saw both of them drop; so I pursued him, and took him about a hundred yards from my shop, when I took him I charged an officer with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you kept the cocoa from that time to this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your cocoa? - I believe it to be mine; I had only two parcels in the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. How were these two parcels in the shop window, were they papered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same sort of paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any writing on the paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the writing? Was there any writing of your's? - No, but I know the night before I left it there, and put it up myself in the window, and this is the same writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment how he got in? - No, I cannot form any idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your door? - I latched the door after me.</p>

            Was your house ever broke open? - Yes, on Monday morning, the 26th of July last, about three o'clock, I heard the glass break of the window in a back room, that I made for the convenience of my business.</p>

            Was this the room that you left the curtain in? - Yes, it was. I heard them break the glass, and I thought it might be the cat, my wife stared and wished me to get up; I got up, and then I saw a woman at the window, and she said, d-mn you, who are you? and she said, she was not afraid of any bloody b-gg-r, to the best of my recollection. In consequence of that the prisoner went from the window, and I ran after her, and I followed her, and she got about three doors from my house, then I caught her, and called the watch; the watch came; I went in doors and dressed myself, and then went to the watch, and gave charge of her.</p>

            Had she any thing on her? - I did not suppose she could have any thing on her, and when I had given charge of her I came home; my wife said she had took the curtain, the shed curtain, which was a curtain to keep any person from looking in; I went back to the watch-house, and the prisoner had it on her, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she it in her pocket? - No, she had it in her lap; she was down in a hole, in confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so dark as not for her to know what she was about? - I cannot take on me to say, I was very much confused.</p>

            What day was it? - On Wednesday, the 15th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it was missing from the warehouse? - I missed it about ten minutes I suppose after it was taken; we are in the habit of exposing the cheese at the door; this cheese was there exposed on the side of the door, in sight of the people that pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you charge the prisoner with having this cheese? - I do not charge the prisoner; I know no more than that; the cheese stood on the pile, on Wednesday morning, and I missed it on the evening; it was there the whole of the day till dusk; I was entertained in the evening by two or three customers, and afterwards I turned my eyes and missed this cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the cheese in the prisoner's possession? - I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get the cheese back again? - I saw it at a public house facing the office, at Queen's square, the sign I do not very well recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What King-street, Westminster, near the Abby? - Not a great way from the office, perhaps two or three hundred yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing happening at your mother's house, the 27th of October? - Yes, About a quarter past seven, I was up at work in a two pair of stairs room, next door to where my mother lives; but at that time my candle being just gone out, I accidently opened my front window, and by the reflection of the light which was in the lower apartment, I observed two men standing almost opposite, and I evidently heard one say to the other, now! now is the time! I see them both directly run across to my mother's door; and, as I thought they were going to do something that was wrong, I immediately ran down stairs, to go to my mother's door; and when I came to my mother's door the street door was open, and the outside door of the apartment was shut, which outside door of the apartment I am certain I double locked when my mother went out, which was about five o'clock the same evening. I put my hand to the handle of the ketch of the door, and it opened immediately; I went into the apartment and saw the prisoner in the front room, as if he was coming from the back room; I then immediately caught hold of him; on which a scuffle ensued, which brought us into the passage; he then called out, as if to his companions, murder him! murder him! murder him! I directly called out, and some neighbours came, and by their assistance he was secured till the officers, who were sent for, came and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the other man? - I see no other but the man that I saw before that gave are the suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other man when you went to your mother's? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. When your mother went out at five o'clock, did you fasten the outer door? - I am not certain, I think not, because there were lodgers in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the room where you found the prisoner? - In the front room there was a very good fire, because my coat, in which I had been out with in the morning when it was wet, was hanging there to dry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say that the prisoner at the bar was searched, and no arms found on him, nor any picklock keys? - There was a picklock key that was found broke in the lock, which the officer has got.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your mother live in this house? - She does, she occupies the whole of it, and lets out the upper part.</p>

After we took the prisoner into custody, and he was committed, I went to the house, and in the lock of the door I found this piece of a blank picklock; I was obliged to take the lock off to get it out. After that we went backwards into the yard, and saw the print of the feet of two men that had made their escape out backwards, as we were informed. Here is a knife and key, and brush, and this instrument, that I found on the prisoner, whether it is for shooting peas, or what, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So the prisoner was searched I understand? - Yes.</p>

I said, it is me; I thought she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110045"/>know me, then I asked her if she would give me that again that she took away from me? and she says, you shall not have it; I said, will you open the door? she said, yes, I will open the door; and when the door was opened the watchman went in and took hold of her.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. You was called into this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the house? - In Hermitage-yard, close by the Hermitage, the prosecutor came to me about ten minutes past one, and says, watchman, I have been robbed of gold and silver, and a handkerchief; I asked him where? he pointed to the place (here) I went along with him to the house, he knocked at the door some time; she refused to let him in, at last she opened the door, and I went in, and he gave me charge of her, for robbing him of gold and silver, and a handkerchief, and she threw the handkerchief at him, but he did not take it; so I took it, and took her and the handkerchief to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it? - A house of bad same, for girls of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her? - No, it was too late to search her.</p>
               <p>Q. You a watchman, and took this woman on this charge, and not search her? - No, we do not like to search them, the officer of the night searches them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was she searched at the watch-house? - No, the officer of the night locked her up immediately as the prosecutor gave the charge.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearson. Is that your handkerchief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hedge. She told me that she took the handkerchief of this man for to hem and to mark.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray was the handkerchief hemed? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had it in your possession ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober or in liquor? - He was not in liquor, he was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk? - No, he was not drunk, he was sober; but in these houses if a man sends for five shillings worth of liquor, there is not above one shilling's worth comes in, that is generally the rule.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman was an old acquaintance of mine, before he went to sea last; and when he came home from sea this time, it was about twelve o'clock in the day, and I was going to dine, I asked him to dine with me, and he did; I asked him to pay me the fourteen shillings and six-pence that he owed me; he said he would when he got money; after dinner he went on board the ship, and came on shore about tea time, and said that he had borrowed a guinea of the captain, and he paid me the fourteen shillings and six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110046"/>pence, and gave me the remainder of the change, and said, when he was paid the next day, he would make me a better compliment; with that he went and came again in the evening, and he brought two or three shipmates with him, and they sat smoaking their pipes; and then he asked me if he could lay there? I told him there was no room; one of the shipmates was in a bed along with me, and another with my servant; and he asked me for six-pence, to take him on board the ship; and then he went out and brought the watchman, and he said to the watchman, say any thing against her, for I have owed her a spite this five or six months. My friends are gone down into the country, and I did not expect my trial would be this month; the prosecutor sent up to the prison a good many times, and said, if I would find him a guinea and half, a and five shillings, he would not find a bill against me; I told him I had not got so much money, and my clothes would not fetch it; as I had begun the law, I would go through with it.</p>

            At what time did you say this happened? - A little before eight o'clock, between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light? - It was star light, but they took me between the hedges, rather in the narrowest part of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How does it happen that you speak so certainly as to Porter and Grover? had you ever seen them before? - Yes, I knew Porter before; when I knew him he lodged at the Wool Pack; I think that is eleven or twelve months ago, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you? - Yes, he knew me, and the other likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know Grover knew you? - They told the justice so when they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Grover before? - I had seen him, but did not know who he was; I had seen him about as a working man, many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to be able to distinguish the men? - Porter I could distinguish, but the other I could not, because he was in dark coloured clothes; but just as I went to pass them, I looked very hard at Porter, before he struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to Porter? - Yes, I see his face when he struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say as to Grover? - He kept all the time behind me, on my left hand side, I never could see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to Grover, as well as Porter? - No, I cannot swear to Grover.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Porter. This happened when you was between some hedges you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not so good a light there this time of the night, as if he had been in a clear open field? you was shaded by the hedges? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whereabouts did you say this was? - I was coming from Palmer's-green to Southgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give information? - I went to serjeant Runnington's the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention Porter's name then? - Yes, I mentioned his name; I knew his face, and told them who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time say any thing of Grover? - No, I did not say any thing about Grover.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell them it would be better for them to give an account of this business? - I said nothing to them in regard to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told them it would be better for them, that they should tell all about it? - Yes, I did; I told Porter that there were two persons concerned in the robbery, and there must be one more besides himself, and I told him he had better tell of the other party.</p>
               <p>Court. That was with respect to Porter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Grover, to induce him to tell? - No, he told voluntarily before the justice of peace, without any questions.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you not then no conversation with Grover about his confessing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you know the subject of your exhortation to Porter, was, that there were two? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had already confessed; are you sure that when you had a second in your mind, and went to take him, that you did not say to him, you had better confess? - NO, I am sure I did not, to the best of my knowledge; he came to the justice, and I don't think the justice asked him the second syllable, before he up and told the way and manner how they proceeded in taking the watch and money from Mr. Crowder.(The examination.)</p>

After I had missed my first property, on looking over my drawers I found a sheet, which I thought was not my property at all, because it was so much worn, I called on a neighbour Mrs. Meredith, who keeps a linen draper's shop, and desired her to compare this with my linen; afterwards I went up to the two pair of stairs room to put by some linen, and while I went there I heard the street door open, on hearing the street door open I came down to see who was in the house; when I came down I saw my neighbour, Mrs. Meredith, in the parlour; she came to tell me that somebody was come to the house; I then looked down the stairs, and saw one of the prisoners,

               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - Near a year and three quarters. This was Alice Buller; on the sight of me she returned down the stairs again, and I called to her, and asked her what she wanted there? She told me that she wanted to speak to her sister; I answered her and said, that her sister had left my service two days before, and she had told her; I told her that she had got a place; she said she had got no place yet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had her sister left your place? - But two days. I asked her where she was? She said, she should see her that evening; I told her to tell her I wanted to speak to her; she said she would tell her. She went away; and when she was gone, I went down in my kitchen, as I usually sit there, having no servant; in about half an hour I was preparing myself to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might this be? - It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. On my preparing to go out, I had hung a watch on a little brass hook on the chimney mantle piece, in the kitchen; I look ed and saw my watch was gone; a little while after that, it might be about ten or fifteen minutes, I went to put on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110051"/>my shoes (I had had nobody in the house the whole day, only a gentleman that lodges with me, and he was out the whole day) I went to look for my buckles, and they were gone; looking round I missed a couple of spoons; I communicated this to a friend, who advised me to apply to a magistrate. There was nothing found on them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after were they apprehended after you had missed the things? - They were apprehended, I believe a very little while afterwards; that day was the 19th that I missed these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they apprehended that day? - No, not that day, a few days after that.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner there? - About one hour on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your things? - I missed them that night; she came at five, and I missed them about eight; she went out at seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been alone in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she be alone? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts was the room in the house? - Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss? - One bed quilt; three sheets, two pillow cases, and two wine glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover them? - No, never found them since.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never came back? - No, she never came.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen her since? - I saw her when she was taken, I am very certain it is the same woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the wife of William Gale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never see any one of the people before they swore to me at the office.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have a sister that is a twin, that was born half an hour after me; and our parents did not know one from the other, we are so much alike.</p>

               <p>Mr. Kirby. The sister was stopped at Newgate; we had intelligence of her offence; and we were afraid of letting them see each other almost, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110055"/>fear we should not know them again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took them? - I have every reason to believe that the prisoner at the bar took them, because I had no other person in the house besides my own family.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - Four children and my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge with you? - She had not slept in the house, but she took a lodging at the house the day before.</p>

            Is there a strong likeness between them in the countenance? - Yes, there is, but not in the voice-besides this one offered to take me to the place where the things was, if I would let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Is her sister about her size? - Much about in height, but a good deal lustier, and fatter in the face. I have very great reason to think that she knows of my things; it was she and not her sister that came to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Kirby. You have seen the sister, does she correspond in height and size to this woman?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. if any thing, my opinion is that this is the lustier of the two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby's man. Of the two the sister is lustier than this.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Mecklenburgh public house, in James's street, Manchester-square. On the 12th of October, I was sitting at the window, and the boy called to me, master! master! he had stopped the woman, and I went out and asked the boy what was the matter? and the woman begged I would search her, and I stroked her down, and found a pot at the bottom of her petticoat tail, it hung quite at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that pot your's? - Yes, I marked it, I wrote my name on it at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. There was none found on the child? - I did not meddle with the child, I should think by the looks of the poor thing that she could not have any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have every reason to believe that the child had not the pot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110057"/>Q. Is she in the habit of having beer at your house? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Court to Elizabeth Miller. Where did you see the mother standing? - About forty yards from the public house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Plant. When you found this pewter pot at the bottom of her petticoat did you look to the petticoat and see how it got there? - I cannot say, I turned the the petticoat up and got it out of some hole. How it went in, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Newbank. Is this Mr. Richards hand writing? (shews the note) - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you been in the habit of transmitting bills or money to Messrs. Smith and Oldfield to the care of Mr. Whitely? - Yes, some years back.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned in this country on the 23d of July? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Whitely was taken up had you any conversation on the subject? - He has called on me at my lodgings before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you arrived? - I had a letter from him dated the 27th of July, four days after I arrived, I am not certain as to the period, this letter is dated the 27th.</p>
               <p>Q. After you received the letter how soon did you see Mr. Whitely? - He called on me in a very few days, perhaps two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation on the subject of this bill of exchange? - I gave him home the account current addressed to Smith and Oldfield.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You say you gave Mr. Whitely the account current? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have for some years received propery for the estate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have been directed by the assignees to transmit the different accounts? - The direction was to direct the letters for Messrs. Smith and Oldfield to the care of Mr. Whitely, Jamaica Coffee-house, London.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you to give the account current to Mr. Whitely? - I thought I was doing right, I had not heard that he had made a failure, and I thought I was doing very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Newbank, had you any concerns with Mr. Whitely for his own affairs? - I carried a power of attorney, since he was a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q. That property belonged to a lady, who was a bankrupt in this country? - It might, but I knew nothing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Richards give you any money in Jamaica? - He gave me a bill for five hundred and sixty-nine pounds, and says, I assure you this matter would have been settled long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Whitely has any claim on Richards in any other manner, as an estate of his own? - Mr. Whitely said so; but as he has been a bankrupt, I don't know how that is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I would ask you one question, were you ever desired by Richards to transmit any thing to Whitely? - Never; he told me he wished he was clear of the business.</p>

               <p>Q. Respecting the bill in the present indictment, when did you first learn that any such bill had arrived? - I called on Mr. Newbank as soon as he came to England; in the mean time Mr. Whitely called, and he had the account current.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - On the 6th of August, I saw Mr. Newbank, Mr. Newbank had given him the original account current, and he had a copy of it, which he shewed to me, and I saw there were two bills missing, of which I knew nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is one the bill which was produced? - Yes; it is a bill of five hundred pounds, drawn on Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Mr. Whitely called? - Before I saw Mr. Newbank, and he took away the account current; afterwards I saw Mr. Newbank.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days? - But a few days. When I saw Mr. Newbank, he shewed me the account current, which he had given to Mr. Whitely, and he said there were two bills sent to us that were missing, one was a five hundred pounds; I knew nothing of that bill till I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had you before at all learned that any such bill had been sent? - No knowledge of it at all, that it never was sent. I met Mr. Whitely in Change-alley, I told him I had just parted with Mr. Newbank; he was very much surprised at it; I asked him if he had seen them two bills, the five hundred pounds one, and the other, and why he had not given them to us?</p>
               <p>Q. You say this was on the 6th of August, what did he say to that? - He told me that he had given the bill or bills to Mr. Oldfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned both these bills to him? - Yes, both; I told him that Mr. Newbank said he had the account current; he said he would give it to me, he was coming the next day opposite to me, and he would bring them at the same time, if he had them at home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110060"/>he would bring them the next day about twelve o'clock; he said he would bring the bills, if he had got them at home, to me, the same time as he brought the account current.</p>

            What did you do with the key? - Curiosity enduced me to unlock his box, and I saw a smelling bottle of Mr. Bailey's and Mr. Lowe's, and tooth brushes; on seeing them there, I sent my fellow servant to the shop to my master.</p>

            Did the prisoner work with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the day did you see them last? - I left them when it was too dark to see to work, in the evening, about eight o'clock; I came the next morning, and the door was bursted open, and the things stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again? - Yes, I have got them from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them? - I found them in James-street; the jacket was stopped at a pawnbroker's; the other tools I was directed by a butcher, in a house where he lived; I went there, and my master with me, to one Mrs. Nelson's, and I found my basket and tools.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - I have seen him I believe, but never knew him, he worked near the building where I did, he was a life guardsman.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did he work? - He is a carpenter by trade, and had worked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110066"/>there sometime, as I was told afterwards, I do not pass that side of the way that he worked.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no certainty that fixes it on him? - No, he was stopped in pledging the jacket.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where did you leave these things? - In the building, where I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked? - It was, the door was bursted open some how or other, but the lock was not shut back.</p>
               <p>JAMES MULCSTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I have got a jacket. On the morning after the robbery, some persons belonging to the things, came and made me acquainted with it; about half an hour after, the prisoner at the bar came with the jacket, and I stopped it; this is the jacket. (The jacket shewn.) He said he bought it of a labouring man that morning; I know the prisoner, and I know that he belongs to the life guards, and so I did not stop him, but made him give the proper directions where he lived.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Look at this jacket, and see whether you know that jacket to be your's? - Yes, I know it by the buttons, because I wore the buttons six or seven years ago on a waistcoat, before they were put on this jacket; they laid by a year or two before they were put on this jacket; besides it is a very particular cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no mark on it I see? - No, but the cloth was made in Wales, it was not made by cloth manufacturers, but was made by people for their own use, and they breed the sheep that the wool come off their backs.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any brushes at any time lately? - In consequence of information that the prisoner had robbed me from time to time, I applied to justice Addington, and desired to search his lodgings, October 3d; and I found that box with the greatest part of the articles specified in the indictment, which box belonged to the prisoner; he was not present at the time; the prisoner had been an apprentice of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know it was his box? - One of the evidences is an apprentice of mine, who was present at the opening of the box, and said that it was the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the time? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You found these things in a box? - All except one or two trivial matters.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110071"/>Q. Do you know the room? - Yes, it was in his room where he lodged; I always understood he lodged there; I believe the evidence in court will convince you of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the brushes? - The brushes appear to me to be of my manufactory; but there was one or two more things that seem more particularly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This man had lived in your service, I believe? - Yes, he was an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. His time is not quite out now? - There wants a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away, did he take his boxes away or no? - Really I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that he came again, about four days afterwards, for his boxes? - I believe he did; I believe I heard so much.</p>
               <p>Q. The evidence you talked of just now, what is his name? -

               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you had been? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you had taken away? - Yes, I told him there was a quantity of things which his master had claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about its being, or not being his room? - No, nothing at all, he did not deny it was his room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You do not mean to say it was his room? - He acknowledged it was his room.</p>

On Saturday, the 26th of September, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in my shop; I asked him what he wanted? the answer was, he wanted a pennyworth of honey; I went about the shop to serve him, and in going round, I observed the till had been opened; and he made an excuse, I must give him something to put the honey in; I told him I should do no such thing; he said, I can go out and borrow a cup of a boy in the street; he immediately went out of the shop, and as he was going out, I looked in my till, and missed some silver; I went after him, about a hundred yards, to the corner of a gate way; he then made a full stop, to see if I was after him, he saw me a following of him, he then run up the gate way.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a thoroughfare? - Yes. About the middle of the yard I over took him; he threw down the silver, and run out and another person ran after him, and took him.</p>

               <p>I am an officer at Whitechapel. On Monday, the 20th of October last, I was walking up Winfield-street, in the parish of Spitalfields; I saw the prisoner at the bar, about two or three yards from me, coming down as I was going up, I met him, it was about two o'clock in the day, when I met the prisoner he was walking pretty sharp, about two or three yards before he came to me he made a sudden stop, and leaned on a post at the corner of a street, I did not seem to take any notice of him till he got exactly opposite of me, he had got a smock frock on, and under his left arm I thought I saw some little bulk, I then laid hold of him and asked him what he had here? then I put my hand under the smock frock and pulled out the two shifts, he said he had them from a sister at Bow; I told him his sister would not give him them, and that he must go along with me; I took him to the Cross Keys public house to search him, because I could not search him in the street, because the mob began to get around, in searching of him I took off his hat, and in the crown of his hat I found the shirts, I then took him to the office and we enquired all round Stepney and Bow, and enquired if any body had lost any thing, and we found it by advertising once; I have kept them till now.(The linen produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, They are my property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have no doubt but it is my shirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I help to make ropes in the rope ground, I went to one ground, and when I had done I was going to another ground, and as I was coming along I see this property laying by the side of a ditch, and so I picked up the property, and this man met me and took hold of me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take one or both to that justice? - The constable would have both, finding the property in the elder one's premises; the sauce pan was on the fire; she denied it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that was your sauce pan; I think I did, and one of them said it was not mine? - I saw some tea cups and saucers on the shelf, which I said were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110079"/>mine also; they said they were not; I cannot say which said it, the witness may:</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mrs. Silk, I understand that the youngest prisoner had been your servant, she left your service on the Tuesday; then until the Sunday after you heard nothing about the property, nor never missed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps during the course of that time, you had never seen your property, from the Tuesday unto the Sunday; therefore whether any body had taken it to the house, and brought it to the prisoner, from Tuesday to the Sunday you don't know? - I have nobody in the house to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, if she left your service on Tuesday, and you never found the things till Sunday, any body might have taken them? you found them on Sunday? - I missed them on Sunday, but I found my gown and coat on her back, the 24th of October, a week and four days; she owned at the justice's what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And so whatever she did say, was said at the time she was under the examination at the justice's? - It was; she said nothing more than that she pledged a curtain at Mr. Wright's, at the Hamborough, the fellow of this is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to take on yourself to say that it was not taken down in writing? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. However it was a week and four days after this property was found? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The mother was at home? - I did not know that this was her mother, the eldest was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which house was it? - I do not know whose house it was, it was full of lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this house? - Orchard-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand it to be a house full of lodgers? - When I came down they said so it was; the gown was on her back, and some new muslin was cut up in caps; I missed the muslin the week she was with me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the police office, Queen-square, Westminster; I produce the articles that are in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get them from? - No. 17, Orchard-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. From whose room? - I do not know who rented it, but these two women were in the room at the same time; I have kept the things from that time to this; Mrs. Silk said, that if the young woman would give up her property, she would go no further in it; Mrs. Silk said, she had lost a great many articles, and that the young woman had lived with her one week; I supposed she had robbed her of these articles? - the young woman came immediately with Mrs. Silk, and we went about and looked for these articles, and she gave them up to Mrs. Silk.</p>
               <p>Q. When these things were in the room, were they open about the room? - Yes, a great number of them, there is a part of the sheet that was in a deal box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the old woman say any thing, the elder of the two? - The elder one said that she had just come into town, she knew nothing of these things being brought there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said unto whom they belonged, by either of these women? - Mrs. Silk said it was her property; they did not say it was not her's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these women say whether it was the lady's or not? - They did not say they were her's, but they went and delivered them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say they were not her's? - To the best of my recollection they did not say so.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110080"/>Q. You have kept the things till now? - Yes. I took them at the office, and they were committed for trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told the jury very properly just now, you did not know from them, who the room belonged to; but you found them there; all these things that you found there, were laying open in the room? - All but the curtains and the sheets, and they were found in a little deal box.</p>

            Then they were laying open in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the, house was full of lodgers? - Yes, after I came, I understood so by the lodgers in the next room to them.</p>
               <p>Q. The old woman said that she had just come to town, and knew nothing at all about it? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Silk said if they would give an account how they came by the property, she would go no further; these things were all laying about the room, and the girl herself delivered them up; and this might not be the room belonging to the prisoner? - I heard it was her room afterwards, but I do not know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went along with this lady, Mrs. Silk, to this room, and we knocked at the door, and Mrs. Silk said how that was her gown that she had got on; she looked about the room, and saw a sauce pan; she said it was her's; the young woman made answer, and said, it was not her's; on the mantle piece there was a china cup and saucer, and and earthen ware on; and Mrs. Silk said that was her's, and Mrs. Silk asked for the rest of her things, and the young woman brought her a box, and gave what things she had; and there was a sheet in it, and part of a curtain, and her mistress had asked her for that, and she had said she had not got it; the things were in this box, she looked about the room, and saw a bundle tied up with some rough dried things; and there was an apron and handkerchief in it, which did belong to her mistress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Well, my little girl, so these things were all found laying loose about the room? - There was only the gown out of the box, the rest was in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had said so, it must be a falsity? - There was nothing but the gown out, and that she had on her back; except the sauce pan, and the cup and saucer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did your mistress make any enquiry about her things, or make any offer about them? - My mistress said, if she delivered all the things up, she would make it up with her; and the young woman denied it at first, and said, that she had none of her things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that any of these things that are now produced? - No, none of them things that we found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The old woman never said any thing about it? - I did not hear her say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Silk. The gown and coat is mine, this sheet was whole when she took it; she owned she cut it, but she could not find the pieces; in this gown and coat there have been some moth holes, that have been darned in it; they are things that I wore some time ago, when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110081"/>was in mourning; here is a stain of red wine in the middle of the apron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I have no doubt but what it is your property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simpson, the younger. I went to this lady's in October, and she had me there a little while, and she said she would look me up a few old things, to make me tidy, and she gave me the gown, and I wore it with her a good while; I agreed for a sortnight's warning, and the place was so bad I could not stay in it, she would not allow me fire in the kitchen, nor victuals to eat; I told her I should leave her, and she said I should pay her a fortnight's wages; on Tuesday night I brought away my boxes, and she told me she would make me pay a fortnight's wages, and I put my hand in my pocket, and she said she would not take the fortnight, but she would keep the wages; she said she would make me repent of it, before the winter was out. The cups and saucers, and saucepan, were my aunt's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simpson, the elder. When the lady came to the room, she came to ask for the black gown, that she had given to her, to lend to a person that was going to a burying; the child said, they were the things about the room; she asked her for other things; I can bring witnesses to prove that the saucepan was my own, and the cup and the saucer.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether Mrs. Silk had sworn the saucepan? - Yes, I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. What did you miss? - A bolster and the other things mentioned in the indictment? - One large blanket, two sheets, one marked with my name on it, and the other not marked; the things are in court; I found her coming down from the room with the bolster in her apron, and I went in the room, and found the duplicates of the other things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My husband being ill, and through his illness I was obliged to pledge this property, when he was well he went to sea in order to reimburse the property, I don't know that it was any harm, so as it was reimbursed in the place again. Mr. Mordaunt keeps a house of ill same, and bawdy houses. Nothing but necessity urged me to pledge them, with just intention of putting the property in the place again; I submit to the candour of you, and the jury. There were people here for my character yesterday, and they have not come this morning; my husband returned last Monday and paid exactly one guinea and three-pence we owed for rent.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him with Carter, another watchman? - Yes, Carter was there; then we took him to the watch-house and left him there, and went back to the chapel to see what possibly was done, we found the door was broke open, the lock was broke so that we could make no use of it that night; accordingly when we went, one man picked up some bits of plate, then we searched all round the galleries, and below stairs to see if there was any body there, and there was nobody, then we went in this room, and we found this first door which leads to the sexton's room broke open; then we came into the sexton's office, and there were all the vails, as they are called, laying distributed about, and some pieces of plate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have told the gentlemen of the jury every thing that you said before the magistrate? - As nearly as I can recollect; I would not say a word neither backwards, nor forwards if I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked at the magistrate's whether the prisoner was one of the three? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you say before the magistrate no? - I have witness that you said so. Upon your oath, I will have an answer to my question? - At the juctice's, sir! no, every man answered, yes; I said myself, Yes; upon my oath I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked by the justice likewise, whether you saw him come out of the chapel? - Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>Q. How many yards do you think the prisoner was from you when you first saw him? - About thirty or forty yards, I fancy; it is impossible to tell exactly when a man is in a slurry.</p>
               <p>Q. He was running from you? - He was; and the other men turned back; I positively swear he is the man that came out.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe he used to give you broken bones? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he discontinued that? - He hath been out of his shop these two years; he used to give it to me the same as my master now gives me a bit of fish. A poor man is very glad of that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Is it possible that I could come into the gentleman's shop, and take a roll of Irish off the counter, without his seeing of me?</p>
               <p>Court to Nicbolson. Whereabouts was you in the shop, when Mrs. Smith came in? - I was in the shop, folding up some prints, which had been opened in the course of the day; there was a large pile<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110087"/>of such cloth as this laying on the counter; there was another shopman too in the shop, but he was a writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Swallow-street, that gentleman comes and lays hold of my collar; he lays hold of me about a minute, and found nothing about me, and he let me go; then he ran after another man, and then he let that man go, and came and ran after me again.</p>
               <p>Court to Nicholson. Did you apprehend another man first for this? - No, this is the only person that ever I touched.</p>

            Having said so, was you forced to this prosecution, or is it your own voluntary act? - Prosecution! forced to it!</p>
               <p>Q. Was you forced to it by any relation of your's making any objection at all to it? Was it mentioned to some of them or all of them? - Before the marriage was consummated it was known in every circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you a question, which certainly may appear very distressing to a female mind to answer. Whether you have not known it has been asserted from authority that you cannot doubt; that the first marriage was never consummated from an act of Providence, in the formation of the person of the first wife?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ager. I object to this.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you was no; told by Mrs. Taylor, the first wife, herself, that she never was capable of receiving the embraces of her husband; and therefore she had permitted him to part from her, and to live with you, with her own consent? Did not the first wife know of your marriage? - Not at the time, but afterwards she did, and approved of it. The circumstance you asked me just of, I was told of by Mrs. Marshall's friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mrs. Marshall, or Mrs. Taylor, known of your marriage? visited you with her approbation? and has she not supported you and Mr. Taylor down to this present moment? - I am in the greatest friendship with her down to this present moment, and hope to be so to the end of my days.</p>
               <p>Q. I now ask you whether you or any of your friends instigated this prosecution? - They did not, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what great reformer of morals brings this prosecution forward? - Spite and malice, I know from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that your husband is a witness on some trials that are to be hereafter?</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not suffer you to call this man her husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I beg pardon. Then tell me do you know that this gentleman is a witness in some prosecutions that are to come on? Do not you know and by those that have instigated this prosecution, that you are brought here for the purpose that his conviction may be a means from the prosecutor preventing him from giving his evidence on these prosecutions? In every transaction of Mr. Taylor's life that hath come to your knowledge, is he a man deserving of an excellent character, a moral man, and worthy of belief? - I always found him extremely kind to me, and to all his friends, and would serve any one.</p>

            , Elizabeth Palmer, and Ann Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the witness say at the time he was taken up? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a clerk to an attorney, and I expect you to understand evidence, and I expect you to keep to it. - I saw Mr. Taylor after he was committed, by Mr. Flood or Bond, at Bow-street office, and I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was taken down in writing? - I do not know it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not? - I will not; there was no one person writing in the office when I was present; and if there was I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. I expect that you will swear any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Upon your oath, and I desire nothing from you but the honest truth, was an examination taken in your presence? - There was no written examination. I can only speak to what Mr. Taylor told Mr. Flood, the justice;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110091"/>there was no written examination in my presence; Mr. Flood asked me if I could swear that that was the person that stood in the indictment; I said, yes; and then he committed him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was there any written examination taken down in writing or no, and was not this taken down in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I ask you on your oath at the time that this conversation took place, was there any body taken down any thing regularly? - No, Mr. Lavender was not writing, he was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What was this conversation? - After Mr. Flood had committed Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor said, that there were two marriages, and that he had a good defence to make, the reasons of which he would not then enter into.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what situation of life Mr. Taylor is in? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was clerk to Mr. Martin, the attorney? - I was for about three quarters of a year; I was assigned over to him on the 13th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clerk to him now? - No, my articles are now expired.</p>
               <p>Q. You are attorney of this prosecution? - I am the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what relation are you to Mrs. Taylor? - No relation whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation are you to Mrs. Richardson? - No relation at all, I did it merely for public justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you prosecute a man for a burglary? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, sir, you are a sort of a public prosecutor? - Yes, certainly, and I mean to continue so, when ever any thing comes within my cognizance, and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you will not be paid for this? - No, I shall not, I have done it merely on my own head.</p>
               <p>Q. This fell within your cognizance? - It certainly did; I heard of the circumstance from the country, and I made enquiry, and I found it was fact, and knowing the man, as I conceived him to be a man of bad character, therefore I prosecuted him, not with an intention to do that which is unjust, but merely that he should be obedient to the laws of his country.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this tale, you heard of it by accident? - If you please so; I received a letter from the country first of all; I heard of the second marriage from a Mr. Jefferson, and I also heard from the same the marriage of the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble to go to Baldock? - I went to Baldock on purpose, but I went some part of the way on other business.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you have no other motives? - I have no animosity whatever against the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pearce, you are not then under bail to answer any charge of high treason? - I was taken up, and I am under bail at present.</p>
               <p>Q. You are then under bail to answer in a charge of high treason that was preferred against you; you never heard that this man was a witness against several persons that were tried for high treason already? - I have seen his name in a list of witnesses that was on the occasion.</p>

               <p>Q. Then before that time you did not know till you saw the last paper? - I never had, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. No, and trials for high treason? - I did not know that he was to be produced as a witness, nor did I ever hear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suspect? - I do not know that I am bound to give any suspicions.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you suspcted that he would be a witness against these persons for high treason? - I never heard that he was a witness against Watt and Downie; I heard there was a person of the name of Taylor, but I did not make any enquiry whether this was the man or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110092"/>Q. Upon your oath did you never enquire whether this man was the man or not? - No, I did not know that he was the man that was at Edinburgh, that was witness against Watt and Downie, I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know Taylor at all? - Because he was a member of the society to which I belonged.</p>
               <p>Q. To what society? - The London corresponding society, and which I conceive is clear from any aspersion by the late verdict.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you heard that he had left you, and given information, before you took any steps towards the prosecution? - The first I heard of it was, I saw him at the privy counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the privy counsel? - Sure I did.</p>
               <p>

            Perhaps you was under examination? - I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before or after you took any steps in this prosecution? - It was prior; the lords of the privy counsel, they was so satisfied with my conduct, that they discharged me on bail, that I should appear when I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you suppose so? - I did suppose so, but I instituted it for public justice only; I am not now a member of that society; I commenced the prosecution since I absented myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had been before the privy counsel, was it before you received the letter from Mr. Jefferson? - It was some time, I heard of it before, it was a flying, report, that he was a man who had broke the laws of society, that he had two wives.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not set about enquiring after it, till after you left the privy counsel? - I did not, I took no notice was sure; I had references given to me, where I might make application, and I then took the necessary steps, and I have athrmed as I did before, that if any thing comes within my recognizance, and I can afford it, I shall do the same; all I shall have is, a satisfaction in discharging my duty to society, bringing to punishment them that offend the laws.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say it will be great satisfaction to you, to make two innocent women very uneasy? - I was the last person in the world to give any human being uneasiness, but I wish to see the laws of the country not violated. In all the business which I have done, I have taken care that the stamp act shall be fulfilled, as far as relates to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many bawdy houses, gaming houses. Be so good as to let me see you here every sessions; you was not in court when that amiable young woman was here? - No, I was not in court, I was ordered out by your own desire, and I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think yourself a party attacked to the guilt of bigamy? Have you been told that this connection with this young woman, was with the consent of her own friends, and with the consent of his former wife? - No, I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you did not enquire whether it was with the consent of her relations? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you call on the second lady, and tell her, you did not want to see her? - No, I only consulted the laws of my country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I ask you on your oath, was not you immediately discharged from the privy counsel on the common bail being given, when a man is taken up to set him at liberty; the prisoner at the bar prosecuted these men in Scotland; sup<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110093"/>posing it possible that you was to be indicted, you would not be indicted in Scotland? - No, certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. How came this to be found out? - She came in, the 24th of September, in the evening, and asked for some muslin for cap borders, I shewed her some, and cut her a quarter of a yard, she paid me for it; when I was looking for some paper, I lifted up my head, and I saw her take a muslin handkerchief off the counter, she seemed rather confused, seeing I saw her, she held it down beside her, between her and the counter; in a minute or two afterwards I saw her put it in her pocket; I immediately informed an elderly person who was in the shop with myself, what was best to do; while we were speaking she went out at the door, and I called her back again, and desired her to walk into the kitchen, and I desired a young woman to search her; she went down into the kitchen immediately, and the young woman went down with her, and found the handkerchief on her; we sent for her master and an officer, and her master demanded the key of her box; this is what was found in it, and the constable and her master and myself saw it there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along the gateway, and I saw the ginger lay, and I picked it off the ground; I never took the ginger out of the bag, nor saw the bag near.</p>

            What did you do when the watch was going? - I screamed out, I am robbed! I am robbed! my watch! my watch! and I went to catch hold of my watch, but it was not in my power to help myself; immediately as I said I am robbed, I saw a man running with all his force down Snow-bill; in putting my two seet on the pavement, I felt myself pulled down behind, in such a manner that I sell headlong on my head, and very likely would have broke my scull, if providently my umberella which I had there, had not received the blow, so that I saved myself; then I arose, and I said I was not hurt, and then I make a great noise, to call a mob, because I saw two people running after the man that was running from me, therefore I was not afraid I should be hurt; because I knew an English mob was the best mob, only sometimes they are missed; directly the mob came to me, and helped me with the two men that was scuffing with the robber, or with the man that went from me, and the man was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that was running was taken? - Yes, they told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coach appear to you as if it was over turning? - It appeared quite hanging to the right, I did not know what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had your watch since? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take up this man? - I did not take him up, I was carried by the mob with him to the Compter, and when he came there he sell on his knees, and he said, my life is in your hands.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not been stopped at that time? - Yes, he was stopped before this, he said this in the Compter; then I told him directly, you must not be afraid of me, because I cannot swear to your face.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found your watch at all? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You felt your watch go from you while you was on the steps of the coach, and it was after that that any violence was done to your person? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw some person or other running down Snow-hill? - Yes, with great precipitation; it was not the man that that run down that made any violence to me.</p>

            Where did this gentleman take you up? - He came and got in my coach, the first coach in the Old Bailey, and as it stood in the rank.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - About eight o'clock, as near as I can guess the 26th I believe; I believe I was ordered to St. Giles's; before I got to Snow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110104"/>hill, nearly opposite St. Sepulchre's, they hallooed out I was broken down, then I stopped as soon as I could, and got down, and went to know how it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence done to the coach, or was it an accident? - It was not an accident, there was a brace cut from the off side, the brace behind; I am sure it was cut; I got down from my coach as soon as I could, and I saw two gentlemen helping the gentleman out of the coach, but I did not take particular notice, I was quite confused, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of these men that let him out of the coach? - I cannot say that I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened after the gentleman was handed out of the coach? - The gentleman hallooed out, he was robbed, and lost his watch, he hallooed out, I am robbed! I am robbed! I am robbed! I think he repeated it in that manner; I have lost my watch; two young fellows went and apprehended the prisoner, and took him, as I suppose; the man at the bar is the man that was at Guildhall, that is all that I know, I cannot say that is the man that cut my coach, nor that is the man that robbed the gentleman.</p>

            Did you see this gentleman robbed? - I saw a person run from the coach with the watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, is he the man? - I am certain of him, he was the man that I stopped with the watch. The first thing I saw was a coach coming down Snow-hill, and I heard somebody call out to the coachman, you are broke down; and I went to the coach, and I saw the gentleman at the coach door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the gentleman before you? - Yes, that is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when you saw the gentleman at the coach door? - I saw some people very busy at the door, and endeavouring to get the gentleman out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the prisoner was one of those that was busy at the time? - I cannot say; I heard of the gentleman call out, I am robbed of my watch; I was standing at the coach wheel, and the prisoner passed me, and I saw him pass me, I looked at him, and saw the watch in his hand, and saw him put it under his great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what coloured watch it was? - I saw the glass of it, but whether is was metal or silver I cannot say; I pursued him, and took him by the collar; as soon as I had took him by the collar, I told him that he had got the gentleman's watch, he said, what watch? as soon as I took him by the collar, there came a man over my shoulder, and put his singer in my eyes, here is a small mark now over my eyes, a fear of it; I received several blows, from, I suppose, part of the gang, and I was pushed in the kennel, and I saw the prisoner at the bar in a scussle with (I suppose) Thompson, the other evidence; I saw him engaged with somebody else; the prisoner had a great white coat on, which he was endeavouring to get off; as soon as I got up I went to the prisoner again, who was secured by this Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the watch? - No, I never see the watch since.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prosecutor? - We took the prisoner to the Compter, and the gentleman came up to us there.</p>

               <p>I am a pastry cook; I was sitting in our parlour about Friday evening, the 26th of September, about half after seven I heard a noise in the street, I ran out to see what was the matter, when I came to the mob -</p>
               <p>Q. In what street did you hear a noise? - In Snow-hill; I saw the prisoner in the middle of the mob, in a light great coat, with a hat on, which he pulled off, and with horrid imprecations said, he would give them battle, squring his arms as if he would sight, with that he run across the way, and I ran after him, and I called out stop thief! he ran up the George passage a little way, I followed him, and told him it was no occasion his running, he might as well stop, with that I collared him, at the time he said he would give battle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running particularly? - He was squaring his arms, I got hold of him in that passage, and he fetched me a blow, which knocked me to the wall, and he received a blow from an unknown person, that setched him to the ground, and with the assistance of the mob we took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on him at any time? - Only the great coat and hat which he threw off.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any watch about him? - I did not, but when he came to the compter he said to Mr. Stavell, now my life is in your hands, sir, do as you please.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the prosecutor at all, this gentleman? - When we came to the compter, not before</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you first came up, the prisoner was quarrelling with the mob? - Yes, he ran athwart the way, the mob separted, and he ran, and I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him to the compter, he was tolerably frightened, was not he? - I do not believe he was any ways frightened or alarmed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said at the compter, my life is in your hands, but I am innocent.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110107"/>Q. What do you know of this property that was taken away? - On the evening of the 22d of last month, I was coming down the gateway of our house and just coming to the door I observed my partner with some muslin in his hands, crying stop thief! and looking down the street I observed a man running with another person or two, which I immediately followed nearly to the bottom of the hill; at that time a young man delivered a man to my care.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that man's name? - Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that was delivered into your hands? - The prisoner at the bar, I have every reason to believe, and he was in my hands but a very few minutes; the young man told me that was the man. I was conducting him up the hill again, in the space of a minute or two a man came up to me, and told me he was a constable in our ward, and asked me if he should take charge of him? I then told him yes; and I immediately delivered him to the constable's charge, his name is Watkinson.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw three men running? - I saw one or two men running down the hill at the time that my partner cried out stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. You say a man was delivered to you by Evans. Was the prisoner one of those men that were running? - That I cannot positively say; when the prisoner was delivered into my hands, his coat was much soiled, by which it seems he had sell down in the road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you saw one or two persons run; the prisoner at the bar, you do not know whether he was running or not? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner at the bar was drunk? - He seemed somewhat disgansed in liquor, whether he was drunk or was not I cannot say, or whether it was sictitious.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see the muslin till you returned to your partner's? - No, there were several persons running, it is impossible to see in such a crowd on such a hill as Fish-street-hill, whether it was two or three.</p>

What have you to say against the prisoner? - All that I have to say is, in the afternoon,about a quarterpast five, on the 22d. of September, I heard a cry of stop thief! it was at the back of our warehouse, at day time, I immediately ran to the door, when I came there the young man had fell down, he was at that time getting up, as soon as he got up he ran, soon after I got to the door Mr. Steinman, the prosecutor, came and said, that the man that fell down before our door was the man that had robbed him, I rather think that the prisoner must hear it, I can say that is the man that fell down before our door; I took and delivered him to Mr. Hassell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had the man that you took, hold of any other person near him? - At the time I took him he had none.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you took, you do not know any otherwise of his being the prisoner than delivering him to Mr. Hassell, and seeing him before the magistrate? Did not you look at him when you took him? - No, I never saw his face, as soon as Mr. Hassell came up I delivered him to him and went in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person you took, in liquor or not? - I really cannot tell, I took no notice at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not in liquor? - No, I will not swear one way or the other, for I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were they taken from? - From Mr. Fletcher's barges, I have no doubt of that; it was on the 25th of October, about eight in the evening, I was passing along Thames-street, I saw a man bring a sack of coals up the gangway from <placeName id="t17941111-51-crimeloc255">Paul's-wharf</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was this after you had seen a man in the gangway? - Yes, that induced me to go on the whars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you immediately went to this door? - I gave him time to dispose of his first freight, and return for the second, then I went up to go on the whars, and I met with the other witness, and we went up the whars in Thames-street, and went down the gang way, which leads to the stairs, I went down the gang way and saw this person still in the white waistcoat; I conceived that he would not come on shore, that he had either heard or seen me, we walked up that gang way again, and I stopped exactly at the top, and in about five or six minutes the prisoner at the bar came up the gang way, with this sack of coals on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whose coals these were? - I cannot swear to the coals, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other coals laying in this Paul's wharf, besides Mr. Fletcher's? - There was at that time no other craft with coals in them but Mr. Fletcher's. I asked him what he had got in the sack? I said, I perceive they are coals, how did you come by them? he stammered, and at length said, that a west country bargeman had given them to him; I told him that must be explained to my satisfaction, and he walked on, and I along side of him, and when he came to Bennet's-hill, he threw down the sack, and seemed determined to escape if possible, and we had a scussle on the hill, I found that in all probability he would escape from me, the other witness being an elderly man, I then threw him, and we both sell, he being much stronger than me, he shot me under, and got up and ran away; I also got up, and followed him, and he runned up Addle-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him till you took him? - No, not at all till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. The coal sack, who does that belong to? - I do not know, there are never no sacks in the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man came up with the sack on his back, was he drest in a white jacket? - Yes, he was, to the best of my recollection it was a flannel waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never wore a white jacket in my life; there were other barges there, in my master's dock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110109"/>Prosecutor. There is a dock belongs to an oil man, between the causeway and where Mr. Fletcher's barges lay; the barges he talks of, was on the left hand of the cause way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the barges he talks of from Mr. Fletcher's? - Thirty or forty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether he could come from that barge of his master's, and be in that situation in which you found him? - Surely, because I found him at the top of the gang way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he is a servant there or no? - I have heard that he is a servant to Messrs. Crawshaw and Co.</p>

About eight o'clock that evening, I went down to Paul's whars, there is a necessary there, which I goes there almost every night in the week; when I had done I went to the steps on the landing place, and I thought I saw something by the pile, the side of the cause-way, like a bundle, and being dark I went down the steps, on purpose to see what it was, and I found it was a little bag of coals, and I stopped a minute or two, to see if any body was there, and I called halloo! but nobody answered, and I took them up, and when I came about a hundred, or a hundred and fifty yards up, just in Thames-street, that gentleman collared me, and he directly said, he would send me to goal, where I never was before, and he used me very ill, and threw me down, and I thought I would make the best escape I could, and I ran I do not know which way.</p>

I told him I was a dealer, that dealt with one Locklan; he asked me who else I knew in the business? I told him four or five names which satisfied him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he provide you with these yards of whites? - He did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I object to going into evidence on different days.</p>
               <p>Court. You may go on what day you please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullon. Then we will go on the 30th. - On the 30th of September I went with six officers, I think it was rather turned of seven o'clock; I had two half crowns in my pocket then to purchase with; Mr. Armstrong asked me if they were marked; I told him one was, and the took the other and marked it himself; when I came to the house I asked him if he could do any thing for me? he said he could, he went into the parlour and brought me out this money, which I gave him five shillings for, ten shillings for two half crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have kept them ever since? - I have; the officers then were waiting, and I came out to them, and told them he was in the bar without his coat and hat, and had a striped waistcoat on; they went in and took him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What are you? - A bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - An extraordinary officer belonging to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sent by the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was to pay you for going there? - I never was given to understand who would pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you expect to be paid? - I did, certainly.</p>

            Until you mentioned to Spencer what you came for, he did not mention a word about this business? - Spencer did not come to me, I went to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you tempred him to put off this bad money, and now you come to give evidence against him? - I am doing my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there was no half crown found or any thing? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Jury. How many do you call a yard? - I understand that it was a shilling a yard, that ten yards was ten shillings worth.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a public officer at Worship-street? - I am. On the 30th of September last, the witness was at our office, and we were ordered by our magistrate (I and the rest of the officers) to go to the prisoner's house, at Field-lane, the Swan, we went, and when we came near Field-lane, we told him to go in and do the business, and we would call at a house in Fleet-market; we stopped there about a quarter of an hour, and the came back, and said, I have bought, now is the time; and we went there and took the prisoner; I was one of the men that took him from the house; and left the other in the house; I searched him, and found nothing but a few halfpence.</p>

            Pray what kind of people did you see about that house? - I did not mind hardly any person in the house, for directly as the prisoner was pointed out, I and another officer took him out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then this man were sent by you? - No, not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. They were sent there by somebody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to endeavour to make the prisoner put off bad money, and you were watching in order to take him? - We was at the public house, waiting his return.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was a trap laid for him to put off this money? - I know not that.</p>
               <p>Q. He was searched and nothing found on him; there was no bad money found on him? - Nothing but a few halfpence.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of people did you see about the house?</p>

            Was he a servant in the house? - He was a hackney coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he in the kitchen? - On the 23d of September I had a sister in Bartholomew's Hospital, came to see me; she came to the door with him; I sent her home in a coach, and the prisoner endeavoured to entice me very much to go back with him in the coach, I told him I could not afford it, I was nothing but a servant; he said he would take me back for six-pence; I did not go back with him. On the Saturday following he came to our house, and asked me whether we did not leave an umbrella in the coach? I told him I did not know whether we did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your family in town at this time? - They were in the country; there was nobody abiding in the house at this time but myself; there was a bill at the door to let the house. When he asked about the umbrella, I told him I did not know we had; he said we had, and he had taken care of it; I told him I was very much obliged to him; he asked me to give him a bit of cold victuals; I told him I had none, I would give him a bit of bread and cheese with all my heart; I asked him where the umbrella was? he said it was just by; I asked him where his coach was? he said It was not his day to go out, he was not on the stand. I gave him some bread and cheese, he sat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110113"/>down in the kitchen to eat; I told him if he eat it there he must be very quick, I was to be with my master at the banking house at half past two, while he was sitting there I looked at my watch, and see it was twenty minutes after two; I ran up one pair of stairs in the hall, for my bonnet, and I just took my bonnet in my hand, and I was coming down, and I heard the door shrick, and I slew down stairs to the door, he tried to shut the door, but he could not shut it, his coat catched in the door, and he slung it open against me, and ran off; I thought of my watch and property, and I went in the kitchen and saw it was gone, and I had six hundred pounds of my master's property, in bank notes, that I was going to my master with, but I had that in my pocket; then I ran up to the door again, and went out, and asked every body, and could not find him, and I was continually going about to find him out; I did not know that they had taken the number of the coach at the Hospital; but I heard at last that he was in Clerkenwell Bridewell; I went and found him at Bow-street; he was there to be examined for thieving a trunk; he was then cleared to go out, and I was there with some officers.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take him up or any body else? - I took him at Bow-street, he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take him. Are you sure that is the same man? - That is the man; I know him amongst ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found the watch and pin? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have never had the good fortune to find the watch and pin again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he took you up in the coach? - No. 78, my master's door, on the 23d of September.</p>

            Had it the silver on it then? - No, it was taken off. I happened to be in the shop, he came with one cap, and said, I did not know they were of any use to you, I have made enquiry and cannot find who they belong to, they lay at the White Bear, in Bride-lane, I have seven more of them. I immediately said it was my property, and I should like to see the others.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he offer them for sale? - He asked if they were worth any thing? I told him they had been advertised and a reward offered; he said he knew nothing of the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reward? - A guinea reward. In consequence of that he said I might see them at Bride-lane; I said, I would take care that somebody should come and see them, I wrote a note to Mr. Urwin that he was in Bride-lane, and there he took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman said, that when he sent the workman to me he should satisfy me for my trouble.</p>

And he asked me what I had got? and I told him eight caps; and he asked me whose they were? and I told him Mr. Hawkers's; then he said, Mr. Hawkes had sent him for them in a great hurry, and, says he, lend them me and I will take them to the gentleman; then I asked him when there would be any more ready? and he told me to come at twelve o'clock the next day; and I went at twelve o'clock the next day, and the gentleman said there had been no caps come.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Not before he took the caps.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The boy said that I stopped him first of all in Exeter-street, in the Strand, and took them from him; then on his second hearing he said, I took them from him by the New Church, in the Strand.</p>

               <p>Court to Hawkes. They are for the light horse? - They was for the gentlemen of the City light horse. It was a great disappointment to me at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in the afternoon at the White Bear, Bride-lane, about six o'clock, and remained there till ten, I went out to make water, and saw a parcel laying with these caps in, and I took it into the White Bear, and the mistress of the White Bear said, I had better advertise them, I took them home on Friday afternoon to my lodgings; on Tuesday I had nothing to do, and I went to a trunk maker, the corner of the Old Bailey, and asked what they were worth? he said not much, they were worth more to the owner; and the owner was Mr. Hawkes, in Piccadilly, and I went to Mr. Hawkes directly.</p>

I advised him to put them bye, and get them advertised; they were put bye; and I am very sorry to inform you that the next morning I went out of town, I had some bunsiness to do at Cambridge; I told him they should be advertised. I was gone a much as eight days, which I think it I had not gone out of town it would have laid in my power to prove that this prisoner was in my house when the boy lost the caps, but I rather think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110116"/>the young man that lives with me can.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in your house at the time the boy lost the caps? - I think he was, but going out of town did it away from my mind, but I as much believe he was, as if he was now present.</p>
               <p>Q. They were in a cloth? - Yes, they were; I told the young man that lives with me to put them in a cupboard.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of his losing a pair of spectacles in a case, and a compass? - Michael Parker and John Kennedy came in the shop, they asked me for a pennyworth of hand snappers, I served them; they asked me if I had any candle snappers? I told them I had not, therefore Kennedy he put down the halfpence to pay for those I had served him, then Parker put down a shilling and said he would pay for them, he said it made no difference between the two; I went out of the shop to light a candle to look at the shilling he had given me, and these things particularly werelaid on the counter before I went out of the shop, besides the things stolen there were two barometers, a steering compass, and a show glass, containing many other things.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was you absent? - Not more than a minute. On my return I missed the spectacles and the compass, and one of the boys was gone out of the shop, Kennedy the youngest of the two; immediately I secured the other boy, and asked him what became of the things that lay on the counter? he told me he could not tell me, he believed the other boy had run away with them; I asked him if he knew who the other boy was? He told me his name was Kennedy that his father was a taylor, living in East Smithfield; I said is that so? he said it is; some little time after I saw Kennedy return and looking through the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep this other boy in custody? - Yes, I ran out after him endeavouring to catch him, I called out stop thief! he past a great number of people and ran down into Thames-street, there I lost him among some carts, and I returned back; my master soon returned, and he will relate what past.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take him then? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Parker searched? - Not immediately.</p>
               <p>Jury. What did you do with the lad, at the time you was looking after the other? - Left him in care of the house keeper.</p>

               <p>Mosely. This is the case, but the spectacles I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. I have to ask you how you got these back again? - The spectacles was sent by Kennedy's father, to my shop by an old woman some time after we had taken this first boy; that woman is not here. This compass was not taken out of the shop, I found it behind the counter, the next morning; I have lost in the course of ten months, goods to the amount of nine or ten pounds from the counter, taken by somebody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Kennedy. I never had the spectacles at all; I never knew this lad, I never saw him before I was put in the Compter with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parker. One day as I was going along Tower-street I went in to buy a pennyworth of snappers, and while I was in they said, that how I took out some spectacles and compasses, and it was another boy that did this, and I said, I had none at all, they might search me.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of that, had you any communication with Pynor, and what did he say? - At the time I was to make the transfer, being also in possession of this suspicious circumstance, I thought it necessary to enquire about it; I traced from place to place, till at last I went to St. Martin's; I found it out by references, which had been given me; and after searching the books for four or five years back, I found the entry you have now heard; this being the case, I thought it my duty not to go with them to the funds, I had intimated that the beginning of the week would suit me to go; I had not any communication with Pynor till he came to my house in consequence of a general message.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did he come? - On Monday the 27th of October, I hope I am accurate; being in possession of this certificate, which I had obtained, I went in company with my attorney, to the Lord Mayor; on our return from the Lord Mayor, Pynor and Sarah Bartlett was in my dining room, we procured an officer, and I went to Mr. Pynor, I had not seen him from the time of the marriage till then; I went to him, and I said, on my return from the country, I heard that you had married Mrs. Bartlett; I heard also that it was in common report, that you was a married man; and I also heard that you set up this as a justification of your conduct, that it was true that you had cohabited with women, but that you had never been married at all, is it so, I said, or, to that effect? his answer was, that he had never been married; I then asked him if he knew Joanna Hobbs? he said he did, but he never was married to her; I asked him if he recollected going with her to St. Martin's church? I think he replied no, but I immediately said, I will help your recollection, I read to him the certificate of the marriage I had obtained, quite through; he then said, she was an unworthy person, or he used an expression of the same import, I do not positively speak to the very expression; and that they were separated, and that she had given him leave to marry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deny or acknowledge that he had been married to this

               <p>Q. It is within the liberties of the City of London? - It is a liberty place, but within the bounds of the City of London, I was sworn before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took up Pynor, did you hear him say any thing? - I heard him say a good deal; after I took him up, and took him to the Mansion House, we stopped an hour and a half before the Lord Mayor came, and there was some conversation took place between the prisoner and me, he acknowledged the former marriage, but he did not think that either his first or second wife would hurt him; after some time had past, he says, what had I best to do in such a case as this; I says to him I am not a lawyer, I am only a constable; says he, I think I will not speak a word, I said to him it will be of no service to be dumb; says he, I think I will tell all the truth, I told him the truth would hold longest on foot; he said that his wife had used him very ill, and that she had given him leave to marry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will not intrude upon your lordship's time but very little. The ill treatment of my first wife was beyond expression; also neither did I wish to obtain any money from Sarah Bartlett, or to have any money in my possession, I would not go to wrong any one, it is not my disposition, only to discharge the bills; all that I have to say now is, that I am only at your mercy, and the gentlemen of the jury; I never troubled my friends on this occasion at all.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the person? - Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came in what did they do? - One told that he had been robbed, and almost killed by kidnappers, some time before, he did not mention the time; and after they took a chair and dined, another mentioned a great many things, I do not recollect about kidnappers, and the gentleman in the blue coat, he took the bills out of his pocket, and the other two which was in their company said, that he had some also in his pocket, that person is not here; the young man in the blue coat, he came were I sit down, and he gave me one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the bill before.(The bill shewn him.) - It is the same exactly, I know by the direction on it, it is the bill; I received it without giving any approbation or disapprobation, and put it in my pocket without reading; after my dinner I went out of the room, and I read the paper by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave them in the room? - I left them all three in the room; I read the bill, I looked on it as nonsense, it struck me as a dangerous bill at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had read the bill what did you do? - I went to the Mansion House immediately; I called on the Lord Mayor and I gave it to him, with the direction, and he sent for these three young men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when they were brought before the Lord Mayor? - I was not.</p>
               <p>The bill read by the clerk of the court.</p>
               <p>"To the PUBLIC.</p>
               <p>Beware, Britons, of the hordes of crimps and kidnappers that infest the metropolis and its environs, who rob and imprison its peaceful inhabitants. Oh! think of the number of parents that are made wretched, in having their blooming sons torn from them by these Monsters. - Would such atrocious acts have been suffered in the days of Alfred? If you bring these Demons before the magistrates, you cannot get redress, they will screen them in defiance of the Law. Is this the Land so famed for Liberty? Did Sidney and Russel bleed for this? - Oh, My Poor Country!"</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - Between three and four.</p>
               <p>Barrow to Rusina. Pray, sir, did I give you any papers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did I sit in the room? - You was sitting opposite the gentleman who is not here, and the other gentleman was by himself; I was near the door, the gentleman in black was here, and you sat there, (pointing the manner they fat in the room) I was near the door, and another came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he was sitting in the room, Watson? - He was on the left; you left your place and went to his table.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether I sat below or opposite? - You was opposite to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what coat was I dressed in? - I do not recollect; if I saw you in the same clothes I should know you very well.</p>

               <p>Q. What were they about? - They had pen, ink, and paper before them.</p>

               <p>Q. Had they done dinner? - They had, and they had pen and ink, and they all three sat about this table.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to this house? - A gentleman, a foreigner, came to my Lord Mayor, on the 23d of August, on a Saturday, and in consequence of that I was sent after them, and after I had searched them I took them to the Mansion House, and from there to the Compter, till Monday.(The paper read by the clerk of the court.)</p>
               <p>"To the worthy Citizens of London.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the militia bill, which the common council of the different wards are now carrying into effect fills you with astonishment; I am only surprised that it does not produce a very different effect: what shall such an important matter be determined upon without your being consulted, or informed that a business of so great magnitude was in agitation: shall the declaration which, with matchless affrontry, was made in parliament, that the measures was well considered, and met your approbation, when at least ninety-nine out of every hundred of you was particularly ignorant of its principles and operations. For shame! awake from your lethargy! let it not be said of you that you are strangers to that spirit which had used to animate the City of London, in the preservation of their rights and liberty. If you do not resist with spirit the present innovation of those rights, you will merit this or any other oppression that unprincipled or interested men in power may wish to impose upon you: And I shall not be surprised if, in the next session, a bill should be brought in parliament to convert your shops into barracks. There is no time to be lost! Might I advise, meetings should be immediately convened in every ward, and the common council men called upon to assign their reasons for deciding a matter of such vast importance without having applied to their constituents for instructions, or their being in the least informed of their sentiments on the subject; which, according to my opinion, is a subject which calls for the most serious considerations, the most cool and deliberate discussion. That you may see your present alarming situation in its true light, and speedily adopt such measures as may effectually avert so great an evil, is the sincere wish of an old citizen."(Another paper read by the clerk of the Court)</p>
               <p>"Soldiers! now is the time to acquire glory, protect villainy, and murder those of your fellow creatures who have the courage to resist you."</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110123"/>Q. In what state were these papers? - Quite damp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That is the same that was delivered to that gentleman, of which there was a great number.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the last that was read? - Them that we took out of the pocket of Mr. Barrow was dampish.(Alluding to the paper, No. 1.)</p>
               <p>(Another paper read by the clerk of the Court. No. 3)</p>
               <p>"To the citizens of London.</p>
               <p>Friends and fellow citizens, our torpid insensibility hath subjected us to every imposition of the crafty knaves, to whose cunning delusions we have implicitly become the dupes, it is time to rouse our attention and consideration to every thing that has not the least appearance of connection with our welfare, and no longer tacitly submit our property and persons to the direction of our court, or court sycophants whatever, which are at all times actuated by the score of interest; and while they can preserve and feather their own nests care not who wants; and I dare be careful to say, that our government is managed by rascals of this description, &amp;c. Let us at least preserve the spirit of our brave ancestors, spurn at corruption and venality; once more prove yourselves worthy of the most honourable of all names, that of citizens. Consider, therefore, that is absolutely contary to the charter of the great City of London; which is, that the said citizens shall not be sent to war without the City of London, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>N. B. Any alien or person unknown to the City of London, being employed, is in the highest degree dangerous; and we may as well have the king's butchers to protect us, as any other stranger. Remember, O, my friends! the laws! the rights! the generous plan of power delivered down from age to age, by your renowned forefathers, so dearly bought at the price of so much blood! O! let them never perish by your hands, but transmit them to your children. Do thou, great liberty, inspire our souls, and make our lives, in thy possession, happy, or our death glorious in thy just defence."</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Perrott. There is one of these letters; they were taken from Mr. Barrow's pocket? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search the other? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you proceeded to search these persons, had you any charge of felony against them? - No, I had not. In the coach they asked me what authority I had to take them? I shewed them my staff.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrow. Where did I sit when you was in the room? - Between them.</p>
               <p>Q. If you recollect that man swore before that I sat opposite to them. When you took me I asked you whether you had a warrant? you shewed me your staff, and said, here is warrant enough to knock you on the head.</p>
               <p>Perrott. I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. To Perrott. What was on the table besides paper, pen, and ink? - Nothing else; they had done dinner, and every thing cleared away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your oath, the day that Mr. Wation was committed, was you at all examined by the Lord Mayor? was you examined before my Lord? - Only as to the papers which I took.</p>

               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Is your name James? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a constable belonging to the city.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of August last, tell the court and jury what you did. - About three o'clock in the afternoon Mr. Perrott came to me and said I must go immedi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110124"/>ately with him. I went with Mr. Perrott and the Marshalmen to an eating house, in Smithfield, and we went to a room there; when I came in the room there were the two prisoners at the bar, and a third person, whose name was Scott; Mr. Scott was sitting on the side of the table near the door going in; Mr. Watson was sitting opposite, and Mr. Barrow next to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found on the table? - Here is a bill I have I found on the table; I searched Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing about Watson, the two letters you have in your hand? - No, I found what was on the table, a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Near unto whom was that bill? - Near to Mr. Watson.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the ink wet or dry? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that and see if that is the bill which was near Watson. (The bill shewn him.) - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the pen and ink that was on the table? - I cannot exactly describe.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you found that bill on the table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see both sides? - Not at that time.(The bill which lay before Watson, read by the clerk of the Court.)</p>
               <p>"Soldiers! now is the time to acquire glory! protect crimping! murder those of your fellow creatures that dare resist it! fire on the friends of freedom! destroy liberty! and prepare chains for yourselves and children!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Were there any other people in this room? - There was a man and woman, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wine on the table? - Nothing to my knowledge but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him to? - I took him to my Lord Mayor and told my Lord what had happened; I had this stick of Mr. Watson.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Watson. You searched Watson; you took no bills from him? - None, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any charge of felony on him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the chief magistrate charge you to seize these papers? - I had orders brought me to seize these gentlemen and every paper they had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Watson desire you to seal these papers you found on him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did he not? - He did not, there he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to swear upon your oath that Mr. Watson did not desire you to seal up his papers? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You took this gentleman before the Lord Mayor? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In course you was examined upon what was found on him? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any examination upon oath on Saturday before the Lord Mayor? - There was no examination on Saturday upon oath.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place at the Mansion-house on Saturday? They were taken to prisen? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday there was examination upon oath? - There was.</p>

             I saw him but once; I was in the habit of calling at that house almost every day, there was no idea of any conspiracy, till after I had said I had an action against the Lord Mayor, for holding me from Saturday till Monday; as for that frenchman that hath come forward, He is a perjured man; neither did I pull out a bill from my pocket, till I saw them pulled out my pocket; I asked Perrote by what authority he took me? he said, that was authority enough to knock off my head, if I spoke another word; I knew nothing of Mr. Scott, and Dr.

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Very well, I remember his coming to my shop on the 26th of September, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the week was it? - I think it was on Friday; he came to buy a pair of shoes for himself, I sitted him on a pair; he asked me what the price of them was? I told him they were five shillings and six-pence; he said he did not mean to beat a person down in the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the money? - He laid me down five shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in shillings? - There was some six-pences among it when I looked at them, I told him they looked very bad indeed, I wished him to change them; he said he would change them if I refused them; I said they were very bad; after that he puts me down some more, and bids me take my choice, I said these are very bad, they are much like the others; he said I was very forupulous; I said I will not take any of them; he snatched them up from the counter, and said, keep what you have got, and away he ran.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you put down all those you had in your hand? - No, all but three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. He swept away those on the counter? - Yes, he did, all besides three shillings; he ran off, and I said, stop him, and I ran after him; a person came up who was a constable, and took him up; we brought him back, and when we came in, I said, you had better search him, and he put his hand in the prisoner's pocket, and pulled out some more bad money, the constable did.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what happened when you came to Mr. Trustee? - When I heard the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and I took hold of the prisoner, Mr. Trustee came up, and he told me he had been uttering bad money I took him back, and there I saw three bad shillings on the counter; he had some in his hand, which he chucked down on the counter, which with the two or three shillings that laid there made twenty; after that I was going to search him, I was tied to time, I was going to the Post office; I only put my hand in his breeches pocket, and pulled out eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. That is one shilling and six-pence? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cullen. Since you had mixed the money, what did you observe besides, in carrying him to the compter? Did he do any thing during that time? - He attempted to put his hand in his right hand waistcoat pocket; I desired him to keep his hand from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that is the money you found on him? - Yes.</p>

            Produce it. (Produces the money he took off the counter, and the one shilling and six-pence.) You have two parcels there, where is the other? - We had a hearing before the Lord Mayor, he desired Trustee to point out the money, he pointed out the five shillings and six-pence, and the one shilling and six-pence, and he swore it to be the identical money that he brought for a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Court. Now this other parcel was all that was found on him when you took him to the Compter? - Yes, except the one shilling and six-pence.(The money shewn to Parker.)</p>
               <p>Parker. This money is all bad, the twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The money was all thrown together, but there are three of the shillings which I can speak to, which has some aquafortis on it, them I am positive to.(The five shillings and six-pence shewn to Parker.)</p>
               <p>Parker. Three of the shillings are bad, two of the six-pences I am doubtful of, I believe they are good ones, indeed it is hardly possible to tell by candle light, they have brought the composition to such great perfection; upon these three that are bad, aquafortis has been on them.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is John? - A young man, a pretty gentleman, he is a gentleman's ostler, a servant, cleans knives.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - About three weeks, it is only three weeks since I first knew him, since he gave me a glass of peppermint.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Kirby. How long has she been in confinement? - The sessions before last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming over the common, I sat down, and he came to me as I sat there; he said he thought it was a pity such a pretty girl as I should be lost, and he took and gave me a glass of peppermint, and he said he would marry me, if I had no objection; and I told him I had no objection; he told me where his master lived, and I went to his master's, but they said if I did not go away from them, they told me they did not know what to do with me. They told me I should see him sit here in a great white wig, but I cannot see nonelike him; I took the petticoat to be wedded to him, because mine is a nasty old one.</p>
