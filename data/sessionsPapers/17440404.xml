               <p>Amias King. I came to London about the 10th of January, and locked my house up, and when I came home again in two or three days, I found the back part of my house had been broke open, the outward door was broke to pieces, and the other door was likewise broke open. - I lost two guns, some Carpenter's tools, &amp;c. (my husband was a Carpenter,) - Gregory confessed before he was taken up, that he was concerned in breaking the house open, and wanted to make it up with me. He said one Dyer, Robinson, and old Hayes were concerned with him in doing it; the house was broke open twice, once was four or five weeks before the 10th of January, and then they took a pail, and some other things. - I know nothing but what Gregory told me.</p>

            , between one and two in the morning. I felt her hand in my pocket, and immediately I missed the money, and she run away; I run after her, but she got away, and I could not see any thing of her - it was in a little passage.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Minton. Very well - because she was along with me and the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going?</p>
               <p>Minton. I was going to the other woman's lodging, we had been all three drinking at a cellar over against Somerset-house, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the other woman did not take it?</p>
               <p>Minton. I am sure I had my money in my pocket when the Prisoner put her hand into it - it was in a black purse.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you * by so much money? </p>
               <p> * The Prosecutor was a private soldier. </p>
               <p>Minton. I received it of Mr. Dobson, at the Custom-house, on account of tea that was seized in a barn at Camberwell belonging to smugglers.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your other companion?</p>
               <p>Minton. I don't know where she is now.</p>

               <p>Minton. I knew her before, but had not much acquaintance with her - she was not taken till two or three days after.</p>

            . I am a Constable of Covent Garden; between eleven and twelve on Easter Eve (March 24.) this man, Minton, brought the Prisoner into the watchhouse, and in the night I was talking familiarly with her; and I asked her why she robbed such a poor man. She said, D - n it, those that have nothing we can have nothing from, and we must have it from those that have, for we have no respect of persons. She said she had the money, and she swore, she would hang farther and mother, before she would hang herself. Then said I, you should turn evidence. Yes, she said, to be sure I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what money she had?</p>
               <p>Wolsenden. She said she had a three-pound-twelve, a thirty-six shilling piece, and a moidore; I can't tell what silver she said she had, she said she had shared the money between herself and two accomplices. I asked her if she had any of the money left. She said she was obliged to pawn her cloak for two shillings. What, said I, is all the money gone? She said, as to one of her accomplices, she was clothed with that money; she had bought her a gown and petticoat, a shift, a pair of stockings, a cap, and the rest of the money was spent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say in what Manner she took it from Minton?</p>
               <p>Wolfenden. I cannot say in particular in what manner; she said, D - n it what signifies talking, the truth is the truth, the money I had from him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What condition was she in when she told you this story?</p>
               <p>Wolsenden. Just as she is now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man in my life before that night, and he took me into a house to give me a half pennyworth of small beer, I can bring one to prove he never missed the money till seven o'clock next morning.</p>
               <p>Wolfenden. The Prisoner said she dogged the man from that cellar in the Strand, into broad St. Giles's. <rs id="t17440404-5-verdict32" type="verdictDescription">

            . I keep a goldsmith's shop on St. Margaret's Hill in Southwark. On Friday the 23d of March, in the morning, the Prisoner brought this lid of a tankard to me to sell. Finding it was wrenched off by force. I asked her some questions , to which she gave me but very indifferent answers. I suspected she had the other part of the tankard about her, and asked her if she had not? She said , No. Then said I, you must give me leave to search you. She very readily let me search one side, but was very unwilling that I should search the other. I put my hand over the counter, and struck it against the edge of the tankard; and then I told her, I must stop her and the tankard. She said, I should have the tankard if I would let her go. I said, that would not do for me. I sent for a Constable, and had her before Justice Clarke, who committed her. I saw by an advertisement that was published that day, who was the owner. I sent to him, and the gentleman came to me, and said, it was his tankard . She said before the Justice that she took it out of the Prosecutor's house; there's the tankard with the name and number that was in the advertisement.</p>
               <p>White. That is my tankard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was given me by a woman who lodged in the house where I lived; I told the gentleman so; they bid me confess the thing, and said, I should be safe; and I said what was not true .</p>

            . On Sunday March 18, I was at a publick house by Covent-Garden, where I saw Mr. White. He was pretty much in liquor, and I advised him to go home - this was about half an hour after nine. The next morning he came to make his complaints to me, told me what he had lost, and wanted me to go with him to endeavour to get them again. I told him I could not go then. On the Tuesday morning he came and told me he had found out the place where he was robbed, and showed me one of the buckles. We got a warrant and had it executed; and when the Prisoner was before the Justice, she owned every article except either the hat or wig, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say, did she own she took them from him?</p>
               <p>Hughes. She said she knew of them, and if the Justice would indulge her to let the Constable go home with her, she would show him where the buckles were, and she said they were under a brick in her cellar. The Constable and I went with her, she found the brick but did not find the buckles, then she said that one Sullivan, who she said was run away , or something to that purpose, told her she had left them under a brick in the cellar for her, but she did not know, what Sullivan had done with them.</p>

The Prisoner came to lodge with me last February, lay there but two nights, run away and took the sheets off the bed, and carried them away with her - She was the last person in the room, my girl told me the sheets were gone. I went up about five or six minutes afterwards and they were gone. She said before Justice Mussel that she did take the sheets off the bed. She said at first she had pawned them, and then that she had sold them. - I don't know I lost any thing, only as my wife and child told me. <rs id="t17440404-17-verdict98" type="verdictDescription">

I went next day to the King John in Holloway-lane, and asked the landlord if such a man was not there. He said yes (he had got two pound of beef stakes and was eating them) I asked if he had not pawned something, he said he had pawned a silver knee buckle. I told him if he would help me to my things again I would forgive him, and I would pay what they were pawned for. He went with me to the pawnbroker's where my buckles were pawned. I got one of my buckles again, and I paid 5 s. 1 d. for the other two, [a large pair of shoe buckles.] There was one of the buckles he did not take away, which I suppose stuck in my pocket, for I put the buckles under this pair of stockings in my pocket that nobody should find them.

She said she did not care to sell it herself, because she knew so many of the soldiers, for she came along with them. I told her, I did not care to do it. She said, You B - h, what are you afraid of?

            . The Prisoner was my lodger. On the 10th of March, about eight o'clock in the morning, news was brought me that I was robbed. When I found in what manner, I said to the Prisoner, it cannot be a stranger that has done this; it must be you, or through your occasion. She said, she wondered I should say so, for her honesty was never questioned; and she declared she did not do it. She went out of my house, and was dogged into a pawnbroker's shop, at the Hand and Lock of Hair in Shoe-lane. She came back again afterwards, and still said, she had nothing of mine. Then I said I must charge a Constable with her. One Mr. Wilson said, it does not signify any thing talking, for I saw you go into a pawnbroker's, and I know some of the goods. Then she fell a crying, and bid me put my hand into her pocket, and take out the key of her room, and I should find a great many of the things. The Constable pushed me away, and said, she should give me the key herself. She said the things were under her bed; and accordingly I found part of the goods there, and part at Mr. Sheldon's, the pawnbroker. I found my daughter's mantelet, and several other things, at Mr. Weyburne's, the Five Roses in Shoe-lane. And before my Lord Mayor she cried, and owned the fact.</p>

            . On the 9th of March I went up stairs, and found all my drawers pulled out: I missed thirty shillings in silver, and four shillings in half-pence: there was no body in the house but the Prisoner Campbell. When I came down stairs , I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174404040011"/> was in a terrible fright, and he was gone; he came in at night with a new checkered shirt on, and said he had been at St. Catharine's, and had got his chest (he belongs to the sea). The maid said, you have made great haste, for you have not been out of the house above half an hour - my husband is a vintner; there's no body but my husband, myself, and the maid, who live in the house - Campbell does not lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house?</p>
               <p>Langley. The maid and the woman who came to wash. I had known Campbell about a week; he lay about sleeping, and I said, young man you had better go up into the garret and sleep. He went up stairs, and staid there from eight in the morning till five in the afternoon - I missed this money much about six o'clock - the money was in my own chamber, the half-pence upon the table, and the silver in the drawer where the India handkerchief was - He went out about fix, and came in again about eight. The maid said to him, you have got a new checkered shirt on; and asked him some questions. He said, what signifies your asking me so many questions; is there any thing missing? I was loth to awake my husband, who was asleep in the kitchen, and did not say any more to him then. He came in again about eleven o'clock at night, and then he had a white shirt on. I charged a watchman with him, on suspicion of stealing the money, &amp;c. As we were carrying him to the watchhouse, coming through St. Martin's church-yard, he said he would charge me; and he said he did not care if I did transport him, for then he should go to sea. He confessed having the half-pence, and said he met

             brought this handkerchief to our house, and pawned it for a shilling - I have known Gray these four years, he is a taylor. Gray said he came from the Parliament-house in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that a night-house?</p>
               <p>Ravell. Yes, Sir. Coming from thence he met Campbell, and asked him to treat him; and he said he would if he would go and pledge that handkerchief for him. Campbell confessed he took the handkerchief , and took the half-pence off the table, in Mr. Langley's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Campbell. I went to this gentlewoman's in Charles's Court in the Strand. I was very much in liquor, and sleepy: she desired me to go up and sleep. I went down to Wapping afterwards for a check'd shirt; and when I came back again, she would charge me with these things, and said, she was told I had opened the door, and took so much money. And two women came and told me, if I would own it, they would clear me; and they gave me money to say so. I had met Gray, and he asked me to treat him. I told him, if he would pawn that handkerchief I would. Mrs. Langley gave me liquor, and persuaded me to own it.</p>

            . The Prisoner took a ready furnished room of me at half a crown a week, in Bell Court, Gray's-Inn-Lane, and robbed me of these things. I got a search warrant, and found them. He owned before the Justice, that he took them out of the room, and pawned them.</p>

               <p>Kitchen. Yes, you gave me something in your way as you are a lawyer; they were of no service to me, and I delivered them up to you again before the Constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. I took him the 7th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave his lodging?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. The same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. I took him in the same room where he lodged, about eleven o'clock in the morning, his wife and child and he were in bed together . I had a note sent me to take care of my goods, for sent I should lose all I had in the room: and that was the reason of my apprehending him.</p>

I said what service are these of to me? said he, pray take them, so at his desiring it I took them and laid them by.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they?</p>
               <p>Prisoner . One was an indenture of a fine belonging to myself, and the other was a commission empowering me to take affidavits in Buckinghamshire. I left them in his hands as a security till I could get money to pay him for the things he gave me leave to pawn ; he did not deliver the papers till I was apprehended with a warrant.</p>
               <p>Kitchen. I own that I delivered them before the Constable, after I took him up.</p>

               <p>Kitchen, Yes, but I believe it was with my things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How much were the things pawned for? That would not pay half a crown a week from September to March, they have put my material witness out of the way, who could have proved he gave me leave to pawn them.</p>

               <p>Jordan. I believe he was, but I believe he did not take so much notice as I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been a man under misfortunes, and have lost a great deal of money. I did not take them with an intent to rob him, or steal them from him, and actually he gave me leave to pawn them.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner applied to some gentlemen of reputation in the law who were in Court. One gentleman said he knew him very well as an Attorney at Stony Stratford , and never heard of any misbehaviour in him. Another had known him seventeen or eighteen years ago, at Carmarthan in Wales, that he afterwards lived with Mr. Hayward an Attorney in Salisbury-court, and that he had then a very good character, and never heard any ill of him. A third said he was surprised to see him in these circumstances, that he knew him Clerk to Mr. Hayward, and that he always behaved well. <rs id="t17440404-22-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Prisoner was destitute of a place, and I employed her as a chairwoman, out of compassion, till she could get a better place. She was with us about three weeks. On the 23d of February she came between six and seven o'clock in the morning, in order to light the fire. I said who is that, Betty? She said yes, Madam. I asked her what o'clock it was, and she said between 6 and 7. I was in bed on the same floor, and gave her the key of the bed room for her to come into the dining room. - She could not get into the dining room without coming into the bed room; and she took that opportunity to rob me of these things. - Most of the things were in a chest of drawers, the spoons and some other things were lying in the room. I arose between eight and nine and went into the dining room, and found all these things missing, and that she was gone. I went to a neighbour to acquaint him with it, and he advised me to advertise it. The next day I put out an advertisement with two guineas reward, and the Monday following she was apprehended by a man in St. Martin's-lane by Charing-cross. My petticoat, shift, stockings, gown, cloak and bonnet, were taken from her by the Constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Brooks. She was so good as to tell me where they were pawned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you give me these things to pawn?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I deny it, I never gave you any leave to do it; if I had, I would not have made any noise about it.</p>

My master not being very well, the order was brought to me; and upon telling them over I found 300 short of the number. I went immediately and told my master the number was short; and from that time the Prisoner absconded my master's service. My master took him in Lincoln's-inn fields, and he owned before Justice Poulson, that he took the books out of the house. [Some of the books were produced.]</p>

               <p>Beckles Booth. I was standing under the piazzas on the southside of the Royal Exchange, 31st of March, to hear the proclamation of war. I thought I felt something twitching at my pocket. I felt in my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone. The Prisoner was standing within half a yard of me, with his hand in his breast, and endeavouring to get into the crowd. Seeing him in that suspicious manner, I seized him by the hand with my handkerchief in his hand. Upon which I pulled him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174404040015"/> along, and carried him cross the Exchange. The mob desired me to commit him to their management; which I did not care to do. I carried him to the Amsterdam coffee house, with my handkerchief in his hand, but could not readily get a Constable; but on Monday he was committed - The Prisoner said he found the handkerchief on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to see war proclaimed, and found the handkerchief upon the stones. I held it up, and called out two or three times whose it was; and kept it in my hand three or four minutes, but no body owned it.</p>

He has served me faithfully, justly, and honestly; and behaved well in my house. I go to bed about nine o'clock, and always see my apprentices to bed first. Please to ask Mr. Booth, if he did not desire the Alderman to commit him to Bridewel.</p>

             knocked me down; then he tore my apron off my sides, and took my pocket with five or six shillings in it - I knew him when he came up to me - I have seen him several times - He had a room in the next house to my mother's, that came over her shop - It was pretty light, it was neither light nor dark - It was not so dark as to want the light of the lamps - I knew him after I got up again . I did not know him at first. After I got up I said , Pray Mr. Carberry don't meddle with me. And he beat me, and said, you B - h, I will knock your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Milward. No, Sir - I complained of it about three or four days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not take him sooner?</p>
               <p>Milward. Because I could not take him - I had known him in that neighbourhood about three or four months - After he had robbed me he run away directly - He did return to his habitation again, but when I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it two days, or did he return the next day?</p>
               <p>Milward. I can't tell whether it was the next day, or the fourth day - I believe he was taken up upon the account of Justice Willoughby's being knocked down on Tower-hill; and there was a report that he did it - He went on board of ship after that - I complained to Justice Dennet three or four days after the robbery; and he sent a warrant for him, and he broke out backwards, and got away - He had been seen before that, but it was only in the night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did not you cry out stop thief?</p>
               <p>Milward. If I had, no body would have taken him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not do any thing to you. You run away as soon as I said to you, You B - h, you are one of them that robbed me last night.</p>
               <p>Milward. He did rob me - I knew him by the light of the day - There are several shops there.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you cry out?</p>
               <p>Milward. I made a great noise; but when the people saw who it was, they shut their doors, they were afraid of him, he is so desperate a fellow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The night before this happened, another midshipman and I went into the bawdy-house which is kept by her or her mother, and we drank pretty freely. She took a laced hat and 2 guinea from this gentleman, and three shillings and six-pence from me. Said I, my girl, you have got a guinea from this gentleman, and a laced hat. She said she knew nothing of it. They had stripped us so, that we had not money to pay our reckoning. And then they and their bullies sell upon us so, that we had like to have been murdered. There were a matter of sixteen whores of them together. So the next day, about three o'clock, I met this girl, and said, You B - h, you are one of the whores that robbed me last night. And so she charges me with robbing her.</p>

            . The Prisoner has lodged in a room over my head since last Michaelmas, he came into my house in the middle of the day, with a woman he calls his wife, and he and my daughter had some words; he came bodily into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by bodily?</p>
               <p>Milward. He came with a great stick, and he gave me a blow upon my arm, that I had like to have lost the use of it - it was the day the warrant was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What upon your daughter's affair?</p>
               <p>Milward. No, that was the last thing he did, it was upon the account of a quarrel, it was all within a day or two of one another; he came again about six or seven at night. I asked who was there, I believe he changed his voice, said my daughter, that's Carberry's voice. God forbid, said I, but I opened the door, in he came with two pistols in his hands , and a cuttean cross his month. My daughter hid herself behind the back door, and I got out of his fight, but I stood so that I could see what he did. He was in a great passion, and broke the chairs, shelves and things to pieces: there was a lad going by with a link, he got the link from the lad, laid about with one of the pistols, and broke the windows till he was tired with that. Then he took his stick and laid about with one and the other, and broke all the glasses and several bottles of small beer. And at the same time there was a mob of 100 people about the door. - There was a great mob, he threw the goods out into the street, and I went and picked up what I could, for I thought I had better have them than not, and he came out several times before all the people, and no body dared to meddle with him. Then he searched for my daughter and found her, he put a pistol to her breast and said, D - n you you B - h, if you speak a word you are a dead woman. Then he took a box with all these goods and money in it, and put it out at the window, his wife and the landlady he lives with were at the outside of the window, and took the box entirely away, and they carried it up stairs into his own house. And he not only took away all my things, but cut my clothes off my back in the street. The next day I got a warrant from Justice Jones, and I told the Constable what a dangerous man he was, but he could not take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you got the Constable here?</p>
               <p>Milward. No; Justice Dennet said there was no occasion for him. The Governor of the Tower (I think it was the Governor) sent the whole grand guard, and as they came into the house he got over Esquire Willoughby's garden. - One that he was supposed to be a highwayman about, and so got off. - How he came to be taken I cannot tell, but I think he was taken upon suspicion of robbing Capt. Pidgeon.</p>

She adds, that after he had done a great deal of mischief, in beating and abusing them and breaking the windows, he asked if they had any thing to drink, that not having any thing he went up into his own room, came down again, and then broke the shelves and every thing all to pieces. She says, that the people were afraid of him, that she sent to the Constable and Watchmen too and they would not come, and that the watch was not set; that she could have brought a great many people to have proved this, but the Justice said there was no occasion for any body but her mother and herself.</p>

            . Monday, the 5th of March, I lost this coat out of the stable. I went to supper about nine o'clock, and left the lad in the stable; and I went back into the stable about ten o'clock, and my coat, waistcoat, and great coat were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not a large dog in the yard?</p>
               <p>Croon . Yes - he always does bark at strangers - I don't know the Prisoner - I know no body can get into the stable, without 'tis somebody the dog knows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gillman. I lodge at Mr. Matthews's , and was in the shop when the Prisoner brought in the coat. The advertisement was read, and nothing could be painted more exact than this. I advised Mr. Matthews to stop the Prisoner, and go to Mr. Caswell's. The Prisoner would have gone away. I said, Friend, you must not go; you must go to Mr. Caswell's. He said he bought it for eight shillings, that he was then very much in liquor, and did not know the man he bought it of. - To tell you the truth, Sir, said he, I was dead drunk, and don't know the house where I bought it ; but afterwards he said, he had it of one Newman, who was servant to Mr. Caswell. I asked him, if he knew of any of the rest of the things. He said, he did not know any thing of them, I spoke to the Justice to have the house searched where he lived, and he ordered the door to be broke open. And then the Prisoner, rather than have the door broke open, pulled a key out of his pocket; and then he said they were in his room, and they were sent for; and these clothes were brought, which I judge to be the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I discover that I had the clothes, before the butler?</p>
               <p>Gillman. I can't tell what you said to the butler, but before me you said you knew of no more than that numerical coat which is there produced.</p>

             . I have known the Prisoner three years , he always was esteemed a very honest man, and I would entrust him with my property, notwithstanding this affair . I was informed that Mr. Newman was suspected of taking the clothes; and I did endeavour , on the behalf of the Prisoner, to get Newman taken up. I went to Mr. Caswell, and told him, it was hard an innocent man should suffer, when the principal might be taken; and desired Mr. Caswell to let somebody belonging to him make an information of this fact before the Justice, in order to get a warrant to take up the principal: but I could not get his assistance, and I could not get a warrant to take him up.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. Caswell replied, That he did apply to the Justice to grant a warrant to take up Newman; but that the Justice did not think proper to grant it for the reason, that if goods are found upon a person, and a warrant was to be granted upon their information, every one would say the goods were brought to them, and by that means every person might be acquitted.</p>

            . I took the Prisoner into my house some time ago, as an object of distress (he had been abroad some years for such unhappy doings as this) out of regard to his family, hoping he would not do so again, and trusted him with the key of my chamber. But thought he was very poor, all on a sudden he had money, silver buckles, and other things. Said I, Jacob, you have committed a robbery, not thinking of myself; but my wife missed a cambrick apron, and upon that I looked farther, and missed thirteen pound. Then I told him he had robbed me. He was very much surprised at first, but some time afterwards he said, If I am hanged there's an end of me, for I can die but once; and if I am transported, I shall go from whence I came, and you may do your worst. He owned he took the goods, but did not own he took the money.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will consider him. He has a very honest family, and a good honest old mother. <rs id="t17440404-35-verdict193" type="verdictDescription">
