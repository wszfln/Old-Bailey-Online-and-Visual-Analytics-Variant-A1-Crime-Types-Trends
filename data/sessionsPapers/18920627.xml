                  </hi>. I hold a master's certificate, and have done so upwards of eighteen years—on 13th March last I was master of the steamship <hi rend="italic">Roxburgh Castle</hi>—I had been so for twelve months—on 12th March, 1891, I left Newport, Monmouthshire, with a cargo of coal in bunkers, for the Piraeous—I had a crew of twenty-four, all told, consisting of myself, first and second officers, three engineers, two stewards, a coos:, six seamen, carpenters, and a boy—I took a pilot as far as to the Wash</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270004"/>
               <p>—up to that time we had strong weather from the N. E., with snowstorms, clear at intervals up to about 13th. of May—at 1.20 a.m. we were off the Seven Stone Lightship—the weather was then moderating down, and became fine; there was a good sea to begin with, when the wind veered round to S. E.—I was on deck all day; after 1.20 I went below till the morning at eight—after that I was on deck all day—I went below again at 7.30; at that time the weather and sea was moderate—I went into the saloon—at 9.15 I heard an unusual noise on deck, a sort of crackling—I ran on deck, and as soon as I got on deck I heard a heavy crash; it was dark, and I had just come out of the light, and I did not see any vessel; if I had been used to the dark I might have seen it—we came into collision with another vessel—the chief officer was coming off the bridge, and I spoke to him—the spars were all flying about—I ascertained that we had been run into on the starboard side; having ascertained that I returned to my cabin—I called the steward and the boy, and went on deck at once—I found all hands there except the chief engineer—I then looked into the engine-room, and gave certain orders—about two minutes after hearing the crash part of the stern on the starboard side was under water—after I got forward on the bridge the mainmast had fallen over—we had two lifeboats on board, fore and starboard, also a gig and cutter—I gave an order in reference to the starboard lifeboat; the second officer said it had been cut in two by the collision—I saw that the gig and cutter were under water—I then gave certain orders in reference to the other lifeboat, and she was got ready to be swung; we could not swing her on account of the stay being outside the davits—we lowered her into the chocks again—all hands tried to get in her, I among them, and tried to float her; it was the only chance we had; the ship turned over and sank, and the boat sank also, and all hands went down with the ship—I should say from the time of the collision till she sank was a quarter of an hour—I came up to the surface, and got hold of a spar or an oar, or a bit of plank—I could hear the cries from all who went down—there was only one other man near me—I saw the bright lights of the other ship, and swam towards her—she was a sailing vessel—she had lights over the bows to see the extent of the damage—I was dressed when I went over; I undressed in the water—I had a boatswain's whistle; I made use of that—I should say I was in the water half an hour, it was hard to judge—in my opinion there was no danger whatever to a lifeboat being lowered; not even to a small boat—having got to the vessel, which I afterwards found to be the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi>, some ropes were thrown out, and I was taken on board—I saw Captain Dakin after a time; I asked to see him—he was on the starboard side of the deck, close to where I got on board—I said to him, "For God's sake, captain, put a boat over to save my men"—he replied that he had enough to do to look after his own ship—after that I went into the cabin; the captain went with me—he asked me to remain there to look after the spirit locker, as he was afraid his men would break into it—I remained there till twelve o'clock—I was exhausted; I had two cuts, my head was knocked about, and I was laid up after I got home—the captain gave me some clothes—when I came up at twelve o'clock I went on the poop; I thought I was no good in the cabin; the captain and the men were going in and out to get provisions—I said there was no use in my staying</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270005"/>
               <p>there, and I went on the poop—after I was rescued, and previous to my going into the cabin, I heard cries—we eared one man—I heard no cries after I came out of the cabin—as soon as they saved the one man we went into the cabin—I heard cries for ten minutes; I could not hear what was said, that was when I was below—they were crying, "Save me! save me!"—after the man was got on board I heard no more cries—I was on board when he was rescued; I assisted in rescuing him; his name is Whitelaw, an A. B.; he was on the look-out at the time of the collision—the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi> hailed a steamer between seven and eight next morning, and was ultimately towed into Falmouth on Monday, the 15th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This matter of the collision was the subject of inquiry for two or three days before Mr. Justice Jeune; both ships were found to blame; the <hi rend="italic">Roxburgh Cattle</hi> for not reversing the engines, and the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi> for having defective lights—I believe at the time of that judgment notice was given of a Board of Trade inquiry into this matter—I understood that it was going to be taken to the Admiralty Court first—I have commanded a sailing vessel—our vessel was struck on the starboard side, abaft the engine—our engines are in the middle of the ship, the weakest part—the collision was a violent one—our ordinary speed is nine knots—I could not say at what speed we were going at the time of the collision, because she was on her wind—I had not turned in or undressed—I went below at 7.30, the collision occurred after nine—when I came on deck it was dark—there was not a heavy sea; there was no sea—it was not calm, there was a swell; the day before the S. E. wind was heavy, but the wind had veered to the N. E., and knocked it down—the collision was violent—I turned my attention to my crew and ship—as a captain, the first thins I should do would be to ascertain the extent of the damage—the ship had already been brought to a standstill—her headgear was gone—they might lower down her topsails, and back the main topsail—I should first ascertain the extent of damage, and then take in sails—I afterwards had the opportunity of ascertaining the extent of the damage to the <hi rend="italic">British Peer;</hi> I saw that her bows were stove in, and the stem carried right away; the stem was turned round a-starboard, so that there was nothing to prevent the water getting into the fore-foot—this photograph is a pretty correct representation of it; I have seen it before—the ship was an iron ship; the fore-foot was very small—there was no extra strain on the bulkhead—her register was 1,200 or 1,400 tons—the water had got into (he fore-foot; I did not ascertain that the iron door was open; I ascertained that there was no water in the ship, and that the bulkhead was secured—I knew that the captain had been engaged with men in shoring up the bulkhead—I was not on board this vessel within seven or ten minutes of the collision; I think it was nearer an hour; it was full a quarter of an hour before my ship sunk, and I was in the water certainly more than half an hour—I understood when I was in the cabin that the shoring-up had been done; I made inquiries, and found that the bulkhead was secure; the captain told me so—I am not positive whether he told me about the fore-toot—I did not see the men engaged in cutting away the bowsprit; next morning I saw that it had been cut away; I saw that they were cutting away the headgear next morning—the second officer was aloft with his men—the first thing I said to the captain of the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi> was, "For God's sake, captain,</p>

               <p>put a boat over to save my crew!"—I did not ask him to pat the ship about—I do not know how far I was from the collision at the time my ship went down; I went as far as I could swim, and I was in the water half an hour—I should think we were rather over a quarter of a mile from the ship when she sank; it might be half a mile—the prisoner told me he had enough to do to look after his own ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The only thing to prevent the water getting into the fore-foot would be the bulkhead—if the bulkhead was properly shored up there would be no danger to the fore-foot—as soon as I got into the cabin I asked the captain all particulars—I ascertained that there was no water in the well—one of the crew made a communication to me, and I communicated what he said to the captain, and asked him again if there was any water in the well, end he replied there were nine inches—the ship was not pumped out while I was on board—when I first came up after my vessel sank I judge that the lights of the other vessel were between a quarter and half a mile off—I think she was drifting towards me—as regards the accident to the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi> there was nothing to prevent the lowering of the boats.</p>

I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi>—at the time of the collision I was against the half-deck door—after the collision I went below and passed up some lamps—I could see the light of the ship we were in collision with, I only looked at it for about <hi rend="italic">five</hi> minutes—I was below about a quarter of an hour—after passing up the lamps I came on deck—I received instructions from the second mate and the captain to go and help them to store the boats—I did so, and helped to provision the boats—at the time of the collision I saw the captain on the poop, burning a light—I did not hear him give any directions, there was so much noise—after the collision I heard cries for about five or ten minutes—I did not see the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Roxburgh Castle</hi> brought on board—it was after I came up from getting the lamps that I heard the cries—the captain had then been brought on board—I did not see any attempt made to lower the boats; I was down in the bread-tank—there were four boats; none of them were swung—I saw the <hi rend="italic">chocks</hi> knocked away just after we started to provision the boats; I and several others did it—the captain gave me no instructions to do it—he might have given orders to somebody else—it was rather a dark night, not starlight; should not call it a thick night—I daresay you might see lights a mile off, or more; it was not very thick, it was just murky—I don't know if there had been a boat whether I would have gone in it; I might if I had been asked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it would have been dangerous to lower a boat—I have been at sea three or four years—there was not a heavy sea—there was a great deal of excitement and noise—I did not ascertain where the captain went after the collision—I have been in the four-foot several times—I heard men shouting out that there was water in the fore-foot—I did not see the captain after he was on the poop until we were all working below shoring up the bulkhead—to get into the forefoot we go through a small iron door between decks; if that door was mot fastened the water would get in between decks—some of the men</p>

               <p>went to fasten that door; it had been opened—I did not know that it was open until I saw some of them looking for bolts to get it fixed up, to keep the water from coming in between decks; unless that was done, the water would come in, and nothing could prevent the ship foundering—I was not one of those that went down to shore up; I was passing the things to shore up with—I saw the men engaged in it—I saw that the captain was there—that lasted a good hour, I should think—while they were there I heard the jibboom banging against the side of the ship—some men were ordered to cut it away—5 thought it would have knocked a hole in the ship—I remember the captain of the other vessel coming; on board; that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the collision, or it might be more, I daresay fifteen minutes—I did not see him pulled on board—I saw him on board—it was a good while before I saw him there; but I heard he was on board—the first time I saw him he was in the cabin, and he was bleeding somewhere—I think it was after I heard the cries that the captain ordered me to store the boats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. In my opinion it took an hour to shore up the collision bulkhead; it took six or seven men; the captain was there among them—I think the number of hands, all told, was twenty-nine—in my opinion it was dangerous to lower a boat at the time, because the sea was rather heavy; it was not a rough sea, not a swell; it was rather choppy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine surveyor, a member of the firm of Thompson and Lewis—on 12th March, 1891, I surveyed the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi> at the East India Docks—she was twenty-two years old—the forepeak is 18 ft. long at the main deck, and the depth from the main deck to the bottom would be about 26 ft.—the length of the vessel over all would be about 235 ft.—the stem and all the bow plates were broken right away down from the main deck to within 5 ft. of the keel; that is about 21 ft. was all broken up—the ship had not been temporarily repaired; she was towed up to London; beyond what the sailors had done, only the bulkhead had been strengthened at Falmouth, and sails and other things had been put over the bows; it was an iron bulkhead—the jibboom and bow-sprit</p>

               <p>were broken right off and clean gone, and all the headgear and stays were gone—when she came into London the water in the forepeak was right up level until she was got into dry dock; it could not be pumped out until it ran out itself—the effect of a collision on the collision bulkhead depends on the strength of it; there would be a tremendous strain on the bulkhead as she rises—every time she pitched or tossed the water would rise to pretty well the height of the deck, and the greater the depth of water the greater would be the pressure on the bulkhead—if the door had been open the ship would have filled; no water had got into the cargo.</p>

I was second mate of the <hi rend="italic">British Peer</hi> at the time of her collision with the <hi rend="italic">Roxburgh Castle</hi>—at the time of the collision I was on watch on deck, standing aft on the poop, alongside the chartroom—we were going about 4 £ knots, and the <hi rend="italic">Roxburgh Castle</hi> at about 10 or 11 knots—after the collision the prisoner called all hands on deck, and gave an order to lower away the topsail-halyards and clew up the sails—the effect of that was to keep the vessel stationary near the place of collision—I did not see the damage done to our ship till next day—we lowered the topsail halyards and clewed up, and I went up the topsail-halyards to help them; but before that I went into the forecastle and took off the forepeak-hatch, and had a look down, and saw the forepeak was full of water, and a lot more was rushing in—I think I sang out that she was filling up forward; that was when I was going forward—the next thing I heard the captain singing out for the carpenter and engineer to bring screws and bolts to bolt up the door in the bulkhead leading from the forehatch into the forepeak; the door is 2 ft. above the 'tween deck—the water was flying in then; every time the ship dived she threw some spray, but there was water above the 'tween deck in the foredeck—I did not go down into the forehatch—the chief officer was getting the boats clear for the swinging out—it would have taken between a quarter of an hour and twenty minutes to get the boat ready before we could have lowered it—it was a pretty heavy sea at the time; we had been under our lower topsails till noon that day—in my judgment it would not have been safe at that time to have lowered a boat—if the collision bulkhead had given way, or if the door had been open, the ship would have sunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would not have been safe to lower the lifeboat, because there was too much sea on; it was a pretty heavy sea and a dark night—I think I could have seen lights a mile off—it was a very rough sea; it was not a swell, there was a sea—I do not think a man could have swum for half an hour in that sea and have saved his life—I should have gone in the boat if I had been asked, but I would rather not have been asked—if they had called for volunteers for the boat I should have made a step, but I should not think to have come back alive—I heard some cries for help—I did not see the <hi rend="italic">Roxburgh Castle</hi> go down; I saw her at the time of the collision and for about a minute afterwards—</p>

He has exchanged this for two rice cakes"—the prisoner said, "Don't lock me up"—I said I should have to search him; he said, "You need not, I have got no other money"—I took him into the parlour, searched him, and found eight florins and two sixpences in a little watch-pocket in the band of his trousers, all good—I took the coin to a jeweller and had it tested—the prisoner said, at the station, "I got the coins for carrying a parcel from Adelaide Road for a gentleman; I carry a parcel sometimes three or four times a week; I know the gentleman"—he afterwards said he did not know the gentleman—the inspector asked his address—he said, "I have got no home"—he asked him where he slept last night—he said, "In a lodging-house"—the bottom of Adelaide Road is 300 or 400 yards from where I arrested him, and the top is about half a mile.</p>

On 23rd May, at 11.30, I saw the two prisoners in Pond Lane, a quarter of a mile from Mr. Turvey's, and said, "What are you doing so late at night?"—they said, "We are having a roam round"—I saw them again about 3.30 coming across the fields, carrying something dark between them—they went to a hoarding, and one got over, and in a few minutes returned again—when they saw me they returned in the opposite direction and hurried their pace—I caught them, and asked them what they were doing over the hoarding; they said they went to ease themselves—I met another constable and spoke to him—I took the prisoners to the station and returned to the hoarding, got over, and found seventeen pigeons in a sack; these are three of them—a candle was found on one of the prisoners—they were charged a week afterwards, and Mr. Turvey identified the shirts.</p>

I am a watchmaker, of 78, Tottenham Court Road—on 5th May the prisoner, who I did not know before, came and wanted to pledge a silver Waterbury watch for 12s.—I said that we did not take in pledges, and directed him to the nearest pawnbroker—he then offered me the watch for sale for £1, and said he paid 35s. for it—I said that 308. was the price they were usually sold at—I gave him 15s. for it; it was new—next day he came again with a traveller named Gent, who I had had dealings with, and offered me six Waterbury watches for sale—I said, "You were here yesterday, and said nothing then about having these"—he said, "I only sold that watch then because I wanted to get to know the value"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "I bought them from a dealer"—I said, "Are there any more?"—he said, "Yes, there are about £60 worth"—I said, "What do you want for them?"—he said he would take 17s. 6d. each—I said it was funny, if he sold one for 15s., to raise the price for a quantity—he said he could not take less—I said, "They would not be worth more than 12s., buying a quantity"—he said, "Why, the Waterbury Company would give more than that"—I said, "Why don't you take them there and sell them?"—he said they would not buy them from him, he was not in the trade—I said, "You had better tell me the lowest price you will take, and I will submit the matter to them"—he said he would take 5 per cent, less, but 17s. 6d. was the price—I said, "Who am I to buy them from, you or Mr. Gent?"—he said, "You will buy them from Mr. Gent"—Mr. Gent</p>

"You had better come with me to the Waterbury Company and get the money"—he said, "You said you would pay for the watches"—I said, "Yes, but the "Waterbury Company are buying them, and you must come there to get paid for them; here is your cab at the door, we can quickly get there"—he took the watches and went with me, and on the* way he said, "They won't do anything to me for having the watches?"—I said, "Well, if you got them honestly you have nothing to fear"—he said, "I bought them and paid for them"—I asked who he got them from—he said, "From a man over the water"—I said, "Well, we will get paid for these, and then we will go and get the remainder,"because he said there were £60 worth altogether—he said, "Well, you can't get them to-day, because the man is out of town; when we get there I shall say I got them from Gent"—I said, "You will do nothing of the sort; you will say where you got them from"—on arriving at Snow Hill I saw Mr. Pindar first, and afterwards introduced the prisoner—we went away, and returned in an hour, and saw Mr. Pindar and Mr. Rankin—Pearce was present—the prisoner said he bought the watches that morning of a man named Farrell outside the General Post Office—I am quite sure he said "that morning"—he said he knew the man, but did not know where he lived, and had no receipt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He gave no name on the first day, and I did not ask him for one on the second—I believe Gent is a respectable man; he is traveller for a firm which I deal with—I have bought watches before of men who came in in a casual way, but not Waterbury ones—he told me that Mr. Gent was going to get half-a-crown out of each watch, and if I did a certain amount of business he would give me the half-crown instead of Gent—I put the watches behind my counter, and we went off to the Company together—Pearce and another officer were there—I did not ask him Farrell's address—I only bought one watch.</p>

Farrell, who I met outside the General Post Office bout 10.30 this morning, for £17"—I said, "Do you know where Farrell lives?"—he said, "I don't know his address; it is somewhere in Newington Causeway"—I said, "We are police-officers, and shall take you in custody for receiving watches knowing them to have been fraudulently obtained"—he repeated his statement, and added, "Farrell told rue he had bought up a lot of watches cheap, and asked me to buy them at 12s. 6d.; I agreed to buy them; I have sold only one to Mr. Lock, for which he paid me 15s."—I asked if he could find Farrell—he said, "I can take you to him; I do not know his address; it is somewhere in Newington Causeway"—we started to find Farrell, and in Aldersgate Street he said, "Well, the whole thing is blown; I may as well <hi rend="italic">come the lot;</hi> we must go to Donald's Road, Highbury"—I understood that to mean that he would tell me all he knew—we went there to No. 27, where his father</p>

I am an oilman, of 23, Shaftesbury Place—on Monday evening, 23rd May, I met the prisoner in the King's Arms about nine o'clock, and left with him about 10.20, and walked to Shaftesbury Place—we passed the bottom of Maidenhead Court, but not through it—the prisoner then proposed boxing, and George Negus went and brought a pair of boxing gloves—Fred Negus put on one pair, and the prisoner the other—they were boxing about twenty minutes, and a constable and Hodgson came up the place—Hodgson said, "That is one of them,"and with that the prisoner ran up the place, and the constable followed him to the door where he lived, and asked for him—he said, "Are you going to take me for boxing?"—he said, "No"—I did not hear the constable tell him the charge, because they were in the passage.</p>

I did live at 12, Mead Street, Bono, but hare moved, and am now working at a public-house—on 26th May last I was out of work—I have known Briggs about' a fortnight—I was with him on 26th May—I met him in Brown's public-house about half-past six in the evening—Munro was with him, and a man they call"Hearthrug"—we went to the North Pole public-house in the New North Road, and then went for a walk round by the Agricultural Hall—opposite the hall there was an old gentleman going past, wearing a watch and chain—Briggs said to me, "You take his watch and chain and run away, and I will knock him down"—I said, "No; I expect to have work soon"—we then took a turning to the left into Essex Road, where there is a bridge over the canal—we stood there talking—I had my back against the parapet of the bridge—Briggs was standing in front of me, and he took me up by the waist and threw me over the bridge—I thought he was only larking, and I laid hold of the bridge with my hands; he knocked my hands off, one at a time, with his own hands, and I went down into the water—it was a drop of seventeen feet from the parapet—I can't swim; I tried to get out, and halloaed as loud as I could, and a lady who was there halloaed out as well—it awoke a man who was in a barge there, and he came and got me out—I had gone under water twice—I was taken into a public-house, and while I was there a policeman came in—later the same night, about half-past two, I went to Munro's house, and then to Briggs's lodgings in Hoxton, with a policeman—he was in bed (it was about eleven when I was thrown over the bridge)—the policeman told him what he wanted him for—he said, "I don't know the man; I don't know anything about it; I don't know what you mean."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">OBERT JOHN MARKS</hi>. I am a director of the <hi rend="italic">Sunday Telegraph</hi> Company, Wine Office Court, Fleet Street—the prisoner came there in answer to an advertisement, and I arranged to give him 20 per cent, commission for canvassing for orders—I paid him £8 7s. 6d. for six insertions—this receipt, "Received on account of commission 30s., Thomas J. Hart,"it his writing—I sent this monthly statement to Mr. Brookman, and in consequence of the reply my manager wrote to the prisoner at 2, Wilmington Square, Clerkenwell—he absented himself from the office as near as possible on February 27th, just after the last payment—it was his duly to come every day—I wrote a letter to him at Wilmington Square—it was the address he gave, and it came back through the Dead Letter Office marked, "Gone away; address not known"—this is it—two letters have been returned through the Dead Letter Office—he never came back—I thought it <hi rend="italic">was no</hi> good instituting proceedings, but when I found he had been caught I came forward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He might come and go when he liked; if he found a better opportunity he could leave me—the receipt does not specify what the commission related to; 13s. of it related to this; it was for orders—the document was put in at the Police-court—I did not know at that time what the balance referred to—he was overpaid, and if he had remained another month no commission would have been due to him—during the time he was with me he was entitled to £3 7s. 6d. commission—I produce a receipt for £2 10s.; the balance is not in his favour; he has been paid, but the receipt is mislaid; I should have to call a witness to prove the other payment—he brought the orders to me two or three times, and said, "I have got these."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. He told me he had seen Mr. Brookman several times—I cannot carry all the orders in my mind, but if I refer to my books I can tell.</p>

I am an indiarubber stamp manufacturer, of 11, Hand Court, Holborn—early in this year the prisoner called on me two or three times for advertisements—on 30th January I gave him a verbal order for fifty-two insertions, but I altered it to twenty-six; it was originally "at 1s. "but a "1"has been put in, making it 11s.—I received an invoice for £2 2s. for four insertions; I was rather surprised, and wrote immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I represent the Cavendish Estate Company, 27, Chancery Lane—I employed the prisoner from March 14th at a canvasser on commission—we are agents for Day and Co., who have a system of advertising lavatory tablets—on 14th April I found this document on my table, with the prisoner's writing in blue: "I have gone to Horton's, these people are O. K. as far as I know"—that was on the Thursday before Good Friday, when the office was closed—the prisoner came on the Saturday between ten and eleven, and said, "I believe I can get Horton's order this morning; I have been promised it, shall I go and get it?"—Saturday being a short day I said, "Go there, and I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270042"/>
               <p>will pay half your cab fare,"as I did not want to stop at the office—I afterwards received a telegram, and a few minutes afterwards, towards one o'clock, the prisoner came in—I said, "What does this mean: 'Give 100 at 1s. 3d. '?"—he pulled out the order and said, "This is what it means 'Give' is 'Five, and the amount 500 at. 1s. 3d."—I believed that to be a genuine telegram—this is the order he gave me: "Messrs. Day and Co.,—Please insert our advertisement for twelve months on your patent advertising tablets; to occupy small space at 1s. 3d. per tablet per annum. Hart and Co., Bays water. One hundred are put up and checked"—he told me hat that was Pay's order—I paid him his commission for it on Tuesday, the 19th, £1 in gold, and laid out 6s. for him for a hat, at his request—this is his receipt—that was on account of Horton's order—if Horton's order had been genuine it would have been £31 5s., and he would have been entitled to 31s. 3d.—he asked me to leave the rest, so that at. the end of the quarter he would have something to draw upon—I passed the order to Day and Co.—on 21st April the prisoner gave me this piece of paper containing Horton's advertisement, with something scratched out, and said, "This is the advertisement Horton gave me for the tablets"—Messrs. Day sent ma this postcard: "Messrs. Day and Co. In reference to postcard received last night, Mr. Horton left here more than a year ago"—I then asked the prisoner what he meant by handing in wrong orders, or <hi rend="italic">bogus</hi> orders—he looked <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much confused, and trembled, and acknowledged them to be bogus orders—I said, "I shall have nothing further to say to you till I have communicated with your father"—on 13th April this order came from Day and Co.: "Please insert our advertisement for twelve months on your patent advertising tablet holder at £1 4s. 6d. per annum—George Cook; and a similar advertisement to appear on the same frame"—he handed me this cutting at the same time. (<hi rend="italic">An advertisement of a skilled detective</hi>)—that was for £75 worth of advertisements—I believed it to be genuine, and paid the prisoner £2 8s. on the 13th—I did not take a receipt because I paid him outside the bank in Threadneedle Street—he said he would hand me a receipt, but he did not—I passed the advertisement on to Day and Co.—I said to the prisoner on Monday, "I want Cook's proof returned"—it was set up in type and sent to Cook in due course, and an answer came—I said to Hart, "Go and see about that advertisement"—he went, and said that Cook was away in Manchester, and his letters were being forwarded to him—I then made inquiries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I received no money from Cook over this—our commission on the £75 would have been 20 per cent.; we drew 10 per cent, of it, not knowing the order to be fictitious—Day and Co. were not my employers; the money I paid the prisoner was my own—I have not got the original telegram here to show whose writing it is—the prisoner acknowledged the order to be <hi rend="italic">bogus</hi>, or words to that effect, and I have a letter here from him acknowledging his folly—I have managed a business at 41, Eastcheap—I never carried on business at Brighton; I was a tutor there preparing young men for the Army examinations—I am Dr. Selig; I have never gone by the name of Henry, or advertised as Dr. or Mr. Henry, or as Professor Horace—I never went to the shop in Archer Street till the night before last; I did not go to see the prisoner's father—I wrote to him, and asked him to call on me under the name of Mr. Stagg,</p>

               <p>so that my employers should not know it; I did not broach the subject of money—I asked him to call because I thought the prisoner was On the threshold of life, and I did not wish to crush him, but to give him a chance, and I have letters from his father thanking me for my kindness—I believe I first took criminal proceedings on June 2nd; the matter was not found out till May 8th, I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a senior clerk in the Stamping Department of the Royal Courts of Justice—this plan shows the counters and door in the room—tickets are obtained at one end of the room, and the stamping machines are behind boxes at the other part—the £5 die is marked "Royal Courts of Justice"—it is peculiar to these Courts, and is the only one of that character in the kingdom—in the morning Mr. Barker cornea from the Accountant-General's office, and unlocks the dies, which he has locked up the night before—he takes one specimen impression in the specimen-book, to see that the date is right; then he unlocks the tell-tale, takes the number of it in his book, and relocks it after being checked by the senior clerk; I initial it—these are my initials on May 12 and 13—Mr. Barker then goes away, and the business of the office begins—that is the usual course, and it was pursued on May 13th—people buy tickets at the counter, and pay for them, take them to the screen, and hand them over, with the deeds, to be stamped—no stamper ever receives money; there is a rule against his doing so—the tickets are numbered and issued and handed in consecutively—they are torn from a book—if a person wants a document stamped with a stamp for which we have no actual denomination, he hands in the document and ticket to me, and I pass it to the stamper with a covering</p>

The prisoner said he did not, and did not recollect anything about the counting of the tickets, and he had never had any money since he had</p>

               <p>been in the office"—<hi rend="italic">risk</hi> money is money paid for a particular post where there is a liability to pecuniary loss—that risk money comes out of the public purse—£15 a year is paid as risk money to our stamps department—it has never been £50—that is paid because there is a possibility of mistake, but it is intended to cover loss that might occur in giving change—it is not in writing—the £ 15 has never been left at the end of the year—mistakes to the extent of £15 a year are not made by the stampers—I have not here the books from which the tickets are taken——if a £5 ticket was taken on Tuesday and not brought to the stamper's desk till Friday it would not affect the machine; it would affect the accounts; there would be a surplus of £5—there is no counterfoil in the, ticket-book—the only way of checking the tickets in the box is from the register number on them—it has never happened to the £5 machine that someone has next morning brought back a ticket which has been taken out by mistake, and had a stamp impressed—to the £1 machine it has happened, but not often—if you came to get a document stamped and paid £5, and afterwards discovered it only required a £1 stamp I should nave no power to give you back the £4; you would apply to the Commissioners—in the office, besides the stampers, are Mr. Keates, Mr. Neilson, Mr. Weaver, Mr. Lomax, Mr. Gayford (who I don't think was there then), they never touched the stamping machines—they were in the rooms where the machines were, and there was no physical obstacle to prevent them touching the machines—I cannot say that the clerks have not frequently used these stamping machines—a £30 stamp would require six impressions—I cannot say if we made a mistake about a £80 stamp some time ago—I don't remember someone coming and saying he had paid £10 and the document had only been impressed with two £1 stamps instead of with two £5 stamps—clerks have gone to the boxes where the tickets are <hi rend="italic">kept</hi>, and taken them but and sorted them to see if there has been a mistake—the tickets are counted just before four o'clock, closing-time—very likely a person is often called away from counting by a person who wants a document stamped—about the middle of this very day the prisoner put on a £5 stamp by mistake, and a very extraordinary thing it was too—the document was handed in at the £1 window, and he went to the £5 machine—it was before 3.30, and it was rectified that day, as far as I recollect—I do not suggest that the prisoner received any money for it; I only say it was an extraordinary mistake to go to the wrong machine—I am responsible for mistakes; it does not matter to him—I have to find the money—I have my own opinion about whether he did it intentionally—it is just the point what good it would do him—he simply said in explanation that he had put a £5 stamp on—I was obliged to be satisfied with that—I could not help saying I accepted the prisoner's explanation as to the £5 and £1 stamp as satisfactory—the indicators of the machines never go wrong, but they stamp imperfectly sometimes—we cannot give a second stamp when the first is imperfect; we get it rectified at Somerset House ether the numbers come in regularly at each window depends on the persons who take the tickets—I suggest that they come in regularly at the £5 machine, because it is so seldom used—it is possible that a solicitor's clerk would come in just before lunch-time, take a ticket, and men come back at three o'clock with the document and ticket, other tickets having been issued in the meantime—a notice is printed on the</p>

               <p>tickets that they are to be produced at once—they used a long while ago to be frequently taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. My experience as to people taking tickets and coming back with them after lunch is that they do not prefer two journeys for what they can do in one—the prisoner's error as to the £5 for the £1 stamp I rectified on the same day, and notified it in my account—that error was about the middle of the day, I believe—Barker comes to clear up as near four as possible—he cannot tell the numbers till the doors are closed to the public—we keep a record of tickets that have been taken out and not brought back—I never remember such a thing as an. outstanding £5 ticket, and I have been in the office since it was established in 1879—risk money has nothing to do with the value of the impression of the dies; it is to make up losses in giving change, which is the fault of the cashiers, not of the stampers.</p>

The prisoner was not always at the £5 stamp; if he went out for a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> minutes and a £5 stamp was wanted, the next senior to him would take his place—if the other stampers were busy, a clerk from the other part of the office would not stamp it; it is impossible for anybody except with technical experience to put the stamp on parchment—one of the other stampers would do it—I do not appoint these clerks or pay them, but I am responsible for them so far as money is concerned—each stamper has a little box by the side of his machine, into which he puts the tickets for the stamp, and they are there till they are counted and put on the file—if he is out for a minute or two there is nothing to prevent any other stamper from going to the box and taking out a ticket; all the stampers have access to the box, which is open—we only hold a stamper responsible for the tickets issued to him; he does not initial them to show they have come to him; we should not get through the work if he did—there is no proof that the ticket has gone into anybody's hands, only that it is on the machine in an open box—Evans counted the tickets in this case—the junior generally counts the whole of the tickets on each machine—another man counts the tickets for which the prisoner is responsible, and marks them—in this case the prisoner counted them himself.</p>

I am the junior stamper in the Stamping Office at the Royal Courts—after 1.30 on Friday, 13th May, the stampers in the office were Lant, the prisoner, and myself—either the prisoner or Lant was at the £5 press that afternoon—between three and half-past that afternoon I counted the tickets, which were in an open box beside the press—I found 18—I put them on the file, and marked 18 on this top one—I then went away from the box for a moment—about ten minutes to four I went again to where the £5 press and the tickets on the file were—the prisoner was standing by the press—I found one ticket on the side with a hole in it similar to the hole made by the file—I asked the prisoner, "Who has been playing about with the tickets?"—he said he did not know—I asked him to count them, and I saw him do so, and he said, "There, are eighteen here, and one at the side here makes 19"—I put them on the file, and put 19 on the top—I was there next day when the prisoner asked for leave and went away—subsequently I made a communication to Mr. Keates, and on Monday I was sent for to Somerset House, where I made a communication <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mr. Purcell—the prisoner was sent for—Mr. Purcell asked me what I knew about the tickets, and I told him I counted the tickets a little after three, and found 18; that I put them on the file, and marked them; that when I went again about ten minutes to four there was one lying by the side, with a hole in it; that I called the prisoner's attention to it, and he counted them as 18, and said, "One by the side there makes 19"—the prisoner said, "It is quite right what Evans says"—Mr. Purcell said, "You denied it just now"—the prisoner said he did not think he did—I did not receive £5 in gold from anyone that afternoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite sure I did not use the £5 Press that afternoon—I saw Lant use it—I have been in Her Majesty's service since July, 1882—I have been in this department at the Law Courts since the beginning of April this year—since that time mistakes have occurred in counting the tickets at the end of the day, but they are corrected before we go—When we go to the window to serve a person there is something to prevent other people in the office from seeing what takes place—I have found out since I was at the Police-court that unless you are standing at the window you cannot see—I swore at the Police-court: "When any of us go to the window there is nothing to interrupt the view of the others, and it can be seen what he is doing"—<hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot look over the partition; it is about 6 ft. high—I am still in the service; I have not been suspended—we have been talking about it among ourselves; I noticed at the time I had made a mistake—it was a.</p>

               <p>mistake to say, "I should think that if any of my colleagues took money through the window I could see him"—I desire to say that unless you are near the man you would not see anything—I do not desire to change my statement that "I did not see the prisoner take any money at all that day"—I have been working with Mr. Keates every day since this; I have not discussed my evidence with him; I should say no one called my attention to it—I have not changed my evidence in consequence of something said to me—tickets are sometimes brought to the window not in consecutive order—other clerks in the office come through occasionally—only a door, which is occasionally open, divides their department from ours—I work the handle of either the £1, 10s. or £5 stamp—it does not require technical knowledge to pull the handle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When stamping parchment a piece of silver foil and an escutcheon are put on after the skin has been rubbed with pumice stone, and little slits made with a knife—a stamper has to do that; we mostly understand it—I did the same work nine or ten years ago in the Stamping Department at Somerset House—I cannot say whether Lant worked the £5 stamp that afternoon—I swear these figures are in the prisoner's writing—I have known £5 tickets brought to the window out of their order—when anyone goes to the window there is nothing to interrupt the view of others; but if he is away from the window he cannot see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the officer from the Accountant-General's office, who unlocks the dies in the morning and locks them up at night in the Stamping Office of the Royal Courts—I record the number of the tell-tale of the stamps in the evening—on the 12th I recorded the last number of the die as 5,066—on the morning of the 13th I unlocked the tell-tales, and the number was then 5,066—I took this one specimen stamp in the specimen-book, locked up the tell-tale, and came away—when I went back in the evening the tell-tale number was 5,145, which made out that 79 impressions had been made by the die during the day, and less the one specimen, it was 78 chargeable with duty, or £390—I agreed in the usual course, the figures on the £5, with one of the stampers, who to the best of my belief was the prisoner—I cannot say I saw him make the figures out—as a rule similar papers are made out and placed on the top of each file—the senior stamper makes out the file, and agrees with me for the whole of the stamps—the senior agrees not only his own lot of papers, but the other three lots—he agrees with me the total number of tickets, and the amount of charge raised—he adds the covering receipts to the number of tickets, moneys them oat, and calls out to me the amount of duty, which he finds according to the tickets—on the 13th I made out this document, showing the amount of charge raised against each press—as to the £5 press, he would call to me</p>

               <p>that the amount that day was £390, and I would call out "agreed,"and the next day the tickets are gone through.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are six machines, each of a different value of stamp—it is the senior man's duty to work at the £5 stamp—I do not hold him responsible for the other five, but he accounts to me for everything—there is no one to whom I should say with respect to the 10s. machine, "You alone shall use that machine"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stamper in this office—on 13th May the only stampers there were Evans, the prisoner, and myself—Thomas had gone at 1.30—I worked the £5 press that afternoon—none of the clerks who issue tickets came round at the back by the dies that afternoon to my knowledge—I have seen then coming round by the back of the dies, but not many times—that has been when there was great pressure of work—I have never seen them touch the £5 die—I do not think there was any great pressure on the 13th to necessitate anything of that kind, and I do not think we had any assistance from the clerks on the 13th—I certainly did not receive £5 in gold from anyone on the afternoon of 13th May—next day Mr. Keates called me to count the file—I counted them over and handed them to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nobody is told off distinctly to each machine—the senior man can go to the £3 10s. or £5 machines and use them indiscriminately, but he has instructions to stick closely to the £1 and 10s. machines—I work the 10s. machine, and did so on this morning—the tickets are thrown into the box—I remember last year a boy coming from Vyse's to have three documents, I think, stamped with £30 stamps—there should have been six impressions with the £5 stamp—by mistake six £1 impressions were made instead of six £5 impressions—that was found out about a week afterwards—I understood that the cashier was supposed to have received £30; I know nothing of the cash balance of £24—I receive a ticket for every stamp I give—I have never known a stamp impressed on a document for which cash has not been paid in the first instance—mistakes occasionally occur in the counting of tickets—only a door, which is generally open, separates the clerks from the stampers—when there is nothing to do in the office we walk to and fro, not from one room to the other—sometimes the clerks come through and speak to us if they have nothing to do—some of the clerks go out in the course of the day, and then the work must be done by the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Assistant-Comptroller of stamps at Somerset House—I was there with Mr. Keates and Mr. Purcell when the prisoner was had up and asked questions—Mr. Purcell said to him, "Rowlandson, what do you know about this £5 deficiency in the accounts?"—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—Mr. Purcell asked him whether he did not remember haying been called on to count the tickets, and questioned by Evans as to whether there were eighteen there instead of nineteen, and he said he did not remember anything about it—I said, "Rowlandson, don't you remember Evans seeing a separate £5 ticket lying on the counter, with a hole in it, and asking you whether anybody had been meddling with the tickets, and asking you to count, and you did count, and saying you counted eighteen tickets besides the one lying on the counter, and that including that there were nineteen?"—the prisoner said he did not remember anything about the occurrence at all—I said to the Comptroller, "I think the only thing to do is to send for Mr. Evans, and let these two men be confronted"—Evans was sent for, and gave his account as to the discovery of the separate ticket, and asking Rowlandson to count them, and Rowlandson saying he made eighteen, without the separate ticket, and on the faith of Rowlandson's counting he (Evans) marked the top ticket, which was the separate one, 19, and put it on the file—the prisoner then said, "I remember all about it"; something to that effect; I believe those were the exact words—I said to him, "How was it, then, you denied all knowledge of this circumstance when Mr. Purcell and I questioned you?"—he said, "I did not deny it when you questioned me"—I said, "You did"—before that, while we were sending for Evans, I said to the prisoner, "Wright has been complaining; to me again of your failure to repay money to him which you borrowed some years ago"-Wright was one of the prisoner's companions in the office, in the same position—he said he had made an effort to pay—I said, "You have not paid anything for twelve months"—he said he had not been able to do it; he had had heavy family claims on him—I also complained to him about another case of borrowing money from a law stationer who was in the habit of going to the Law Courts to get stamps impressed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at 8, Harpington Road, Ealing Dean—in July or August, 1889, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, in consequence of which I wrote to Miss Cullen, Richmond House, Burnt Ash Hill, Lee—I received this letter in reply. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Miss Cullen, who had made the school herself had been there nearly six years, and had sixteen boarders and also day pupils; that her net income was</hi> £400 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> £450; <hi rend="italic">that she wanted someone to join her in taking a second house to increase her accommodation; that she would give one-third of the school, or a fixed income of</hi> £110, <hi rend="italic">with board and residence, the</hi> £110 <hi rend="italic">being made up of salary, interest on capital invested, and a capitation fee on the pupils</hi>.)—I proposed an interview in reply to that letter—I received another letter, and then went and saw the prisoner at Richmond House, Burnt Ash Hill—I said I was anxious to help the education of my younger daughter, as our circumstances were very different to what they had been—she said she did not wish for a partner, as she had made the school entirely herself, and did not wish to be interfered with in any way—at a second interview, at which my husband was present, she was asked whether she had debts of any description—she said, "No, no debts whatever"; her current expenses she paid monthly, so that nothing was owing—the advance she required from us was solely to take a fresh house and furnish it, and, I suppose, leave some balance in hand to begin with—I supplied nearly all the furniture there, and in consequence of that she gave my husband partial board as well as myself—I paid a fee for the children's education—we came to a verbal arrangement, which was afterwards embodied in this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that Mrs. Banner would put her furniture into the new house, and advance</hi> £250, <hi rend="italic">and assist in teaching; that the furniture was to be in her own possession, and removable by her; that the</hi> £250 <hi rend="italic">was to be repayable on demand at any time after October</hi>, 1890, <hi rend="italic">subject to six months' notice by either party; and that she was to be paid as interest for the loan and for services as assistant</hi> £110 15s., <hi rend="italic">in three equal payments, on 1st February, June, and October in each year</hi>)—both I and the prisoner signed that—she. told me her net profits were £400 or £460 a year—my husband sent her a</p>

               <p>cheque for £25 on August 29th, and then I sent her other instalments on September 4th, September 13th, November 2nd, December 9th, and January 11th, 1890, making in all £250—she herself suggested instalments—after the agreement was signed on 17th September I went and lived at Corn-worthy, Burnt Ash Hill, Lee, the other house taken to enlarge the school—it was about five minutes from Richmond House—I lived there till April, 1891—my time for teaching was irregular; it averaged about two and a half hours a day for five days a week—my pupils varied very much; sometimes I had eight—I took different classes—about eight slept in our house—the first payment, due from the prisoner in April, I received in March—of the next, due in June, after considerable pressure, I had a minute instalment, and if balance was paid in October by a dishonoured cheque which was afterwards made good—I received no money after that—I received this letter from her. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that she had deferred sending an answer till the money she was entitled to under her aunt's will was paid; and that she found the expenses were more than she had counted on, and that the school could not stand it, but that fortunately the legacy would free her, and making an appointment to gee Mrs. Banner</hi>)<hi rend="italic">—that</hi> put an end to the agreement—I have not received anything besides the two instalments directly from her—I proved in her bankruptcy, and received £31 odd instead of the £-333 then due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I suppose I had the same dividend as all the other creditors—before bankruptcy proceedings were taken I brought an action against her to recover my money; I think that was in March, 1891; ft was a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> months before bankruptcy proceedings were taken—the £110 15s. per annum was to go on every year, and for that I had lent her £250, and I was to assist in teaching and to manage the house, and be responsible for the well-being of the pupils in it—I and my husband and my little girl lived in the house—I paid £12 a year for her tuition, as much as the other pupils paid, I believe—my husband died while we were there, and the prisoner then took another of my daughters and boarded her, but that was only for a few weeks while I was away to get a change, that she might take my work she left when I came back, but as I was too ill to take my work again she came back, and during that time I paid for my own support—some days I taught for three hours, sometimes only three-quarters of an hour—I took classes one day in the week, and on certain days I took the girls in French—after I was ill my daughter took my place, by the prisoner's permission; she said the pupils liked her better than myself—my daughter who taught was nineteen years old, and had a Cambridge certificate; my younger daughter was sixteen; she only once took my place, I think—I had had no experience of teaching, beyond having taught my own children, and being connected with some Sisters of Mercy, and teaching a little for them before I was married—the Kindergarten system was carried on at Cornworthy—she said she wanted the money to open that branch, and she did it—she took the house immediately after the agreement—at first I wanted her to take a bigger house, and she declined because it would be too expensive—the house she did take was at a larger rent than she wanted to pay; I persuaded her to take it, and I paid the £10 rent extra myself, partly because it would be more convenient to my family and myself—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270063"/>
               <p>she only paid the rent she wished, I made up the difference—I don't know how many pupils there were; every question I asked was met with an evasive answer; I think the number of pupils fluctuated from fifteen to twenty-five; I am not certain; I was kept purposely in the dark—I only taught eight—I cannot tell if the number was never higher than twenty at the other school; I never knew—eight pupils slept at Corn worthy, to. the best of my recollection; sometimes nine; sometimes seven; and governesses slept there too—I may have said before as to the number at Richmond House, "I think there were from fifteen to twenty-five"—I don't know if there ever were less than forty pupils in the two houses—I don't know if my income would have increased with the increase in the school—my chief object in entering into the arrangement was to finish my younger daughter's education, and to find a home for myself—for a year and a half I had board and lodging for me and my daughter—I never ascertained whether there were any pupils there when she began the school; she said she had made it herself, and I believed her—I never knew or saw Miss Crockford till I met her at the Police-court—I heard she was music-teacher at the school, and I believe she gave my daughter a lesson—Mr. Abbott, the solicitor who served the writ for me, first asked me to take proceedings against her, and give evidence at the Police-court—that was in September, and I was put into communication with Messrs. Haynes and Claremont, in consequence of a garnishee order being served on me to pay money to Miss Cullen—in the spring of 1889 Miss Crockford's solicitors tried to attach some debt supposed to be due from me, and then I found the prisoner owed money to Miss Crockford, and that there were other victims besides myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, St. Peter's Road, Mile End—on 18th November, 1889,1 saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, for a lady or gentleman, non-resident, to take a share in a successful school, with good income guaranteed, eight hours' teaching weekly—in consequence I saw the prisoner on 22nd November, 1889, at Richmond House—on the 26th I went again with my father—the prisoner explained that she wanted someone to teach in her school, as she had said in her advertisement—my father said before going into anything he must ask if she had any debts; she said, "No, none whatever, except my tradesmen's monthly bills and salary for governesses for the present term"—my father asked if she had had any such arrangement before, borrowing money in that way; she said no, never; that she had lent money herself to a school and found it answer, and she thought she would try it in her own school—she said she wanted between £200 and £300; £250 was the sum, and for that she offered 5 per cent, interest and a salary to me, as a teacher, of £75 a year—this agreement was subsequently drawn up. (<hi rend="italic">By this Miss Crockford agreed to lend</hi> £250 <hi rend="italic">to carry on the school, and to be repaid on the determination of the agreement; Mitt Cullen to pay five per cent. by half-yearly payments, and to employ Miss Crockford at a teacher on two days a week, and pay her a quarter of the profits of the school, guaranteeing such quarter to amount to</hi> £75; <hi rend="italic">and there was a provision that the letting of two</hi>

(<hi rend="italic">This said that she imagined the payment was due the first week in July, instead of June, but as she had made a mistake she would be glad if Miss Crockford would wait for a fortnight, as she had been paying a good deal out lately, and some heavy accounts for last term were outstanding</hi>)—ultimately I proved in her bankruptcy—I received no dividend—I have only received two payments of £25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe it was said in the bankruptcy that I was not a partner—my father is here—an action was brought on my behalf to recover the money early in 1891—she told me at the time that she required more capital for the school because she had enlarged it recently in the previous September—I knew of Cornworthy House where the little children were; I knew nothing about Mrs. Banner—I said at the Police-court, "I let the prisoner have the £250 as I believed her school was a flourishing one, and that it would be a good investment"—I did not know I was to have a share in the school or that I was a partner at all—I don't know that she insisted that the parents were backward in paying her—she said she did not get money at the end of the term, but only about a fortnight after the beginning of the term; that was why she did not pay me at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last witness; I live at 2, St. Peter's Road, Mile End—in November, 1889,1 went to the prisoner's house—we wanted to know her reasons for requiring the money, and she stated she was desirous of increasing her school, and had taken, or intended to take, another house, and wished to buy furniture and pianos, and she found herself rather short of capital; she stated that some of the parents did not pay punctually; she wanted money in hand, so that she should not be pressed—I asked her particularly if she wanted this money to pay debts, and if she had any debts; she assured me she had not—I pressed her on the point and said, "Surely you have some small debts?"—she said, "I pay my tradesmen and small accounts monthly"—I said I would not lend money if she had any debts; I impressed it on her as much as I could—ultimately I advanced to my daughter £250 for the purpose of her advancing it to the prisoner, as my daughter was desirous of employment; that was my only reason—I wrote some letters and received some—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lent this money to my daughter—I knew she was going to have a share in the profits of the school to a certain extent—the object of getting that share was, as I knew the prisoner had no security to offer, to enforce the inspection of the accounts—after some discussion she offered the lease of the school as security, but I declined it—I knew nothing about the rent—I looked on it that she had no security to offer—she gave very good reasons why she wanted the money—I saw the agreement my solicitor drew up—I did not think anything about whether this would be a good investment; 5 per cent, was no gain to me—I only did it to oblige my daughter—£75 per annum for my daughter was not over-payment—I said if the prisoner wanted it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270065"/>
               <p>to pay off debts, or if she had debts, I should not lend it—I don't know if I expected after that that she would tell me if she had debts—I expected her to tell the truth—I understood by her saying she was not in debt that she did not owe any sums of money she could not pay—I should consider she was in debt if she had borrowed money of other people—I should not understand it to mean that she thought at the time she did not owe money she was not able to pay—I should not draw it so strictly as to mean that she did not owe sixpence to anybody—the matter was explained; she said her accounts were paid monthly, and if two months' accounts were due I should say she was in debt—the first instalment of £25, due by her in June, was paid long after that, and not without a great deal of trouble—the second instalment was paid eventually after a very long delay and the issue of a writ—then about July or August,. 1890, my daughter gave the prisoner six months' notice terminating the agreement; it expired on 14th February—the third instalment became due on the 15th February, 1891—the first instalment was paid on 15th. June, and the second instalment was due four months after 1st or 15th October; that was eventually paid—long before 15th February we had given notice terminating the agreement, but she went on teaching to the end of the term—the third instalment was not paid—on 13th February, before the instalment was due, we brought an action against her to recover the principal; my solicitor acted for us—I see that the writ of 13th February is to recover £250 and interest—I was told judgment was obtained against the prisoner, and then my solicitor garnisheed the debts due from the pupils' parents, and so smashed up the school; having done that, I and others presented a petition in bankruptcy in June, 1891—we could not find her before; she absconded, and took her furniture away at night—when we garnisheed the parents' debts she went to a much larger house in another place at £200 a year rent—when we presented the bankruptcy petition against her we knew she had borrowed money from other people, and we knew it when the garnishee order was made, not before—I did not say at the Police-court: "I believe I first found out that Mrs. Banner had advanced the prisoner money <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> after Christmas, 1890"—it was some time after Christmas, 1890—my deposition was gabbled over to me at the Police-court, and I signed it—it was towards the end of March I first knew it; long before the bankruptcy proceedings we knew she owed several other sums of money—I did not know it before the garnishee order—the proceedings were before 9th April—I have never seen any of the documents, I only know from what my solicitor told me; I did not interfere from first to last beyond giving my solicitors instructions to act—early in April, before I took the bankruptcy proceedings, I saw the prisoner's brother—I don't know if he is a man in a good way of business, or a man of means; I know he has extensive shops—I said I would make his sister bankrupt—I did not tell him if he would not pay these debts I would make her bankrupt—I told him distinctly that we intended to make her bankrupt, and that probably the matter would not end there—a legacy of £500 came to her at Christmas, and she offered to pay money to my solicitor; she played with him for a long time, and then he found that she was encumbering the legacy with moneylenders, and I went and asked the brother to let it come into the bankruptcy, and it had the desired effect—the bankruptcy petition was not till June,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270066"/>
               <p>as we could not find her; she had run away—I went to her brother to persuade him, because he held the money, to keep, the money for the benefit of all the creditors, not myself specially—I did not know of other creditors—I said nothing about seeing him in April—my letter to him fixes the date when I saw him. (<hi rend="italic">Part of the witness's deposition was read, as follows</hi>:—"Early in April I saw Cullen's brother. I said to Mr. Cullen I intended making his sister a bankrupt; I won't swear I did not say, "I will make her a bankrupt unless the matter is settled"; I said probably the matter would not end with making her a bankrupt; I referred to criminal proceedings")—I said he could infer what he liked; it was not at that date—I don't know that the prisoner did execute an assignment of the balance of the £250 legacy to the trustees for the benefit of her creditors—I was only present at one meeting, and never heard it—I know now that after my interview with the prisoner's brother he made an offer of £175 through my solicitors to settle my debt in order to avoid bankruptcy; I knew nothing of it then; I did not know it till the writ had been issued—I might have taken the offer, I cannot say—my solicitors did not submit the offer to me—the bankruptcy proceedings were concluded in September, 1891; I was away at the time—it was not until after the bankruptcy had been closed that any criminal proceedings were commenced against her—I presume she attended at the Court to sign her public examinations, and so on—I was in hopes of finding where our money had gone to, because it was a large sum that was made away with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. My daughter was teaching up to the Christmas holidays—between October and Christmas she was not paid for her services, nor the principal—when the bankruptcy proceedings were instituted I did not know of her debts to Miss Cruickshank, Miss Taunton, or Miss Noel—she informed me of her debt to Mr. Ellis, her brother-in-law; he proved in the bankruptcy, and that was the first intimation I had of it.</p>

Snell and Co., as her solicitors, called on me and offered to give as a security for the debt some charge on a legacy; I accepted it, and the charge was being prepared, and then there was a delay in settling the clauses, and I told them that as I found they were not prepared to give me the mortgage I should proceed to issue execution, which I did—that was in consequence of some disagreements about the terms of this mortgage—the mortgage I wished was simply security for the judgment—it would leave it open to my client to issue execution if necessary, the only question was whether we should have to go to the trouble of finding miss Cullen again to issue another writ—they agreed to pay my costs as between solicitor and client—that having failed, saw the prisoner's brother when le called on me—I did not snow he had seen my client—I never wrote to him until July—he came to see me on April 30th to offer £100 if I would stop the bankruptcy proceedings, which had commenced on 14th April, when I issued the bankruptcy notice—it was not served for a long time, because she could not be found, but it was afterwards served by substituted service—Mr. Cullen never offered me £175 in settlement, I swear—I refused his £100 offer on 30th April—I cannot say whether I refused it on my instructions, or whether I refused it after submitting it to Mr. Crockford—I did submit to him an offer of £100 and £25 costs, made by Mr. Kemble—on 20th June, just before the petition was coming on, the prisoner called and said that her brother would pay me £125, and she could find another £50 from another source—that makes £175—I did not believe it—I declined that offer; I did not submit it to Mr. Crockford—my costs would be nothing—I did not tell her that unless something more was offered criminal proceedings would be taken against her—I did not tell Mr. Cullen that at that date I did not know sufficient facts then to justify criminal proceedings—it was not until 28th July, 1891, that I knew the facts that would justify criminal proceedings—on 31st March I ascertained that the prisoner had borrowed money of Mrs. Banner—she was the only person I knew specifically she had borrowed money from—I could only guess by the difficulty of getting money from her that she was in some difficulty—it must have suggested itself to my mind, I think, that she was in difficult ties when I knew she had borrowed money of Mrs. Banner—it did not suggest itself to my mind when I drew up the agreement that the woman who signed it must be in very great difficulties—I cannot see anything peculiar in the agreement—after I had refuted the offer of £175 I wrote to Mr. Cullen to come and see me—at the first creditors' meeting in July the Official Receiver had rejected my client's proof; about two days after I heard that Mr. Cullen contemplated offering the creditors 10s. in the £, and I wrote asking him to see me, my object being to ascertain, if such a proposition existed, whether he intended to include the disallowed proof—I was not afraid if I did not get the 10s. that it would he said to be my fault for having drawn the agreement is that</p>

               <p>way—Mr. Cullen did not call on me—I saw him at the Greenwich County-court at the prisoner's public examination—I do not think he said he had made an offer in order to avoid bankruptcy proceedings—I will not swear he did not—I cannot say what he said; I do not remember—he did not say that his offer of £175 was more than 10s. in the £; it would be more—the prisoner attended all the public examinations, and came up at the last hearing, a month after the public examination was completed, in order to sign the papers—I don't know if she attended on every occasion she was required; I don't know anything about it—on 8th September, 1891, I first took criminal proceedings—I did not then know that she had gone to Paris to get a situation—she was arrested in Paris by the French police in a situation of some sort there—I wrote on 15th January, 1891, to Mr. Travers, who was a solicitor (I don't know if he has a certificate now), thinking to make him responsible for this debt, because he had been a reference for the prisoner, "The financial position of Miss Cullen as subsequently disclosed, is wholly inconsistent with the state of affairs represented by your letter"—I inferred that her financial position was inconsistent with what had been represented; I had no precise facts before me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I had not ascertained, when I wrote to Mr. Wire, that money was due to Mrs. Banner—at the time, of the negotiations with Mr. Cullen, in April, I had no such information with regard to the borrowing of money as was subsequently disclosed in the bankruptcy; all my information in April, 1891, was gained from an interview with Mrs. Banner's solicitor on 31st March.</p>

In March, 1890,1 saw an advertisement in the Times, and went to see the prisoner—I inquired of her as to the nature of the lectureship, number of pupils, and so forth, and we arranged as to fees—she then asked me if I was willing to advance £200—she mentioned that she knew Mr. Lana, a scholastic agent and a friend of mine, and I went to see him, and he gave the prisoner a very high character and a satisfactory account of the school—I was assured it was a good school which she had built up—after that I agreed to advance £200 I paid her cheques for £50 on 29th March, £20 on 31st May, £10 on 28th June, £20 on 14th July, £20 on 15th January, and £10 on 26th January, making altogether £130—I was to receive 10 percent., one guinea per lecture, and a capitation fee, but I said that as the capitation fee was vague, I was to have one and a half guinea per lecture instead of the capitation fee—I think I gave her a course of about ten lectures in that term and about the same number in subsequent terms—she paid me back</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 19, Waterloo Road—on this night I was outside the Halfway public-house, standing outside the middle door at the corner—I heard a noise in the bar, the door opened, and the prisoner threw the man out—he had his hands on his collar, on the throat, to lay hold of him—as the man fell one part of his head caught the gutter and the other part the kerbstone—the prisoner stood for a moment on the step of the door—he then went to the man's collar again, and pulled him like on to the pavement—I did not take much notice of his face; I saw very little blood.</p>

I had used the house about eighteen months before; I stopped going there all of a sudden—the prisoner and I were on friendly terms, we had made it up—I was not on the inquest, I took no interest in it—J was not called—I was not outside while it was going on; I was near—I had to shoot a load of rubbish at a building close by—I spoke about this matter to Mr. Pressy on the 16th—I did not speak to the police about it—I know Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, and Charles Bennett, and James Mallison—I did not meet Mallison in Grey Street the night before the inquest, or have any conversation with him about the deceased—I did not say to him, "I would have given £20 if I had seen Wynne throw the man out"; "and I would give £5 to be on the inquest,"or anything to that effect—I never had the slightest word with Mallison</p>

               <p>about the matter—I do not remember meeting Mr. and Mrs. Bennett on Saturday, 23rd April, in Grey Street—Mr. Bennett did not say to me, "Did you see anything of the accident outside the Halfway House?"—nor did I say, "I wish I had,"and ask if they knew anybody that was on the inquest—Mr. Bennett did not reply, "No, but I have heard that Hoppy was"—nor did I say, "I wish to God I was on the inquest, I would make it hot for him; I would give £5 to be on the inquest; I would give the b-twenty years"—not a word of that is true; it is a pure invention—the Bennetts are not friends of mine, nor enemies, that I know of—I know Harry Hyde; he works in my yard; I see him every morning—he asked me it I had heard what had occurred at the Halfway House—I did not reply, "Yes; but I was not there, I did not see anything of it; the man is dead"—I did not say to Hyde two or three days afterwards, "I happened to be in the next bar, and saw it all"—Hyde did not say to me, "That is a lie; you told me you were not there at all"; nor did I say, "It won't do to know too much; if I was on the inquest I would give him a lash every year for twenty years"—it is a falsehood—Hyde is not a friend of mine—he has no spite against me that I know of—I know Mr. Pressy, as a neighbour—I spoke to him before I gave my evidence, on 19th April, the day of the occurrence—I told him what I had seen; he saw the same as I did—the police afterwards came to me, I was out with my curt at the time—the inspector came to me and said. "I have been given to understand that you saw the accident at the Halfway House, that Pressy had told him I knew something about it"—I said I did not wish to be in it—I had No. conversation with Pressy till after I gave evidence at the Police-court—that was after the coroner's jury had give their verdict.</p>

I was an inmate of Gordon Road Workhouse, and did all their private correspondence and dirty work. A man named Edmund Earish is gateporter there, and his wife assistant matron, and has charge of the stores. For a length of time a considerable quantity of materials, consisting of calico, bed ticking, dress stuff, boots, etc, have been taken out by different inmates. A bed tick was pawned on 11th September, 1891, at Jackson's, in New Church Road, Camberwell, by Mrs. Hardiman, 15, Dorton Street, my landlady; a blanket was also pawned for 3s. at same place 7fh May, 1892, by my daughter, Amelia Greenwood. She has been in the habit of going to the workhouse weekly, Fridays and Saturdays, and bringing stuff of all description* out, the price of silence for work done. I have within the last month brought out boots given to me expressly to be pawned. That is sufficient for you to go on with. I have written similar letters to the one you have, to the chairman and other guardians. I know, strictly speaking, by law I am liable to be placed in the dock with them. I do not mind that; £100 would not pay me for what I have done. The porter is on duty at the gate, and must see the things come out, as they cannot be put in one's pocket. You can see me any day between 11.30 and 1, and any time after 8 in the evening"—I went to him again on Tuesday, 24th May, about seven o'clock—I did not see him—another officer took him into custody on 27th.

                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweep, of 28, Kintore Street, Bermondsey—on 7th June, between eight and half-past, I was in the King's Arms, Old Kent Road, with my sister and her husband—the prisoner, whom I knew well, came in with his knife in his hand—he said, "Come on, Cannon; I want to fight you"—I said, "All right"—I looked down and saw the knife, and said, "Put your knife away like a man; you don't want to do any cowardly action to me; come outside, and I will fight you like a man"—we went outside—he said, "Come up here,"meaning a kind of gateway where cabs go to stop all night—I said, "No, I am not going up there to get a booting; come out into the road"—he then came out between the urinal and the public-house—I went to spar up to him, he still had the knife in his hand as if it was a dagger; I think it was an ordinary penknife; I could see the blade, not the handle—I said again, "Put your knife away; I will fight you; come on"—I went to spar at him; he made a dig at me, then I went to turn, and he stabbed me through the back in the shoulder-blade; if I had not turned I daresay I should have got it on the head—I ran a few yards and jumped on a tram, and the prisoner came after me by the side of the tram for some way till his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> pulled him away—I went to the station and had my wound sewn up by a doctor—I went with the detective to look for the prisoner, and saw him about half-past twelve or a quarter to</p>

               <p>one coming to make another hit at me in the Old Kent Road, while the two detectives were behind the coffee-stall—they claimed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This happened on. Whit-Tuesday in the Old Kent Road—I had four or five people with me; Hedley, a young fellow I am generally with, was one of them; he had no knife with him, I am sure—at three in the afternoon he had; I cannot say if he was in the habit of carrying one—my sister Mary Ann Blackett and her. husband and Edgeley, for whom he works, were there with me—the prisoner walked into the public-house with a mob; his mob met mine—we had no sticks or knives—I did not use a knife—I have been convicted of using a knife, and sentenced to fifteen months for it—the jury. brought it in common assault—the man who appeared against me said I hit and knocked him down—witnesses said I had a knife in my hand—that was about two and a half years ago—that is the only time I have been accused of that kind of assault—I never assaulted the police—I was charged on a warrant with breaking some windows, and got six months—I have also had twelve months—I have had three convictions for assaults—in 1882 I had eighteen months for felony—I am not called the terror of the neighbourhood; I have a wife and four children to support—I should live peaceably if they would let me alone—I had no objection to a friendly spar with the prisoner—I was not hitting him over the head with a stick when someone interfered; the stick was taken out of my place at a quarter to twelve, when I was out—I was not attacking an old lady—I did not show my knife in the public-house; I had no knife—his mob came in to pay me, a crowd collected round us in the middle of the road, but the prisoner was the only man in front of me—I was hot stabbed in the confusion by one of my own friends.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were eight or nine people with the prisoner and half-a-dozen with us, and about twenty people looking on—I carry a penknife; it is at home now—I had it in my pocket upon that day while the fight was going on—it is a pretty large knife—I have known Cannon a great many years, and am rather a friend of his—I had been drinking with him the greater part of this day—he had a bit of a row on that afternoon—I have only been out with him twice—knives were not used"in the afternoon—Cannon had no knife that I know of; I will not swear he had not—he had no stick—in the public-house an</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Weston Street, Stratford, Essex, and have been employed as clerk and timekeeper—about the end of March I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> similar to this. (<hi rend="italic">This was for a man to keep workmen's time and pay wages, at</hi> 30s. <hi rend="italic">a week, cash deposit indispensable. Reply by letter to George Wilson</hi>, 32, <hi rend="italic">Bessborough Gardens</hi>)—I replied, and afterwards received a letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">deposit would be required</hi>)—I went to the works at Oakhill Road, East Putney, and saw Mr. Kerry—I asked him if I could see Mr. Wilson—he said he was not there then; could he do anything for me; he would send at once for him—he told me that I should have to pay down—I said I could not pay the £100—he said be would see if Wilson would take any less—the same evening I received this letter, dated the Office and Works, Oakhill Road, April 7th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Mr. Wilson had appointed him timekeeper on the estate, and was signed for George Wilson; Kerry, manager</hi>)—I wrote accepting the appointment—I had no further communication for some tune, and then I wrote asking when Mr. Wilson would like me to commence my duties—I then had this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Mr. Kerry had left Wilson's employment, and he was not certain on what terms he had been engaged, and asking him to call</hi>)—I wrote—I had a reply, and then I went to the works at Oakhill Road, where I saw the prisoner—he asked what arrangements Kerry had made with me; I told him, and he said those arrangements would do; I said they would not do for me, as he said Mr. Kerry, had left Mr. Wilson's employ—he said, "He has"—I said I would sooner have a fresh arrangement with Mr. Wilson or his representative—he said, "I need not after this; this will do"—he asked me what deposit I had brought; I said none, as I thought it very strange</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270090"/>
               <p>Mr. Kerry leaving so suddenly—he said, "You need not fear anything he has had a little bit of a tiff with Wilson, and he has gone away, but I think he is coming back after a bit; it will be all right, so will you bring a deposit? you need not lay it all down at once; if you bring £30 or £40 you can start"—the deposit was to be £75, which was first mentioned in one of Mr. Kerry's letters; I repeated that as part of the terms on which I had been engaged—I said I should have to go back to get some money—I went back to Stratford—I wrote asking a friend if he would stand as guarantee for me, and he said he would—I said nothing to Humphries about a guarantee—the arrangement for the deposit was not made the first day, but on the Monday following—on Thursday, 28th April, was our first interview, and on the following Monday, 2nd May, I came and offered the prisoner a guarantee—he would not accept it, as it was no good—he said he could get thousands of guarantees; but he offered to take a smaller deposit, and let me lay the other down when I could—I arranged to go back and get the money—I next saw him on Wednesday, the 4th, about twelve o'clock, at Oakhill Road—he asked me if I would lay my money down—I said, "No, we will have some dinner first"—he seemed anxious to get the money—after dinner I gave him £30 in gold, and took this receipt from him, dated the 4th May—he did not say why he wanted the money down; he said that why he wanted the principal was that I should have money put in my hands to pay the men's wages, £60, £70, £80, and up to £100, and that he wanted the money as security in case I ran away—he did not say why a guarantee would not do—he said I could stay with him, and regularly commence my duties, and I went to look for a place where I could sleep—on Thursday I started at Oakhill Road, East Putney—there was an office on four wheels, an ordinary builder's wooden box—I was there Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Monday, from the 5th to the 9th, and then he was arrested—a little building was going on, a double house; four or five men wore employed, they got on very slowly—on Saturday the prisoner paid the wages; he did not trust me with any money—I did not have to keep the men's time, the prisoner kept them, and a bricklayer kept the bricklayers' time with him—I did nothing whatever—sometimes only one man turned up until breakfast-time, sometimes there were three—the prisoner was there sometimes at half-past ten, sometimes at eleven, and stayed up till about half-past five—there were some books in the office; I did not see any used except the one he put the time down in—I asked him for my money back on the same night I paid it, because I would rather wait and see Wilson, but the prisoner refused—then on the Friday I asked for it, because I wanted to go into the country very particularly; he said he could not give it to me back, as he had sent it on to Mr. Wilson in Ireland—I asked him for Wilson's address; he said he could not give it to me, as he was always shifting about; he would see Mrs. Wilson and try and get it—I asked him on Saturday for it; he refused, and said if he saw Wilson he might give it to me; he said he had seen Mrs. Wilson, but she could not understand it, as it seemed I wanted to get the money and clear off—the prisoner asked me to stay on; he said I had got a proper job, 35s. a week, and nothing to do; it would be always the same as it was then—I never got 35s., I only got 10s. when I started as part of my travelling expenses—on Monday, 9th May, one man turned up, he mixed a little mortar—later on, when the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270091"/>
               <p>came, he wanted to know why the men had not started—I said I did not know; the bricklayer was there, and there was something about taking the scaffolding down, but I did not hear what was said—in the result the prisoner went to the Police-station—he said he was going for a protection order for the scaffolding, to keep the men from taking it down—I remained outside the Police-station—an inspector afterwards took me in—about five or six the same day I saw the prisoner in the charge-room of the station—I was asked if the prisoner had had my money; I said Yes"—I afterwards charged him with obtaining money by false pretences—I parted with my money as I thought it was a very good opening, and would give me a good start—I believed a genuine business was being carried on at this place, the prisoner seemed very straightforward, but I was very suspicious after I had parted with the money—I believed at the time that a genuine building business was being carried on, and I believed in the truth of the allegations made to me by letter or by word of mouth, and that induced me to part with my money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first had negotiations with Kerry, whom I understood at the time to be Wilson's manager—the prisoner represented that he had succeeded Kerry as Wilson's manager, and I parted with my money to him believing he was the manager—I should have parted with my money to Kerry believing him to be Wilson's manager—I understood from Kerry that the money was wanted as security for my honesty—that was the same thing that the prisoner put plainly to me—Kerry did not tell me my duties, he said I should have to see Mr. Wilson about it; he said that I should have to keep the men's time, and that my salary would be thirty-five shillings—the prisoner gave me more particulars than Kerry did—the works were at Putney, where the men were working—the works were just coming out of the ground—afterwards they were not quite up to the first floor—! heard nothing about works at Surbiton from Kerry, but Kerry told me that Mr. Wilson was buying some ground at the corner of the Oakhill Road, and I should have to go to work there—I believed that Kerry was telling me about a genuine going business; such details as he gave me satisfied me of that, and that there was an opening for a timekeeper—in the interval between the 7th and 21st April I found the managers had changed, and on Thursday, 4th May, I went there—something was said about Bout taking down the scaffolding—I did not hear the prisoner say, "You must not take it down, wait tail Wilson comes back"—he went off to a policeman—on the way to the station I knew that somebody was suggesting removing the scaffolding—I do not know what he spoke to the policeman for—I did not understand that he went to the policeman about preventing the removing of the scaffolding, nor that the policeman told him to go to the station—the prisoner came from the constable to me, and asked me to go to the station with him, and on his way he told me that he was going to get a protection order to prevent the scaffolding being removed by Rout—he said nothing about Wilson—we got to the station about 12.20—the inspector came out and said the prisoner had said I had better get my dinner—I had not sworn any information against Wilson at that time nor told the policeman anything—I knew nothing about a summons or warrant against him-when I parted with my money I knew nothing about the business at Surbiton Hill—the prisoner told me later in the day, just after I had paid my money, but the existence or non-existence of works</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189206270092"/>
               <p>at Surbiton Hill had not the least effect on ire in parting with my money, nor had the fact that I was told that Wilson had gone to Ireland.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 109, Eye Road, Battersea, and am a clerk—in November, 1891,1 was living at Eye, in Suffolk—my mother left me £300, and about that time I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> somewhat similar to this, in consequence of which I afterwards wrote to 32, Bessborough Gardens—I there afterwards saw Wilson—he explained what my duties were, and told me I should have to go down to Surbiton, where I should be appointed, and act as timekeeper and cashier on a building estate; he was building six houses on the Crane Park Estate; the houses were in course of erection; that my £250 was wanted as an investment, for which I should have security on a house then in course of erection, which was to cost £900, and I should have 5 per cent, on my money—there was a charge of £650 on the house, and my money was to cover it up—my money was to be security for my honesty, as I should have a lot of money to handle, to pay the men's wages—I agreed to accept the appointment, to deposit the money, and on 30th November I gave Wilson a cheque for £250—this was the agreement between us. (<hi rend="italic">By this agreement Kerry deposited</hi> £250, <hi rend="italic">Wilson agreeing to employ him as timekeeper and cashier for twelve months, and after that, subject to one month's notice in writing, at a salary of</hi> £2 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week</hi>)—after I had paid the £250 and signed the agreement, Wilson asked me whether I was willing to go to his City office at 4, Featherstone Buildings, Holborn; he said he had got another man who was willing to fill the vacancy at Surbiton—I stayed at Featherstone Buildings from 30th November to 6th April; I practically did nothing during that time—I answered and inserted advertisements, and carried on correspondence with people who answered the advertisements I inserted—Wilson came there two or three times a week, not very regularly, and when he came he was only there a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> minutes—advertisements were inserted almost every week, always requiring a money deposit—there was an agreement between him and a freeholder about land at Surbiton; the matter was delayed he said in consequence of their not being able to come to terms—he asked me to go to Surbiton—he had got Mr. Payne to act as timekeeper there—almost the next day he asked me to go to Surbiton, as he said he could not come to terms with a freeholder—I was sent to tell Payne to discontinue work for a few days, and also Mr. Alfflat, who was engaged to set out the work—Payne was looking after Alfflat's men—Inspector Gillies showed me a number of letters and account books—I had entered most of those—they refer to advertisements inserted by me at Featherstone Buildings—I had kept the accounts—I wrote to several brick merchants, asking them to quote their prices for delivering bricks at Surbiton and Wandsworth—there was one transaction done with Sittingbourne brick merchants; that was for ready money to between £50 and £60—that was the only transaction which took place from November to February when I was there—I have never got my £250 back; I have not tried—I remained there till April 6th—I left because he gave up the office—I received my £2 10s. a week.</p>

I am an engineer, living at Manor Terrace, College Park—in February last I saw an advertisement in a newspaper, and on 14th February I saw Wilson at Featherstone Buildings, and asked him for particulars about investing £250 with him, and he offered me the berth of timekeeper, cashier, and checker of goods at some building operations at Surbiton Hill—I was to have three guineas a week and 5 per cent, for the investment—our agreement was to be terminable at a month's notice, and then the deposit was to be repaid to me—on 26th February I deposited £250 with him—I entered on my duties at Surbiton on 29th February; I found no work going on, there was only a portable office three-parts finished—two or three men came and turned some turf over—next day I was fetched away to Oakhill Road, Putney—I only went to Surbiton again to fetch the office away to Oakhill Road; that was on 3rd March—I remained at Putney till 8th April, when Wilson failed to come to pay the week's accounts—at Oakhill Road the ground was up for two houses out of six that were supposed to be built there, and building went on from time to time from 4th March to 8th April—I think we had four or five men; Wilson used to hand me a cheque, which I cashed and paid them with—that went on to 2nd April—the wages amounted to about 82s. per week—for the labour account and a few bills that I might have paid out of my pocket during the week, the total sum of the weekly cheque might have come to £8 or £12; £12 was the largest sum of his I ever had in my possession—the building operations at Putney got about half-way to the first floor—there were two other houses being erected on ground adjoining Wilson's—on 8th April Wilson sent a letter to the office to say he could not come, but that he would come on the Saturday, next day; on the Saturday he did not appear, and the men went without their wages—three only remained there up to Saturday, 9th April—I did not get a farthing of my £250</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, at Adley Road, The Grove, Hammersmith—in March last Wilson had some correspondence with me, and then I went to see him at 4, Featherstone Buildings, and he entered into this building agreement with the solicitor on 12th March, to build six houses at Oakhill Road, Putney, for which I was agent and surveyor—there is a schedule attached to the agreement, by which Wilson was to receive certain advances from time to time as the work proceeded—the work progressed very slowly and unsatisfactorily; it was carried on continuously up to the 11th of April, and then they ceased altogether, and I gave Wilson notice—then he started again on April 25th—on April 23rd he and the prisoner came together on to the estate, and Wilson wanted to know if I could give the prisoner the certificate to receive the advances when they were due—I said I could give him the certificates for the advances, but whether he could get the money at the solicitors' or not I could not say—then an appointment was made of the 25th to see the solicitors, and we saw Mr. White, of Gibbs, White and Co., and he said before he could allow the prisoner to draw the money Wilson would have to sign the mortgage-deed and the authority for the prisoner to receive the. money, and the prisoner was to send back his usual signature for them to see it—Mr. White sent on the mortgage-deed and authority for him to sign; he received it on the 26th, and returned it signed by Wilson, and with the prisoner's signature, to Mr. White—they had not got to the stage when the advance could be obtained—the last time saw Wilson at the works was 25th or 26th April—he said he was going to Ireland to sell some of his wife's property, about £800, and he was going to leave the prisoner there, as his friend, to look after the works till he came back—I never saw him again—I retook possession of the estate when the prisoner was taken into custody on 9th May—I saw Kerry and Payne there—I heard on 9th April that they had paid money; on that day they made a communication to me, and on 21st April I told Wilson I had heard he had had these two sums of £250 from these young</p>

               <p>men, and I thought he was a respectable man; and I heard it was a very serious matter, because it was going to be put into the Public Prosecutor's hands; and I said, "You had better pay them at once, as it is a disgrace to you to have those two £250"—at an interview subsequent to that he endeavoured to get the advance on the building and to transfer his right to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw Kerry at the Holborn office; I went there from an advertisement in the paper for building land—afterwards I saw Wilson; I had no negotiation with Kerry—I saw Payne as well as Kerry at the works—I am quite certain Kerry told me on 9th April that he had put the matter into the hands of the Public Prosecutor—I did not see the prisoner before 23rd April, and then Wilson introduced him as the man who was to superintend the building when Wilson was in Ireland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. On 21st April I had the conversation with Wilson about the two men and their £250; and on 23rd he spoke about transferring his interest in the advance to the prisoner—on 25th I went with him to the solicitors', and the agreement transferring the interest to the prisoner was signed on 26th, between two and three p.m.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 479, Liverpool Road—on 14th March, 1892, I contracted with Mr. George Wilson, at 4, Featherstone Buildings, to do some brickwork on certain land at Oakhill Road, Putney; and I was employed from that date till 7th May—we stopped for a fortnight, on 9th April, because Wilson did not send the money, and then we finally stopped on 7th May, and on 9th May I gave notice that I was going to remove the scaffolding,' because my men would not work on the ground—Kerry was there the last week—I did not see the prisoner there before Wilson brought him up on 23rd April, and said he was going to superintend his works for him—the prisoner at the last gave instructions for men to work there, but until he was in custody, when Kerry and Payne were there, there were no men except my own—I paid the men up to the last week, and then the prisoner paid them—I had charge of the work; the prisoner had charge of getting the staff, and full management—my time had to be checked against me—the prisoner paid the wages; I paid all except the last week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I understood the prisoner was going to superintend the work—the place had been looked after by Kerry and Payne, and I looked on them as Wilson's managers—about four or five men were employed, or seven or eight towards the finish, I believe—that is the way building work is usually carried on in the suburbs—sometimes funds are wanting—Hall was there when Wilson brought the prisoner; he said he was going to do it for him as a friend.</p>

On the 9th May, shortly after twelve, the prisoner came to Wandsworth Police-station with another man, and complained of Bout, saying that he was going to remove scaffolding I asked who was the owner of the house; he said he was not, that Wilson was—I knew that at that time a warrant was out for Wilson, and I thought the prisoner was he, and I detained him at the station—he gave the name of Humphries, the address being 5, Godman Road, Peckham—I sent a telegram asking if Wilson or Humphries resided there—I received a reply, and told the prisoner the effect of it—he said, "I 'am known there"—I detained him, and Í went out and found Ward, and he came back to the station, and Ward charged the prisoner with obtaining from him £30 with intent to defraud—the prisoner said he had the money, and paid it over to Wilson—I made inquiries as to where the prisoner lived, and subsequently went and searched 56, Ivydale Road, Nunhead, where I found several letters and memoranda—I found a rent-book, on the prisoner belonging to Featherstone Buildings—these account-books were found at Oak hill Road—I found these two letters and this receipt in a cupboard in the ante-room on the first floor at Ivydale Road.

I am a tobacconist, at 104, Waterloo Road—on the night of 15th June I fastened up my premises at eleven o'clock securely, and went to bed—early next morning I was called up by the inspector, and on coming down I found the plate-glass window broken and a large brick inside, and some meerschaum pipes and cigar-holders had been taken—these are them—the police afterwards brought them back.</p>

About four a.m. on the 16th I examined the shop window at 104, Waterloo Road—it was intact—about ten minutes past four I passed again, and noticed the window was broken, and a large piece of brick was lying just inside the window—I called Garter, who gave me particulars of the property which had been stolen—the two female prisoners when charged at the station made no reply.</p>
