I examined her about them, and she confessed that she had taken a Silver Girdle Buckle, a Gold Ring, a Shirt, and two Ells of Holland, and had pawned them all at the Greyhound and Three Bowls in Hounsditch, for 18 s. The Goods were found there. She was carried before Alderman Brucas, who committed her to Newgate. I went thither next Day to see her, and then she confessed further, that she had taken from me a Portugal Piece of Gold that goes for 36 s. I was more surprised at this, than at all the rest, because I could not imagine which Way she could come at it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Underwood. Missing my Stockings and Aprons, I asked the Prisoner if she knew any thing of them? She denied that she did; and as I had received a good Character of her, I did not suspect her Honesty, but thought she might have put them among her own Things by Mistake, and therefore I desired to look in her Box. She readily opened it, and there I found my Aprons, one of my Holland Shifts, and my Prayer-Book. Upon this I began to mistrust her, for I thought she could not take all these Things by Mistake; and upon taxing her closely, she at last confessed that she had taken the Shift with a Design to carry it away, as she had done several other of my Things which she had pawned; but she said, the Aprons were put in her Box by Mistake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Box had no Lock nor Hinges, it always stood open; I had been Ironing late at Night, and put some of my Mistress's Things among my own, by Mistake: As for the Ring, I found it among some foul Things, and wanting Money, I carried it to pawn, but did not intend to keep it; for when my Master paid me my Wages, I fetched it out of pawn with my own Money.</p>

I had seen them several Times, for a Month or two past, loitering with the Prisoner about Rosemary-Lane. I had some Suspicion on that Account, and what encreas'd my Suspicion was, that I saw some Blood upon the Hats. So I took the Prisoner over to an Alehouse, and Bunker followed. I ask'd the Prisoner how he came by the Hats? He said he had them of Bunker, and Bunker own'd the Hats to be his own. 'That he bought them in Rag-Fair for 3 s. but when they came before the Justice, Bunker own'd that they had stole the Hats aboard a Ship, and charged the Prisoner with being concern'd with him in several Robberies. But we could find none of the Prosecutors but Mr Bank, and he being sent for, he was then positive to the Prisoner, but afterwards he did not seem willing to prosecute.</p>

He first robb'd Mr. Collet, and then took 7 s. from me; but, not satisfied with our Money, he demanded our Watches. We told him we had none. He said we had, and insisted upon searching us. While we were expostulating with him, a Gentleman's Servant came riding from Tottenham. The Prisoner turn'd about, bade him stop, made him dismount, and was going to search him, when Mr. Collet stept out of the Chaise, and with the Handle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100005"/> his Whip struck the Prisoner on the Side of the Head, and almost knock'd him down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Collet. I was going in a Chaise with Mr. Vow to my own House at Enfield, on Saturday Evening, and on this Side Tottenham, just opposite to Mr. Ambrose's Wall, the Prisoner call'd to us to stop. I drove the faster; upon which he rode up, and swore if we did not stop the Horse he'd shoot him I stopp'd, he robb'd me, and afterwards took something from Mr. Vow, and then demanded our Watches. We told him we had none. And presently - Skelton (Doctor Ward's Footman) came towards us from Tottenham. The Prisoner stopp'd him, and made him dismount, and was going to rob him, when I jump'd out of the Chaise and struck the Prisoner on the left Side of the Head with the Handle of my Whip. He reel'd, and riding by the Row of Trees near the School, I saw him fall from his Horse and run to a Ditch, where Skelton jump'd upon him. - He was not out of my Sight before he fell. - After he was taken I took off his Hat and Wig, and saw the Wound I had given him, and it look'd fresh.</p>
               <p>- Skelton. I had been at Edmonton, and was returning, when, just on this Side Tottenham, I perceiv'd a Chaise standing still and a Man on Horseback by it. I heard him say, Give me your Watches; and when I came up closer I heard some Money chink in his-Hand. He turn'd about to me, and said, Damn ye! deliver this Minute, or you're a dead Man. He made me dismount that he might search me, and his Back being then to the Chaise, Mr. Collet stept out of the Chaise, and struck him such a Blow with his Whip, that he made him reel, and told me, if I had but given him a second Blow I might have knock'd him quite down. But I had not that Presence of Mind. The Prisoner rode into Tottenham, I mounted again and follow'd him. I saw him fall from his Horse into a Ditch hard by the two Rows of Elms. He got up again and ran into another Ditch, and endeavour'd to get over the Bank into the Field. But in Scrabbling to get up, he slipp'd down again; upon which I quitted my Horse, and he offer'd to shoot, but his Pistol missing Fire, I Jump'd into the Ditch upon him, and down he went among the Sludge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When this Man came to see for me in Newgate, he charg'd another Man with the Robbery, and own'd that he only came for the sake of the Reward.</p>
               <p>Skelton. No; but when I came to Newgate I was brought among several Thieves, and Somebody there said, What! do you come here to swear away a Man's Life for Hire? At which being frighted, as fearing some Mischief, I could not suddenly recollect whether the Prisoner was one of those present or not.</p>

            . About 8 in the Evening, as I and Sam Brown were sitting at my Master (Mr. Ambrose's ) Gate, I heard a Noise at a little Distance. Somebody said, Sir! what would you have? we have given you all. And another answer'd, Your Watches. I ran out to assist, and presently I heard a Blow. I cry'd out Highwayman! and a Man on Horseback rode by me, but I could not then see his Face, for he held his Head down thus -. I suppose it was by reason of the Blow that was given him. I follow'd, and help'd to take him in the Ditch.</p>

            . Sitting on Mr. Ambrose's Rails with Cropper, the Gard'ner, I heard a Man say, Stop, or Stand! Hark! says I, there's a Robbery. - Presently a Gentleman said, What would you have more? you Watch got all. The first made answer, Your Watch, or Watches. Then I heard a large Blow. The Highwayman rode by, and fell into a Ditch, and getting up again ran into another, but in climbing up the Bank to get into the Field, he slipp'd back, and Skelton push'd him in and jump'd upon him</p>
               <p>John Gibson. Coming from Page-Green I heard a Man ask for Watches; upon which I stept out of the Fort-way, and saw the Blow given to the Prisoner, while he was searching Skelton. I help'd Skelton to catch his Horse, and then he rid after the Prisoner, and cross'd the Common, and endeavour'd to take the Turning that goes to Justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100006"/> Harwood's, but, being upon full Speed, he over-shot himself, and turning back too quick, his Horse's Foot slipp'd in the Ditch and threw him. I was then about 60 Yards from him, and am sure he is the Man, for there was no other Horseman upon the Road but he and Skelton for the Space of 10 Minutes.</p>

I told him I only drove it for Mr. Mackrel. - He then demanded my Money; I said I had none; with that he punch'd me in the Face with his Pistol and broke my Head with it, and turn'd my Pocket inside out to search, but could find no Money. I got from him once, but he fetch'd me again and beat me. I got away a second time, and ran to my Master Mackrel, and told him how I had been abus'd, and so I crept into the Waggon; I was hardly well in, when the Prisoner came riding up, and said, Damn your Blood, here I am again.

The Highwayman rid after me till he came so close, that one of his Horse's Feet stood upon one of mine; I ask'd him what he meant by serving me so? He demanded my Money; I gave him my Bag, which had in it two half Crowns, a Shilling, and some Halfpence. He did not meddle with my Waggon, but when he had got my Money he rode from me to Mr. Sadgrove, whose Waggon was about four Lugg* off. - I can't swear the Prisoner is the Man that robb'd me: I had no Lanthorn, and it was not light enough to see his Face, and besides I find I was mistaken as to the Colour of his Horse, for I thought he rode upon a black Horse, but others that were assaulted by the same Man, say it was a dark bay Horse. So that all I can be positive of is this, I was robb'd by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100007"/> the Man who said, Here I am again.

             Between 9 and 10 at Night on the 30th of April, as I was coming over Hounslow-Heath with my Waggon, I heard somebody galloping hard after me; I turn'd my Head and perceiv'd a Man upon a little serubbed Horse just behind me. Whose Waggon is this? says he. Why, says I, whose Waggon do you want? Damn ye, says he, let it be whose it will, if you don't stop it immediately, I'll shoot you thro' the Head: So I stopt my Horses, and then says he, What Passengers have ye got? Why what do you want with my Passengers? says I, Why I want their Money, says he, and damn ye I'll blow your Brains out, if you don't tumble 'em out of the Waggon-Tumble out my Passengers that I get my daily Bread by? that would be fine Work indeed! thought I to myself, so I told him I had no Passengers. Damn ye you lie, says he, - But however, give me your Money and your Bag and all. So I gave him my Bag with 3 s. in it. Now turn your Pockets, says he. I did so, but yet that did not satisfy him. For, says he, you have not so good a Hand at searching as I have; so he stopp'd down and search'd my Fob and my other Pockets himself, but he found only a steel Buckle, which he took away. He again enquir'd if had any Passengers? No, says I. You lie, you have, says he. Why then, says I, if you won't believe me, you may get off and look. And upon that he gave me a knock with his Whip, and knock'd me quite under my Horses; if they had gone forward I should have been crush'd to Pieces. Then he rode off, but he came back again presently, and giving me a cut with his Whip, told me, that if he should ever come to know that I had any Passengers that Night, I should never travel that Road again. Then he ask'd me where about the other Waggons were, I said I did not know. He told me I ly'd; and taking a Pistol out of his Pocket, he presented it towards me, and said, I have a mighty Mind to give you a Pill before I go. But he went off towards London without doing me any more Mischief. He had not been gone long before I heard a Pistol go off, upon which I concluded that he had overtaken the other Waggons. This was on the Monday Night; I got into London on Tuesday Morning, and returning thro' Kensington on Wednesday Morning I went to see the Prisoner, who was in Kensington Round-house. I told him I thought he was the Man that robb'd me: He desir'd me to do him Justice; Aye, says I, then I must hang ye; and so I went on upon my Journey and the Prisoner was sent to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was you from Mackrel's Waggon when you was robb'd ?</p>
               <p>Sadgrove. His Waggon was 3 or 4 Lugg behind me; and he told me, that the same Man that robb'd me, had robb'd him and abus'd his Man but a little before.</p>
               <p>Mackrel. Yes, the Highwayman went directly from me to Sadgrove; I heard the Blow that he gave him, and was afraid he would have murder'd him.</p>

How go Affair, in our Country? There was a Light in a Room pretty near us; I suppose somebody was going to Bed, and by this Light I could see the Prisoner plainly: He parted from us, and we drove forward along Smallberry Green: By and by I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100008"/> a Horse coming hard behind me, I gave the Way; the Prisoner came up and cry'd, Damn your Blood, where's your Passengers ? I want their Money! Grand look, says I, and ask 'em for it. Upon that he beat me, and going up to the Head of the Waggon he tore the Tilt to look in; I struck at his Horse with my Whip, and his Horse moving a little, he pull'd a Pistol out of his Bosom and fired at me; the Bullet just graz'd on my Cheek; he did not stay to examine the Waggon after he had shot, but rode towards London. We hollo'd out to the Turnpike Men to stop him, but they let him pass; tho' when we came up they own'd they heard us hollo, but pretended that they did not know what we hollo'd for.</p>

            , Watchman in Kensington. On Tuesday Morning, between 1 and 2, I heard a Horse trampling and prancing at a Brandy Shop Door in Kensington. I went up to see who was there, and found the Prisoner sitting on a little bay Horse, and drinking Gin with a Soldier. The Newbury Coach had been robb'd but the Saturday before, and a Man then rid by me full Speed on such a Horse as I now found the Prisoner's to be. This gave me the first Suspicion that he was one of those concern'd in that Robbery, and made me take the more Notice of him. He ask'd me what a Clock it was ? I told him it wanted a quarter of Two. He pull'd out a Watch, and took the Case off to look at it. I thought by the Manner of his handling it, that he had not been much us'd to a Watch. As he put up the Watch I perceiv'd a Pistol in his Breast, and this made me conclude that he was one of the Highwaymen that robb'd the Newbury Coach, for I had not then heard of the Waggons being robb'd. So I resolv'd to get Help if I could and take him. But that he might not mistrust me I staid a little to drink with him, and then told him I was going to call up some Market People, tho', God knows my Heart, I was going for Assistance to apprehend him. I went to a Tallow Chandler's and a Baker's, and told their Men, who were at work, that there was a Highwayman at the Brandy Shop Door, and if they would assist me, we might easily take him. I hey seem'd then afraid to venture, and so I went back; but in a little while I found two of them (Paget and White ) at the Gin-shop. We drank two or three Quarterns, and then I was for taking the Prisoner, tho' they were still afraid, but I swore, - yes, I did swear, begging your Lordship's Pardon, - that now was the only Time, and so I seiz'd him, took the Pistol out of his Breast, and clapp'd it to him. He struggled and endeavoured to get his Hand to his left Pocket, and if he had done that, Gods knows, I might have been kill'd, for he had got a Pistol there, but others assisting me, we prevented farther Mischief. We had scarce well secur'd him before the Waggons came up. The Waggoners were overjoy'd to see him; and as poor People are apt to swear an Oath now and then as well as their Betters, they all swore that he was the Man that had robb'd and abus'd them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Mackrel there then?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, and Sadgrove too, and they both swore positively and heartily that he was the Man. - As soon as ever they saw him, they cry'd, This is the Rogue that robb'd us! But they were afterwards afraid to swear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100009"/> positively before the Justice, for as they constantly travell'd the Road, they thought their Lives would be always in Danger. The Prisoner was searched, and a Pistol ready charg'd and 8 loose Balls and some Powder and other Things, were taken out of his Pockets. The Pistol that I took from him was not charg'd. I suppose that was the Pistol he had discharg'd at one of the Waggoners: For one of them (a little Fellow) came in with his Face bloody, and said the Prisoner had shot at him, and that the Ball graz'd upon his Cheek. - So we carried the Prisoner to the Round-house 'till such Time as his Magistrate the Justice was up. - Have I told a Word of a Lie now? [To the Prisoner.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, in saying that you saw me ride by you in Kensington on the Saturday before, for I was sick a-bed then.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the Prisoner dress'd?</p>
               <p>Clark. He had a white Horse-hair Wig, a light Coat, black Waistcoat and Breeches, and no Boots; I ask'd him why he rid without Boots, and he said he had worn 'em out.</p>

            . Clark the Watchman knock'd at my Master's Door about 2 a-Clock on May-day Morning, and ask'd me to go and take a Highwayman at the Brandy Shop. He said he had call'd upon Will. White too, but Will. was then lock'd in, and could not get out immediately. Clark went away and I call'd upon White, and took him with me to the Gin-shop Presently we heard Clark crying 2 a-Clock, and White call'd him in. - When we had drank together, says Clark, I'll go and seize him now, or he'll be gone. So he went to the outside of the Prisoner's Horse, clapp'd his Hand to the Prisoner's Coat, took a Pistol out of the Prisoner's Bosom, and holding it up, threaten'd to shoot him. - The Prisoner lean'd back, and went to put his left Hand to his Pocket, but I prevented him, and holding him by the Coat he fell back, and his Heels struck thro' the Brandy Man's Window. Two or three Shillings and a Six-Pence fell out of his Pocket. I kneel'd upon him to keep him down, and took a Pistol out of his Pocket. the Constable came, and then we ty'd the Prisoner's Hands and search'd him farther, and we found upon him two Handkerchiefs, a Snuff-Box, a Silver Watch, and a Pewter Watch (such as they have to please Children,) seven or eight loose Bullets, a little Powder in a Bag, a Fleam, a Silver Buckle, and a Steel Shoe-Buckle. In a quarter of an Hour three or four Waggoners came in, and swore he was the Man that robb'd 'em. The Soldier that was drinking with the Prisoner, said the Prisoner was a Gentleman, and went to push me from him, but upon my holding the Pistol to the Soldier, he march'd off.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew that Shoe-Buckle to Sadgrove.</p>
               <p>Sidgrove. This is the Buckle the Prisoner took from me, and here is the Fellow to it.</p>

            . Paget call'd me from Work to help the Watchman. I went up, and looking at the Prisoner I saw no Pistol, and so was forgoing away; but the Watchman coming in, said, he was sure that the Prisoner had a Pistol. The Man of the House said, Have a Care what you do, fo r he's a Gentleman. - The Watchman seiz'd him, took a discharg'd Pistol from his Breast, and Paget took a loaded one from his Pocket. We pull'd him back, and in falling he broke the Window with his Feet, and dropp'd some Money. The Waggoners came in, and swore Damn him, this is the Man that robb'd us, - and this is his Horse. It was a dark bay Horse, about 14 Hands high. The Prisoner had no Boots, and but one Spur.</p>

            , Constable. When I came up to the Prisoner, White and Paget had just pull'd him off his Horse, and there was a Soldier, who, I believe, had a great Mind to rescue him. The Waggoners came in and said, This is the Rogue that robb'd us on Hounslow-Health and Smallberry-Green. Do you say that I am the Man? says the Prisoner. Yes, and will swear it too, said they. I ask'd him why he had abus'd the Waggoners? He said he had neither been upon Hounslow Health nor near it, not any farther on that Road than Kensington, where he then was. But upon searching him, we found, besides other Things, two Turnpike Tickets for that Day,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100010"/> one for Smallberry-Green, and another for Kensington. And when he saw them, he said he did not know where he had been. I ask'd him what Business he had with those Pistols and Bullets, and he told me he was a Gunsmith by Trade. The Money that we found about him was 13 s 6 d. in Silver, and 2 d. 3 Farthings. The first Day that he was carry'd before the Justice he would confess nothing; but the second time, when he found he must go to Newgate, he own'd he had committed several Robberies on t'other Side of the Water, but still said, that he neither robb'd the Waggoners, nor. knew any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that I ever saw any of the Witnesses that have sworn against me, 't ll I saw them at Kensington.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did not take Fullbrook by the Hand at Hounslow ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I saw none of them. I shall give an Account how I get my Bread. - I don't deny but I have been guilty of some Facts, but not of these that I am indicted for.</p>
               <p>Court. What Facts?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That will be known when the Gentlemen that I shall call come in and give their Evidence.</p>

               <p>Court. How long did he hold it?</p>
               <p>Ansell. He work'd at our Shop three Weeks (after he came from India ) and then he went down to see his Father in Wales. He staid about a Fortnight, and then return'd to his Work, and continu'd at it constantly till within these six or seven Weeks; and he work'd very hard, and call him when you would he was always ready. I have call'd him up to Work by One or Two in the Morning (as our Business sometimes requir'd it) and he was always ready and willing. I was almost continually in his Company. I never saw him disguis'd in Liquer ; he was not at all given to drink or game, or keep ill Company, but was always very sober and sedate. We work'd at Harrison's and Duke's, Anchor-Smiths in Rotherbith.</p>

I went on, and they turn'd back and follow'd me. The Prisoner took hold of the Blanket, and said, What have you got here? 'Tis nothing but a Blanket, says I; and with that he gave me a Blow with his Fist, and knock'd me down. I held the Blanket still, and begg'd him not to abuse me, because I was big with Child. Then let go the Blanket, says he. I was loth to lose it, and struggled to keep it as long as I could; upon which he kick'd me, and at last pull'd it from me, and then he ran one Way, and the others who stood by, ran another Way. I cry'd out, Stop Thief, and follow'd the Prisoner, and he was taken within about 30 Yards, by a Man who was coming towards me. I heard him ask the Man why he stopp'd him? and the Man said, because the Woman cry'd out.</p>

            . As I was walking over Moorfields, between 8 and 9 at Night, I heard the Cry of Murder! Thieves! It was a little darkish, and running towards the Noise, I met the Prisoner coming full Speed from the Woman. She was then about 30 Yards off. I stopp'd him. He cry'd, What do you want? What do you want? I told him, I beliv'd he was the Person concern'd. She soon came up, and said, he had dragg'd her along the Ground by a Blanket, and taken it from her. He had nothing when I took him, but Somebody presently brought in the Blanket, and she said it was hers. The Prisoner deny'd that he knew any thing of the Matter, and said that he was not the first Man that had been wrongfully accus'd. We carry'd him to the Flying Horse by the Watch-house, and sent for a Constable, and next Day he was carry'd before Justice Chamberlain in Spittle-Yard.</p>

She's big with Child, says he, and I fancy she may have Child-bed Linnen. So we follow'd her, and he went foremost, gave her a Knock with his Fist, and tripp'd her up, and said, Damn you, deliver the Blanket. She struggled to keep it, and held one End while he dragg'd her along by the other, and at last he got it from her, and ran away. He had no Stick. We stood by to watch. He was taken at one End of the Field, and I at the other, and we were both carry'd to the same House, the Flying Horse; and going next Day before Justice Chamberlain, I confess'd, and made my Information.</p>

               <p>Bagley. Why, last Easter-Monday we got drunk together, and that was the first of our Acquaintance.</p>

It was broke open on the 10th of September in the Night I lost 31 Suits of lac'd Headcloths, they were taken out of the 31 small Boxes that stood by the Window, but the Boxes were left behind; 7 Ounces of narrow open silver Lace, 12 Yards of broad silver Lace, and 5 Yards of narrow silver Lace, 3 Yards of black Velvet cut out for a Scarfe, and a red silk Lining for it; 18 Pair of Manteel Tassels, a sattin Gown, a Shift, an Apron, a Point-lace Neckcloth and Ruffles; 17 back Heads with Lace, 14 Suits of Nightclothes, and other Things. On the 25th of April, this back Head - 'tis new Brussels Lace, and cost me 20 Guineas - was brought to my Shop to be sold by Eliz. Eager: I presently knew it to be one of those that I had lost, and therefore enquir'd how she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100013"/> came by it: She said she had it from Mrs. Broadhurst in Monmonth-street. Upon farther Enquiry, I found that Mrs. Broadhurst had it from Mrs. Slurrow in Westminster ; Mrs. Slurrow from Mrs. Sanders, and she from the Prisoner. I obtain'd a search Warrant from my Lord Mayor, and went with Mrs. Sanders and others to the Prisoner's House in Pye-Corner. In the Table Drawer below Stairs I found this Pair of minteel red Tassels with white Bugles; I can safely swear to 'em, for I know 'em from a thousand; I had 'em made on Purpose to suit the Fancy of a particular Lady. My Wife and Brother, and the Constable, went up Stairs with the Prisoner, and brought down with them these 12 pair of black manteel Tassels, which I verily believe are part of those I lost. Then the Prisoner himself put his Hand behind some Pewter on a Shelf, and took out these two Brussels Lace Suits, and gave them to my Brother. We ask'd the Prisoner how he came by these Goods; he said he bought a Handkercherful of these and other things of a Woman in Rag-Fair. - At first he said for 3 Guineas, but afterward for 3 l. 8 s. And he said he believ'd he cou'd find the Person out if he might have his Liberty to look for her. We did not care to trust him alone, but went with him; he carried us into a House where a large Company of Men were sitting round a Table: He call'd to one of them, and said, Hark ye, Are not you the Man I bought the Lace of? - I the Man! says the other, No; I know nothing of it. Why then I am mistaken, says the Prisoner. By his asking a Man this Question when he had told us but a little before that he had them from a Woman, we found he was only shuffling with us, and so we carried him before a Magistrate, and then he said he had all the Things from Mrs. Sanders.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Lear. On the 10th of December, between 10 and 11 at Night, we left the Shop all fast and went to Bed, and between 5 and 6 in the morning we were call'd up, and round we had been robb'd; several Holes had been bored in the Pannel of the outer Window Shutter, and then the Pannel was slit down and so taken out: A Piece of Woollen of the Colour of the Shutters was nail'd over the Hole and daub'd with Clay. Thro' this Hole they had push'd back the inner Shutters, and so taken the Goods off of two Shelves next the Window. without getting quite into the House. Behind the Counter lay the 31 empty Boxes and a Parcel of Cloaths that had been push'd down. - This Head I took out of the Prisoner's Pocket. - I'll tell ye the whole Tale presently. - I can swear to all these Goods, and to this red and white Tasse particularly.</p>
               <p>Juryman. I think you said it was in December that your Shop was broke open.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lear. December, did I say? - Then I mistook. - It was in September. - On the 25th of April,

Why says she, he has often told me that he liv'd in Peter's-Street; but I sent my Maid one Day to watch him, and so I found that he liv'd in Pye Corner. So we got a Warrant and went thither, and ask'd him if he had given that Head to Mrs. Sanders. He deny'd it at first, but afterwards own'd it. Have you got any more such in the House? says I; no, says He; I had indeed more of this old fashion'd Lace, but I have sold it all. And where did you get it? says I. Why, says he, I bought it of a Gentlewoman in Rag-fair, over against the dead Wall; I had a Handkercherful of it for three Guineas. Three Guineas? says I. No, says he, now I remember, it was 3 l. 8 s. We found this pair of red Tassels in a Drawer below, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100014"/> then my Brother and I and the Constable went up and found 12 pair of bugle Tassels. There was a Coat hanging up; I ask'd the Prisoner if it was his, and he said, Yes. I search'd the Pockets and took out this lac'd Head. Now, says I, this is plain Proof against you, and therefore you may as well confess. Why then, says he, there's more below. So he went down with us, and took these two Heads from behind some Pewter, and gave them to my Brother. And now, says he, if you'll let me have my Liberty, I'll find the Woman I bought 'em of. And so you'll run away, says I. No, says he, I'll give my Bond that I won't. Your Bond? says I, that would be a fine Security indeed! No, we'll call a Coach and go together. And so away we went, and he carried us to a House where there was a Parcel of Thieves sitting round a Table, and he beckon'd to one of them, and said,

            . I keep a Chandler's Shop in Great St. Anne's-Lane, Westminster; my Husband is a House-Painter. The Prisoner has known me from a Child, for my Father was a Serjeant in the Guards, and the Prisoner was then a Soldier: And so he came to see me about 3 or 4 Weeks before last Christmas. He brought a blue Bag with him, but there was nothing in it then, and he only ask'd me how I did, and the like, and so went away again. But the next time he came, he brought 9 Ells of Linnen in the Bag to sell. He ask'd 13 d. a Yard; I bid him 11 d. and at last we agreed for 9 s. 6 d for the whole. He came again a Week after with the same blue Bag, and ask'd me if I knew any Body that would buy a Suit of lac'd Headclothes. I told him I did not want myself, but I would enquire among my Acquaintance He said the Price was 18 s. and so he left 'em with me, and I afterwards sold 'em to Eliz. Grindley, a very honest Woman. She was acquainted with Houses of Fashion, and knew where to dispose of such Things, and I had no Suspicion of the Prisoner, for I knew he dealt in old Clothes, and always took him for a very honest Man. On the Friday before the 25th of April he came and told me his two Daughters were going to be pass'd to another Parish, and then he shew'd me this lac'd Head, which he said he bought of the Duchess of Richmond's Gentlewoman, and he desir'd me to dispose of it for him. He bid me ask eight Guineas. I carry'd it to Mrs. Slurrow's (while he staid in my Shop) and she bid me six Guineas. I came back to tell him, and he bid me take the Money. I went again, but she had not the Money ready, and so I laid down four Guineas and a half, which my Maid paid him before two Witnesses, and he was to call next Day for the rest of the Money; he accordingly came, but she had not paid me; he came again next Tuesday, but the Money was not ready then neither; so that he never had it, for the Affair was discover'd presently after. Mrs. Slurrow brought Mrs. Lear to me, and said, she would have the Head if she could be sure that it was honestly come by. To satisfy them, I went with them to the Prisoner's House. He was not at home, but we staid till he came in. How do you do, Mr. Adley? says I. This Gentlewoman would buy the Head you left with me to dispose of, but she's scrupulous about its being honestly come by. Who are you ? says he, I don't know you, I never saw you in my Life before. I was surpris'd at this, but when they told him they had got a Search-warrant, he own'd that he gave me a Head, but he said he did not know it again. However, at last he confess'd, that that was the very Head he had left with me. This other lac'd Head I had got

               <p>Mrs. Lear. This is my Velvet. There was three Yards of it. I found it at Mrs. Sander's House.</p>
               <p>A. Sanders. I bought this Velvet of the Prisoner for 26 s. 6 d. I reckon there was but two Yards and three Quarters. I bought this Sattin Gown of him too, for I produc'd it to Mrs. Lear, tho' she knew nothing of my having it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did I allow you for selling these Things, as you say?</p>
               <p>A. Sanders. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That must be hard indeed.</p>
               <p>A. Sanders. You spent your Money at my House for what you wanted. You did not say at first that you had them from a Man, but from a Gentlewoman, and that you gave 'em me to dispose of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lear. Mrs. Sanders told me at first, that she had 'em from Adley, who liv'd in Pye-Corner ; she said, he had told her he liv'd in Peter's-Street. She shew'd me the Sattin Gown and the Velvet freely, and I knew nothing of her having the Gown before she produc'd it; and she told me, that Grindley was gone over the Water with two Suits to sell.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Grindley. I had this lac'd Suit from Mrs. Sanders, and I sold it to Mrs. Waters at the Golden-Ball in York-Buildings. Mrs. Sanders, indeed, told me at first, that this lac'd Suit came from a Woman of her Acquaintance, who was kept by a Gentleman. But about six Weeks ago the Prisoner being in Mrs. Sander's House, he told me, that she had the lac'd Heads from him.</p>
               <p>Court. How came he to say that to you?</p>
               <p>Grindley. Why, I being a Laundress, have sometimes an Opportunity of selling such kind of Things, and I had sold several for Mrs. Sanders. Now, you must know, that now and then I happen to get a little merry, as any other Body may do, and then I say any thing that comes uppermost; so coming into Mrs. Sanders's House in one of these merry Fits, there was she and the Prisoner, a sitting by the Fire; and says Mrs Sanders to me, This is the old Man that I have had all the lac'd Heads from. Ay, says I, and pray, old Gentleman, how do you come by such Things? Why, I'll tell you, says he, my Daughter lives with a Woman that is kept by a Jew in the Minories, and this Jew gives his Mistress these Things for Pocket Money, and she sends them to me by my Daughter to sell for her, and so I bring them to Mrs. Sanders. And so Mrs. Sanders gave 'em to me to dispose of 'em as well as I could; and this Head I sold to Madam Dell, a Town Lady, for three Guineas, and this to Mrs. Martin, who keeps Martin's Coffee-house at Charing-Cross. I was bid to ask six Guineas for it. Mrs. Clapham, at the Golden-Anchor, bid me two Guineas; I try'd at some other Shops, and at last I let Mrs. Martin have it for three Guineas and a half. I sold her another Head afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lear. And that, Mrs. Martin sold again to a Jew; but we cannot yet produce it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin. I bought two Heads of Mrs. Grindley, one of them I sold * to Mr. Bray, a young Gentleman, who said he bought it for a Present. - This is very like it.</p>
               <p>* For Twelve Guineas.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lear. Like it? Why, is it not the very same? Did not he make a Present of it to Mrs. Murray ? and did not I find it upon Mrs. Murray ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Grindley. Did you never say that you sold those two Heads at a Brandy Shop? now you swear you sold 'em at a Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100016"/>Grindley. What if I did? Mrs. Martin keeps a Coffee-house over a Brandy-shop.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin. I let the lower Floor of my House for 25 l. a Year, to Mr. Capstick, a Distiller. Mrs. Grindley, it seems, brought this Head to Mrs. Capstick, who shew'd it to me, and ask'd my Advice about it, whether it would make a Suit of Head-clothes for her. It was cut and mangled, and very dirty. I told her there would be many Joinings in it, and therefore I thought it was fitter for a Back-head than a Suit [for a Suit has four Lappets, and a Back-head but two.] Then she said she would not buy it, and ask'd me if I thought I could dispose of it for an Acquaintance of hers. What is she? says I. A very honest Woman, says Mrs. Capstick; I know her very well, her Husband runs Goods. This Woman (which was Mrs. Grindley ) came in, and I ask'd her whose Head it was? and she said it belong'd to a Cap woman who had it from her Cull. How came it to be cut so? says I. Why, says she again, she's a very maggotly Creature, and she cut it when she was drunk. I bid Money for it then, but she refus'd it and went away. She came three or four times afterwards, and at last I bought it, and some Time after, I bought another of her; she came at several other Times with other Heads, but I did not buy any more than those two.</p>

No, says she, except this young Woman, (meaning me) for she has liv'd with an Old-Clothes Woman, and may know how to dispose of them. Then he told me he'd give me 6 d. to sell 'em for him. I took them from him, and he bid me ask 2 s. a Pair for the large, and 18 d. for the small ones. These are the same, I can swear.</p>

            , Sanders's Maid. The Prisoner came into my Mistress's Shop, and sat down in the great Chair and pull'd out some Head-clothes, and ask'd her if she could not be so good as to sell them for him. My Mistress would have had me to have gone, but he desir'd her to go herself; for he said it was a lac'd Suit that he had from the Duchess of Richmond's, and would have her ask eight Guineas for it. I have seen my Mistress pay him Money several times, and once she gave me in the Yard four Guineas and a half for him, and I carry'd it in and paid it to him.</p>

Can you have the Face, says I, to say that you did not deliver them to her? Why not, says he, when she has us'd me so barbarously as to bring a Constable to search my House? But what would you have a poor Woman do, says I, when the Goods were brought to her, and found upon her? Do? says he, why, she might have sent for me, and I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100017"/> have vouch'd that I saw her take 'em in Pawn, and that would have clear'd her and me too. From him I went to Mrs Sanders, and told her what he said. She answer'd, that she was innocent, and would not part with a Farthing. I acquainted him with her Answer, and he then sent me to her Husband to see if he would not lay down half the Crop. I went, but her Husband would not do any thing. I return'd to the Prisoner, and told him of it; And, says I, when she found that the Goods were stolen, she might think you might have them from some Thieves, and could have discover'd who they were. Ay, says he, and so I might have made a Noose for my own Neck. - Mrs. Sanders bears a good Character.</p>

Yesterday morning, before I and my Wife were up, there being only a Servant Girl below, I heard a Man come in and call for a Pint of Beer; it being a Stranger's Voice, I whipp'd up my Stockings and Breeches, and stepping to the Stairs-head, I look'd down and saw the Prisoner go to the Bar, take up a China Punch Bowl, and put it under his blue great Coat. My Girl came up with the Beer, and I presently went down. When he had drank his Pint he was going out very orderly; but I stopp'd him at the Door, and told him it was not kindly done of him to carry off my Punch Bowl. What do you mean? says he, I am the King's Officer, I have had an Information that you keep run China in your House; and I have Authority to search and take it where I find it. - Here's my Deputation. I ask'd him if he had a Deputation to go a Thieving, and not finding that he had, I carried him before a Justice, and the Justice committed him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I belong to the King, and to prove it, I have got my Deputation ready to produce. - Here it is. Then the Deputation was read. 'Tis dated Octo. 24, 1728. It impowers the Bearer, having a Constable and a Writ of Assistance, to enter Houses in the Day-time, and seize Goods prohibited, or for which the Custom has not been paid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have had several Informations of Tea and China being carry'd to the Prosecutor's House, and had no less than three when I went thither Yesterday to search.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any Constable or Writ of Assistance?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I can't say that I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Who gave you the Informations?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I must beg your Pardon there, Sir, we that are the King's Officers must never discover Informe rs.</p>

            , but I could find no such Names; she said she was going into the Country next Day by the Waggon, and wanted a Certificate to shew her Friends, and she beg'd of me to let her have one to save her poor Children from perishing. I told her I could not do any such Thing: - But at last I was over persuaded by her and Hicks, and let her have a Certificate, and entered it in the Book.</p>
               <p>Court. And did you do so wickedly?</p>
               <p>Hodgkins. Ah, my Lord! If you had but heard how she beg'd and pray'd and cry'd, I am sure you would have had some Compassion for the poor Creature.</p>
               <p>Court. And what did she give you for this Jobb?</p>
               <p>Hodgkins. Why, for searching the Books, and for the Certificate and Entry, I think I had 3 half Crowns.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the Book here?</p>
               <p>Hodgkins. No, the Attorney has it, I expect he will bring it immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100020"/>Court. You ought to be prosecuted instead of the Prisoner. You, that for the Lucre of 3 half Crowns, would wickedly make a false Entry, and bring false Evidence to charge a Man with the Cost of maintaining this Woman and her two Children; and now you come to swear against her, when you yourself did the Fact.</p>
               <p>Hodgkins. I am very sorry, my Lord, for what I have done, I humbly ask Pardon, and hope you'll excuse this one Fault. I never did any such Thing in my Life before, and never will again. And indeed I had not done it now, but that she said it would keep her poor Children from perishing, and I did not know there was any Sin in it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Hulman. Hearing that the Constable had taken the Prisoner, I went to the Ale-house where they were. The Prisoner told me, she never saw the Prosecutor before the last Thursday. I ask'd how she came to see him then, Why, says she, I was sitting upon the Steps at St. Clement's Church, and he spoke very kindly to me, and ask'd me, where I liv'd? I cry'd, and told him, I was run away from my Mother, who was a Basket Woman, and I had got the Itch. He said he won'd advise me how to get rid of the Itch, and ask'd me if I would go with him to clean his Rooms?</p>
