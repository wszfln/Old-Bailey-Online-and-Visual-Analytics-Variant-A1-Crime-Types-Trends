The prisoner and two other men came into my house on the 24th of January, about eight at night; they called for six-pennyworth of rum and water, and, after that, another. I made it; the prisoner asked me to drink; I did; there was then a silver mug, which weighed 28 ounces and a half, standing on the table, which some people had been drinking out of, which was missing after the three men were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons in that room before you missed the mug?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, there had not: we missed it in about two hours after they were gone. I was at home all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I never saw him before. I lost two tea-spoons out of the tea-chest, and a table spoon out of a closet in the same room, at the same time: I have since advertised them, but never heard any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people are of your family?</p>
               <p>Jones. I have a servant maid, a relation, and my wife.</p>

            . I live in Knaves-Acre, opposite the prosecutor's house: I was at Mr. Jones's that evening about eight o'clock; I saw three men come in; the prisoner was one of them; they called for six-penny worth of rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner was one of the three?</p>
               <p>Russell. I am.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. I am wife to the prosecutor. I remember three men coming into our house on the 24th of January; they came first about four that afternoon; they called for six-pennyworth of rum and water, pen and ink, and wanted a back room. I said our back room was full of company, they might go up stairs, but there was no fire. One of them said, Then we will go down there; I suppose, meaning some other house: then they turned round to me, and said, We will call again, and they went out. They all came in again much about eight, and called for six-pennyworth of rum and water, and went directly into the parlour: I made them six-pennyworth, and carried it in myself, and shut the parlour door, and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you carry it in?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. I carried it in a china bowl. When they went in, there was a silver mug on the table, and a large silver table spoon in a closet, and two spoons in a tea-chest. After that, my husband made them six-pennyworth of rum and water in the china bowl. I cannot take upon me to say I know either of the three men; there was a relation of mine, and a nephew of my husband's, at the same time at my house; they and the maid are here.</p>

            . I live in Rosemary-lane, about two hundred yards from the prisoner's house, which is up an alley, in Rag fair. The prosecutor is a Lascar; he came to my house that morning, without shoes or stockings, and told me he had been robbed, as he has now mentioned: I went with him to the prisoner's house, and took Mr. Cottrell along with us, he being a beadle, but neither the prisoner nor his wife were at home. We went to the public-houses to look for them, and was informed the man was at the Ship, in Well-street: we found him behind the bar, drinking a pint of purl; the prosecutor said he was the man. While we were talking with him, in came his wife; then the Lascar said, that is the woman: we took them away; but going along, they talked Irish together; so I took one, and Mr. Cottrell the other, to prevent their talking. We took them to the Justice in Whitechapel: before they were ready to examine them, the woman took this sash (which the Lascar calls his silk purse; it ties round him, and in which he ties up his money) she took it from under her arm, and was going to drop it, but a man took it out of her hand, and delivered it to me. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) When before the Justice, I opened it, and there were in it Two Guineas, a Rupee, and one Firnam: the woman was searched, and in her pocket was found Thirteen Shillings and Four-pence Half-penny, and a white purse. (The purse produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

            . I saw the prisoner, Spearing, take the calabash out of the copper, and give it to Bourn: he went away with it under his coat, and the other followed him: they were all three together.</p>
               <p>Humphry Jackson. I keep a chymist's shop in East Smithfield. On the Friday there was a bill thrown into my shop, giving an account, that a large quantity of aloes had been stolen from on board a ship, Captain Hall, master. I told my man, if any body brought any, to let me know. Spearing and Bourn came on the Saturday evening after; one of them took a gourd of aloes from under his coat, and asked me to buy it: I asked how much he asked for it? he said, two shillings a pound. I said, it was not worth my while to buy that alone, (this was to see if they had any more): he said, he came from on board a ship at Woolwich, and he had more. I agreed for the aloes at 20 d. per pound: on paying him the money, I said, I was afraid he would not let me have the remaining quantity, unless he would leave some money in my hands till he brought the others. I got him to leave two shillings; I think it came to fifteen shillings. As soon as they were gone, I sent my man to Captain Hall, in Burr-street, desiring him to come up; he came accordingly; I told him what I had done, and that the men were to come on the Monday following with the remainder of the aloes, or for their money; and said, if this was any part of his, he might take his measures accordingly: but before he came, Mr. Jebb came and told me, that two men were taken up upon the key, and carried before my Lord Mayor, and had given information, that they had sold a gourd to me. I went to my Lord Mayor, and gave the same account as I have now.</p>
               <p>Bourn's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was walking along the key; Spearing gave me that gourd, and desired I would take it for him; I took it, and Burgin took it from me, and carried it away. Spearing is a porter, and works there.</p>
               <p>Burgin's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was on the key, and met Spearing: he is a ticket-porter: he said, Take this stuff, it belongs to me. I took it: they told me, they sold it for fifteen shillings, and the doctor stopped two shillings till they brought the remainder.</p>
               <p>Spearing's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw Bourn but once in my life before. Burgin was my ship-mate; I was coming over Tower-hill; he said, How do you do, ship-mate? We went and got a pot of beer; he said he had got a thing; Do you know any apothecary's shop? I said, There is one just by: then he said, he had five more at Woolwich on board a ship.</p>

He brought three loaves, and put them on the table; I went with him to fetch more: he said I was to go to the Hermitage stairs, but he took me to a place almost to the King's brewhouse; there in the street, under a bit of a shutter, were three more loaves, which he delivered to me.

(There were three loaves of sugar produced in court, said to be brought from the constable's house; but the constable not being bound over, it could not be proved to be the identical sugar that the prisoner sold to the landlord.)</p>

            . I was at New Crane stairs the 25th of January, between ten and eleven; I had moored my boat, and got into the prosecutor's boat to come on shore: there was the prisoner only in her; the things were lying at the bottom of the boat, and a great quantity of rope lying upon them. He had a bit of a scull to bring her to shore; I said, Friend, how did you get this rope? he said he came from one Mr. Bray, above bridge. I said, You never could bring this boat through bridge with this piece of a scull; you are no waterman. Yes, said he, I am; and what is that to you, whether I am or not? I asked him where he was going? he first said, to a little man in a blue coat, who lived somewhere thereabout, and keeps boats. I mentioned several names, at last I mentioned Joyner; he said he believed that was the man. I stopped him, and took him to the watch-house, and staid with him till morning: he told me there, that a man gave him six-pence to bring her there; then he said he brought her from below bridge. I asked him where the six-pence was? he said he had spent it. He was taken before the bench of justices, where he said one Dangerfield, a fisherman, gave him the six-pence at Billingsgate. I went, by the justices order, to the house he described, but no such man was to be found. He was ordered to prison; after that, a captain of a brig came to me, and said he believed the rope was his property; he failed the next morning, and left word before he failed, that he would take his oath it was his property.</p>

               <p>The boat was driving with the tide; I was in a boat going to Deptford with a boy; I got out of that boat, and got into this, to carry her on shore, and should have left her there, if that man had not stopped me . I found her just below Rotherhithe stairs; I belong to a chimney-sweeper, and have no friend any nearer than Plymouth.</p>

On the 24th of January, about four in the afternoon, I was coming from the back part of my house into the shop; I saw the prisoner handling some stockings upon the counter; my little boy was behind the counter; I thought by the prisoner's folding up the stockings he belonged to the business. Looking through the glass, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270010"/> saw him put a pair under his coat: I stood a little longer to satisfy my curiosity, and after that I thought I saw them lying on the counter: my boy turning round to look for some stockings, then I saw the prisoner put a pair under his coat; then I went backwards, and called Mr. Pilkington from the kitchen, and told him there was a person in the shop stealing stockings, and desired he would come up, and help to secure him. He came, and placed himself on the stairs; then we saw the prisoner put another pair under his coat; then the boy took him to the other side of the shop, and shewed him some other stockings: he said they would not do; then he told the boy, he would call another time, and went out of the shop. Then Mr. Pilkington went and brought him back; the prisoner took a pair of stockings from under his coat, and begged I would forgive a poor young creature, who never did such a thing before. When Mr. Pilkington went for a constable, my maid said she saw the prisoner fling another pair of stockings behind the counter: I did not see him do it, but there I found them. When Mr. Pilkington came back, the prisoner took a knife, and attempted to cut his own throat; he did cut the skin, and cut himself a little on the belly. After he was in custody, he took out nine shillings, and offered to pay for the stockings; (the stockings produced,) one pair are my own make; here is my name upon them; the other have my shop mark upon them; they are both made of worsted.</p>

            . Mr. Greenhill called me up, as he has mentioned: I stood and saw the prisoner put a pair of stockings under his coat, and after he went out, I went after him. There are three steps at the door; he was got upon the last step. I tapped him on the shoulder, and desired him to come back again: he did, and immediately took the stockings from under his coat, and flung them on the counter, and went on his knees, and begged for mercy. I went out for a constable, and, when I came back again, the prisoner was at the upper end of the shop, cutting his own throat with a knife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have not been two months in London; I came from Chester with letters of recommendation to get into a counting-house, to Mr. Carwin, in Lime-street, and Mr. Power, a merchant; the latter is gone to the south of France for his health, so that I was obliged to rely upon Mr. Carwin, who did as much as possible, but could not succeed. Then I wrote down to Chester, and my friends sent me up five guineas, to bear my expences home, and pay what I owed here. I sent my things to the Swan and two necks in Lad-lane, to go down by the waggon, and intended to go down by the coach home again. I had been in St. James's-park: coming back, my stockings not being very good, I went into this shop to buy a pair: the young lad shewed me five or six pair: I fancied one pair in particular, and asked him the price; he said 4 s. 6 d. I bid him 3 s. 6 d. he said he could not take it: I recollected they were a pretty good pair; I offered him four shillings, and took them, and folded them up, in order to pay for them. I went to the door to look at them, and was coming in again, when the young man came and tapped me on the shoulder, and said I had stole a pair of stockings: I said I had not stole them, and threw down the money on the counter in order to pay for them. They searched me, and found nothing but my pocket-book and my own things about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Carwin? Is he here?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, he is not; I was ashamed to write to him, fearing he would write down to my friends, and they would never look upon me.</p>

I went down stairs, and found a ladder<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270011"/> was standing against the tyles, by the door; a parcel of tyles were taken off, and a hole made from thence down through the cieling, big enough for a man to get down, and the door was left open, where I suppose the thief went out; the door opens into the yard: there is no chamber over the wash-house. I went to the watch-house about seven; there I saw my linen and things mentioned in the indictment, and the prisoner was confined there. (The goods produced and deposed to).</p>

            . I am a watchman, in Marybone parish. Between the hours of two and three on Saturday morning, the 19th of January, I was standing behind a board in a dark corner, at the King George, in Portland-street, which is about half a mile from this woman's house. I heard a foot coming along pretty briskly from out of the fields: when he came opposite me, I pushed out; I had my lanthorn under my coat; I opened my coat and drew it out: I said, halloo, my friend, what have you got here? it was the prisoner: he said, nothing. I said it is something: then he said it is nothing to you; he had a great bundle under his coat: I said what is it? he said, it is nothing but a little bundle of wet linen, which he was going to carry home to his wife to dry and iron: I said, where does your wife lodge? he said, at the Hampshire-hog, St. Giles's, or by it. I said, is your wife a laundress? he said, yes. I said, where did you bring it from? he said, from a gentlewoman, at the Shepherd and Flock, at Marybone. I said, does your wife iron for a gentlewoman there? he said, yes. I said, it is a wrong time of night; how came you to carry it at this time of night? he said, he had been drinking with two or three of his countrymen, and they had been tossing up, and that made him later than he should have been: he said he was a very honest man, and I might go home with him to his wife, and she would tell me the same. I said, I had no business to go with him: he said, he had told who he had brought it from, and where he was going, and I had no business to stop him; and said, I did not know my business: he kept pushing forwards, but I took hold of him, and said he should go with me to the watch-house; he struggled to get away, and my dog came and jumped up towards his face; then he submitted. I got him to the watch-house about ten minutes before three. Going to call the hour three, I met a young man going to Marybone; I sent word by him to the Shepherd and Flock, that if any body there had sent any linnen out, or lost any, to come directly to me. When I had done calling the hour six, the woman and her husband came and owned the things, the same as laid in the indictment; it was all wrapped in one of the table-cloths. We took him before the justice; there he said, another was concerned with him, who had handed it out of the wash-house to him; I have forgot that man's name, but he was brought there. Then he sent for his landlady, who made it appear, he was in bed and asleep at the time. So he was discharged.</p>

            's; there he owned the linen was found in his custody, but that he did not break into the house: he said one Neal gave him the linen out of the house: Sir John desired me to go and take up Neal; I did; the man sent for his landlady and his bedfellow, and they made proof he was at home, and in bed at the time, in St. Giles's, and he was discharged: then the prisoner said, he did not know which way he came by the linen, being in liquor. I went to the house of Mr. Hall, and saw there was room enough broke for a man to go down into the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the wash-house join to the dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Anderson. It does.</p>
               <p>Pemberton. I saw the place that was broken: the house and wash-house join in the form of the letter L.</p>

               <p>I have no wife in England; I work'd for Mr. Foster, in Tyburn-road; he pays his men at the Rose and Crown: I happened to come in there for a slice of bread and cheese, and a pint of beer; two or three of the workmen came in, and we staid and drank there till it was late: I was after going home every minute, and asked what o'clock it was? they said it was ten o'clock, and another time said it was eleven; they kept me till twelve. When I left the house, I was going home, but a man met me, and asked me if I would go with him and earn six-pence? I said, yes, and thank him too: I said, where? he said to Marybone: he brought me to a house, and kept me till we had five or six pints of beer, but where this Neal parted with me, I cannot tell, or whether he was the man that gave me the linen, I cannot tell: that man brought me to Marybone, brought a bundle to me, and put it on my head, and some things in my pocket; he bid me carry them to Hanover-square;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270012"/> and said, if I do not come soon, pitch your load till I come: I never miss'd the man till I was stopped by the watchman; he asked me where I was going? I looked about, and did not see the man; I was surprized: what I said I cannot tell: I knew nothing of what pass'd till I found myself in the watch-house the next morning: the watchman, when he was bringing me to the watch-house, said he would swear my life away, in order to get the reward; he told me I was a gone man. I have two small orphans, and a helpless father, in Dublin: I hope the honourable court will consider my innocence in this affair: I am a bricklayer's labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pemberton. Did the prisoner appear disguised in liquor, when you met with him?</p>
               <p>Pemberton. No, he did not, at all.</p>

I don't know the time they were lost: I think I miss'd them the 27th or 28th of last month, that was the day they were stopt: Colonel Dean informed me he was at Mr. Welch's, upon the bench, and examined the prisoner, and asked him if he had any body to his character, and he mentioned me; I went there, but the prisoner was gone to gaol before I got there: the prisoner had worked for me, in my yard, but was discharged a day or two before: I saw these two glasses at the justice's (produced in court): I make no doubt but they are the same that were taken from Mrs. Bland's coach, by the lining of the coach being the same as the cloth over the frames, and the tassels; and the frames are a little more ovaled on the tops than is common: then I went to New-Prison; there I saw the prisoner: he said he was as innocent as the child unborn, and would confess nothing.</p>

            . I am a journeyman salesman to Mr. Dawson, in Monmouth-street: between six and seven o'clock, on the 28th of January, the prisoner came into my master's shop; he wanted a furtout coat, and wanted to change these two glasses for one: he asked 40 s for them: I asked him how he came by them; he said he gave 20 l. for a hackney coach, which he had broke up, and they were the glasses: my master desired me to charge a constable with the prisoner; I did, and carried him to Mr. Welch's office: he said there, he was coming by the Marlborough-meuse, and a man came to him. and asked where he was going; that he answered to the Golden Leg, in Long-Acre; that the man desired him to carry the glasses there, and he would come to him; that he carried them, and left them there two days; and the man never came: and he had been there, and was car rying them to the place where he had them, when he came into our shop.</p>
               <p>Shadreck Venden. I am a coach-maker: I made Mrs. Bland's coach: I very believe these two glasses to be the glasses belonging to her coach; the lineing of the frame is the same as the lining of the coach; and the frames are made rising, as the coach is rising over the doors; and the canvass shutters, that I have brought from the coach, answer exactly; there is not one glass in a hundred will match the place as these do.</p>

I was coming from Putney Bowling-green, and overtook the prisoner, driving the six hogs, last Monday was fortnight: I first saw him just above Putney: I went down into the town, and staid some time, and overtook him again beyond the Three Goat's-heads: I asked him, where he was going with them? he said, to sell them; and that he brought them out of Berkshire: I said, it was a wonder he did not go to Smithfield with them; he said, he should be too late there, and he was going into the Borough with them. I asked the price of the best of them; he said 25 s. at last he would have sold it me for 18 s. then he said, he wished he could sell them all together: I said, what will be the price, to take them all together; he said 15 s. apiece: I said, I did not know but I could help him to a chap, if he would sell them worth the money, then he came to thirteen shillings apiece: then I went on to the Three Goat's-heads, and said to Mr. Johnson, here is a man coming along with a parcel of hogs; I am satisfied he has stole them, for they are worth as much more as he asks for them; so he let the man put them into his stable: I went on, and when I came to the Goat's-head again, the owner of the hogs came: when the prisoner saw him, he begged for mercy.</p>

I said to London: he said, I shall be too late; if you'll be so good as to drive these hogs to town for me, I'll give you a couple of shillings: he desired me to go over Kew-bridge, and so to Vaux-hall; and, if I could light of a chap, to sell them, as money would be of more service to him than the hogs.

               <p>Q. Was she searched?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. No, I was afraid to search her; the other two prisoners were in the room with her; but I never left her till the time I took her to the watch-house: I would not let her go out of the room: I stood at the door: one of the women took me by the collar, and tore my shirt; and took up a pint pot, and swore she would knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the other women meddle with your pocket?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. No: they were not near it; they all three came at me at once; when I would not let them go out of the room, they knock'd my hat into a tub of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your half crowns again?</p>

               <p>Smith. I heard Edwards say she would give the man his money again; but one Foliot had got the money, and said she might go and be d - d, he would not part with it.</p>

In about ten minutes after they were gone, I took the loose handkerchiefs up, and found the board was cleared of one row, about a yard in length; I could not tell what I had miss'd, till the next morning: the first pattern I miss'd was a piece of fine blue borders, twenty-one handkerchiefs; I miss'd about a dozen or fifteen of red and white, then three parcels of another pattern of red and white, of what we call spoiled work, they were not cleared at the printers. I lost more, that I cannot describe, having such a great quantity. I went to Mr. Fielding, for his advice: he advised me to advertise; I did, and printed some hand-bills, and sent them to the pawnbrokers. One of my men told me, that Field-lane was a great place for handkerchiefs, and such things: I sent both my men there, they saw two parcels at Mrs. Taylor's, and bought each of them a handkerchief. The gentlewoman having seen the advertisement, went to Mr. Fielding with the handkerchiefs: when I came there, to get a search-warrant, she was there, and said she bought them of the three prisoners at the bar; this was on the Saturday morning, (several pieces of handkerchiefs produced in court, some good and some spoiled work. He takes up two parcels) I am sure these two parcels were in my shop, when the prisoners were in my shop; they are my property. Mrs. Taylor told us where the prisoners lodged, by Hicks's-hall. When we came there, they had quitted their lodging about a fortnight before, in the night: Mrs. Taylor told us they had sold some more to a person in Field-lane, and were to come there again in the evening; she got a constable, and took the two women, the man got away; then she sent for me: I went to them; they had them at a public house going down Holbourn-hill; I knew them to be the same people. I charged them with having robbed me; they pretended they knew nothing of me; they were sent to the counter: the man going to the constable's house, to ask what they had done with his mother and wife, the constable secured him, and took him to the counter, and on Monday I had them all three before my Lord Mayor, and swore to my goods. I have not found any more of them. Here are twenty handkerchiefs of what we call spoiled work, and I have the other half-piece at home, belonging to one of these. The man told my Lord Mayor, that he lodged at the house of one Magennis, the George, in Broad St. Giles's; but when he came there, we found he did not, nor ever did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you say the women stood?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. They stood just by the door, coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is your house?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. At the corner of Mitre-court, Fleetstreet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the women been in, before the man came in?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. He came in about three or four minutes after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at the same counter they were at, or the other?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. He was at the same counter, but farther up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he abide long in your shop?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. He did not stay long; but it is possible the women might give him some of the handkerchiefs as he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible he could conceal them from your seeing them?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. They will lie in a little room; I have pieces of handkerchiefs that cost ten guineas a-piece; you may put two pieces of them in one pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the women went out, and returned again; had you missed any before they came in again?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. No, I had not; they were covered with light goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the goods before or after the the gentlewoman who was in your shop went away?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. I missed them after she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss your goods before Mr. Pelteroe went away?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. No, I did not, till after he was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270016"/>Q. Did you observe the women, when they went away?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. No, I did not; neither did I observe which way they went: I could not see the bottom part of them for the piles of handkerchiefs that were between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they could be taken away in their aprons?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. I think one apron could take away three times as much.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you imagine they could take away such a quantity?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. As they lay piled up, one hand could sweep them all into an apron; I could see their faces, but could not see their hands; the piles of handkerchiefs were breast-high.</p>

            . I live in Field-lane, and sell linen handkerchiefs, cheques, and old cloaths; I deal with hawkers; I have dealt with the prisoners at the bar ever since the 13th or 14th of December last: they came sometimes with wallets, and sometimes bundles under their arms: they brought large quantities of goods; they usually brought silk and cotton: I never saw them have linen, till these two parcels I bought on the 7th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did they come to your shop?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It might be about five in the afternoon. They were all three in company; they asked me as usual if I wanted any thing; they said they had some very handsome blue-bordered ones; (the prosecutor produced a handkerchief with a blue border) they were like this; but I said they were too fine for me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Such I missed.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I bought a dozen of handkerchiefs, fancy-grounds, or mosaic; my man came in, and bid them money for some damaged ones; they would not take his money; they went away, and called the next day, and asked if he would advance any thing more; I said I did not care whether I had them or not. Then they took the money he bid, and I paid them: I gave them 18 s. a dozen for the first parcel, and 14 s. a dozen for the damaged ones, and hung some of them out in the street for sale. The prosecutor's two men came and bought each a handkerchief; our people said they behaved very comically: I was then afraid there was something amiss, and my man read of such goods being stolen in the Advertiser. I went to Mr. Fielding's with them; the gentleman came there, and said he believed they were his goods, (these are the same here produced); then I was ordered to take up the people that brought them. I had taken a receipt of them the first time I bought of them, and at that time I asked who they served besides me: the man named four shops; we enquired at the places where they said they lived, and Mr. Fielding's man and my man went to the places where they had lived. I was afterwards going up Holbourn, I met the two women above Turnstile; I made a full stop; I thought they seemed to shun me: I asked them if they had any more handkerchiefs to sell; they said they had none with them: said I, Can you go home and fetch some, and the wife that is big with child may stay at my house the while. Then they went faster, and I could not follow them so fast: I called out for people to stop them; they ran up a place, and were taken, and brought to my house, and charged with a constable. Two or three hours after that the man came to another house in the lane, and said Mrs. Taylor had taken up his wife, and he would ruin her. When he came to my house, and asked where his wife was, I said, she is in one of the counters; my man went with him to the constable, and the constable took him in custody, and carried him to his wife: then we sent to Mr. Greenfield to come; he came, and said they were the same persons.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take the prisoners to be?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I took them to be hawkers: sometimes the man had a pack over his shoulders, and sometimes under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all together when you bought the things?</p>
               <p>Taylor. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in these handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any licence they had?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, I never did: they always told me they dealt in Spital-fields.</p>

I shewed them some; they took it to the door to look at it; as they were looking at it a man came in, but I cannot swear to him. About two hours before, we had six dozen of silk handkerchiefs just came in from the weaver's: I had examined them, and they were lying on the counter, on the right side going in, two or three yards from the door.

I went back, and asked Mr. Smith if he had lost any thing? they were looking for the stockings. Then we went after the boys; he went one way and I went another: I found the prisoners, and laid hold of Wood, and said he must go with me: he said, for what? I said, where are the stockings you have taken? he bid me lay hold of Harrison: after that, he owned he had got them, and would fain have given them to me: I brought them both back: we got a constable: Wood took the stockings out of his pocket, and Harrison said he knew nothing of Wood, and Wood did not own he knew him; they were taken before my Lord Mayor; there Wood said, he picked them up at the door; but over night he owned he had taken them away from the shop.</p>

            , my servant, and I went up into the bedchamber; we found all my drawers pulled out, my writings had been examined, and my money gone: the solding leaf of my bureau was unlocked, and down, and a chissel, that I imagine it was broke open with, was lying on the leaf: I missed a 10 l. Bank note that I had received the day before, and cash to the amount of near 20 l. and two pair of silver buckles. I was up in the room about half an hour after seven that night, to change a six-and-nine-pence, and all was right then: there was a pane of glass taken out, so that they could get at the hook that fastens the sash down. I suspected the prisoner, by the character I heard of him, and his manner of living: I took him on the 6th of this instant, at a breeches-makers, at the Seven-dials; I found one pair of my silver buckles upon him; there was a woman and a man with him, in his room, which was up one pair of stairs backwards. I found also eleven guineas and a half, a 36 s. piece, a shilling, and three crown pieces; two of King Charles's, and a French crown: the two English ones I had marked with a scratch on the King's head; one was marked about four years ago, and the other about fourteen months: I saw them taken out of his left side breeches pocket. (Produced and deposed to).</p>
               <p>Q. What was your design in making these scratches on them?</p>
               <p>Compton. They were my wife's money, and she fancied them, and I marked them, fearing they should be lost. I gave 4 s. 6 d. for the French piece, in the tap room, and have had it about a year and a half; these always lay by, as medals, The prisoner had made a present of the other pair of buckles, to the man that was in the room with him (Both pairs produced and deposed to): the buckles and money were all in my bureau. The prisoner said, before Justice Welch, that man was not concerned with him in the robbery, but that he gave him the buckles. I lost one 36 s. among my money; the rest was silver, small gold, and guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose eleven guineas?</p>
               <p>Compton. I can take upon me to say there were above fourteen guineas in my bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your Bank note again?</p>

            . I am constable of the hundred of Holbourn division. On the 5th of this instant, hearing Mr. Compton had been robbed, I went to his house, and in the afternoon on the same day we met with a young man, who was an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner's, who led us to the prisoner's lodgings, in Earl-street, Seven-Dials, at a breeches-maker's. We had a warrant to apprehend his body, and another to search; but the latter being made general, and not confined to any house. I made application to Justice Welch, for a warrant to search his lodgings. I sent two officers, Langridge and Sowery; they returned, and said, there was nothing there. I applied to the man where the prisoner lodged, told him our suspicion, and asked his assistance. He promised all in his power. I got a grant for the two constables to sit up in his shop all night, to wait his coming in; and the next morning, being Wednesday the 6th, between eight and ten, the officers informed me the prisoner was within the house. I went with them up stairs, and rushed into the room, and took him. Seeing a man and woman with him, I desired the prosecutor to come forward, and give charge, which he did. While one of the constables was hand-cussing him, I searched him; in his breeches pocket I found eleven guineas and a half in gold, and a 36 s. piece. When I pulled the money out, I said, Compton, I fancy you cannot charge your memory with any of these: he said he knew there was a 36 s. piece among his money. I put that money in my pocket, and searched his waistcoat pockets; there I found these three crown pieces, one was a French crown, and a pair of silver buckles: Mr. Compton immediately said, I'll swear they are my property. I asked the prisoner how he could be so wicked to rob the poor man of all this? his answer was, I did do it, and I cannot deny it. I asked him if he had got any accomplice, and begged he would discover them for the good of the public; he said, he had none, for he did the robbery, and no man else. I asked him what he had done with the rest of the money? he said he had disposed of it: I asked him if it was anywhere where it might be recovered; he said, No, he had paid some debts with part of it, and he had fetched some cloaths out of pawn, and he had paid a chandler's shop bill, and his rent. I asked him to tell me where the 10 l. bank note was, which then I had not found; he said it was disposed of. I pray'd him to tell me; he would not discover it. I ordered the constable to search the woman and the room; the prisoner immediately said it was not in the room. I asked him again to tell me where it was, and said I would endeavour to prevail with the prosecutor to allow him something to keep him while in gaol; he said, then if I would give him a guinea and a half to keep him while in gaol, he would tell me where it was. I told him I would, when the note was produced: he would not trust me; I gave him a guinea and a half, and he told me to search a private place in his breeches; we did, and there it was found. We hand-cuffed the other man that was with him, and took them both to Justice Welch. The woman was searched by a constable afterwards, and brought likewise. When we came there, the Justice asked the prisoner what he had got to say for himself; he confessed the same to the Justice as I have here related.</p>

               <p>Q. WAS any thing said, as to the manner of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Clay. I asked him how he could go to do such a daring robbery, at that time of the night, alone? he said, he did do it, but was in great confusion. Mr. Welch permitted me to ask him, where the other pair of buckles were: he said, he had hid them in Marybone-fields: I said, if I took him there, could he find the place? he said, no: immediately upon that, the young man, who was hand-cuffed, said, I have them in my pocket. Then Mr. Welch said to him, You have been concerned with this man: the prisoner generously cleared him, and said he gave him the buckles, as he sat in the bed, and that he knew nothing how he came by them: there was a chissel found on or by the prosecutor's bureau. Mr. Welch permitted me to ask the prisoner what sort of a handle the chissel had; whether made of wood, or what kind of one it was? he answered, it had no wood handle to it; he said it was an iron chissel, with a square sort of a socket, (the chissel produced, and corresponded with the account the prisoner gave). I saw the window where the ladder was set; he might get from the ladder upon some tyles, and open the window: I found a pane of glass lying on the tyles, on the shed.</p>

               <p>They asked me, if I knew any thing of the breaking open this house, or if I knew the back-door? I said I knew the back-door; he said, I suppose you know my back-window: I said, I believed I had seen it: he asked me if I took the ladder up, after I had opened the window? I said I had not done it, and that I knew nothing of its he asked me what sort of a chissel it was that I broke open the drawers with: I said I did not know: he said, has it a wooden handle? I said, it might be without a handle, for what I know I know nothing at all of the fact, any farther than what they forced me to say: I believe I have sufficient evidence to prove I was at the sign of the Crown, in West-Smithfield, at the time they say the window was broke. I parted with a man at Upper. Turnstile, Holbourn, and called at my wife's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270023"/> mother's, in St. Gyles's, and it was between nine and ten o'clock when I went home.</p>

            . I happened to call at Mr. Edwards's, at the Crown, at Smithfield-bars, on a Monday night: I believe it was last Monday was a fortnight: it was that night this fact was committed. After we had drank two pints of beer, I went up with him as far as Turnstile, Holbourn, between eight and nine o'clock, as near as I can guess; then I went home, to my master's house, named Gumbey; he is a distiller in High Holbourn. I saw nothing of the prisoner afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity was he?</p>
               <p>Tyner. He drawed beer for me: on the Tuesday morning, about a quarter after six, I was dressing myself in my own room; the boy at the bar was coming down stairs: we burning a rush-light, lighted a candle, and bid him light a fire in the p-room, and said I would be down presently: when I came down, the candle was standing on the table, and the tap-room door open and no fire, and the boy was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go down after him?</p>
               <p>Tyner. I believe I went down in about five minutes after him; I found the bar-door unlocked; my wife had put nine guineas in the drawer, over night, at about half an hour after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her put it in?</p>
               <p>Tyner. I did: on the next day, being Wednesday, I was riding after him for Essex, and heard of him in Whitechapel, and found him in the custody of a constable, who had taken him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. How could that lad get at your money?</p>
               <p>Tyner. I had pulled my key out of my pocket, and gave it to my wife, to put the money into the till, and she left the key in the bar: we found it, with others, upon the prisoner: the boy told me he found it in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money found upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tyner. There was a silver watch, and some money found upon him; he had no watch when he was with me.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the bladder I put my money in.</p>
               <p>Galatley. I could find no such person as he mentioned: the prisoner said he had bought a watch at the Cross Keys, a sale-shop in High Holbourn: I went there, to inquire the truth of that; I found he had bought it there: I asked the man what he gave for it; he said that was nothing at all to me, the boy had paid for it; he took it out of my hand and gave it to the boy, and desired him to keep it: I was afraid the boy might throw it away, and I begged of the man to ask the boy for it: when he found I was a peace officer he was sorry for what he had done; he got it again of the boy, and delivered it to me: it seemed to be a good watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain that was the day?</p>
               <p>Segwick. I am; that day the boy at the bar, and two men, came in at the White Hart, and called for six-pennyworth of warm brandy and water; when they had drank it, the boy pulled out this bladder, and laid down a 5 s. 3 d. piece, and desired change for it; they then ordered another six-pennyworth: one of the men said, landlady, bring us a glass, that we may all drink alike: I said, you don't use the boy well, to make him drink as you do; it will be time enough for that ten years hence: I asked that man if the boy was any relation of his: the man said he was the boy's uncle: I asked the boy if he was his uncle; the boy said no, and winked, as though he wanted to speak with me; I went out of the box I was sitting in, and took him into the next room; I asked him how he came by that money, and how much he had got: he said he had lived three years in service, in Essex, and that he had three pounds a year at each place: I asked him who found him cloaths all the time; he said his father: I asked him to let me look at the money, what he had left, there was 2 l. 17 s. 9 d. as he was putting the money in his pocket I saw a seal hang down; I asked him if he had a watch? he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270025"/> Yes, He said, he had been changing watches with one of the two men: then we went into the room again, where the two men were sitting. I I asked the man, (not him that said he was the boy's uncle) if he had changed watches with the boy? he said, What was that to me; but when he found I was a peace officer, he said he had: I asked him if he gave the boy any thing in exchange? the boy said he had given the man two guineas and a crown. It was an old watch that belonged to the man. I desired him to return the money and take his watch; he refused it: then I said I should take him before a magistrate, and let him decide it. I then took them all three before Justice Darling: they had made the boy drunk: the boy then told me he had an uncle at Hyde-Park Corner, and after that he said he had not: the Justice ordered him to give the money to me, and the man to refund the two guineas and a crown. After they had been examined, the Justice desired me to go and see whether he had an uncle at Hyde-Park Corner, or whether he had bought that watch, as he had said. I begg'd the favour of his worship (the next day being execution day at Tyburn, and I was to attend) that he would let the headborough go with the boy: so Mr. Galatley went.</p>

There was one Ball first taken he gave evidence against Cook; I went and took Cook in St. Catherine's: I put him in the Poultry Compter that night; he told me where the three prisoners were to be found; that was at Taylor's house, in an alley in St. Catherine's, called Mouse-alley: there I saw a woman who told me her name was Taylor, and said her husband was gone out: Cook said they had been robbing several people, and he was sure we should find some linen there: I searched, and found about two dozen and a half of napkins, and some towels; I brought these things here out of the house; I found them in the lower part of the house, and the prosecutrix came to Sir

            . Taylor, Perry, and I, did this Robbery: it was at Poplar, about ten weeks or three months ago, about midnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before, or since Christmas?</p>
               <p>Cook. Since Christmas, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week?</p>
               <p>Cook. I don't know. We got over several yards, and the door was upon the latch we went in at. There stood a pot with some water in it; I took and handed that to Taylor, over the pales; it was a larger pot than either of these. I had that at home till I was taken up, and my house-keeper says she sold it to by victuals for the children. That was burst at the sides.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts did you find that?</p>
               <p>Cock. It stood on the left hand of the back-door, by the side of the house, some distance from the house: Perry was in the next garden, and Taylor came over to me: he pulled out his pistol and gave it to me, while he handed the pots and things over the pales; he and I went in, and struck a light; he always carried a tinder-box, candle, and dark lanthorn.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270027"/>Q. Where did you take the pottage-pots from?</p>
               <p>Cook. They were standing edge-ways on a form, and the other things on the mantle-piece: the plates were on a shelf: we took six plates, five candlesticks, four pottage-pots and covers, two sauce-pans, a pestle and mortar, a pair of scales, and a white apron that lay upon a chest of drawers, in the kitchen: after we had handed them to Perry, we took them among us, some in our pockets, and some in bags that we had, and carried them to Perry's house; we got there between two and three o'clock; the prisoners lived all together.</p>
               <p>Q. What share did you carry?</p>
               <p>Cook. I carried the plates, the large pot and candlesticks: we went first into a field with some fowls we had stole and left there: a few days after we shared them: after that Taylor gave me two sauce-pans for one of my pots. Ball was taken up first, and he impeached me, and I was taken up about a month after the things were shared: he knew nothing of this fact, only we told him of it; Sparrow was not with us in this: I lived about 200 yards from Perry's house, in St. Catherine's Lane.</p>
               <p>The prosecutrix was called in, who was sent out of court while Cook gave his evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Had you any thing taken from the yard?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes; a larger pot than any of these was standing in the yard, with rain-water in it; that I never saw since.</p>
               <p>Q. how near the back-door did it stand?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. About six or seven yards; it was burst, and ran out at the ears.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any linen?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I lost an apron out of the kitchen, but I did not put that in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cook. I was at the Rising-Sun at Hackney, about five weeks ago; Perry, Taylor, and Ball were there: Ball was taken; they said he would impeach them, and they said they would go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Ball live?</p>
               <p>Cook. He lodged in Sun-Yard, within about a hundred yards of Perry's house.</p>
               <p>Perry. He used to bring fowls and things to my house when I was in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. to Evans. What sort of powder was that which you miss'd?</p>
               <p>Evans. The two half barrels were what they call single M. that is pretty small; there is smaller and there is larger: we miss'd some very small and some very large, and some middling.</p>
               <p>Q. to Callow. What did you give a pound for it?</p>
               <p>Callow. I gave three shillings for five or six pounds: I can't be a judge what it was worth; I never weighed it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Evans. What was the powder worth a pound, that was missing?</p>
               <p>Evans. The fine was worth about 14 d. per pound, the other a shilling.</p>
               <p>Callow. On the 20th of January they brought more powder, and asked the landlord and others to buy it: and on the 21st the prisoner, Ball, Cook and Perry, came with a canvass bag of powder. I believe it to be about 30 lb. weight in all; nobody would buy any of it.</p>

            . Taylor and I went and fetched four barrels of powder away one Saturday night, in the month of August, about nine at night, from a place called Jones's field, near Wapping chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get in?</p>
               <p>Cook. Taylor had a key that unlocked the door; we took it out of the powder-house in that field; they were what they call half barrels, fifty pounds each: Taylor had a bundle of keys. The head of one of the barrels was out, it was not quite full; there were two tubs of it glazed powder, very small; one tub was mixed, it was small and large powder: we carried two tubs to the top of the field, and set them down, and went back again and fetched two more, and locked the door: then we carried them to Taylor's house; we were stopped by two custom-house officers, and I told them what it was, and they let us go: we disposed of three tubs to a man at Wandsworth, either on the Monday or Tuesday after; we took it on the Saturday: we carried it in two butter firkins to Queenhithe, and sent it up; and we went up and met it: we had agreed for 8 d. per pound before: when we came there the man said, if we would not take two guineas for it we might take it back again; so we took the two guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Cook. There was about an hundred and half of it; some we sold to other people: that we did not sell was not glazed, it was a small sort of powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sell the mixed powder?</p>
               <p>Cook. That went to Wandsworth: I was in company with the prisoner at the Rising Sun, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you to Wandsworth?</p>
               <p>Cook. Taylor did; he was with me at Hackney: we had some in little bags, and sold some to chandlers-shops, and to two or three people about: we had sold some at the Rising Sun two or three times; the last time we were there we left about 20 lb. weight with the landlord, that was too large for shooting.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was there at that time?</p>
               <p>Cook. There were Ball, Taylor, Perry, and I. Last Monday it was five weeks ago since we went there first.</p>

            . I have known Sparrow about a year and a half; he is a sawyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Farmer?</p>
               <p>Cook. Yes; he is a goose-feeder: I was in his field and his yard, about two months, or better, ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before Christmas or after?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was since Christmas: I know the prisoner did not come home from Twittenham till Christmas-eve; and it was after he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. What can a sawyer get a week?</p>
               <p>Cook. They can get sixteen or seventeen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you, when you was in Mr. Farmer's yard?</p>
               <p>Cook. There were Sparrow and his mate: I do not know his name, any farther than we called him Thomas, and Ball; Sparrow and Ball broke the gate open, with a wrench they had, and pulled it open together.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a wrench?</p>
               <p>Cook. It is a thing that was made to screw the breech of a gun with; they always carried it with them: I fancy Ball had his hands to the gate, and Sparrow had the wrench: then Ball, I, and Sparrow's man went in: that door was about the middle of the place where the turkeys were, between the field and the yard: the prisoner stood at the door, with the broken end of a screw-gun; it screwed in three place: he had lost the piece that belonged to the shoulder; so the muzzle end of the barrel was left at home. The piece he had, had the lock and breech of the barrel on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270030"/>Q. Was the gun charged?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was; I brought out two turkeys: as soon as I came out I heard a dog bark; Sparrow's man came next, with three; the dog flew at him, and he threw a turkey at him: then Ball came out with two turkeys, and the dog flew at Sparrow, and catched him by the heel: I, seeing the dog at him, ran away with my two turkeys, and saw no more of them, but went home by myself, and lay at my own house: I got home between one and two, and went to bed directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of them that night after?</p>
               <p>Cook. No, I did not; only my four children, that lay with me in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Ball lie with you that night?</p>
               <p>Cook. No: Ball did lie with me one night; when we got some fowls, but that was before Christmas; he lay a-cross the bed's feet: the next morning I saw either Ball or Sparrow's man; they told me Sparrow was bit: then we went over the water, and sold the turkeys that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that you carried them over the water?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was either Friday or Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turkeys had you in all?</p>
               <p>Cook. We had six; we sold five on the other side the water and one on this side: the next morning I went to see Sparrow; he was in bed at Perry's house, in Mouse-alley: he wanted me to get him some beer-dregs, to make a poultice to put to his leg; I went and got some the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he confined with this lameness?</p>
               <p>Cook. He was confined three weeks, or better: he never went out with us afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken?</p>
               <p>Cook. I don't know: I was in prison when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts was his wound?</p>
               <p>Cook. He was bit very much behind, just below the calf; the dog's teeth came through.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. I desire to know what man that was which you call mine?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was a man they called Thomas, which the prisoner brought from Twittenham; he knew of a place where were then fowls, at Twittenham; and Sparrow, he, and I, went there and fetched them by night.</p>
               <p>Ball called in again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ball. Do you know any thing of a wrench?</p>
               <p>Ball. I have one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that with you when you took the turkeys?</p>
               <p>Ball. To the best of my knowledge we had not that with us that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the door open?</p>
               <p>Ball. To the best of my knowledge we pulled it open with our hands?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you lay at Cook's the remainder part of that night, along with him?</p>
               <p>Ball. I am sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else were in bed at the time?</p>
               <p>Ball. There were three children with him: I lay on the side of the bed: I did not strip.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turkeys did Cook take?</p>
               <p>Ball. He took two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went home with him?</p>
               <p>Ball. He was gone away before I came out with the turkeys.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cook. You see how you two differ in this circumstance.</p>
               <p>Cook. To the best of my knowledge he did not lie there that night.</p>

            . I live at Towcester, in Northamptonshire, and am a staymaker; the prisoner was taken there one Sunday morning, five weeks ago to-morrow, for having stole some things: I saw him searched; there was the part of a gun found upon him that contains the lock, and breech of the barrel, it was in his side pocket: he had also a cannister, with a great deal of gunpowder in it. I came up to town with him. (The part of a gun produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Cook. This is the part of a gun that the prisoner stood with at the door.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor: about a fortnight before the 24th of January, the prisoner was at my door with a little baby in her arms, and was frighted at a drove of cattle that went by; the seemed sickly. I asked her to come in and sit down with her baby; I never saw her before that time; and on the 24th of January she came to my door again, and thank'd me for my civility, when she was so frightened with the cattle, and said her little baby was dead. I asked her to sit down; she sat till my husband came to dinner, and would send for a pot of twopenny; she drank to my husband, when he came in; she said she was very bad with her breasts when we were at dinner: I said I could not draw them with a full stomach, but if she would come again, in about an hour and a half, I would draw them for her; she came again in that time, and I drew them for her; then she would insist upon having a dram; I sent a little boy for it: I had some suspicion of her after that; she desired me to lend her a looking-glass; I shut the door while she used it, and was looking another way: I believe she then took the watch; for, as soon as she was gone, I miss'd it; she gave me a false direction to come to draw her breasts the next morning: after I miss'd the watch I went and told my husband.</p>

I told him what we had lost; he came and let us know that he had seen some chairs in the prisoner's apartment: then we got a warrant, and took him before the sitting Alderman: there he said he had bought the chairs: we found seven chairs and a bedstead in Blue Anchor Yard, Bunhill-row, in the prisoner's lodgings, our property: we found afterwards a four post bedstead that the prisoner had sold to a broker in Bunhill-row: the prisoner always denied taking the things.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father; I live in Moor's Alley Norton Falgate; he came to my House on the Tuesday fortnight before Christmas Day; I was to pay my Landlord's rent on Michaelmas day: my son wanted things in his house where he was going to live; I said, if you think well to bring your work and work with me till I make up my half year's rent, you may: he came that Tuesday, and staid with me till Christmas-eve; he, I, and my wife, lay in one bed that Tuesday night; he never was out of the bed a night, only Thursday night and Friday night, when we worked almost all night to get the money up; and as soon as I got the money up, I paid my landlord on Christmas-eve, and he went away, and did not come near me for two nights. I swear positively he was in the bed with me every night, but these two nights, at eleven at night, and these two nights we sat up to work.</p>

            . Sinnet and I got in at a window in Mr. Pitchard's house, by the help of a ladder. We took the till and about 5 s. in halfpence, and the other things mentioned in the indictment. (Mentioning cash very exactly, and how marked.) This was between two and three in the morning, about six weeks ago. I was bred just by; but I went into the shop the day before, to see which way to do it; so when we were in at the window, we went down stairs, and into the dining-room, and then the counting-house: we had a dark lanthorn. When we had done, we put the ladder in the place where we took it from. We carried the things to the prisoner's room, St. Giles's; there we shared the halfpence; we broke some of the plate, and sold some to a Jew for a guinea and a half, and a shilling; and that we broke we sold for eight shillings and three pence. I have been acquainted with Sinnet four or five years; we lived next door to one another.</p>

               <p>Williamson. I keep the Bee-hive, in Leadenhall-market; they beg'd the favour of me to let them sit down, for they were much in liquor; Tupnail brought in some shoes and boots, I can't tell how many pair; they had two bottles with some rum in them, almost full; there was, I believe, a roquelo and coat; but I bid my boy take care of the things, which he did, and Tupnail went away. The prisoner and Smith sat about half an hour; then they said they would have something to drink; they had a shilling in rum and water; they drank it and sent the shilling and bowl up to me; after that they sat the best part of an hour, and ordered sixpennyworth of rum and water more: I made it and carried it to them; about ten minutes after that Smith had a pennyworth of purl; about eight o'clock Mr. Tupnail came from Mr. Stevens's, the packer, the next door to me, and ordered a pot of purl there: then they insisted upon his drinking with them, so he had a pint of purl; then they all went away together, with the boots and shoes, and every thing they brought with them.</p>

Smith said I have got the other; he came back again; he had got a bottle of wine in his hand, with the cork drawn; he asked us to drink: we drank cut of the bottle; and at that time the prisoner came up: he seeing the door open, he went down Mr. Taylor's passage six or eight yards: my partner asked him where he was going? he said he wanted to go to bed; he took him by the arm, and led him out again: then they both said they wanted a lodging: I told them it was too early in the morning, being almost day-light, it was not worth their while to go to bed: I said I could take them to a house where was good fare, and they might stay there, which would be better than tumbling about the street. I took a candle and lanthorn, and light them by the India warehouse; the prisoner refused to go: Smith said, do not mind him, for he is my man: I went with them to the Bee-hive, and told Mr.

On Wednesday morning, the 20th of February, Mr. Tupnail called me up to go to work: we got into Leadenhall-street just about five o'clock: I rang the bell at Mr. Taylor's door; during the time the boy was getting up we went to the Bee-hive, in Leadenhall-market, where we had a pint of hot together; we came back, and at the corner of Lime-street (I had a candle and lanthorn in my hand) a man met me, and said, Halloo, watchman! I said halloo again, I am no watchman: if you want one, there is one yonder: he said he had lost something; he seemed to have things in his pocket. I looked about, and saw a boot in his hand: I said, Where is the other boot? he had a bottle of wine in his hand; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270039"/> gave it me to drink some: I drank, and so did Tupnail, out of the bottle; he said somebody has picked it up, and was going away: turning round, I saw a boot standing by the side of a post: I called to him, and said, here it is; he came and took it, and said that was his; then we drank more of the wine; he came back to the door: as we were standing there, the prisoner came; as soon as the other man saw him, he said, this is my man: they wanted a lodging; I said they could get none at that time of the morning. The first man, which was Smith, said he came from on board a ship. Tupnail took the candle and lanthorn, and we took them to Mr. Williamson's, at the Bee-hive: the prisoner had some cloaths upon his arm; we came back and left them there.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday se'ennight, about nine o'clock, coming from the city, in order to go to Greenwich, because Smith had an uncle there, lie carried me to Lime-street; he went from me for about three hours: when he came back again, he said, if I would go with him to Greenwich, he would pay my expences. I said, I did not care. Then he ordered me to stay at Lime-street, because he had left a portmanteau there, and he wanted to get clean things to put on: I asked him where they were; he said, at the Thistle and Crown in Billiter-lane: this was about three o'clock: I said, the people would not be up: he desired me to wait there, and said he would be back again in three minutes. I was walking backwards and forwards between Billiter-lane and Lime-street; I found no appearance of his coming; I went down Lime-street, and knocked at the Thistle and Crown door; I came past that gate, and saw a light in the house; I looked to see for Smith: I hollowed out; Smith came out; but I never was within the house: Sir Alexander's gate stood open, but I never was within it. When he came to the end of Billiter-lane, I said, what have you here? he said, I have got my things: he said, Lay hold of that, for I have lost a boot; I took hold of the things, while he looked about for the other boot, and found it; when I saw the other things, I said, Smith, this is not right; you have done something or other: I said, how did you get in? he said he saw the gate open, and he went in and took the things out: I told him I would stay no longer in his company, for he had got them feloniously: I went down Bishopsgate-street, with nothing in my hand, and he went away. Was it the last thing I was to say, I never saw the coat, boots, or shoes, from that time. On the Thursday after, I went to the other end of the town and met with Smith; I asked him what he had done with the things? he said he had sold them to a chairman, or a chairman had sold them for him; I cannot tell which; and that he got 12 s. for them: I never did say to Mr. Faulkner that I was in the house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alvarons. It is out of humanity I have had the honour to attend upon this honourable court; the prisoner lived servant with me about six months; he had all the care of my plate, and several valuable things in my house: I have a desk in my parlour, in which I keep things of value; the prisoner has more than once brought me the key to that desk when I have left it in, or the like. The reason of my parting with him was, he was given to drink, or I should never have parted with him. I gave him a character to another gentleman; the prisoner lived with him two months, and behaved well.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave your service?</p>
               <p>Alvarons. He left my service three months ago; the other gentleman parted with him for the same reason as I did.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live at Holbourn-bridge: on Thursday in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop, and ask'd to look at a pair of buckles: I had a suspicion of him, and did not care to show him any; but, at last, I did; he pitched upon a pair which came to twenty-two or twenty-three shillings: I told him I thought they would come to too much money for him: he asked me if I chose to take any silver in exchange for them, and pull'd out this piece of silver, and offered it in exchange. (Producing a piece of an old silver waiter, with engraved work upon it, and two pieces of silver solder). I asked him how he came by them; he said he lived with Mr. Baskervile, in Rolls Buildings: I said, as it was so near, I would just put my hat on and go with him, to see if his master knew he had these things to dispose of: when I got out at the door he wanted to have the silver again: I said he should not; and if he was fancy, I would charge a constable with him directly. As soon as he heard that, he took to his heels and ran up Holborn; I ran after him and took hold of him, and was determined to know where his master lived. Going up Holborn I met Mr. Crips's nephew; he called the prisoner by his name; I asked him where the prisoner lived; he said in St. James's-street; I brought him back to my shop, and sent for his master: he came, and said he would swear to the piece of silver as his property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property; it is a piece of a waiter, very particular to be known; it was an old waiter which I had cut into pieces. The folder I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did not steal it; I found it among the sweepings in the shop: my business was to sweep the shop.</p>
