I live at Bush-hill Park, Enfield—on 27th September, between eight and nine, I was. in Brick Lane—I saw the two prisoners there; I said nothing to them, or they to me—Clarke hit me in the chest and knocked me down, and took all the money I had in my pocket—Clarke put his hand in my right-hand trousers pocket, and took four half-crowns, and Douglas put his hand in the left-hand pocket, where I had nine shillings and some coppers—that was after I had been knocked down—two policemen came up, and as soon as they saw them they jumped up and ran away; the constables followed; I saw Clarke caught, not Douglas; they were both taken to the station—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men that robbed me; it was a very severe blow that knocked me down.</p>

About seven p.m. on 25th September I saw the prisoner with Clark at Wine Office Court, Fleet Street—I said to the prisoner, "My name is Davidson; I am an officer in the City Police. I have been making inquiries respecting a cheque for £7 obtained from Admiral McClintock. I have traced this cheque as being cashed by this man" (pointing to Clark). "He says he received it from you. What have you got to say about it?"—the prisoner said, "I say nothing"—I said, "The cheque now bears a forged endorsement. You must consider yourself in custody on a charge of forging that endorsement and uttering the cheque"—he said, "Well proceed"—I conveyed him to Snow Hill Police-station, where he was charged—he made no reply—when asked his address, he said, "No fixed abode"—he was searched; a number of memoranda were found in his possession, and among them was one, "Dr. von Hohnfeldt, B.A., 14, Cursitor Street"—I went to the paper shop and found another letter there from Admiral McClintock—I returned it to him—I find the signa<lb/>tures on the slip of paper and the letter, and the endorsement on the cheque, tally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an omnibus conductor, No. 905—on September 12th, about 10.50 p.m., the prisoner hailed my omnibus and got on the roof—I went up and asked him for his fare—he gave me Is.—it is a penny fare—I at once detected that it was bad—I did not give him the change or speak a word—when we had gone on about 200 yards I saw Sergeant Clifford and called him—I stopped the omnibus and called the prisoner down, and said, "This man has given me a bad shilling," and handed it to him—the prisoner said that some one had given it to him an hour before—I asked if he had any more money—he said, "No"—he was searched, and several bad coins were found on him—I afterwards went to the top of the omnibus and found two half-crowns, two florins, and three shillings under the seat where he had been sitting—I took them to the police-station at Barnsbury.</p>

Taylor called me and gave the prisoner into my custody with this shilling—he said, "The coin is good"—I told him the coin was counterfeit, and asked if he had any other money—he said, "No"—I searched him and found two half-crowns, two florins, and a shilling, all counterfeit—I asked how he accounted for them, he made no reply—Taylor afterwards handed me a half-crown, one shilling, and eight pence, which I gave to Inspector Wright at the station—I searched him further at the station and found a bill head and three keys—he refused to give any account of himself or his address, but I found it and went next day with Murray to 71, Shoe Lane, to a room on the first-floor back, and unlocked the door with one of the keys found on the prisoner—I made a search there and found a battery, a bottle of chemicals, a bottle of methy<lb/>lated spirits, spirit lamp, brushes, lead, a quantity of wire, potass, nitrate of silver, cyanide of potassium, Epsom salts, sand paper, a square of glass, matches, two farthings partly gilt, forty-six pieces of solder, a counterfeit florin, four counterfeit shillings, and six moulds for shillings, four of which were under the floor—the shilling found in the prisoner's possession corres<lb/>ponds with one of the moulds—there was no furniture in the room but one chair.</p>

In January and February last year, I was employed as a clerk to the London Bank of Exchange, Lombard Street—this cheque for £23 2s. 6d. was brought to our office somewhere in February, 1894, by a Mr. King; I can't exactly fix the date—to the best of my belief it was brought by the prisoner King—he asked if we would clear the cheque for him—it was crossed—I told him it was an unusual thing for us to clear crossed cheques, but we would put it through his principal's account said he could not do that as his principal was away—the cheque was endorsed as it is now—he saw our manager, but I was not present at the interview—I saw him a second time that day—the cheque was left—I next saw King, he introduced the prisoner Barnes in the name of Mann, and I paid the money—only Mann was present when I paid it, and he signed this receipt in the name of John Mann.</p>

I am clerk to John Nicholls, a solicitor, of Mansion House Chambers—I have known both the prisoners for a long time; I was lodging with both of them at 15, Devonshire Road, Holloway, in January last year, and saw them daily—the other King did not lodge in the house, only the prisoner—in February, 1894, the prisoner King called me into his front parlour—he said, "Where is Salmon?"—I said, "In the City"—he said, "When he asks you if you have seen Barnes</p>

               <p>say 'No, he has not been home all night'"—I said, "Yes; I walk down to the City every morning; that was why I should see Salmon?"—he used to go about with Barnes travelling in the indiarubber line—King also said, "There is a little business on which he would tell me about later on, within a day or two"—he did so—he said, "A cheque has been found in London Wall, and we shall be all right; in a few days we shall have plenty of money: in the meantime Barnes must not go out for at least a fortnight. You have plenty of books upstairs. I wish you would lend him a few to keep his mind occupied"—I did so—Barnes did not go out for some little time; he used to go out after dark; King used to take him out; not in the day-time—two or three days after, as King and I were walking down to the City together, he said to me, "You are no fool, you must think there is something up at home; I will tell you all about it; we have had the money for the cheque, £20, and I had £19 of it"—I do not think we had any further conversation on the subject—King and I were always referring to it, ever since the thing took place—I never knew Barnes by the name of Mann.</p>

W. King; I showed him the letter or cheque "(I knew that he lodged with him); I gave him the letter and cheque, and suggested as he was better dressed than I was—he should try and find the owner, and he might get 5s. while I should only get half a crown; some days passed over; I spoke to him again, and asked him if he had done anything about the cheque—he said, "No"—he had been busy; he had not had time to attend to it; then he said he was hard up; he was expecting the bailiffs in his house, and the money would be very useful to him, and proposed that we should cash the cheque; that he and Barnes should cash it—Barnes said he was unwilling to do such a thing, but eventually, on the morning of 30th January, he con<lb/>sented—King said he knew a money-changer in the City who would change it for them, and in the morning King signed the cheque in his presence with the endorsement it now bears—that is what Barnes said to me; he said that King gave it back to him, and went with him into the City; that King introduced him to the money-changer; he did not say in what name; he was asked what name, and he gave the name of Mann; that he came out, and missed King, and wondered what had become of him; that he saw him later in the day, and said to him, "Whatever did you leave me for?" and he said, "Because I knew you had the money to pay," and I had not, and he said he eventually got it on the 1st of February, and signed in the name of John Mann, and he told him to be careful, as he might be watched, and advised him to go up and down the lift—he said that he saw Outram sitting in the office of the money-changer's, and that frightened him; that he saw King afterwards, and gave him £21 of the money, and King told him that he had better keep quietly at home for some time—Barnes went on to say that they were to be partners in the City, but it was a failure; they never had a customer; that King told him he had destroyed the letter; he did not think it was safe to keep it—After that I gave Barnes into custody—I afterwards saw King on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mineral water manufacturer, at 18, Walter Street, Bethnal Green—on the early morning of September 10th I was awakened by a noise and went downstairs to the gate of my factory and into the street where I saw the prisoners—they said they came after a man named Slade—I said he did not work there; he had gone—the prisoners began making a row—I said I should have to fetch a policeman, and they threatened me, and one of then struck me on the forehead; and one pinned my arms behind me, and they took my chain, leaving me only a little piece of it—some time afterwards I went to the Police-station and I recognised Estell as one of the men who had robbed me; I had seen him before—I don't know which man struck me.</p>

I am a painter's labourer, of 53, Stebbing Street, Latimer Road—on Sunday, September, 15th, about 12.30 a.m. I was coming from Notting Hill Gate, with my friend Height—when we got to Uxbridge Road, the three prisoners and another man were there, and Dono<lb/>van pushed against me—I told them to straighten themselves up and go home—they were sober—we went about twelve yards, and at the corner of Ladbroke Grove they turned back and pounced on us, and knocked my friend down; I turned round and faced them, and Canter gave me a blow on my nose, and I got several blows on the back of my head—Riley took a halfpenny out of my left trousers pocket—they left my friend and all four were upon me—they punched my head and face, and Donovan took fourpence from my right pocket—the only one I can swear to as doing violence is Canter; I saw him give me a few blows on my head—I left Height in the road and ran after them shouting "Police"—Constable Daniel caught Riley; Donovan ran in the opposite direction and was taken by Brown, he and Canter were taken on the following Friday—Riley was the only one taken that night.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S. of England—on the evening of 10th September I went to Holly Cottage about a quarter to ten—I found the deceased sitting on the sofa; I found a very large swelling about three inches long from the right to the left side of the head—there were five wounds on that swelling, the largest wound was a triangular one in the middle of the back of the head—none of the others were a quarter of an inch in extent—there was a pool of blood on the floor by the leg of the table about six to eight inches in diameter; I had to step on one side to avoid it—I saw no other pool of blood—there was a pool of blood upon her, but not on the articles on the floor, or on the floor—I told them to put cold water rags on, and I left one on—I washed all over the bruise and back of the head—I washed and wiped all the blood out of the hair—she had a, great deal of hair—the prisoner said they were a bad lot, she came in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189510210027"/>
               <p>in drink, and fell down—one of the neighbours said he had hit her over the head with a poker. I feel sure that the prisoner heard that—I did not see Constable Lane there, he must have gone before I arrived—I did not pass him in going there—I saw the son, Edward, there—he did not speak to his father while I was there—I washed my hands and told them to get her to bed as quickly as possible, to keep her quiet, and not to quarrel any more—I next went there on September 11th, at half-past ten, she was then dead, lying on the bed—she had been bleeding in the night; there was a considerable pool of blood on the pillow, where her head had lain—the body was not cold—I made a post-mortem examination next day—she had been dead at least four hours, or longer—I made the examination first alone, subsequently it was made by Professor Pepper, in my presence, and Dr. Ward's, on the 17th—I gave evidence before the Coroner—that evidence was given before the second post-mortem—there was a fracture of the processes of the spine, which I had not noticed—in my opinion the cause of death was the oozing of blood on the surface of the brain, that was the consequence of the injury to the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have attended these people for the last four or five years—I have never attended the prisoner—I was called to him once, a long time ago—I have seen his wife now and again—I can't say whether I have seen any of the children—I knew Mrs. Rednap and her husband living next door—the Hammerton's house was in an alley about three feet wide—the stairs were steep leading to the kitchen—the space between. the table and the sofa would be under three feet—I think it was Mrs. Rednap's daughter that said the prisoner had hit his wife on the head with the poker—the prisoner did not come into the kitchen till I had been in the room about three minutes—Mrs. Rednap was facing the stairs—when the girl made her statement the prisoner at once said, "I did not hit her"—I did not see any soot on the wounds—I counted four or five wounds on the head—the triangular wound was one you could put your little finger in; the other wounds did not show as I found them at the second post-mortem—I tore them open in my examination—I left two wounds at the back of the head instead of four or five little ones—I could not ascertain that any of them went down to the bone, they were only skin deep—I have said that in my opinion they could be caused by hitting or kicking; I am still of that opinion—the pressure of the blood on the brain might have been caused by hitting or kicking—I have also stated that the wound might have been caused by a fall against the leg of the sofa or table—I say so still—I made those statements after the second post-mortem—I do<lb/>not think they were caused by the poker—a kettle might have caused the triangular wound to the head—I don't think the wounds were caused by a fall downstairs; I don't think it possible, not by a fall on a flat surface. It is possible the injury to the spine might have been caused by a fall if it struck against something hard at the bottom; the step of a stair would be hard—I did not examine the spine carefully, the examination was out of my hands, the injury was to the three vertebrae; there must have been considerable force—I have said that a fall might have caused the four or five wounds on the top of the head; I said that after the examination by Professor Pepper, and I think so now; if she fell on something striking the back of the head and face at the same time—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189510210028"/>
               <p>noticed that the cheek was grazed on the first examination, the left eye was discoloured—I gave it as my opinion that she met her death by falling on her face on the floor and striking against a piece of furniture—I am of opinion that the blood clot on the brain was the cause of death—I had been treating her for rheumatism and indigestion due to alcohol<lb/>drinking habits, which cause the arteries to become weak and would give rise to effusion; effusion of blood on the brain might be caused by a fall, and would cause death—she had been vomiting during the night—the appearances I observed were not inconsistent with suffocation—vomit shows that the fracture did not produce paralysis; it would be a symptom of brain injury—I did not open the gullet—I watched the details of the second post-mortem, but I did not handle the parts—during the conver<lb/>sation among the people there was no mention of injuries by the kettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I point out on the photograph the spot where the blood was—the deceased was a middle-aged woman, going on for sixty, I should say, heavy and rather clumsy, weighing about ten or eleven stone—if she fell, striking her head against the leg of the sofa, that might cause a great many wounds—I think the injury to the spinal cord must have been done by a blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master in surgery, and surgeon of St. Mary's Hospital—I have had considerable experience in post-mortem examinations—on 17th September I made a post-mortem examination of the deceased woman in the presence of Dr. McDonna and Dr. Ward—a post-mortem examination had been previously made—I found the hair had not been cut from the scalp at the previous examination—that is neces<lb/>sary to enable one to appreciate the character of the wounds on the scalp—having removed the hair, I found two wounds, one an inch and an eighth from side to side, and one half an inch in diameter, three-quarter inch from fore to back, and exactly between the most prominent part of the head and the middle line of the skull—there was extensive haemorrhage in the scalp in the neighbourhood of the wounds, the margin of each wound was com<lb/>posed of scalp tissues which had been pulped—the skull was half inch thick in its thickest part—that accounts for its not being fractured—at the age of deceased the space between the two bones forming the skull is filled in with dense bone, instead of the soft porous material of earlier life—that is in consequence of the change incidental to age—the skull would strengthen very much—I did not observe the clot said to have been present on the left side of the brain; it had been removed by the previous examination, but I have an accurate description which I took down from Dr. McDonna, and I had read the coroner's deposition—there was no fracture of the skull, and no hæmorrhage into the substance of the brain;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189510210029"/>
               <p>the arteries of the brain were singularly healthy for a person of that age—the left eye-lids were blackened as an ordinary black eye, quite separate from the injury on the cheek—there was a superficial bruise on the right side of the mouth, a bruise over the left cheek bone an inch in width—the hemorrhage beneath these had extended close to the upper part of the mouth, that is to say, there had been severe injury—it was not simply a superficial bruise; there were two smaller bruises between the left cheek bone and the ear on the left side—there had been no bleeding from either ear, as sometimes happens in similar cases—there was a large bruise over the lower part of the back of the neck, just above the shoulder, where you begin to feel the prominence of the bone—there was extensive haemorrhage under the bruises in all the tissues down to the bone, and immediately beneath I found a fracture of the fifth cervical of the vertebrae, and a slight one of the sixth—on opening the spinal canal at the seat of injury I found haemorrhage on the surface of the spinal cord—there was a bruise three inches by two inches over the small of the back, a small bruise in the left flank, and a bruise covering the whole of the back of the left wrist, but excluding the fingers—I have one or two other notes with regard to the organs, but they have no bearing on the case—the organs were fairly healthy—there was a slight hardening of the liver frequently found in a person who has taken too much alcohol, but for a person of her age they were healthy, practically normal—all the injuries were quite recent—the more important, because more severe, wounds were caused before death, because there was very much more haemorrhage than would have been from an injury after death—the cause of death was shock, due considerably to haemorrhage from the scalp wounds on to the surface of the brain and to the injury to the spine, in other words to the injuries I have spoken of. I examined the room and saw the kettle and the poker produced. I cannot conceive that the injuries were caused by a fall. There must have been more than one fall to have caused the different injuries—two or three would not have done it—I cannot conceive any kind of fall that could have produced the injury to the spine—some of the injuries might have been produced by the poker—all might have been produced by the kettle—the injury to the back of the hand could only have been produced by putting the hand to the neck to protect it; it is only the back of the left hand that is struck, and that with an instrument with a broad surface, taking a very considerable area—it certainly could not have been done with the poker; it was equally severe over the entire surface that covered the back of the hand—the injury to the spine must have been produced by a blow—it is possible a fall might do it—but in that degree I think it is improbable—I saw nothing in the room to have produced it.</p>

I am adopting the word "blow"); another to have caused that over the small of the back; another that over the back of the hand, and another the bruise on the left flank, the</p>

               <p>blow below the waist—all the wounds might have been caused by the kettle—I believe some of the slighter ones on the face were not—nine wounds may have been caused by the kettle—the two on the scalp might have been caused by the poker, and the one on the cheek-bone, but the one on the back of the neck could not have been—several smaller wounds, on the face might have been caused by the poker—I will give you cate<lb/>gorically those which could not have been produced by the poker: the wound on the spine, and the wound on the lower part of the back; the wounds on the back of the head could; a fall may have produced the wounds of the scalp, but not at the same time as the injury to the spine and back—I should say the deceased was about eleven stone in weight—I cannot conceive her producing the wounds successively from step to step in falling down the stairs—it is impossible for the wounds in the back to have been caused by striking against the edge of the sofa; the bruise would not have been circular three inches in diameter; it would hare indicated the nature of the body against which the person struck—I am taking the three wounds to the head and the back in order—the head striking on the flat surface of the next step would make it more impossible still to cause those three wounds—the two wounds on the back could not be caused by coming in contact with the step or any flat surface; they most have been caused by something projecting, which practically cut into those wounds—the wounds were pulpy—I should not deduce from that that they were caused by coming in contact with a flat surface—I should expect the wounds to be pulpy no matter whether the blow was direct or indirect—those two wounds could not be produced by the body falling either on a flat surface, or on the edge of a step—I cannot admit that the two wounds were inflicted together, I admit a fall may have produced the injury to the spine—emphatically it could not have produced those wounds on the head that I found at the same time—there is no possibility of it—I cannot go further, I cannot go into imagination; that is my fixed conviction founded on con<lb/>siderable experience—all the blows would not be equally severe—it would not require very great exertion to injure the spine with this kettle which is very heavy—it is iron from the look of it, and there is a great deal of fur deposit in it—it would weigh 7 lb. or 8 lb.—it would require a severe blow from the kettle to produce some of the injuries, but the blow would have two components, the exertion required to wield the kettle and the weight of the kettle which would not have to fall far to produce a severe injury if merely dropped—if the hand which was wounded was put up to protect the head I would not expect the part protected to have been injured by that blow—the injury to the fifth cervical was produced within forty-eight hours before death—the blood was extravasated—I can tell that at a distance of seven days—the appearance of the spine is exactly as it would have been found an hour after death—the body was well preserved—the condition in which I found the bruises, the extrava<lb/>sation of the blood was tire same as if it had been found an hour after death—the wound to the spine had a very large share in causing death, a severe concussion over the spine is important in itself, it is still more so if it causes hæmorrhage on to the spinal cord, and this had—some scrapings were taken from the kettle—I examined them—there was no blood upon them—Dr. McDonna converted five wounds originally</p>

               <p>into two—that did not alter the character of the wounds—it did not interfere with my observation and inference, except as to the fact of the number of wounds—the vomiting could not cause the effusion of blood spoken to by Dr. McDonna.</p>

I am the wife of William Nichols of 54, Exeter Street—that is not quite the distance of this court from Duke Street—there is no obstacle between the two, I can see right down Duke Street to the Row—Duke Street is from our door to Exeter Street straight for<lb/>wards, and I can see right down to the end of it—on Sunday morning, September 15th, at quarter to 1 o'clock, I was on my doorstep and saw the prisoner with her back against the window of 7, Duke Street, that is the warehouse, and heard some glass fall on the sill—I had spoken to her a few times, but not lately—I saw her put her hand in and take some things from the window, and as she drew them out some more glass dropped—she put the things under her cloak and went straight down Duke Street towards Lisson Grove, and turned round the corner to the right—the next street is Devonshire Street—she had a hat and cloak on then—she returned very shortly without a hat or cloak—I went upstairs, put my light out, and looked out at the window—she turned her back towards Exeter Street and drew some more things out of the window of No. 7, crossed over Duke Street, and came down Exeter Street opposite my window with some things in her apron—there was a lighted lamp near my house, and one at the corner where she crossed over, and another opposite—there are three or four lamps—I am absolutely certain she is the woman—I did not know much about her, but I had spoken to her—I was not very friendly with her—I identified her from a number of women at the police-court—I saw her in Devonshire Street on the following Monday—she asked me to have a glass of ale, and said she wanted to speak tome about what she had done on Saturday night, and she was very sorry she had done it, and she hoped I would not <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on her—I said, "What did you do it for? Is your husband out of work, or are you hard up?"—she said, "No, I was drunk, or else I should not have done it"—I did not inform the police; I heard that afternoon that inquiries had been made about her—two constables came, and I made a communication to them.</p>

"I met him in the neighbourhood and took him home with me, I could not cash it for him, and he asked me for the bills</p>

The same evening the milkman came to the house with the cheque and asked if I was Miss Cohen, but I did not answer. He told me to put 'Louisa Cohen,' on the back, without the 'Miss'; I took the cheque upstairs and asked my friend, Miss Howard, to put 'Louisa Cohen' on it, which she did; I gave it to the milkman, who some time afterwards sent the balance round in a sealed envelope or bag. The same night I and Miss Howard went to Islington, met Cohen and gave him the money as I had received it, he gave us a sovereign each"—I took Evans to the station, he pointed to Howard and said, "That is the woman who gave me the cheque"—Seaward said, "What I have already told you h the truth."</p>

"I don't know what you are talking about"—I said, "We are police-officers"—we were both in plain clothes—we took him to the Vine Street Station in a cab; Churchman came with us—in the cab I said, "You will be charged with being concerned with Edwards, a man now in custody, in breaking and entering the Burlington</p>

The trade value of this pin, pawned at Fish's, is 18s!; that and the one pawned at Miller's are both a very common description of pin; they are made in Birmingham—we have two assistants, both women; they have been with us over four years; the only male assistant is the boy—we have discharged no one for the past six years—I have no idea how the robbery took place—all the shops are left unattended at night with the exception of one, a diamond dealer's, where a commissionaire sleeps all night; the gates at both ends are opened at eight o'clock, and then the Arcade becomes a public thoroughfare—the boys are supposed to arrive to clean the windows between 8 and 8,15; most of the shops have boys to clean the windows—the moment the gates are open a number of persons would be coming in and going out, so that after eight it is a busy thoroughfare—the commissionaire's box is supposed to be removed about 8 am.—it would be an unusual occurrence for me or my assistants to be at the shop at 8 a.m.—the thieves took every pin in my place; they emptied one window entirely, with the exception of a few things strewn about the floor, which evidently fell out of the bag in the hurry—we do not undress the windows every night, only pull down the blinds—probably we should sell fifty pins of this kind in the course of the year—we put a mark on every pin when we buy it, and another mark when we sell it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 127, Englefield Road, Islington, and am a tailor's cutter—in September Speight asked me if I would pawn a gold watch for him, and he would give me 2s. for doing it—he said I was to ask 25s. and not take less than £1—I went to two pawnshops, and could not get £1—I returned the watch to Speight at the Star and Garter, Balls Pond Road, and told him I could not get the money he asked for it—Edwards was there when the watch was given to me, and when I brought it back—Speight then asked Edwards to pawn it, and he said, "Why don't you pawn it yourself?"—Speight said, "Because they know me in the trade as a dealer, and they lend more money to a stranger than myself"—he handed the watch to Edwards and they went away together—I had seen Speight before in a public-house—I only knew him as a dealer in jewellery.</p>

I am a clerk to Mr. Wisby, the solicitor for Edwards—I was at Marlborough Street instructing Mr. Blackwell, on behalf of Edwards, on September 28th—by the magistrate's permission I went to see Edwards before he was brought into Court—he and Speight were in the same cell—I spoke to Edwards through the little hole in the door—I did not see Speight in the first instance; but he heard our con<lb/>versation—I said to Edwards, "Are you aware another man has been charged with this affair?"—he said, "Yes; he is here now"—I said, "Is that the same man, Norton, who you have instructed us, has handed you the goods to pawn?"—Speight then came up to the hole and said, "It's quite right, I did hand him the goods to pawn, and the greater portion of the tickets found at his place are mine. Do you know my solicitor, Mr. Porteous?"—I said, "I have not seen him in Court to-day, I wrote to him to be in attendance"—he said, "Don't make it too hot"—I said, "I have to look after the prisoner Edwards."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, St. Margaret's Road—on Saturday evening, August 31st, I was at the Plough Inn, about half-past eleven—I saw there a man named Batley, the prisoner, a man named Blay, and a woman named Eagle—I did not then know her name—Batley owed Blay some coppers and he handed over a shilling to him—it dropped in the sawdust and got lost; it was searched for and could not be found—the prisoner was there at the time, I did not see him look for it; I did not hear anyone accused of having it—on the next Tuesday evening, the 3rd September, about a quarter-past twelve, I went to the Plough again—I saw the prisoner there—the shilling was mentioned, I think by the prisoner, and I told him it was a dirty mean trick of him to take it if he did have it; if he wanted a shilling we would give him one—he took some bitter oaths that he had never had it; he said God strike him blind he never had it—after that I was going out, and he caught me up and we went along the Harrow Road, that was my way home—going along I saw Eagle on a seat, she appeared to be dozing—the prisoner was walking along by the side of me, and said to her, "You b——y f——g cow, you say I had that shilling;" she got up and looked up in his face, and said, "Yes, you did have it"—he said she was a b——y liar, or something to that effect, and he would either knock her head off, or kick it off, I would not be sure which—she got off the seat, and said, "I will go and fetch him," and walked down the road in the direction of the Big Plough—nobody's name had been mentioned while I was there—I said to the prisoner, "You shan't shame the woman, I would have a fight with you"—he said he did not want to fight me, and wanted me to shake hands with him—I said, I did not want to shake hands with him; I said "Good-night," and went home—he said, "Just to save a row I will give a shilling if I can get one, and pay it back"—on Sunday morning, the 8th, about half-past nine, I went out to see where the murder had been done and saw the prisoner there with three or four other men, right at the bottom of the road leading to Kensal Green Station; they were just going by there as I came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of Police; I live at 150, Kilburn Park Road—on the morning of September 8th I was called to the body of this woman, it was lying on a piece of waste ground, between the footpath and the railway, off Wakeman Road, flat on her back with the throat cut, six inches long and chiefly on the right of the neck—I came to the conclusion, as there was no blood on the dress, that the wound had been inflicted when she was on her back—the left side of the wound was jagged, the edges pointing to the right side—the skin was scratched on the left side, beyond the margin of the wound—it was such a wound as might be inflicted with this knife, with great force—I did not at that time notice the depth of the wound, it was full of blood—at one p.m. I found it was an inch and a-half deep; it penetrated the windpipe and the gullet; with the exception of a few strands of muscle at the back it cut through all the large vessels, including the common carotid on the right side of the neck, and the jugular vein on the left—there was a wound an inch and a-half in length on the top of the right side of the forehead, in the hair—this stone is such an instrument as might produce such an injury—there was also a jagged and lacerated wound two inches in length above the left eye; that might have been done by this stone, or by a kick—the arms and hands were free from blood—I saw nothing about her to lead me to suppose that any struggle had taken place—life was entirely extinct when I came up; the body was slightly warm; <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had not commenced, except in the lower jaw—as far as I could judge she seemed to have been dead about four hours—I after<lb/>wards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Dr. Whitlock—the actual cause of death was the cutting of the throat; there was no injury to the skull or brain—the blow on the head with the stone would stun her, make her insensible.</p>

               <p>Evidence and have noticed that this deed was committed with great brutality and violence—I do not attach much importance to that in itself as a factor of insanity—frequently there is great brutality and violence in murders committed by admittedly insane people—I do not say as a rule; I have no statistics—I have come across cases of masked epilepsy—a sudden attack of violence against the man's own life, or the life of another, is one of its forms—insane people in an saylum commit crimes—they may or may not understand that the crime is wrong, although they do not understand its nature—I have known of one similar case where a person who could in any way be considered insane has given himself up—the fact of a man making no attempt to escape, but giving himself up, is a factor of very little import<lb/>ance except as indicating callousness in the man's mind—the amount of drink the prisoner took I do not consider would be a factor of practically any importance—I heard Batley say the prisoner had "all the drink he could get"—I heard the lodging house deputy say the prisoner was most evenings the worse for drink—in connection with the history of drinking that I heard, I do not think the attempt on his own life, or the brother's suicide, and committal to an asylum, would be sufficient to become an important factor—it would not be a factor worth considering—I gathered not that he was drunk, but that he was generally fuddled—that would not bring out the latent disease—I should have taken his ex<lb/>pression about spending £50 on Batley as an exaggeration rather than a delusion—I should not call his stating a person had accused him a delusion of any importance—an hereditary taint and service in a hot climate might have an injurious effect upon him, but that is not an important factor; many such people serve their course without mental trouble—I do not know that it is a general rule, but I know soldiers are cautioned not to drink when they come from a hot climate—a person may have homicidal mania, being sane in other respects—if he made two homicidal attempts, that would influence my opinion very differently, or if this deed had been a violent act of insanity—undoubtedly it was sudden—there is often a sudden seizure in impulsive insanity—I should say the line between a sane and an insane person is almost indistinguishable—in ordinary epilepsy there are unconscious convulsions—masked epilepsy is where in place of an epileptic fit any action may be done unconsciously—the effect of his loss of rest by coming home late at night would depend on the amount of rest he could take at other times—by itself it would not be a factor at all—an over<lb/>whelming anxiety to commit the crime would apply to impulsive insanity, but I do not think it would apply to all forms of insanity—it is impossible for me to say there is mental relief when the deed is done—we sometimes hear from the individual who committed the act that is so—all we can judge from is their observations and manner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Collin's Place, Green Street, Bethnal Green—for some time past I have been working at Mr. Craston's, getting work when I could—I knew the deceased and the prisoner—I went to the workshop on the morning of September 26th, near ten—I asked if I might take my things upstairs—they said "Yes," and I did—the prisoner was on my left, and Keddington opposite—my seat was between them—they were both at work at lawn-tennis shoes—they use skiving knives at that work—the prisoner was cutting out with the knife in his hand—Keddington asked me to go and get some tea—Taylor asked me if I would oblige him at the same time—I said "Certainly," and I went and got the tea—I was away about eight or nine minutes—when I came back I saw Keddington lying at the bottom of the stairs on his back, with a knife in his breast—he was just gasping—he gave three gasps, just like a fowl may do, he opened his mouth three times, and then died, no sound came—Dr. Martin came in just in time to see the last gasp—I went up to the loft to see Keddington's coat, which I did, and I saw the prisoner's coat hanging up—I saw no signs of a struggle—there did not seem to be a thing ruffled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't suppose I had to go fifty yards to get the tea—both the men knew the place where I intended to go for it, and they would know how long I should be away, unless I was detained—both their coats were hanging in their usual place—everything presented its everyday aspect—the two men were perfectly quiet, there was no sign of annoyance about the prisoner, and he asked me the question very civilly, and I said, "Certainly," and went—he treated me quite courteously and civilly that morning—he did not seem at all annoyed at my coming into the place—Keddington was using what is called a driver when I first went up, driving nails; he was not using a knife—I believe he had a double-faced hammer in the place—I did not see it that morning, I have seen it—it is sometimes used when there is a strong job, it is not used for light work which they were doing that morning—it used to lie near his bench so that he could lean back and get it when he liked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not see that hammer at all that morning—the driver that Keddington had in his hand was a file about eleven inches long, it was broken in halves.</p>

I know I told Bill Tilleard to come in to work"—I lifted up the flap at the foot of the stairs for him to come through to my bench, and Martin came and took him off of me and remained with him while I went for a cab—on my return he was dead, and Dr. Martin was there—Mr. Craston went for the doctor—after I left that place I came down-stairs to fit up some work for Keddington—I did not do it, I was coming back to speak to him—during my absence I heard no sound coming from the attic, no cry or struggle—this is the knife that was sticking in his breast, when I first saw it it had an extremely sharp point; it has gone now—I have known the prisoner between five or six years—I have heard Keddington continually taunting him and tormenting him, but I never saw him get cross—Keddington would make his life miserable at times—he would not get cross; I never saw him lose his self control—some times there would be six or seven men working in the attic—the torment<lb/>ing went on while the other men were present very often—Keddington was using a double-faced hammer when I left him about five minutes before this occurrence, and Taylor was using his little knife skiving.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I identify this as the prisoner's knife; I have borrowed it of him on several occasions—I have mentioned the double-faced ham<lb/>mer to-day for the first time—I did not speak of it at the inquest; I was not asked about it—Tilleard was last in the room, he came down directly after me—after the man was killed I could not say for certain whether anyone went up to see what tools were there; the police went up—Keddington was using the double-faced hammer when I came down; it was big on one side and small on the other, with a handle nine or ten inches long.</p>

I live at 3, Avenue Road, Leyton—I was working at Craston's factory on the morning of September 26th, in the ground floor, at my usual bench—between ten and half-past I heard a cry from upstairs, "Oh, oh," twice; there was an interval of a second or so be<lb/>tween the two—I went from my bench to the foot of the stairs and saw Keddington come tumbling down the stairs saying, "I am stabbed, Taylor has stabbed me; I am dying, I know I am dying"—that was all I heard—I caught him when he got to the bottom of the stairs after he had passed under the wicket, which Foley lifted up for him—he was placed in the workshop; I did what I could for him till the doctor came—he died in six minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three persons working in the room beneath, Foley, and two females working at a sewing machine; the machines make a good deal of noise when at work—the prisoner had com<lb/>plained of feeling very bad that morning before he went upstairs; he looked ill; he complained of being very ill indeed; and Keddington used a nasty expression, and I told him he was a beast and ought to be ashamed of himself—I have frequently heard Keddington use foul and disgusting language to Taylor; it was not so much filthy language as remarks passed in insulting language towards Taylor—as a rule there would not be two days in a week without his passing language as would</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter of May</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st bore the addresses Grande Hotel de Malte, and</hi> 11, <hi rend="italic">Verona Road, Forest Gate; and stated that he expected to have received the cheque before, and that they might sell a further fifty Simmer and Jack shares at</hi>

The letter of June 6th acknowledged the receipt of the cheque, and stated that he was leaving on Monday for Nice and Rome and would send his address.</hi>) We were not able to sell the further fifty shares before the next settlement; the price would not permit—on June 14th he came to my office and asked me if the fifty shares were sold—I said no, the price would not permit during the account, and we took the limit not to extend later than that period—he expressed pleasure that the shares bad not been sold, and then told us to sell 200 at the best price we could get—we did so that evening at 171 1/4, they had gone up £2—the next morning he called, and I told him what I had done, and gave him a contract note of the sale—that represented about £3,400 receivable by him—after I had handed him the contract note he said, "The shares will be brought in by a friend of mine; I am leaving for the South of France in consequence of an internal complaint. My friend, Mr. Col lard, who advises me in all my South African Investments, will get the shares from the Bank and hand them to you, and I wish you to take his instructions to buy or to sell for me while I am away, and to receive moneys"—I said, "This had better be put in writing," and I dictated this letter dated June 15th—Leach wrote and signed it in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This requested Buckler, Norman, and Gower to act on any instructions which Stephen A. Collard of</hi> 40, <hi rend="italic">Greyhurst Road, Dalston, might give on Leach's behalf, during Leach's absence, and authorised them to pay money due to Leach to Collard.</hi>) He said he had bought these shares in Paris, and mentioned the price he gave for them; I cannot remember it—he said he had made a handsome profit on them, and that the broker's charges in Paris were much heavier in buying or selling stock than in London—he said he had bought a large quantity of shares in Paris, and led me to suppose that we should have more to deal with—that morning, the 15th, was the last I saw of him till I saw him in the Mansion House dock—on the same day I wrote to Collard and sent him a copy of the Power of Attorney—on 18th. Collard came and handed me eight bearer warrants, representing 200 Simmer and Jack shares—six were numbered 1,204,1,205, 1,195, 1,196, 845, and 846; the other two were handed direct to the company to be split, and do not appear in our books, but I believe they were following numbers—the six warrants we passed to the purchasers—on June 27th in respect of the sale I paid this cheque for £2,500 to the account of S. A. Collard, at the Middlesex Banking Company—in consequence of information received the completion of the sale of the rest never took place—the £2,500 was a round sum on account—we still have a balance of £67 in hand—the company have the two share warrants—in my opinion this Power of Attorney of June 15th, and the endorsement on this cheque for £220 are in Leach's writing—I am not so positive as to the endorsement on this £100 cheque; in one case he signs "James E. Leach," and in the other "James Leach," and the letters are somewhat different—the £220 cheque appears to be a Paris cheque, and the £100 cheque appears to have been paid in Paris—we concluded the bargain as to the remaining fifty shares represented by the two warrants.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had much experience in transactions on the African Market—if Barney Barnato or Cecil Rhodes were large holders of share warrants, and brought them to me to sell I should draw, an inference as to their reason for selling; it would not have a beneficial</p>

               <p>effect on the market if it were a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> sale—those big men do not often put their own shares on the market in their own names—I have known them to find a nominee—the nominee does not instruct the broker—I should want to know who the person selling was—I should not have, anyone in my office unless he were properly intro<lb/>duced—if you came and wanted to sell 200 Simmer and Jack I should want to know your means—I would not sell until I had satisfied myself—I satisfied myself in the case of Leach that he could own such a number of shares, considering the price at which he bought them—all these South African shares have gone up tremendously; a man who held shares at £2 or £3 twelve months ago could be Rolling them at £15; it did not mean a large amount of means to hold these twelve months ago—the price of Simmer and Jack shares is at present £26—if Cecil Rhodes sold 200 shares it would not affect the market, I am his confidential broker—if he were selling a small amount like 200 it would have no effect on my mind, except that he wanted a small amount of ready cash—a great holder selling an amount of them would have an injurious effect on the company—it would have no effect whatever on the market if it were known—that Barney Barnato or Cecil Rhodes wanted to realise £3,000—in the case of bearer shares it does not matter whether they are put on the market by a nominee, because the name does not appear—bearer Warrants are really worth more than registered stock, because they do not incur our heavy English stamp duty, and they are negotiable on the Continent, which the registered stock are not, and there they command a better price—bearer stock can be stolen more readily, but they are preferable for obtaining a loan on or dealing with on the Continent—if a large parcel of share warrants to bearer are brought to me I inquire as to the genuineness of the customer, and if he is genuine we take it the security, is genuine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In dealing with bearer warrants it is not necessary to disclose the seller; there is nothing on the face of the document which reveals the seller—the Goldfields Company, through their own brokers, could put 50,000 bearer warrants on the markets, and no one would know whence they, came, although such a number might affect the price—I had previous reason to believe the statements conveyed' to me through Mr. Hart; I had inquired and believed Leach to be a person of respectability and credit.</p>

Michael Abrahams and Sons, and I must refer you to them."</p>

Abrahams had advised me not to answer inquiries about this account, and I referred all persons to that firm—Leach seemed anxious to see it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manager of the Agency Depart<lb/>ment of the Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa, whose offices are at 8, Old Jewry—we are agents in London for the Simmer and Jack Gold Mining Company—Collard was formerly in the employment of the Simmer and Jack Company, and when we took the agency over he was taken into our employment, and employed as a transfer clerk—in connec<lb/>tion with the Simmer and Jack Company there are bearer warrants for a certain number of shares, which pass on delivery—on signing an applica<lb/>tion form, and lodging the warrants, the holder could have those warrants converted into registered shares—it was part of Collard's duty to receive those warrants and the application for conversion, and give a receipt for the warrants, and hand them over to be cancelled and arrange for the transfer—the particulars would be entered in the conversion register—Collard was in our employment up to about 25th June—I last saw him on Friday, 21st June, I think, in the street—I afterwards obtained infor<lb/>mation which resulted in inquiries being made, and then I ascertained that a large number of share warrants were missing from the place—they had been lodged for conversion, but they were not properly entered, and had not been cancelled—Collard was dealing with them in Antwerp when a telegram reached me—before he was brought back to this country I had taken steps to secure the arrest of Leach—among the warrants stolen by Collard was one, No. 920; four warrants, 845, 846, 847, and 848; two warrants, 1195 and 1196; and two warrants, 1204 and 1205, all for twenty-five shares each—they were not entered in the book as received; and receipts were taken out from the wrong part of the books, out of order—on June 27th warrants 847 and 848 were lodged by Buckler, Grower, and Norman for conversion—the request for conversion was found in the office, and as the result of that, I found that some of there warrants were stolen twice over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to G. W. Dawos, a stockbroker, of 5, Lothbury, and a member of the Stock Exchange—I knew Collard was employed at the Consolidated Company—on June 14th Haynes called at our office with Collard—they brought this letter of introduction from Collard—I opened the letter in the presence of them both, and read it, and then took it inside to Mr. Dawes, and introduced Haynes to him—Collard remained outside—I had never heard of or seen Haynes before—I had no conversation with Haynes about the contents of the letter—Collard came in with a man I had never seen, and handed me a letter and said, "Every man his own postman," or something to that effect—I read the letter—Collard said, "This is a friend of mine, Mr. Haynes"—I asked him what business he came upon, and Haynes said he wished to sell one hundred Simmer and Jack shares, and he there and then produced four bearer warrants from his pocket and handed them to me over the counter—after I had taken Haynes inside to Mr. Dawes, Collard said something to me about Haynes's means and position, but not in Haynes's presence—at the time I took the share warrants from Haynes I had no information about him except that contained in the letter—after, he had handed me the share warrants I took him and them to Mr. Dawes, and left him with him, and came back to Collard and spoke to him—when Haynes came out Mr. Dawes instructed me to go over to the Stock Exchange and sell the shares, and I went there with Haynes. (<hi rend="italic">The letter introducing Haynes was read. It runs dated June</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1895, <hi rend="italic">and stated that it was to introduce Mr. Haynes, whom he had known for the past eight years, and who had lately returned from abroad; that the writer knew for a fact he was all right for</hi> £25,000, <hi rend="italic">and thought he would be a good client.</hi>) I believed the contents of that letter—I believe the num<lb/>bers of the warrants that Haynes produced were 845 to 848—I went</p>

               <p>over to the Stock Exchange with Haynes, but without the warrants, to sell them—Collard went away—I called out our authorised clerk, who asked me what shares they were; I told him bearer warranty and he said he did not think they were saleable on our market, and that I had better go to the Company and ask them about them—I went and made enquiry at the Consolidated Goldfields Company's office—Haynes had left me then—Mr. Dawes had taken down his name and address on the back of this letter that has been read "Henry John Haynes, care of Holman and Sons, 50, Lime Street, and 26, Stavordale Road, Highbury Road"—after that I went to Messrs. Holman's office, 50, Lime Street, where I asked for and saw Haynes—I did not ask whether he was a clerk—Holman's are shipbrokers, I believe—I made no inquiry as to what Haynes was—I brought him this applica<lb/>tion to convert, and told him it was necessary to get it done or our clerk could not sell them in the open market; I must get them converted—he looked through it—I told him it was an ordinary form of application for registered certificates in exchange for the warrants—he signed it in my presence, and entered himself as a shipping agent—having got that, the shares were sold the next morning, 15th—on June 24th Haynes called again with a transfer receipt for 100 shares—Mr. Dawes was not in—Haynes handed the document to me; we acted on it and sold the further 100 shares—the first lot realised £1,725, and the second £1,622 10s.—the first four warrants, 845 to 848, I lodged with the Consolidated Company together with the conversion request—to the purchaser of those first 100 I really delivered the second 100; the company will not certify the transfer on the warrant receipt till the directors have signed the certificate; but they will certify on that ticket; so to make it good I took round that ticket, and the company certified on it; and so really I delivered the second 100 before the first 100—Haynes signed the transfer for these—this certificate certifies that the company hold the shares for the person to whom it is made out—I paid Haynen myself by giving him this cheque in our office on June 26th for £1,714 15s. 6d. that is £1,725 less our charges; it is endorsed by Haynes—he came to our office, signed the transfer, and I gave him the cheque which has passed through our bank and been paid—I saw him at our office after that when he came there to see Mr. Abrahams, and again I saw him at Gravesend where he lived—I went to get him to sign a letter to the bank stopping the money.</p>

I drew myself, payable to H. J. Haynes—I did not know it was paid into pollard's account—I know it now—I cannot say whether that is what a nominee would do who was selling shares for another person—I was not present at the interview when Haynes came to Mr. Dawes's office to see Mr. Abrahams—we first heard from Mr. Abrahams about these shares being stolen—I thought there was nothing wrong about the transaction—when he came to the office he came down the corridor and went out and I simply said "Good-morning" to him as he went' out—I went to see him at Gravesend at Mr. Dawes's request on 12th July; I then asked him to sign a letter for Mr. Dawes's solicitor to the manager of the Middlesex Banking Company and he did so—I read the letter.

Holman and Co.—I certainly should not deal with a clerk; it is against the rules of the Stock Exchange, and I should be liable to expulsion for it—I did not think there was anything wrong about this transaction when he produced the shares, not till I had the advice of Mr. Abrahams early in July—I thought there was nothing wrong when I handed him the cheque, or I should not have given it—with regard to the second transaction no money has actually passed to the prisoner—I had instructions to sell a further 100, and when the fraud was discovered it left me in the position of having sold something I could not deliver, and I had to buy some others to satisfy the purchaser—I have lost altogether £1,874 odd—the fraud as to the first 100 shares sold was dis<lb/>covered by the company, and although the buyer had taken up the shares and sent them in for registration when the fraud was discovered, the com<lb/>pany went back on that and threw the transfers back on the buyer's hands—he applied to the Stock Exchange Committee; they summoned me before them and adjudicated on the matter, and after going before the Grand Committee, they ordered me to find <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> shares for the first lot—I had parted with £1,700 odd for that first 100—I had to go into the market and buy another 100, so as to satisfy the buyer—with regard to the second 100, I sold them in the ordinary course of business—the fraud was discovered; I found I could not deliver, and I had to go into the market and buy back that 100, and the difference between that at which I sold and that at which I bought involved a loss on me of About a further £200—I live in hopes of getting some of the £1,700 back—I instructed my solicitors, who drafted the letter which Haynes signed—I did not see Collard at my office on the first occasion; I know now he was there—the meeting at my office on 8th July took place at 2.30 or 3—Haynes and Mr. Abrahams were there, and a detective, and myself and Mr. Robins, my solicitor, I think, and Mr. Bedborough, at a part of the interview—I think the cheque for £1,704 was produced, and Mr. Abrahams, I believe, asked Haynes if it was his endorsement; he said it was—I heard him answer questions—the gist of it was that Mr. Abrahams called on Haynes to account for the transactions, and he replied to the questions, but I cannot say what he said—the detective was there—after the interview Haynes went away—Mr. Abrahams showed him this letter of introduction, saying how much Haynes was worth, and asked with a smile, "Is this true?" and Haynes said, "I wish it were"—Haynes then signed, at the joint request of the people present, the transfer for the other shares—I cannot remember all the explanations that were given; but the gist of his answers was that he had been en<lb/>trapped into it by Collard, and that he was innocent, and that the cheque he had got for this first transaction had been paid intact into Collard's account—he answered all the questions put to him by Mr. Abraham, so satisfactorily that he went away unarrested—I did not know at the time of the first transaction that Collard had anything to do with it, or I should not have dealt with them; I discovered it a day or two afterwards—I did not know who Collard, the man who signed the letter, was; my clerk brought in the letter, and said this introduction was from a neighbour of his, but I did not understand that he was a clerk in this company, or that</p>

               <p>he was then in my outside office—I did not know that the coupons were cut, or that anything was pecular about the shares; Salton reported it to me—he did not say the deputy-registrar of the company was there—and could explain it—a few shares not connected with the Consolated Gold<lb/>fields were sold for Collard, by his order, for the account of someone else, but that bargain was never completed; he was supposed to have the shares, but he never delivered them, so they had to be bought back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That was on 14th June; I did not know then who he was—when Haynas was in my room, and I had the letter before me, I believed he was a man of substance and means; if I had not so be<lb/>lieved I should not have dealt with him—when the time came to de<lb/>liver the 100 shares I gave the buyer the document he had brought me, which was a receipt, and which would be received in the ordinary course as a document of title to 100 shares for convenience in practice—I was in the difficulty that I had not delivered the warrants—my total loss is £1,874 odd over it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary of the Middlesex Banking Company, of 79 and 80, Leadenhall Street—Collard had an account there; I pro<lb/>duce a certified and correct copy of it—it was opened on May 3rd, 1895, on Haynes's personal introduction—I knew Haynes before; he had an account with us at that time, but it was dormant—on June 26th this cheque for £1,714 15s. 6d. was paid by Haynes into Collard's account, and was duly cleared and credited—among the debits to the account is £2 to Haynes on May 22nd, and £5 on June 19th—on June 26th are debits to self £100, Collard £100, and Moore £50, by these three cheques—Haynes paid those two £100 cheques into his own account on June 26th, and so revived his dormant account—"this is a certified copy of his account—before the payment in of that £200 there was a debit balance of £2—on the same June 26th he drew out £100 to self by this cheque—the next credit to Haynes's account is on July 2nd, £50, and on the same day there is a debit of £50 to Collard's account by the same £50 cheque—altogether he paid in £250—the account was operated on down to 9th July—on July 8th I find debits of £50 and £12, and on July 9th a debit of £1 1s.—there is now a credit of 17s. 6d. to the account—it was about 3.30 that he drew out the £50—I remember it; it was after Mr. Abrahams had instructed us about Collard's account—there is a debit account of £1,000 to Collard's account on June 27th Haynes instructed us as to that—he brought a telegram from Antwerp, purporting to come from Collard, and asking for a remittance to be sent to him there, and we acted on it, and sent a draft equal to £1,000 to Collard at Antwerp by post—at that time Collard had about £3,800 to his credit; there was the credit on 26th of £1,714 15s. 6d.; that would be cleared on 27th—he had not £1,000 apart from the £1,700 cheque on the 27th—we took it for granted that cheque would be met—Haynes gave us Collard's address at Antwerp, and we forwarded to that address—Collard's account was operated on up to July 4th—I heard there was a warrant out for him—some days before his arrest, I think, Mr. Abrahams gave us notice not to part with this money we held.</p>

               <p>paid in the £1,714 15s. 6d. to Collard's account; Haynes could not draw against it—when he brought it he told us to send a draft for £1,000 to Antwerp to Collard, and gave us Collard's address there, and we sent the draft—there was no concealment about it—Haynes opened his account eighteen months or two years ago; it had been standing with the debit balance for three or four months, or perhaps more—I believe July 8th was Monday; an entry appearing on that date does not mean that that was the date the cheque was drawn or dated, but the cheque on that day was paid across the counter to him, and we should debit him at once—it was a cheque from his own book—I believe he came on Saturday, July 6th, and said he was going to close his account—I be<lb/>live he said something about opening a deposit account in his wife's name—I believe he said he would call on the Monday and either take an interest note for his wife or else take the cash—I did not see this cheque till the Monday, so far as I know; if he drew it on Saturday there is no reason why he should not have cashed it then—he spoke on the Saturday of coming again on the Monday—I believe there is still about £12 or £13—I did tell him how much there was to his credit—I might hare told him on the Saturday there was £50 or £60—I now re<lb/>member that he wrote out this cheque for £50 on the Saturday, and left it at the Bank saying he would call for the money on Monday, or a deposit note in his wife's name—after that he came to the Bank, and X told him he was slightly overdrawn, and he paid in £1 Is. to meet the overdraft—£13 was not standing to his credit—we had his address at lime Street in our books—there was no concealment on his part about the transactions with the cheques.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to receiving some of these warrants—I know Haynes—on Monday, June 24th, I came up from Margate to London, and met Collard at Holborn Railway Station by appointment—we drove to Haynes's office; Collard went in, and I waited outside—Haynes came out, and we all went to the Middlesex Bank—to the best of my recollection Collard and Haynes went in there, and I waited outside—after that we all went into a public-house, where Collard wrote out, in the bar, a cheque for £50 in my name, one for Mrs. Collard for £50, one for Haynes for £100, I think—Collard handed all three cheques to Haynes, saying to him, "You must cash them to-morrow, and hand £50 to Moore, £50 to Mrs. Collard," and the third cheque in Haynes's name he could do what he liked with—Collard asked Haynes to get the bankers to send him abroad a draft for £1,000 on the Brussels Bank—he must have previously said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189510210101"/>
               <p>that he was going abroad—Collard left England the same evening; it must have all taken place on Tuesday, 25th—I remained behind—next day I met Haynes, by an appointment made on the day Collard left, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and he gave me the £50 as agreed—he told me he was going to see Mrs. Collard, and that the bankers would send on the £1,000 draft for Collard by post that night—I think I told him I was going to Antwerp to meet Collard; I agreed to go the next day—I asked him in St. Paul's Churchyard or in a place of refreshment what he would do in the event of these transactions being discovered—he said, as far as I remember, that he would know what to do—I left England that night, and joined Collard—the £1,000 draft reached him at Antwerp—I went on with him to Brussels and then to Paris, where we were arrested and extradited—I had sold some of these warrants abroad—I am not certain whether I told Haynes I had done so—up to the time of these transactions I was a clerk in the Oceana Com<lb/>pany at Cornhill—I only knew Haynes lightly—I don't think I have met him more than seven or eight times.</p>

               <p>Company—up to the time of leaving England Collard was in our employ<lb/>ment as a transfer clerk—we found him in the company, and took him over as having a knowledge of the business—some of the shares of the Simmer and Jack Company are bearer warrants for a certain number of shares, and pass from hand to hand—powers were issued at the end of February for the use of them—the company convert those into registered shares on application of the possessor—it was Collard's duty to receive those warrants and applications for conversions, and take the necessary steps to carry it out by cancellation—in consequence of inquiries I made at the end of June I ascertained that warrants so lodged, representing 1,087 shares, had been stolen—the value of the shares then was 17 1/2, now it is 26; the face value was £1—among the warrants so stolen were four, numbered 845 to 848, which appear in the first instance to have been lodged by Reubens and Reichenbach, and then stolen and subsequently lodged by Mr. Dawes, and again stolen—I once saw Haynes in the Company's office—I inquired his business, and he said that only Mr. Collard could attend to it—this receipt for 100 shares cancelled is a false document, no such shares were lodged in the office; the counterfoil is blank; no such transfer was ever received in the office—after Collard had left the country I put the matter into the hands of Messrs. Abrahams, who took steps to procure his extradition—we took some time to ascertain what the facts were; we are not entirely clear yet.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector, City</hi>). I have been the officer in charge of this case from the first—I arrested Haynes on Sep<lb/>tember 10th—I went to 50, Lime Street, with Outram, and saw him, and asked him if he would kindly walk out; he did so—I told him I had a very unpleasant duty to perform, that I was going to take him into custody, and he would be charged, with Collard, Leach, and Moore, in being concerned with stealing a number of warrants in the Simmer and Jack Company, Limited, on or about June 14th, 1895, total value about £1,725, Nos. 845 to 848—he said "I thought I had given an explanation of this. Do I understand you that this charge refers to the first trans<lb/>action I had with Mr. Dawes?"—I said "Yes"—he was charged—he made no further reply to the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On July 3rd I arrested Moore and Collard in Paris, after following them from Antwerp and Brussels—the next arrest occurred after I arrive I back in England on July 13th—I arrested Haynes on September 10th—I had seen him from time to time at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> office in the Old Jewry and at Messrs.

Abrahams' office, that of the £200 he had given £50 to Moore, and a portion of the cheque in notes to Moore to be given to Oollard, and he also had £50, which was given for himself, also £50 for Mrs. Oollard, and he only gave her £15 out of that £50—the £50 was given to him for his services in the matter—Mr. Abrahams told him to speak the truth, and said he need not be afraid, because there was something previous where he had not spoken the truth—in another occasion at Messrs. Abrahams' Haynes corrected a statement of his evidence, I believe—he had made a statement of what evidence he could give, which was taken down in shorthand and afterwards transcribed and read to him, I believe, and he made a few corrections. (<hi rend="italic">This statement was put in and read</hi>). I should think that was the ordinary statement a solicitor would take from a man he was going to call as a witness; it was taken on various occasions at several interviews—I believe Haynes was willing to make the statements; they were the results of answers to questions by Mr. Abrahams—he gave certain information which was found to be wrong, and then he corrected it; he gave an explanation as to where the money went to, and I had the notes traced—I thought he was speaking the truth till I traced the notes back—I was in communication with him most of the time; ho gave me his address—there was no concealment on his part—I have made inquiries as to his character—Mr. Holman, his employer, gives him a good character; he says he knew him when he was in very much better circumstances, and that he was once in business for himself, and he was once in partnership in Plymouth, and that he had known him for about twelve years as a very highly respectable man—he had been to see me so often that arresting him was an unpleasant duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Michael Abrahams, Sons and Co., of 8, Old Jewry, who have had the conduct of this case for the Consolidated Goldfields—I was engaged in making inquiries into this case on the instructions of Mr. Bedborough—I took steps to procure the extradition of Collard, and subsequently that of Moore—then Leach was arrested before Collard and Moore were brought over here—in connection with my inquiries I came into contact with Mr. Dawes, and through him learnt that Haynes was connected with this matter—on July 8th I saw Haynes at Mr. Dawes' office, and told him of Collard's arrest and that we found he (Haynes) had been dealing with some of these bearer warrants, and I told him he would have the opportunity of making a statement or not, and that <hi rend="italic">if</hi> he made a statement it might be used against him; he must judge for himself—he said he would be perfectly willing to answer any questions—I asked him questions with regard to the case based on facts I already knew, and I took notes of his answers—I knew then that Collard had an account at the Middlesex Banking Com<lb/>pany by tracing the cheque—I had found out Mr. Dawes through the cheque—I had had inspection of Collard's banking account—I had no knowledge then that Haynes had a banking account—I asked him on mention the £100 cheque at that interview; he told me he had only received the two £50 cheques, £50 for Moore and £50 for Mrs. Collard, and said he only received £50 himself, which he had received later when he sent the £1,000 remittance to Brussels—he said he had been promised £100, but he did not say he had received it—Outram followed him that day, and I know he drew £50 out of the bank that day—portions of a cheque for Moore and Mrs. Collard were traced to him, which he said he had handed over; it was not mentioned at the interview—at a later stage I found he had a banking account, and I got access to it, and found he had <hi rend="italic">£</hi> 100 beyond what he had told me—when Collard and Moore were brought over here a statement was made with regard to the case by Moore, which was afterwards tested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not intend to use Haynes' statement; I did not know what he was going to say when I cautioned him—he only came to me three times—he came eventually each time I sent for him—I took this proof from questions I put to him, and when I discovered further acts I telegraphed asking him to call, and told him he had not told me the truth—he did call, and I put the further facts to him, and he admitted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189510210105"/>
               <p>them, and then I made the interlineations in the proof; he never saw it—I made the proof as a note of what statements he had made; we had not then determined what we were going to do with him—he was not arrested till two months afterwards—I acted on advice of counsel in having him arrested—Haynes did not call and say there were some matters in his brief which were not quite correct and which he wanted to alter—he called about July 15th, when I sent him a telegram to come about further facts I had obtained—his answers satisfied me to such an extent that I did not have him arrested there and then; I should not necessarily have proceeded against him there and then if his answers had been unsatisfactory—I have here the short notes I made at the one interview.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It took two months to get Collard and Moore back to this country; they did not come back till September—proceedings had been taken against Leach, but they were dormant till then.</p>

I am a shipowner, and a member of the firm of John Holman and Co., 50, Lime street—I have known Haynes-for ten or twelve years off and on; for twelve months he has been in my employment, he has been honest, industrious, steady and willing; we had no complaint to find with him. That is his general reputation so far as I know.</p>

I adopted the name of Hunter because I was only a sleeping partner; I only had to sign cheques, and I thought it wise to have them signed by both partners—I did not wish my name to appear; it was simply a matter of convenience, so that people should not bother me on other business—I was not in any other business—I called at the office once a fortnight during the first part of the time, oftener in May and June—there was no new agreement—I thought it necessary to see how things were going on—I went practically every day towards the end of June; I had no duties—the agreement was in writing—there was no arrangement; the cheque was not to be paid unless Ashbolt pressed for it—I said to Badger the cheque would be paid at once when he called—I learned it had been dishonoured the week following its negotiation; I learned of the forgery a few weeks after Badger was arrested—I did not know Ashbolt's name had been signed on the cheque; I saw it lying in the drawer a mouth after it was drawn—I learned Ashbolt had not the money within a few weeks of its being drawn—I spoke to Badger about it—he said he had paid another mans account with the money in the bank, and that he must pay it; that was before I saw the cheque lying in the drawer—it was not draw" out of the cheque-book—I did not look to see if it was an open cheque—I may have paid the men occasion<lb/>ally—I received £35 on account of the business—Badger was away from</p>

I am a labourer, of 3, Duke Street, Aldgate—on 5th September I was in Warner Street, Clerkenwell, about 11.30 p.m.—the prisoner, with Alice Sims, whom I know, stopped me and asked if I passed a remark about his young woman, Alice Sims, when I was drunk, and I said, "Yes"—Sims asked me if I had said I saw her going home with a young man, and I said, "Yes"—it was no business of mine—she got out of temper and was about to strike me, I put up my hand to stop her—the prisoner hit me in the eye with something—my eye—bled—I put up my handkerchief and walked away, but as the eye kept on bleeding I went to the hospital, where they told me my eye was stabbed, and took it out—Sims did not say, "Why have you taken my character away?" she said it was not true—I did not say, "Goaway, or I'll kick your guts in"—that is all invention—I have heard she gave evidence before the Magistrate, but what she said I do not know—I did not try to hit the prisoner with a knife first—I had no knife in my pocket—I did not then carry a knife—Alice was carrying a baby—she passed it to her sister—I had simply said I had seen Sims out with another chap.</p>

Last month I was house-physician at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—on September 6th the prosecutor came and made a complaint that he had received an injury to his eye—he had a small recent superficial wound to the left of the eye on the temple with no distinctive marks about it—besides, on the left eyelid were two superficial wounds, a small cut one-eighth of an inch deep, and a wound parallel with the edge of the lid about an inch in length, completely cutting through the lid, an extremely clean cut—in the eye itself was a wound which corresponded with the second wound—the danger depended upon the depth of the wound, which it was impossible to determine without an operation by removing the eye at once—that was done—even then it was impossible to say how deep the wound had penetrated—it would endanger the man's life if it penetrated the bone—the wounds must have been done with a very sharp instrument.</p>

I live at 21, Grove Place, Ealing; he and his wife had been lodging at 7, Hope Road for about six weeks—he has been in the Post Office regularly for about thirteen years—he was in the Post Office at Ealing; part of that time he was at Acton—he left the service about two years ago, since then he has not been in any work—while he was out of work his wife had another child, Stanley Victor; he was born about six months ago—his wife went out as a charwoman—that was the only support of the family, which consisted of the boy, Victor, and two other children, a little girl of five and a boy of two years and a-half—they were very often in want; I helped them all I could, and I believe the neighbours were very kind to them at times—they were in dreadful distress; they got rid of everything they had—for the last twelve months the prisoner has been in very low spirits, he could not tell what would happen; they have often cried over each other, and wanted to know where the next loaf would come from—on September 27th he said the neighbours had talked about it, and said that he ought to go to work instead of his wife—I said, "Never mind, you are not able to work"—on Saturday, the 28th, I was called to the house by his wife and searched the house; I asked if she had searched the bed, she said, "No"—then, she screamed and said she had seen the boy's head—I screamed and became unconscious, and the next I saw was Dr. Brough.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, at 49, Uxbridge Road. Ealing—on the evening of September 28th I was called to 7, Hope Road, and between the bed and mattrees I found the dead body of a child, stretched out, with one arm by its side, the feather bed over it, and on the bed was a bolster, with another child asleep on it—an apron was tied round the mouth and nose of the deceased child, tied with a single hitch at the back of the head, fairly tight—there was a slight bruise over the abdomen, the pressure of the bed clothes would account for that—there were no marks of where the thing was tied—I locked the door, took the key, and gave information to a constable—I subsequently made a post-mortem examination—I found the left hand clenched; the internal organs were healthy, there was no disease anywhere—in my opinion death was due to suffocation; either the bed clothes or the apron would account for it, but whether before or alter death I could not say—I have known the prisoner slightly, I attended his father a good many years, also his wife—the father suffered from diabetes for six or seven years—I don't think I can say he was insane—I think that a child of diabetes parents would be more likely to be insane than the child of healthy parents; it would be more prone to have its mind affected—the father, to my knowledge, had diabetes eight or nine years, and it was hereditary in the family.</p>

He has shown no regret for having committed the act, and has hardly appeared to realise the position in which he is placed, or the gravity of the crime which he has committed—I questioned him about the crime, and he told me that at the time he committed the act he seemed to hear a voice, not human, telling him to do the deed, and he felt he must kill the child; and after he had killed it, he felt a satisfaction at having killed it—I was informed he had been out of work for some years—that has helped me to form an opinion—in a person disposed to insanity that would be a factor or predisposing cause—I have not come across any cases of children of diabetic parents being prone to insanity, but it is stated both by Dr. Maudsley and Dr. Savage, two of the greatest au<lb/>thorities on mental diseases, that the children of the people who have suffered from diabetes are very prone to become insane—in my opinion on September 28th he was suffering from temporary insanity, with homicidal impulse—I think at the time he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was committing—the mother of the girl, who is in an asylum, and the father of this man having suffered from diabetes, affect my opinion in that way—diabetes is not a common disease; I could not tell you whether it is hereditary, I have not met with such cases.</p>

Graham, of Oporto, large wine dealers—I have known the prisoner a number of years in the wine trade—I in<lb/>troduced him to Messrs. Watson, whisky merchants, and he was their agent up to his failure—he came on March 29th and told us he had bought Barker's Distillery, and should have a large sum of money to find to pay for it; he had proposed that we should assist him by making him a loan, and he would give us in return a considerable order for Graham's port—the question of the loan was referred to our principal, and declined—he came back in May, and from that time various samples came in, all of port, and on or about August 25th he gave this order: "8 pipes 8 hogsheads, W.B.S." signed Austin—W.B.S. means, Wm. Baker &amp; Son—the port arrived about September 19th, and we sent this letter with the bill of lading, it is a lithographic form—a bill at twelve months was originally drawn in one amount, but at the prisoner's request it was divided into three bills, making £812 10s. altogether—before the bankruptcy proceedings I had no knowledge that our port had been handed to Blumenthal or Westell—I asked him whether he was in possession of the distillery, as I understood he wanted the wine, for the distillery; he said that he was—the bills have not been met, and we have proved in the Bankruptcy Court, and recovered nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in Brown and Panks, 16, Mark Lane, we are creditors for £1,200 or £1,300—I was on the committee—four warrants for brandy were delivered to the prisoner, which were paid for to the extent of two-fifths of the forty hogsheads—the contract was in May, 1894; this is it, it is in the form of a letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was under that contract that the forty hogsheads were delivered—the invoice of the brandy would be £2,500, but £1,000 was paid for, because it was deducted from the champagne, so that left two-fifths—I paid £2,000 that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sold him this quantity of brandy and bought of him a quantity of champagne—it was what we call a contrary trans<lb/>action, I buy and I sell—it was entered into more than six months before his bankruptcy; he was, of course, bound to take the brandy, but he might have used it for his own purposes—he might have had it all at once, subject to the delivery of the champagne—when the champagne was to be delivered in May there was so much short that he could not deliver, and it was arranged that I was not to deliver the brandy till he delivered the champagne; he was generous in the matter, and it was arranged that the whole should be kept by me—on the day he is supposed to have done something wrong he came to me for forty hogsheads of brandy, and delivered me as much champagne, part of the contract as I required—he certainly did not obtain the brandy fraudulently.

               <p>for it—I consulted with my manager, and agreed to lend him the money he would require, and sold him some goods at the same time—he said that his position was first rate, and he should be all right—the advance was to be made by his acceptance, and I gave him this cheque for £739 7s. 11d., which was paid by my bankers—the order he gave me was for four hogsheads and four quarter-casks and four cases of sherry, total £220—that was added to my cheque advance and the whole drawn against—I handed him two delivery orders for the port and sherry—those bills have not been paid—he came again on the 2nd, and said if I would discount a bill drawn on Mr. Abbot he would give me a further order; I knew Mr. Abbot, he confirmed what he had said about the distillery—I discounted Mr. Abbot's bill and he met it duly—on that occasion the prisoner gave me an order for four quarter-casks of brandy, price £422 11s. 6d., and a pipe of port—I have not been paid—I am a creditor for £1,300 9s.</p>

I am a wine and spirit broker, in partnership in Mark Lane—I have had transactions with the prisoner for 18 months, selling goods, making deposits, and discounting bills for him—we did not get cover—in 1884 we accepted some bills, and he was to ship us champagne to cover the acceptances before they became due—we did not get that security, and I saw him about it after September—on November 7th we received from him an order for nine hogsheads and four quarter-casks of brandy, and on November 9th an order for port; those were realised by us as against our advances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made the advances on champagne about September 4th or 5th, 1894—I knew that the wine was to come—none of it came by November. When I got the four hogsheads he did not make any advance—by this transaction with us he would put no money in his pocket, he was only covering; he did not by that transaction get any fresh advance—he did not draw on us, he drew on Blumenthal—we did get bills equivalent to ours, and he was able to get them discounted—in point of fact, we gave him bills, and he gave us bills for a similar amount, but I did not look upon them as valuable—one of them was met. I have done a considerable amount of business with him during the eighteen months—these goods were put in our catalogue in the usual way, but were not advertised till January; they were sold in January—there</p>

I am manager of the London Trading Bank, Limited, Coleman Street—Mr. Moore has been a customer twelve or fourteen years—we made a loan to him on October 19th, 1894, of £500, and received as surety warrants for 997 dozen of champagne, and this draft drawn by Moore and accepted by the prisoner—I have no doubt these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are part of the warrants we took from Moore on October 19th—I am under the impression that the £500 was a loan on the dock warrants, not a bill discounting transaction—this is an acceptance by Austin, and drawn by Moore; it was not paid, and our bank are realising the value of the 990 dozen of champagne.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a spirit merchant of 37, Mark Lane and proprietor of the Bishops gate distillery, formerly known, as Barker's distillery, immediately opposite Leadenhall Station—prior to June, 1895, I had known the prisoner for some time, and he told me in July, 1895, that he had bought that distillery to sell again if he could find a purchaser—I said, "Well, it will be a very good thing, Austin, but I do not want it"; he said, "If I were to put it at a certain price should you feel inclined to go in for it?" I said, "Come to business;" he said, "I will let you have it for £6,000." I immediately told him it would be of no use to me; he said, "How would it be for you to take it on lease?" I said, "Yes, I might do something if you were to make the price right; "he said he would think it over—I saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189510210124"/>
               <p>him again about two days afterwards; he said that he had thought the matter over; I said, "How would it suit you if I sold you the distillery for £25,000 on fifty years' lease at £2,000 a year?" I said, "No, that won't suit me;" he said, "What do you think; what will you do?" I said, "Well, I should not mind giving £22,000 for the lease, and fixtures at a valuation in the usual way." I saw him several times afterwards, and on August 29th this agreement was made by this letter (<hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Mr. Abbot, offering to sell the premises for</hi> £22,500, <hi rend="italic">at a yearly rental of</hi> £2,000, <hi rend="italic">the stock and fixtures to be taken at a valuation</hi>)—after that I sent this letter of August 29th (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing several bills and agreeing to accept the terms subject to the solicitor being satisfied that the prisoner had power to grant the lease</hi>)—I saw him some time in September—he had previously told me he had thirty pipes of port wine, as I had the distillery it might be of use to me—he did not name the shipper—I said that I did not want it, I had plenty of my own—a day or two afterwards his manager, Mr. Chorley, was in my office and I said, "I think, Chorley, Mr. Austin has got thirty pipes of port wine; I have been thinking it over, and I think I can do a deal with him;" he said, "What is it?" I said, "In the event of my buying part of the port would Mr. Austin take a cask of brandy?" he said, "I will see, I don't know,"—he came round later in the afternoon offering me thirty pipes of Gardner's port and six pipes of Baker's; he said he would sell me those and take the brandy, and asked me what the brandy was; I told him about ninety-seven hogsheads, he said that Austin would do the deal—I did not see Austin till after the deal was carried out, Chorley brought the invoices next day, and the bills—this is an invoice from Austin for the thirty-six pipes of port and the contract, and I sent my invoice for the brandy—these are the delivery orders I sent Austin in respect of the brandy (<hi rend="italic">All dated September 27th, making up forty-four hogsheads.</hi>)—I have received no port wine from him nor any documents representing it—I gave bills in accordance with the contract, and have met them all as they became due, and am a creditor for the amount from the estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I began the negotiations for the distillery in July; Austin was working it at that time, he had bought it for a livelihood, he was in possession and took me over it—I found a very large parcel of port wine there—it was taken from Neville, Read &amp; Co., and part of the business consisted of dealing in port—after that date and before the 29th they were negotiating with me, and on the 29th the price was reduced—September 17th was the day originally fixed for the trans<lb/>action to be completed—it was I who introduced the subject of port wine, I wanted to sell my brandy and thought I should be able to sell it if I had the port—it did not suggest itself to me that there was any fraud or I should not have done it; I have not suggested that there was—the £970 was bills which I gave for port, and Austin gave me a bill for the brandy at the same time—it did not occur to me at the time that Chorley or Austin would cheat me—I did get six pipes of port, £270 worth, and I parted with £400 worth of the brandy: I gave my acceptance for the whole, and he gave his acceptance for the brandy—I took a lease from him, I did not know what he had given for it exactly; £40,000 is what rumour said on the market—I took a lease for forty-eight years, and paid £22,500 for the goodwill and lease, it was worth</p>

               <p>£40,000—he got altogether £62,000, another £3 500 was paid for stock and fixtures: he made a very good thing out of it—the completion was post<lb/>poned from time to time. Messrs. Nicholson, the distillers, advanced a sum of money and insisted on having from Austin a mortgage of his reversion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I not only paid my own bills but I had to take up the acceptances, and I only got six pipes of port—I did not know that my brandy, for which I had delivery orders, had been sold on the same day—I believed when he made the bargain that he had power over the port wine to carry out his bargain; he sold me the leasehold, but he gave the £40,000 for the freehold.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to W. and T. Restell, of Mark Lane; I have had large transactions with Austin for some years, he bringing me warrants and delivery orders for wine and brandy, on which securities I made advances—for five years prior to December 9th, 1894, my transactions with him came to about £57,000—my rate of interest is 5 per cent, per annum and 1/2 per cent per month—if goods were sent to me for the purposes of sale the broker's charge would be 5 per cent.—we would hand him money on goods sent for sale, there would be no 1/2 per cent. only, the 5 per cent, and brokerage—when I made advances on dock warrants or delivery orders he paid 11 per cent. per annum; that was my regular charge, but sometimes we have more money than we know what to do with, and let it out for less—on September, 1894, there was a general amalgamation of the different accounts we had with him, and on October 1st he was indebted to the firm £11,000 18s. 10d.—on October 17th we received some money from him, and on the 18th he paid us £600 to take up certain securities, and on the 30th more money; on November £21, £50, and on November 12th £120 10s.—on August 16th, 1894, Austin called, and saw Mr. Thomas Restell; I was present part of the time—shortly before that I had made an advance of £1,000 on some champagne which was to come from France, and on handing him the £1,000 he handed us a delivery order—in consequence of the champagne not arriving so rapidly as it should, Mr. Austin promised to give us cover till it arrived; it was a shipper's port, Graham's I believe—we received the bill of lading from Blumenthal on, I think, November 3rd, for thirty pipes of Graham's port—since the filing of his petition we have had the whole of the securities we held of his, including the pipes of port from Blumenthal—in nearly every instance Austin either placed a reserve price on them, or attended the sales and bought in largely—we received no invoice with the dock orders showing of whom they had been purchased—our principal business is that of wine and spirit brokers—when property is sent to us to sell they do not send any documents—in our early transactions when we sold, it was to realise our securities on advances made by us, and we should render him an account sale—Graham's port realised £600 or £650.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The charges we made to Austin were the ordinary charges made by gentlemen in the trade; we did not make any extra<lb/>ordinary charges to him—we do a very large business—these transactions were of the kind which take place in the wine business—I have known Mr. Austin fifteen years; he has borne a good character; we had a great amount of confidence in him—I have heard of Goldsmith and Vicker, merchants of Oporto; they ship port wine—having regard to his</p>

               <p>statement at the Bankruptcy Court that he did not name the shipper of the port to me I am still under the impression that he mentioned Graham's port—the wine was to be shipped throughout the year on six or nine months' credit—the wine was advertised for sale in our cata<lb/>logue, and in the trade circulars, and in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, giving the shippers and the quantities; there was no concealment about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This is a fair specimen of how we advertise our wine, "Ex ship" so and so, and the port of consignment; any one who read the catalogue had the means of recognising his own goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant—I was duly appointed trustee of Austin's estate—I have had in my possession a number of his books and documents, now in Court, which I have examined—on folio 681 of the ledger is an account called the Bishopsgate Distillery purchase account—the amount to the debit of that account is £33,534 9s. 9d.—that account includes the whole of the purchase-money that was paid for the distillery and is credited on the other side, where appears the sale to Mr. Abbott for £22,500, and the premium on the lease, £1,800 for the sale of the Rose and Crown, also part of the Bishopsgate estate, and £861 17s. 2d. for the sale of another property, I do not know the name of, leaving the debit balance of £33,534 9s. 9d.—the totals are, to the debit £58,696 6s. 11d., and on the credit side £25,161 17s. 2d.—on the debit side appears £3,000 to £4,000 paid to the Official Receiver by Austin, because when he took possession of the distillery he accidentally collected debts belonging to the estate of Barker which appears in another book—on folio 684 appears an account called the Bishopagate Distillery Venture account—the total to the debit of that account is £17,664 4s. 2d. and there is a small credit of £161 2s. 9d., leaving a debit balance of £17,503 1s. 5d., and this account includes bonuses, commissions, solicitors' costs, valuers charges, bonus to Mr. Chorley, and items of that kind, and the stationery and other expenses in bringing out the company which would not float—that makes the total debit balance on the two accounts £51,037 11s. 2d.—on folio 678 is an account called the Bishopsgate Distillery Cash Account; the total to the credit of that account is £47,651 19s. 10d., and the debit is £28,118 18s. 4d., making a credit balance of £19,533 1s. 6d.—£42,000, which does not appear in these accounts for the purchase by Austin of the distillery, must be added to the £19,000, that is the payment for the value of the freehold—that is £61,533 1s. 6d., and the debit on the purchase of the venture is £51,037 11s. 2d., which becomes an apparent profit of £10,495 10s. 4d.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189510210127"/>
               <p>the result of the purchase, as it appears in Austin's books—the whole of that profit came into the estate—the whole of it and more was transferred on the purchse from Abbot for £22,500—£20,000 was transferred from Messrs. Nicholson and Watson, and Messrs. Portall and Dingall—apparently Auston owed those moneys and more to these two firms, who take Abbot as their creditor instead of Austin—there is nothing showing the £2,000 a year he was to get under the lease; the defendant mortgaged that for £42,000, which is given on the credit side—I have realised £200 out of the distillery on behalf of the estate by arrangement, £100 on the lease and £100 on the freehold—also £21 9s. from good debts, and from the £6,621, £586, and there may be a few pounds for some shares that I hold—the £30 2s. 6d. by the purchase of brandy was realised before I was trustee—the total assets I have realised are £845 4s. 3d.—I have taken out of the books the total amount of sales to persons other than Restells and Malley, Kelley and Co. as £14,816; including Moore £20,129 13s. 11d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am responsible as trustee for this prosecution—I have not advised that the defendant should be prosecuted—acting under the instructions of the committee of inspection I submitted to the Court that he ought to be prosecuted, not individually—I am quite fair and have no motive in the matter—I do not suggest the defendant is keeping anything back—or that he is a thief in the sense of taking money—I do not say in other senses he is a thief—he has given up everything to his creditors—I think the books show all his transactions—they are well kept—since the bankruptcy they were at once put before me—by the distillery he was making about £10,000 net, my figures show it—the net balance of the venture account, including cost of commissions and such like things, is £175,031—the £10,000 he had made was a liability on the estate—the whole profit has gone to the estate, not to his own profit—according to the books the commissions were paid from January 1st to December 27th, 1894—on December 21st last the commissions to Portall, Dingall and Co. were £20,000—£3,000 was on May 21st—that includes the bonus on loan of £5,000—the bulk of the com<lb/>missions were paid the latter part of the year—Moore had £2,500, and Chorley had £2,000 in August—the next big sum is £2,000 to Portalls on November 21st—they are a large wholesale market house in the trade—Austin's deficiency is £65,000 practically—I do not know who prepared the deficiency account—I pre<lb/>pared the statement of affairs—the estimated surplus arose from the difference between the supposed value of stock in the hands of brokers and the amounts advanced in respect of it—the brokers require two-thirds margin—the valuation of wines was what any man would get, presuming his statement is correct as to what he gave for them, but the £72,000 he gives in his statement of affairs is not all wines, see sheet <hi rend="largeCaps">B</hi>—I think he valued his securities fairly considering what he gave for them—the reserve price of the distillery was £42,000—I think he valued the freehold at £45,000—I have no reason to believe the wines were not fairly valued, of course there is always a difference between buying and selling by auction—only two creditors held wines—one was Restells—I think the wine was sold without reserve—at the time Austin failed he was agent for Watsons, whisky blenders, Dundes—I</p>

               <p>have understood he held an agreement with them all that he was to be their agent for his life—I think the agency was worth £2,500 a year, it may be more—it might vary according to the year—it was about £3,000 a year—on his bankruptcy, I believe, Messrs. Watson gave him notice—he was also interested in the company called Veuve Monnier et ses Fils, Limited—I daresay he put many thousands into it—the brand of champagne the company was exploiting was greatly advertised in the hope that it would become very saleable—that is a common way of investing money—he had reason to expect an income from the amount of money spent—he was managing director and promoter, and very much interested in it, and if the company had been a success it would have been very good for Austin—I think the actual figures are £5,000 that he held in shares—some are fully-paid shares—I do not disclaim them—the shares are held by his creditors as fully secured—the Veuve Monnier Company went into liquidation, and the shares were valueless—one of the causes of its failure was Austin's petition—if it had not been for that petition being filed Austin might have put more money into it—the Company came to an end a week or two afterwards—he financed the company—he had preference shares also which I include—I think 16,966 fully-paid up ordinary and 6,431 fully-paid up preference £1 shares is right—the company sold about 22,000; on 9,000 of which only 1s. had been paid, leaving 13,000 to 14,000 fully paid—the company at one time paid 5 per cent., I believe, not 7 per cent, or 8 per cent., I don't know, I was not interested—it did pay dividends—Mr. Wright has handed me an account, from which I find Austin held 21,000 fully-paid shares—from the books, it appears the Veuve Monnier Company were indebted to Austin £5,500 for advances—at the time of Austin's bankruptcy he was in no negotiation for the gale of Maxsutanie Champagne, not Champion—his bankruptcy put an end to that—he was to have got some such sum as £10,000 profit if he had carried it through.</p>

I had supplied them with food and lodging to the value of £4 3s. 8d. They said they were military men. I took them in believing their card was true.</p>

From information I had I went with Sergeant Maguire to 7, Draycott Terrace, Kensington; on Sep<lb/>tember 7th, about 7 p.m.—the front door was open—we walked in and tapped at the front ground-floor parlour door—someone said "Come in," and we walked in, and I saw the prisoners sitting at the table, dining—I said, "What is your name?"—Charles said, "I am Captain Gordon"—I said, "Where are you from?"—he said, "We have come from abroad"—I said, "We are going to take you into custody on suspicion of stealing some boots, by a trick, from Peter Yapp, in Sloane Street, on the 2nd of this month"—Charles said, "what is your authority for intruding on us in this manner?"—I said, "I have told you we are police officers"—he said, "How do I know you are police officers? show me your authority"—I produced my warrant card, which he examined; he said, "What is the charge against us?"—I said, "For stealing some boots by a trick from Peter Yapp, of Sloane street"—he said, "I have never had any boots from Peter Yapp; I never stole a pair of boots in my life"—I said, "You are now wearing a pair of boots that you stole from there; let me examine them"—he said, "Certainly not; there have been such cases as mistaken identity, and probably I shall have to take action against some one for this unwarranted intrusion on your part"—I said, "You will hare your remedy later on"—Richard said, "But getting boots on credit is not stealing"—I said, "What boots are you referring to, the boots from Peter Yapp?"—the other prisoner said, "We don't say we have had any boots from Peter Yapp"—Richard did not say any more—we took them to the station—on the way Charles kept drawing our attention, to some roughs following the cab—I told him not to bother about that—in Walton Street, just before we reached the Police-station, he said "Look, there is a lot of roughs following the cab"—he brought his hand up to the top of the cab door and I immediately seized his hand and looked out of the window and saw some paper drop—I said to Maguire, "He has dropped something"—he said, "What do you mean by dropping it? If you think I had anything in my hand get out and look for it"—after we got to the station I went and looked, and saw a number of pieces of pawnbrokers' duplicates torn in pieces—they do not refer to anything named in the indictment—I have pasted the pieces together, some are missing—they refer to overcoats, umbrellas. and a diamond ring pawned on the day of the arrest—in Charles's pocket at the station, I found some other parts of the tickets, these three keys, and visiting cards with the names of various clubs, but the surname blank—in their room I found this card, "Hon. H. F. Biddulph."—I said to the prisoners, "These parts of tickets belong to those you have thrown away in the street"—he said, "Yes, they belong to my own property—I</p>

               <p>said, "It is strange you should throw them away"—Richard said, "Well, when one has been better off, and placed in this position, you don't know what to do"—after that I searched the lodgings 7, Draycott Terrace—they had only been there from the previous evening—they were known there as Captain Gordon and his brother—they had two bedrooms and a sitting-room—the landlady provided some part of the dinner they were eating—the room was decorated with flowers, and there was a display of wine and fruit on the table; everything was in good style; the prisoners were in semi-evening suits, with <hi rend="italic">gardenias</hi> in their button-holes—I found a pair of boots and a pair of pumps, and next morning I requested the prisoners to take the boots from off their feet, and found they were Yapp's boots—at the station, when charged, Charles gave the name of Charles Michael, and Richard that of Richard Gordon, student—I asked them at the Police-court in the morning if they could refer me to anyone who could speak as to their respectability, and Charles said to Richard, "What about our father?" or something to that effect—he said his father lived at Birmingham, I think, but he did not wish to trouble him.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 16, Dalston Lane, and am a surgical instrument maker—the prisoner, who is my wile's brother, was in my employment as a mechanic for a little over two years from June, 1893—three years previously he had been in my employment—when he came back two years ago he brought no tools or materials; he worked with my tools, and on my material—his wages were £2 5s. a week, and Is. an hour overtime—he had no right to take away any tools or material when he left; that is the trade custom—on September 27th I went away, leaving the foreman in charge, the prisoner and six other hands, I believe—I returned to business on the following Friday morning, October 4th—I did not see the prisoner; I found a letter from him, which I threw in the waste-paper basket—I could not swear to his writing—I wrote to him, and afterwards, the same evening, went to 13, Englefield Road, where he was working for his father—I saw the prisoner, and in front of him some of the articles I had missed—I missed a number of patterns, several instruments and tools, and a number of drawings—he had no right to take any of those away—the policeman who went with me said he had come to take him into custody on a charge of stealing these articles; he made no reply—I saw there a pair of dies for screw cutting, special articles, with right and left-hand threads; they were specially made for me; there were taps to suit those dies, several patterns, a speculum of my own specially registered design, three punches used in the manufacture of tubes, and a little steel punch used for making an eye-scraper, and a drill and other things—I only recognised things I could actually prove—he was taken into custody—I afterwards went to his house, 36, Holly Street, where I found two tools, a brass pump of a special pattern I designed some years ago, two silver-plated curved tubes, part of an instrument, a German-silver pipe, and six vulcanite pipes, parts of an instrument—those things belonged to me—the prisoner had no right to take them—he had nothing when he came to me—he was absolutely destitute and prevailed on his sister to get him employment—he is a good workman—he had first £2 and afterwards £2 5s. a week—no wages were due to him—he was over-paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The rough trade value of these things is about £2 12s. 6d—the prisoner is 27 and married—I have been connected with his family for about 15 years—I partly learnt my trade from his father and partly from another firm I went to afterwards—I was with his father for about seven years—the prisoner is younger than I am—he worked with his father—he applied to my wife about six years ago, just before I left Messrs. Nichols and Sons, for relief—he had left his father, who was in a small way of business—I wanted him to go back to his father—I consented to do what I could to help him—I did not enter into partnership or divide profits with him, but I told him if he liked to start in business in his own name I would pay him a weekly salary—that continued for about five weeks, and then I found he was going to firms and drawing money and appropriating it instead of bringing it to me, and I would not have anything more to do with him—then he came to me about two years ago, and since then</p>

               <p>he has been in my employment as a servant—I took him hack because he came to my wife and Raid his wife and children were outside, and they had no home or money, and that unless he could get something to do he should drown himself; and his wife came to me, and under great pressure I took him back as a servant—he brought nothing when he came back—his father would have patterns, drills, dies and punches, and surgical instruments; his business is the same as mine—you would not find all these things at his father's place, because I am the only one in the trade that makes them—when the trade brings out a new article, they entrust it to one manufacturer to make it for them—I missed all these articles from my stock—this left-hand nasal speculum I made specially for an operation, for Mayer and Nelson; they returned it to serve as a pattern because they approved of the exact size; I had other orders to make the same thing of this particular character, Mayer's name is on it—I made dozens of others and: sent them out—here is my registration paper, dated in 1893, for that particular design—it was taken out just before the prisoner came back to me—I do not suggest that a practical working man could not carry in his mind the details of this—I know this particular one, because it has Mayer's distinctive stamp on it; it could only have been so stamped by them—it was at my place a week before I missed it—one of the boxes in which these things were found at the prisoner's house was a postal box sent to me by Mayer and Nelson—I was not at home when the prisoner left—my two assistants, Platt and Penalver, sit on each side of the prisoner at the bench—the prisoner could not be in the shop when no one was present—he being a better workman would instruct the others—these dies were made by my instructions to fit into this stock, and they are stamped with my punches, and these taps are made from the dies—I only charge the pri<lb/>soner with stealing those things which I can identify; these have all marks by which I can absolutely identify them. I had no idea that the prisoner was going to leave; he gave no notice—half an hour before he packed up these things, I said I should be away next week, and left him a week's work to do, and he said he would be there—the only bad terms between us were that he used to get drunk, and not come and do his work, and I used to tell him of it—I wrote asking him to return the articles; I only wanted to get back my things, and clear my <hi rend="italic">employes'</hi> characters—he made the dies and taps, not all the things; he cut some of the vulcanite tubes, not all.</p>

I shall be paying you £2 off what I owe you—he owed me £20, which I had lent to his mother and him—I gave him my cheque for £3 5s. on the London and County Bank—I gave his cheque for £5 5s., which is payable to T. King, to my butcher, Down, of West Kensington, after endorsing it—on the afternoon of the 14th Thorpe came with a bill for £35, and asked-me to give him £15, and said that on the following Thursday I could cash the bill and keep the money, and the difference would go towards what was owing by Onslow—he said he came from Onslow, who was waiting for him in town—the detective came to me on the evening of that day.</p>

Cd., and 2d. from another pocket, and four years' discharges, only leaving me this one—they struck me in the face; it was black and blue, and hurt two of my ribs, and I had a kick in the thigh which is sore now, and I had a blow in the stomach before I went down—some men were kneeling on the top of me—five minutes before I had seen that my purse was safe, when I came out of the Navy Arms—earlier in the afternoon I had been in the Gibraltar—in the evening I went to the Police-station, where I was shown a number of men, and I pointed out Dwyer and Taylor—Dwyer was the man who hit me in the face and knocked me down; I cannot say who took my money—I did not see the other two men till next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman of 5, Albert Street, New<lb/>ington—on August 10th I left my house unoccupied; the doors were locked and the windows fastened—on Friday evening, August 16th, I returned; the house was apparently as I had left it; but I found the breakfast parlour unlocked; and a chest of drawers were open, and £8 had been taken from the top drawers—on September 1st I went to Tun<lb/>bridge and met the prisoner—I asked him if he had broken into my place—he stoutly denied it for about an hour—afterwards, as we stood on the railway bridge, I said, "If you have any manliness in you for the sake of others open your mouth to clear other people"—he made no reply—I said, "Did you do this job by yourself?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you have anyone to help you in this job?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did not you have anyone to help you?"—he said, "No"—I said,. "Did not anyone open the door for you?"—he said, "No"—I said, "How did you get in?"—he said, "I jumped over the railings into the area; I had a large knife and opened the window; with the same knife I opened the drawers, and took the money there from; I forced the door open and went out of the street door which I closed behind me, and I got back to the Elephant about one o'clock"—he said he entered the house about twelve o'clock—previously to that I asked him what money he had got and he said he had only got 5s.—he said he had changed a sovereign at Bromley, another somewhere else, and another at the Chequers on August 24th—he had started hop-picking on the Monday before I saw</p>

               <p>him at Tunbridge—the drawers had been forced open; pieces of the wood work were broken away in the front and the locks were forced—the catch of the window was fastened, and I took no farther notice of it—I saw a slight mark on the box of the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, and am a silk buyer—on August 23rd, I left my house unoccupied, but properly fastened, and went for a holiday—on August 24th I heard something, in consequence of which I returned on the 26th—I found the house had been entered by breaking open the back door, and it had been thoroughly ransacked—I missed plate, a silver teapot, boots, and other articles, and these coins—I can swear to this George penny by a scratch on the top of the head—twenty-four plated spoons were among the things taken—about £18 was the total value of what I lost—these two pawn tickets were in my desk.</p>

On August 24th I went to 9, Upper Richmond Road, and examined the premises which were entered by some one passing up the carriage drive, getting through a gate, breaking a square of glass, inserting a hand, and unlocking the back door—it is a semi-detached house—it was ransacked from top to bottom in a very cruel way—great damage was done—cheffoniers and drawers were all broken open—inquiries were made in consequence of another man being arrested for another offence, and the prisoners were handed over to me on their arrest for another offence, for which they are not convicted—property was found on them.</p>

In consequence of instructions I went to Tunbridge Wells, where I found the prisoners detained—Noakes had this basket, which he owned—I found in it a number of tinker's tools, and in this little box I found these two coins, one a George penny—when Lynch was searched at Walworth these pawn-tickets were found in the, lining of his hat—both prisoners are tinkers by trade.</p>

I am a labourer, of 143, Vauxhall Walk—on September 5th, soon after 10 p.m., the prisoner's wife called me, and I went to their room, 3, Spring Gardens Walk—there was a bed in a corner, and the prisoner was standing about a foot from it—there were two children in the bed—the prisoner had a tin lamp in his left hand, not alight—I asked him if he was going to light it—he struck a match and dropped it on the bed, and the quilt caught alight—it was a lamp which hooks on to the wall—I can hardly say whether he held it straight, because there was no light in the room—he was very excited—I put the quilt out, it was not much of a flame—I said, "What are you doing of Charley?"—he did not answer, but struck another match, which fell on the bed, and the quilt caught fire again directly—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it burnt them holes in it—it smells of paraffin now—I pulled the quilt off the bed on to the floor, and stamped on it, and took up one child; a policeman came in at that moment and took up the other—the prisoner had been out of work three or four weeks and had buried a child that day—he is a respectable hard work<lb/>ing man—after the second match I said, "What are you doing?"—he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His wife had called me, but she was not in the room—I believe the lamp cost 9 1/2 d.—nothing but the quilt was set on fire—one child had been taken ill with fever, and was taken to the hospital and died there, and on this day he had just come back from the funeral—one of the other children was ill—I do not think the furniture was insured—he had been sitting on the bed that day in very great trouble.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker of 167, High Street, Borough—on August 22nd I exchanged these two rings for two other rings—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two rings taken in exchange, they are a wedding ring and keeper—they were exchanged for another wedding ring and keeper—heavier ones and something extra was paid—I lent the two rings subsequently to Bond which I received from the person who exchanged these rings—I cannot say who the person was to whom the exchange was made—the transaction was attended to by one of my assistants, but I go by the books.</p>

I am the wife of Frederick Allen, a plasterer, of 2, Alders Terrace, Merton Road, Tooting—on June 20th the two prisoners came and the male prisoner hired a furnished room for 4s. 6d. per week, but they were only in the room a few days—they lived there as man and wife from Monday to Wednesday—two constables came—there was a box there, the male prisoner brought it—they did not come in separately they came together, and the day afterwards the male prisoner went for the box and brought it to my house—I do not know whether it was used while they were there—it was taken away by the police afterwards—they also brought a child's cart.</p>

I am stationed at Leatherhead—on August 27th I received instructions from Inspector Smith, in consequence of which I came to London, and took the prisoners at 2, Alders Terrace, Upper Tooting, on the 28th—I got into the house with another con<lb/>stable, and knocked at their bedroom door—Rogers asked who was there—I said, "I want to speak to you"—he opened the door—I said, "Your name is Phillips?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "You will have to go with me for burglary"—he said, "I do not know what you mean"—the female prisoner was in bed—I told her to get up and dress, and at the station I told her to take off the two rings which she had on her finger—these are they, Mr. Feuillard identifies them—I searched Rogers, and found a new knife and a bunch of keys—a woman searched the female prisoner, and found a purse and 6s. and a pawn-ticket—I returned to the house where they lodged, searched between the bed and mattress, and found £31 10s. 11d.—there were two sovereigns of 1820 and 1826, an American dollar, two mites, and two Belgian coins—these coins have been identified by Mr. Brown—the prisoners were taken to Leather<lb/>head Police-station—I also found their box in the room; I took it to the station—Rogers said, "I shall plead guilty to stealing the money, but I found the window and door open; I did not break into the house; I went into the house for a certain purpose about 1.30; I did not break in, I saw the door open and went in, and the key was in the safe—on the way to</p>
