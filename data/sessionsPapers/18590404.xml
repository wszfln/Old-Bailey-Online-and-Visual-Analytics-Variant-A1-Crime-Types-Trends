                  </hi>. I am out of business, and live at Paradise-cottages, South Hackney,—on Tuesday, 8th March, at about half-past 3 in the afternoon, I was in Crab-tree-road—some lads came round me, and one or two of them tried to take my handkerchief from my pocket, but I felt it there—I was beset in a minute by eight or ten lads, who pushed me into the road, knocked my hat off, and some beset me by putting their heads into my sides, and attempting to get at my pockets—Barnes stood before me and took out what appeared to be a life-preserver, and struck me on the head as hard as he could with it—I bled very freely—I have no doubt of Barnes, and am also certain that Smith is one of the boys; he has a wooden leg—he dropped his hand from my pocket when I turned round—I felt it at my pocket.</p>

               <p>—I saw Barnes in Crab-tree-road that afternoon; he struck the gentleman on the back of his head with a stick, which bent in an oval from the blow, and the blood began to come directly—I am sure Barnes is the boy—there were other boys there, but they were not all on to him—they were close to him, but I can't say what they were doing.</p>

I am the wife of Adeodata da Silva Lima, residing at Richmond-road, Hackney—on 18th February, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I was at Hackney—I had a gold watch and chain—I wore the chain outside my shawl, and the watch was in the pocket of my dress in front—the prisoner came up to me and asked me the direction to Hack<lb/>ney-downs—I stopped and raised my hand to point in the direction that I thought the downs lay in—in doing so I raised my shawl, and as I put down my hand I touched something—I immediately grasped my chain, which fell loose, and I said to him, "You have taken my watch"—I don't think he made me any answer; he went off quickly—a well-dressed young man passed, and I said to him, "Stop that lad, he has taken my watch"—he did not attempt to do so, but looked at me and passed on—at the same moment a man apparently drunk staggered towards me from the street—I went on quickly after the prisoner—I met a man with a basket—I said to him, "That lad has taken my watch"—I pointed out the prisoner to the man—he was at that time running very quickly up the Darnley-road—the man went after him—he laid down his basket and I stood there—he went after him as quickly as he could—they went out of my sight in a few minutes—the prisoner turned the first corner to the light—a boy seemed to join in the chase—I could only see the three persons on the road; it is a lonely road—the prisoner was brought back to me and I identified him—I have not found my watch—the chain was not taken; that was perfect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker of 1, Copthall-chambers—on Monday, 7th March, about half-past 3, Manwarren came to my office—I did not know him before—he produced sixty-eight shares of the Berlin Water Works Company; he called them sixty-seven, but I counted them and found sixty-eight—he said that he came from Mr. Cleggett of Billiter-square, whom I knew by repute—I drew out this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which Manwarren signed—I told him it was very late in the day, and that these shares were very seldom bought in, and I had rather wait till the morning, as it would be rather hard on Mr. Cleggett—he said that his orders were to sell them at once and bring away the money—I went to the Stock Exchange, and then went to Mr. Cleggett, to inquire if it was right—I returned to my office, found Man wan-en there, and asked him for the shares in order to take the numbers of them—he gave them to mo and I sent for a policeman—just before the policeman came in, I said I did not believe Mr. Cleggett had sent him—he said that two persons outside instructed him to come into the office to sell them, and I should find them waiting outside—I called the policeman in, and he and I took Manwarren down stairs—he pointed to two persons at the bottom of the court and asked him if they were the persons he meant—he said he thought they were, but that he was near sighted—Walters was one of those persons and the witness Bennett the other—we walked towards them, and they went into a public-house—we were about twenty yards from them—I went in after them and found them standing in front of the bar, drinking, and apparently in deep conversation—I asked Bennett if he knew Manwarren—he said that he did not, he had never seen him—not knowing each other, the policeman did not like to take them all three, but Manwarren finding himself in custody said, "Those are the two men."</p>

Dent's warehouse—I told him that we were two detective officers, and he must consider himself in custody for stealing one dozen pair of gloves, the property of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I live at Hayle-street, Islington—on the morning of 25th March, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was passing through Little Turnstile, and a man came behind me and caught hold of my throat with both hands—I called out as loudly as I could—I had a bag of tooth and nail brushes, which I held very fast—I turned to look at the man, and he had got two women with him—they ran off down Little Turnstile—neither of the women did anything—I only saw their backs—I did not see him stopped—I fell against the house from fear and fright—the prisoner was brought back to me in about three minutes—I am certain he is the person.</p>

I was an inspector of the G division of police—on Saturday, the 26th March, in consequence of information, I went to No. 2, Smith's-court, Charles-street, Drury-lane, with Inspector Bryant and the other witnesses—the door of the house was open—we proceeded to the first-floor room—the door was fastened with a drop bolt on the inside—we broke it open with a sledge hammer—the three prisoners were in the room—the two men were sitting at a table at the back window—the female was standing between them—the men were engaged in rubbing counterfeit coin between their finger and thumb, what they call <hi rend="italic">slumming</hi> it, to give new coin a black appearance like old coin—the female immediately rushed towards the front window, which was behind me—the men stood up from the table, and Hayward rushed towards me—I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Charley,</hi> I have come to pay you another visit"—he said, "All right, all right, Jemmy! You have got me to <hi rend="italic">rights;</hi> I knew you would have me some day: I am better pleased by 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that you have got me, and not—," two others whom he named—I examined the table, and on it, and by it, I found twenty-two florins, three crowns, and twenty-nine shillings, all of which are counterfeit (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some were on the table and some on the floor—I found on the table this box, containing black composition in a wet state—it in used in a wet state—I found in Hayward's pocket one-and-sixpence, and I saw Johnson throw down three florins, which I believe were counterfeit.</p>

I live in Doby-court—on the night of 26th February the prisoner came to my house to see his wife—she had not been lodging with me, she was only stopping there—she came to assist me when my sister died—he and his wife began aggravating one another—she abused him frightfully about his clothes and his work—they went on in that way for some time—we got him away at last—he went out, and returned in about three quarters of an hour—they began at it worse than ever—his wife was the worst of the two to tell the truth; she was calling him all sorts of names, and abusing him frightfully as she sat on the side of the bed; she grasped me round, and held me—the prisoner took up the poker and was trying to make a blow at her, but he hit the bedstead two or three times, and took pieces out of it—he then hit her with the poker on the head, and she fell back—I loosened myself from her, and called Mr. and Mrs. Lati<lb/>mer from upstairs.</p>

I am a draper, and live at 88, Edgware-road—on 9th January I was the last up—I was up till half-past 1 o'clock in the morning—I came down about 7 o'clock in the morning—one of my assistants came down first, but he is gone to America—when I came down I found the skylight open and thrown right back, and on the floor 250 or 260 blocks on which ribbons are rolled—I lost ribbons, gloves, shawls, and money—the total value was about 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen about three-fourths of the property since—a person was tried here for it in February, and the property was produced, and identified as the property stolen that night, (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 408.)</p>

I am a cabman—in January last I was residing in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove—on the morning of 11th January I was crossing the rank and heard a call of "Cab!"—I went towards the York<lb/>shire Stingo, and not seeing any one, I was going to turn back; and just as I was going to turn two persons came out of Lisson-grove and got into my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner was one of them—the other was tried here, and I gave evidence on that occasion—I am sure the prisoner was one—he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my fare—they had two bundles with them, and I saw a bit of ribbon sticking out of the end of one of them—I drove them to the corner of Keppel-street, Holland-street, in Blackfriars-road—it was there the prisoner paid me; just under the lamp—they went in a house—I saw an old woman look out of a window, and they went in and took the bundles with them—where I first saw the prisoner was about 100 yards from Mr. Priest's premises—mine is a grey horse.</p>

I am in the prosecutors' employ—their business premises are at 47, Cannon-street, in the parish of St. Augustine, London; the premises run through from Cannon-street to Watling-street—we gene<lb/>rally close at 7 in the evening—there are about twenty people engaged on the premises—they leave by the Watling-street entrance, and after they have left, it is my duty to lock up the premises on the Cannon-street side; and I did so on 7th January—a gentleman named Rix, who is in the business, sleeps on the premises, and I laid the keys close to him—there is a staircase on the Cannon-street entrance which communicates with the warehouse, and there is a door at the foot of that staircase which had been out of use for some time, as something had happened to the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist in the management of Messrs. Vavaseur's business, and reside on the premises—I recollect Claydon giving me the keys of the doors in Cannon-street on 7th January, and I fastened the other doors in Cannon-street—I slept on the premises that night—on the following morning I came down at half-past 8 and found the bar of the door leading into Cannon-street let down, so as to enable a person to go out—the door was closed, but merely on the latch, and the door at the foot of the stairs, which had not been used for some time, was open—there was a great quantity of dust on the stairs, they not having been used, and in the dust were foot-marks, and also as if some one had been sitting on the stairs and spitting—the look of the door had been almost broken off and the screws were lying on the stairs—a person secreted on the stain would have access to all the premises by breaking another door open afterwards, and which was opened—the lock was picked—it was fastened the night before—that would admit a person into the warehouse where silk goods were kept—I missed a very large quantity of black silk handkerchiefs, worth nearly 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from that warehouse—they would weigh over two hundred-weight.</p>

I live at 47, Rushton-street, Hackney, and am town traveller to Parsons, Fletcher, and another, of Bread-street—I have known Sodo for years as a master weaver—I became acquainted with Toye in January last—about five or six years ago I was under the necessity of applying to the Insolvent Court on my own account, and Sodo was aware of that—I was acquainted with him at the time—on Sunday, 16th January he came to my house and brought Toye with him—he said that he had been looking for me for three or four hours, and had found me at last: he had come concerning his friend Toye, to know if I would give him any advice about his schedule—I had some conversation with him on that subject, and an appointment was made to meet them both at Mr. Callow's public-house in Abbey-street, Bethnal-green—I did so—I met them on, I think, the following Wednesday week—I do not know the date, but I think it was the 2d February, as each time I called, I put the date down on this piece of card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and put it in my pocket—I met them there several times on the subject of Toye's schedule—I gave him some advice, and saw him frequently—he told me he had been to a solicitor, and had concluded the business—on the same day, at Callow's, after the insolvent business had been disposed of, and in Sodo's presence, Toye said that he had got a great</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">was here read as follows:</hi>—I am one of the detective officers of the city of London police—I had an interview with the witness Renvoize in the beginning of February, and he gave me some information, which led to my watching Callow's beer-shop—on Sunday, 6th February, I saw the prisoners Toye and Sodo come out of that house between eight and nine o'clock in the evening with Renvoize—Renvoize held up a parcel he had, and they all walked away together, and I followed them as far as Rush ton-street, Hoxton—on the next day, by the direction of Mr. Vavasseur, I gave ton sovereigns to the witness Renvoize, and went that evening to Abbey-street with Webb and another officer, and thence to Toye's house, and between nine and ten o'clock I saw Toye, Sodo, and Ren<lb/>voize come out of Toye's house—they went along Bethnal-green-road together, and I left them; and the same night Renvoize met me at the Baker and Basket, and handed me a parcel containing twenty squares of silk, which I produce—I saw Renvoize go to Callow's house that night, and he afterwards came to me to the Baker and Basket, but brought nothing with him—the next night I followed Sodo and Renvoize up Abbey-street to Toye's house in Bethnal-green-road, and on leaving it Sodo and Ren<lb/>voize went towards Abbey-street—the next night (the 10th) Renvoize met me at the Baker and Basket, and handed to me six pieces, containing thirty-three squares of handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), some with the selvage cut off—the next day I gave Renvoize 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and in the evening he brought to me three other parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one packed up in a piece of newspaper, the others in brown paper—the three parcels contained nine pieces, or fifty-eight squares, of handkerchiefs—on Saturday, the 12th February, I went with Webb to Sodo's house, and found him there, and told him we were officers, and that from what we had seen, and from communications which, had been made to us, we had reason to believe that he had been dealing with a quantity of silk, the proceeds of a robbery at Messrs. Vavasseur and Taylor's, in Cannon-street—he said, "I know nothing at all about it: I have never had any silk in my possession at all, "and repeated his denial, and expressed wonder and anger at what we were doing—I searched his</p>

               <p>place, but found nothing relating to this charge—I searched him, and found in his pocket a ready reckoner, and between pages 84 and 85 I found this piece of paper, on which its written, "Squares 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 58 squares 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 46 yards 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I took him to the station-house, and then went to Toye's house and found him at home—I told him we were officers, and had reason to believe he had been dealing with some silk, the proceeds of a robbery in the city, from Vavasseur and Taylor's, silk manufacturers—he said, "I don't know anything about any silk," and said, "I have never had the ghost of an inch of silk in my possession: in fact, I don't deal in silk," and denied any knowledge whatever about the silk—we searched Toye's house, but did not find anything—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a book—I saw him give his wife three sovereigns, which I afterwards went and obtained—on the 15th of this month, in consequence of a communication I had received from Sodo, I went to Newgate and saw him—he said he had sent for me to say that he was so confused on Saturday last when I spoke to him about the silk, that he had not told the truth then, and wished to do so now; that what Renvoize said was true: that he had some silk, but it belonged to Toye: that Toye had requested him to find a buyer, and had promised him five per cent, commission upon all for which he introduced customers: that he had sold four squares to Mr. Macaire, a beer-shop keeper in Mape-street, for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he had gives the money to Toye, who had paid him for that sale and others at the rate of five per cent: that he had no knowledge that anything was wrong, or he should not have had anything to do with it—he said the memorandum in his book referred to the last deal with Renvoize: that the "58 squares" was the number of the squares he had sold to Renvoize. <hi rend="italic">Signed, M.

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but they are of our own manufacture—we are manufacturers serving retail shops, but not in very large parcels—I could see by the quantity in one parcel that these silks had not been disposed of—we have not sold any quantity—eight or ten people sell for us—there is nothing particular in the make of the silk—we always make the same kind—we had not at that time sold any parcels which would bear the description of these goods—I am speaking of the whole quantity—we manufacture them all the year round—we have looms at work which are constantly making them—I will under<lb/>take to say, that these are articles that we have not sold—I will swear that these parcels of fifty squares have not been sold at our establishment—I have not sold them to Toye or Sodo—of course, I cannot say that I have not sold them to anybody—I cannot tell from the appearance of the articles that they might not have been sold by me or some person in the esta<lb/>blishment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City—I, and an officer named Knight, were directed to watch Newberry's movements—he lives in James-street, Borough-road, and keeps some trucks—I know Richards; she lives in the same house—on 18th February, I saw Newberry in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, coming through a court or alley which runs from St. John-street to St. John's-lane—I saw him before he got into the alley—he was not carrying anything then; but when he came back, he had this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he went to Victoria-street and towards Blackfriars-bridge—I followed him: stopped him in Victoria-street; told him I was a policeman, and asked him where he got that parcel from—he said, that a gentleman gave it him—I asked him where he was going with it—he said, "To Regent-street"—I asked," What house?"—he said, that he did not know—Knight came up and asked him what the parcel contained—he said, he did not know—Knight tore the parcel, and saw that it was silk—Knight spoke to him, and took him to the station, but I did not hear all that was said—I took possession of the parcel—it contains several pieces of silk—Knight went with me in a cab to the station, and, in the course of the afternoon, I saw Richardson in St. John-street, with several other persons, nearly oppo<lb/>site</p>

When I first saw Richardson, on the 17th, she was in the Walworth-road with a man—he had nothing in his hand at that time, but afterwards I saw him with another man, I believe, who had this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I followed them from the Walworth-road—they took a cab just by St. George's Church, in the "Borough, and took the bundle in with them—I followed them in another cab to Finsbury-square, where they discharged the cab, and walked towards Hoxton—I followed them to Beaumont's house, Bridport-place, New North-road, and when they were within one hundred yards of it, the woman took the bundle, and they proceeded to Beaumont's shop, which is haberdashery and hosiery intermixed with silk—it is something like a <hi rend="italic">leaving</hi> shop; there are shelves, and goods packed up with tickets on them. The man went in at the shop door, and the female, Richardson, stopped at the private door, and it was opened from the inside, and she went in with the bundle—Knight, who I believe was nearest, followed her in, and I followed him, and found Beaumont behind the door—there is a parlour behind the shop, which you can get into from the private passage—I went in there, and found the woman, the man not in custody, and Beaumont's wife—Knight was also in the parlour when I got in—I found the bundle on the kitchen stairs, tied up as it is now in this shawl—it contains 181 silk handkerchiefs—Richardson called for some water—the man went down to fetch it—I went down stairs with him, and when I returned again, he was gone.</p>

Vavaseur's name was mentioned, and the charge was read over to her by the inspector on duty, who asked her who she got the goods from, and if she wished to give any explanation—she turned to me and said, "I cannot say anything more about it than what you know; you saw</p>

Vavasseur and Co., of Watling-street, and that there probably would, be other charges against him—he said, "You are very candid; I will go"—I saw Legg bring the bundle from the kitchen stairs, but did not see him pick it up, and cannot say who did—here are a hundred and eighty-one handkerchiefs in the second bundle.</p>

I live at 7, Haydon-square, and am a poulterer carrying on business in Leadenhall-market—on Sunday, 20th March, my birthday, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was returning from my place of busi<lb/>ness, and as I was in the Minories passing Messrs. Moses &amp; Sons, the great clothiers, on the opposite side I saw three men—I crossed over—they were on the Aldgate church side, just opposite Bachelor's the cheesemonger's—the moon was shining, and the gas was lighted—knowing that there had been a number of robberies in the neighbourhood, I buttoned up my coat, and quickened my pace—I gave them what you may call a grand trot, five miles an hour—I generally go down Haydon-street, which is the first street on the left—when I came to Swan-street I stood by the corner—I could not see the three men then—after I got about thirty yards down Swan-street I looked back to see if I could see anything of them and I did not—when I got about halfway down the street I felt myself tripped up like a stick—I found myself going up in the air, and down I came—I felt some men pressing upon my back before I was tripped up, and then I went up in the air and came down on the pavement on my rump, and then my head, and it sounded like an</p>

               <p>old, empty tea-chest—I felt a man throttling me, and one on my right breast, and another on my left, attempting to rifle my pockets—I had on my pilot coat, with the collar up to cover my cheeks—the prisoner took hold of me by the throat—they did not unbutton my coat, they attempted to do so, but I gave them the benefit of my "double fives"—the witness Mr. Walters came up from the other end of the street to my assist<lb/>ance, after I had had a struggle with them, he assisted me up—the other two men made off as soon as Mr. Walters had assisted me up—I told him that these men had attempted to garrotte and rob me—the prisoner moved off some distance—I and Mr. Walters followed him—a policeman came up from the other end of the street, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I am positive he is the man who seized me by the throat.</p>

I am a custom-house officer, and live at 27, St. Mary-at-hill—On Sunday morning, 20th March, a little before 1, I was going down Swan-street in the Minories, and saw the prosecutor and three men following him—I saw one man raise his arm in the act to strike, and the prosecutor fell on his back—I then saw his head between one of the men's knees—the prisoner had him by the right breast, and he was in the act of putting his left hand into the prosecutor's pocket—I sang out, "Hallo, what is your game?"—the prisoner said, "It is only a drunken man falling"—the other stepped back from the prisoner into the road, and ran away—the prisoner also ran away—I called "Police"—a policeman met him, and I saw him take him into custody—I never lost sight of him from the time of his leaving the prosecutor till he was taken—I am quite certain he is the man whose hand I saw at the prosecutor's pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Eltham, and am in the employ of Mr. Turner, a corn dealer, and coal merchant—on Thursday, 10th March, about half-past 5 o'clock in the evening, I was on my way home with a load, near Lee-green toll-gate—I noticed a van beyond the toll gate, by the roadside, loaded with sacks, which I supposed to be corn—it was pulled up by the roadside, and Jenner was lying on the hind-side of the ran asleep—I saw a light cart near the van, and saw Ballard in it, and Peters, who was driving the van, was hiding a sack down at the bottom of the cart with Ballard—after that I saw Hawkes come from the opposite side of the road—he got in the cart—at that time I passed them—I looked back, and saw the cart drawn away, and go to the toll-gate—Hawkes and Ballard were in the cart—I did not notice who was driving it—I saw the van again—it passed me after I passed them—after the van had passed I picked up an empty sack with Mr. Jones' name on it—when I got to Eltham-green I saw a policeman—the sack which I saw them hiding away in the pony cart was a full sack.</p>

On Thursday evening, 10th March, in consequence of information, I went to Tanner's-hill, Deptford—I saw the prisoner Dead man—he was coming out of a public-house—he rather hobbled—I asked him if he had some stables up the hill, beyond the George in the yard—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if all the property in those stables was his—he said, "Yes, bought and paid for"—the officer Crouch and another man were with me—I said, "Let us go and see"—we went, and when we had walked a little way I asked Deadman if the stables were locked, he said, "No"—we went and got a light, and went in the stable, and on the right-hand side, inside the door, there was a sack—I put my hand to it, and found it was beans—these are a sample of them—the sack was not tied—I pulled a few out in my hand, and I said to Deadman, who stood outside the doorway, "How long have you had these?"—he said, "Two days"—I asked him who he had them of—he stood a moment or two, and made no answer—I said, "Surely, if you have had them two days you know who you bought them of"—he made me no answer—I said, "Is it about two hours you have had them?"—he said, "It is about two hours, Ballard brought them up here on his back—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and I believe Salter was with him"—Crouch said, "I know who that is"—I began to look down the sack to see what name was on it, and Deadman said, "It is my sack, they shot them"—I took possession of the beans, and took him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I remember going to bed on 24th July—I do not recollect whether my husband went to bed at the same time—I went to sleep as soon as I got into bed—I do not remember anything after that for weeks afterwards—when I went to bed on this night I was quite sober—my husband was always very unkind to me; at times he has taken up a knife and threatened to stick it in my heart, with very bad expressions—he hit me on the head once with a poker, and I was attended by a surgeon; that was about four years before this—since that time his treatment has been very bad, throwing anything at me—at one time a tea<lb/>kettle; at another time a pot full of boiling water, which went all over my head and shoulders—at times he has used his fists, and given me such blows on the chest, arms, and legs, that they have been black and blue—I work out as a pipe-trimmer—on the Wednesday previous to this we went from the Kent-road to the Thames Tunnel, and I was passing a joke with him respecting an old neighbour that we met, and he up with his fist and gave me a tremendous blow on the nose, by which I lost a very great deal of blood—at that time he made use of very bad expressions, and he said he should not mind going in at eight and coming out at nine for such a woman as I was.</p>

               <p>for years of ill-using you; did he ever ill-use you except when he was in liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was seldom or ever sober, he was always tipsy; I have known him for three weeks at a time excessively tipsy, from as early as five in the morning—it was when he was tipsy that he ill-used me—I have known him to be taken home with his head cut and bleeding once at my house—I have never been with him in the street when he has fallen down and cut his head—I have known his head to be dressed once at home by a gentleman from Guy's Hospital—on the night of the Saturday on which this occurred, he came to the place where I work, and we came home quietly together; and on our way we made some marketing for the Sunday dinner—I had not seen him from early in the morning till he came to Bishopsgate-street to me in the evening, between eight and nine o'clock—we stopped up till twelve—during that time he was more sober than I had seen him for months, I might say—he has never jumped out of bed in the night, and told me that they were pursuing him—he never told me that he could not sleep because of the dreams he had; I swear that—he used to be very wakeful when sober—he has never started up out of his sleep when I have been in bed with him; I swear that—I have never told him, that his head was so bad that he was a fit subject for a lunatic asylum—I never remember his starting in his sleep—the hatchet was sometimes in the fender, sometimes in the cupboard—on the night that this affair took place, he wished me to name to my employer, Mr. Critchfield, though he was in work, whether he would give him employment—I knew that he was afraid ask, on account of his ill-treatment of me; but, at his request, I asked on the Saturday; and Mr. Critchfield said, "Mrs. Newman, you know I could give him work, but his ill-treatment to you is so very bad, and his discourse is so bad, that I would much rather get him employment"—I told him that, and he said, "Had I had work there, this b—job would not have taken place"—he said that next morning—I do not know that there was a bench in the shop where my husband worked; I never was there—I remember his being once brought home with his head cut—if he fell in the room, he generally hurt his head; but he was so in the habit of being guided by both me and the children, that we generally secured him from falling—I do not remember his falling and cutting his head when we lived in Elephant-lane—he was an excessive drinker when he was there, but I do not remember his falling there any more than any other time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as the prisoner—I remember the morning when this occurrence happened—I was with the prisoner and his wife on that night—they appeared very comfortable—we had a pint of beer together—he seemed sociable and comfortable—I believe he had kept steady at his work for a week previous to this—they wore quite comfortable when they went to bed, and I am quite positive he was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you come into the room on the Wednesday morning, between four and five? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I found the prisoner very much excited, and he wished me to go with him to have himself locked up—I declined doing so—I don't think he had been drinking during that week—I first knew him three weeks previous to this occurrence—I have seen a great many persons under the effect of liquor, and, bearing that in mind, I think the prisoner was something like it—he seemed very ill from the effects of drink during the week—on the Thursday night he came into my room very ill and very much excited—he stopped at my door, and spoke to me—I asked him to come in and speak to me—he said, he felt very queer—I said "Perhaps you want a little of what you had too much of last week"—he said, his head was very bad, and he felt very sick—I sent</p>

               <p>my wife for a pint-and-a-half of beer, for him to have some—while she was gone, he went into the yard and retched very much, I believe—on the Satur<lb/>day night, me and my wife, and the prisoner and his wife, were together all in my room; we were all very comfortable—there was no quarrelling between the prisoner and his wife—when we were in the public-house having a pint of beer, he said, I was the most sociable neighbour he had had for some years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house-surgeons at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on 25th July—I found several scalp wounds on the front part of the left side of the head; and there was a very extensive fracture corresponding with the scalp wounds—she was in an unconscious state, and remained so, or in a semi-conscious state for more than a fortnight—during that time three or four portions of bone were removed from the skull—she remained several months in the hospital—she has but recently left there—she will probably always feel the effects of the injury under any extra excitement—an instrument such as this hatchet would produce such wounds and such a fracture—I should say the back part of it was more likely to produce the injury than the blade.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear as if there had been more blows than one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did—I perceived signs of three blows—I am not sure whether more than one blow had fractured the skull—one blow was much more important than the others; but whether one of the other two was also sufficient to produce a fracture I cannot say—a largish portion of the skull was broken, as much as would occupy several square inches—it came out in different portions—it was not removed by trephining—it came out partly by itself, and partly by the assistance of instruments called elevators—the fracture was so severe that nature forced it out—part of the bone came out independent of the elevators, and other portions not so freely separated from the sound bone, were removed by the aid of the elevators.</p>
