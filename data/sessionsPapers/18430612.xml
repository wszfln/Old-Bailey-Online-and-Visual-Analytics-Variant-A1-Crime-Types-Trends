On the 24th of May, about four o'clock, the prisoner came into Mr. King's shop, with another man—they were both talking as they came in—the prisoner asked to look at some black kerseymere for trowsers—the young man went up stairs, brought some pieces down, which they did not approve of, and asked to look at more—during the young man's second absence the prisoner came to me, and took my attention by looking at some washing satins, while the other man walked round the shop—a box of velvet was thrown down—I went to pick it up, and while doing so the other man went out—we then missed two pieces of velvet from the back of the shop—I was talking to the prisoner by the side, just by the door.</p>

On the 19th of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, he came to me at Ludgate-hill, with a message from my sister—I was serving some customers, soon after, and he went into the back shop, where I had a cash-box on the desk with sixteen sovereigns in it—I had been to the box five minutes before, in the prisoner's presence—I turned the key, and, as I thought, locked the box, but I had not—the sovereigns were there then—I left him in the shop with the box—I returned to the back shop to write a note to my sister—I took the box up to put it into the desk, and the lid came open—I immediately counted the money, and missed five sovereigns—the prisoner was then in the front shop—I asked a person, in his presence, if I had paid any money away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the school of the West London Union, for the education of the children of the poor—the school-house is in Meeting-house-lane, Edmonton—the house and property are in my charge—I reside there—the servants there are paupers, receiving parish relief, and doing the work for that relief—they are entirely under my control—I have the entire management of the house—on the night of the 31st of May, I saw all the premises fastened up at eleven o'clock, every part of them, and between two and three o'clock in the morning I was alarmed by the house-dog bark<lb/>ing—I went down stairs about half-past two, listened tome minutes, heard nothing, and finding things as I had left them, went up again—I was alarmed again in about half an hour, by the dog barking—I went down, and heard a rustling noise in the house—I went up, dressed myself, came down, and found the scullery-door open, which had been fastened the night before—I proceeded to examine the window, and found three wooden bars were removed from the pantry-window, which window is outside, in the yard—the yard is between the house and the road—there is a store-room at the back of the house, quite distinct from the pantry—it appeared to me that an iron bar had been forced out of its place at the store-room window—the store-room and pantry are all under the same roof—the scullery it between them—an entry appeared to have been effected into the store-room, by removing on iron bar from the out-side—a person could not get from the store-room to the pantry, as the store-room was locked—I found foot-marks of mud in the store-room, but nothing gone from there—that window is at the back of the house, but the pantry window at the side—I missed from the pantry a loaf of bread, the remains of a loin of lamb, and some butter—that is the property of the guardians of the West London Union—a person could get into the pantry, by breaking the wooden bars down—I afterwards found the prisoners together in a water-closed by the store-room window outside the building—I saw some crumbs of bread on the seat of the privy, and some small pieces of fat, similar to mutton fat—some butter rolled in a handkerchief, and part of a rushlight—it appeared somebody had been eat<lb/>ing, and dropped the crumbs on the seat—I believe the butter had come form the pantry, as about that quantity was missing—I weigh it out for the inmates—we had rushlights of a similar description in the pantry—I collared the pri<lb/>soners, and said, "You vagabonds, what business have you here?" they said they came for a night's lodging—I said, "Who broke down the bars of the pantry-window?"—they said, "Some of your boys might have done it; "but all our boys were up in bed, and it was not done when I went to bed at night—I held them till I gave them in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintending president of the Twopenny Post-office. The prisoner was employed as an assistant letter-carrier in the En<lb/>field district—in consequence of something I heard on the 8th of June, I marked a sovereign, and enclosed it in a sheet of paper, sealed it, and directed my clerk to address it to Mr. Thomas Nicholson, George-street, Manchester, and saw him direct it—I delivered the letter that same day to Peek, the officer, and desired him to proceed to Ponder's-end next day and post the letter there, and to meet me at Enfield post-office a little before one o'clock on the 9th—I got to Enfield about a quarter to one on the 9th—it was the prisoner's duty to collect the letters at Ponder's-end, and he was provided with a pouch to put them in, and to take them to the post-office at Enfield, to be made up for the London bag—he collected at Ponder's-end about a quarter-past twelve—I waited at Enfield till the bag was brought out of the post-office, and delivered to the rider to put into his saddle-bag to bring to London—I pro<lb/>ceded immediately to the post-office at Enfield—Peek was also there—I got the bag from the rider—the prisoner was standing at the side of the horse—I took the bag into the sorting-office, cut it open and looked for this letter—I could not find it, and I said to the prisoner, "A letter is missing, are all the letters here that you have brought from the receiving houses?"—he said, "Yes"—I looked over the letters again, and said, "A letter is certainly missing, have you got any about you?"—he said, "No"—I then asked him if he had any objection to be searched—he hesitatingly said, "No"—I directed Peek to search him—when he was in the act of doing so, the prisoner got out of the chair where he was sitting, and said, "It is no use denying it," put his hand into his left-hand trowsers pocket, and pulled out the letter, crumpled up—it was the letter I had previously given Peek—this is it, it has not been opened yet—(<hi rend="italic">The witness here opened it</hi>)—it contains the same sovereign as I put in—the prisoner said, "I beg your pardon, I hope you will forgive me!"—he fell down in the chair, and laid his head across the back of it—I then gave him into custody.</p>

I am the wife of James Curtis, and occupy a parlour in the house of Alexander Ross, No. 13, Little Albany-street, Regent's Park, in the parish of St. Pancras—Ross lives in the house. Last Friday night I went to bed about a quarter to ten o'clock—I did not fasten the door—my ton came home after I was gone to bed—in the course of the night I heard a noise in the house—I did not get up then, but went to sleep again—I got up about a quarter before four in the morning, went into the passage, found the back door wide open, and the things stated gone—some had been on the line in the passage, and some in the yard behind the house—they were wet—the back door had been opened from within—it had been bolted.</p>

Last Saturday morning, a little after two o'clock—I was on duty in Munster-street, Regent's Park, about 130 yards from the prosecutor's house—I saw the two prisoners turn out of Little Albany-street, in a direction leading from the prosecutor's house—they took the middle of the road, leading into Munster-street, side by side, apparently in company—as they came towards me they parted—Sweet went towards the New Road, and Saunders towards Bruton-street—on her pawing me I observed she had a bundle—I called to know what she had—she made no answer, but appeared to hurry on—I stepped after her, and said I must see what she had got—she said she would see me b----d first—I then took hold of her arm, and said I must see what she had—she immediately threw the bundle into the road—a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, who was passing at the time, picked it up, and put it under my arm—I was about conveying her to the station, when one of my comrades came up, and said there was a man with her—I said, "Yes, there he goes along the street, go and fetch him back again"—he was still in sight in Osnaburgh-street, which is in a line with Munster-street—another constable went in pur<lb/>suit of him, while I took the female to the station—in going along I asked where she got the things—she said the man had given them to her—I asked what man—she said the man that the policeman had gone after—on getting to the station the prisoners denied all knowledge of each other—the bundle con<lb/>tained the articles stated, which were wet—in the morning, as I was coming along Munster-street, I saw a brother constable pick up this latch-key, in the very spot where the bundle had been thrown—he handed it to me—I after<lb/>wards tried it to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 11th of May I was at work on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cambridge</hi> steamer on the river Thames, off Alderman's stairs, on the Middlesex side, near St. Katherine's Dock—she had brought passengers and a cargo from Cork—the deceased was one of the labooren employed at work on board, discharging the cargo—near seven o'clock, after we had finished, the waterman who was employed by the Company, was not in attendance to put us ashore—the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, another steam-packet, was lying alongside—we crossed over the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi> to get inside, that we might get the chance of getting into a boat to go ashore—we got on to a deck barge that was moored alongside the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, when we perceived Buckley, one of the men who was at work with us, had got ashore in a boat—we hallooed out to him to bring off the boat to us, that we might get ashore also—Buckley brought off the boat to us, and we got into her—there was then about twelve of us together, and a boy—Lynn, the shipwright,</p>

               <p>who had charge of the boat, objected to our getting into the boat—one of the men told him what a long time we were there, that we had not had dinner, that as our boat was not there, we had no other way of getting ashore, and then he allowed us to get into the boat—it was a good-sized boat, what is called a ship's boat—after we had got into the boat I saw the prisoner come to the fore gangway of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, and call out to Davis, one of the men who was standing in the stern of the boat, to come out of the boat—I did not hear Davis make any reply—the prisoner then jumped down out of the fore gangway on to the deck barge, and said, "You b----s, I will show you the way [or the road] ashore"—he immediately leapt off the barge in among us, and the boat was upset—the force with which he came into the boat sank it, we were all precipitated into the water—I and some of the others swam ashore, others were picked up by the watermen, and Matthew Holland and John Buckley were drowned—I afterwards saw the body of Holland, when it was taken out of the river—I knew the prisoner before—he was acting as second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall.</hi>

The prisoner has been in the habit of making purchases for ready money as a tailor—I did not know his address—we do not take the addresses of persons who buy for ready money—on the afternoon of the 8th of May he came to our shop with this bank post bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wished to know if we could take it of him—I looked at it, and found it was drawn to the order of William Pennell, Esq., and specially indorsed by him in favour of John Croker Pennell—I said, "This bill, in its present state, is useless to anybody; it will be necessary for John Croker Pennell to put his name on the back of it before it can be taken"—he said, "Very well, I will get Mr. Pennell to do so"—he went away—he came at four o'clock next afternoon, and brought the same bill with him—he spoke to Dickens, the foreman—shortly after, this bill was sent to me by the cashier-it then bore the indorsement of John Croker Pennell, as it appears now—at that time I had no knowledge of this instrument having been lost—I did not receive any intimation till the Saturday after it was due—I then saw an ad<lb/>vertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, stating that this bill had been lost—it was paid by us into Smith and Payne's, and returned to us the same day—in con<lb/>sequence of what I found on the note, "Coles, 21, Great Smith-street," I went to that address on the Saturday afternoon—I could not find the prisoner there—I saw the person who I believe keeps the house—she said he had never lived there—I have not seen the woman here—in consequence of further in<lb/>formation, on Wednesday, the 17th of May, I accompanied the police-sergeant Weston to the Warwick Arms, at the corner of Gillingham-street, Pimlico—I went with the constable into the parlour—I saw several people there, and, among others, a person I believed at first sight to be Coles; but at the time I went into the room he was sitting with his back to me—he put his hand over his face, and remained so for a quarter of an hour—I could not catch sight of his face, and was not positive of him—alter that he put both his hands over his face, and remained so equally long—from a conversation going on in the room he was caused to laugh, and in doing so he raised his face from his hands, and immediately he did that I recognized him—I told the officer that was him—Weston left the room and went into the passage of the house—im<lb/>mediately he left the room the prisoner got up from the table, and appeared to be doing the same—I immediately rose up, opened the door, and got out before him—when in the passage I said, "Mr. Coles"—he made no answer—I said, "Your name is Mr. Coles"—he said, "No, it is not," and he pushed by into the street—it was raining very fast at the time—he appeared as though he wished to make off—I told the officer he was the man—he said, "Are you positive it is him?"—I said, "I am"—he said to him, "We want you respecting a bill you passed to Messrs. Bull and Wilson for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with a forged indorsement"—he said, "I know nothing about the bill"—I said, "It is no use saying you know nothing about it, because I am the person to whom you spoke at the time"—he immediately said with a great deal of surprise, "Oh, are you the person?"—I said, "Oh, then, you do know something about the bil"—the policeman said, "Well, then, it has a forged indorsement of John Croker Pennell attached to it"—he said, "I know nothing about it; I saw Mr. Pennell put his name on the back of it."</p>

On the 31st of May, Leathart brought the prisoner to the door, saying he had been in at the bottom of the house, and took something from the bottom of the house, he did not know what—his hand was in his pocket—he brought him into the house, desired him to take it out, and when he took it out of his pocket, I saw it was my watch—the prisoner gave it into my hands, and said, "Oh, pray forgive me, for my father's and mother's sake"—it had been in the pantry, to which he could get by coming down the urea, and entering the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Fir-lane, Edmonton. On the 28th of May I left my house about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon-I locked and bolted the doors, and left every thing safe—I returned about eight o'clock or five minutes after—I found my shop door still locked—I opened it, came in, and had occasion to go at once to the wash house—I found the door still locked, but the key which I had left outside was inside—I felt alarmed, and made my way as quick as I could through the room adjoining my shop—I trod on a large nail, which I picked up, and which I am sure was not time when I went out—I proceeded to the stable, which adjoins the house, and found a door wide open which I had left bolted—a wall ten or eleven feet high separates the stable from the washhouse, at the top of which is a wooden partition, thirteen or fourteen feet high—a hole was broken in the partition, which would enable a person to get into the coal-house, and into the house—the broken boards were lying on the coals—the lock of the door which opens from the washhouse into the shop was forced back—I missed from the shop about sixty halfpence, six penny pieces, and some farthings—part of the halfpence were in the till, and part wrapped in paper, on the shelf be<lb/>hind a thread and cotton-box, out of which I had paid the prisoner 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the Saturday night, and replaced it there again while he staid in the shop—he worked for me—it was concealed by the box—no one would have thought of looking there—the prisoner had been three times in my service—he looked after the horse and went on errands—I picked up a knife near the washhouse-door, which the prisoner used in cleaning the shoes with, and which was kept in a dark shed behind some blacking bottles—no one used that knife but him and me—the nail that I picked up had been taken out of a tool<lb/>box, and to get at that he had to move two baskets of wood, which stood on a tub of sand, and no stranger would have thought of doing that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Star-court. On the 1st of June between eleven and one o'clock in the night, I was in Plumber-street, St. Giles, taking a walk after my work—the prisoner Brennan came up to me, complained of being very badly off, said she had no candles or firing, and would I give her a halfpenny to buy a candle with—I gave her one—she did not leave me—presently Thacker came up with a key in her hand—she said she was her sister—she complained of being very badly off, and asked if I would come borne with them—I said I had no objection, and we went home—we did not stop long in the house, for I said we would take a walk out, and I would treat them with something to eat and drink—we went to the public-house at the corner of Plumber-street, had three pints of porter and a quar<lb/>tern of gin—we returned home in a short time with a pot of porter—some<lb/>thing took place between us—they then demanded some money—I gave them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then wished to go home—they said I should not go out of the house without I gave them more money—(I had three sovereigns, half-a-crown, two shillings, and some coppers in my possession when I returned to the house)—I said I thought I had given them enough, and wanted to go home—they began ill-using me, and pulled me about—Thacker told Brennan to bold me tight—she then went into an adjoining room, and brought in a man about five feet six high—he had a cloth in one hand and a weapon in the other—Brennan got me into the corner—the candle was blown out, and the man came towards me—he put the cloth up to my mouth, and the weapon be<lb/>fore my face—one girl held me very tight, while the other picked my pocket of two pence and a sixpence—the cloth stopped my breath—I got the wea<lb/>pon away from my mouth as well as I could, and in doing so cut three fingers—I made an alarm as well as I could, and made a little escape from the corner I was in—they tore my coat in my getting away—I seized a quart pot, and perhaps hit the man—he gave way a little—I went into the adjoining room—the girls pulled my coat-skirt off—I received a kick and a blow on my shoul<lb/>ders, which I have not recovered, and a blow on the left side of my face—I held the door as well as I could, the girls pulling me back—I was almost exhausted—when I got to the stair-case I got hold of the landing—it was on the second pair—the girls still kept hold of me, till I saw the policeman</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Isaac Brown, of Portman-house, Globe-road, Mile-end; he has a counting-house in his garden, there is a wall round the garden, nobody sleeps in the counting-house. On the 18th of January I left it safe, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I double-locked the door, bolted the shutters, and brought the key away—I went to the counting-house next morning, and found the shutters broken open—the desk was open, which was not locked the night before, but was shut—the front of the desk was broken out—I had left in it four razors, inlaid with silver, two reading-glasses, two clasp-knives, a shaving-box, and the other articles named—they were all gone—also two half-sovereigns—I went to the bottom of the garden, and found footmarks on the top of the wall, inside, as if they got in that way—I have known the prisoner three years—he lives in one of master's houses about 150 yards from master's—I saw him about four o'clock that afternoon, close to master's premises—I looked for him after this happened, but did not find him till the 28th of April, when he was appre<lb/>hended—there was a brace of pistols in the coach-house in the garden, about fifty yards from the counting-house—there was a bag under a sofa, in the coach-house, with two half-sovereigns in it, and that was gone—the prisoner's father had been employed by master in the house and about the garden.</p>

I am fourteen years old—my father is a tailor, and lives in Globe-terrace, Mile-end, not far from Bird's—I have known the prisoner and Rossiter about six months—I was in the habit of playing with Rossiter—on Wednesday evening, the 18th of January, my mother gave me a coat to take to Mr. Butler's, in Seething-lane—my father-in-law had al<lb/>tered it for him—I did not take it—I fell in with Rossiter, and had some con<lb/>versation with him—the prisoner afterwards came to us—we were all three</p>

I am fourteen years old, and live with my father, in Globe-lane. I have known the prisoner some time—I met Portman play<lb/>ing in a field there, and had some conversation with him about a coat, and soon after the prisoner came, Portman said he had a coat, and was going to take it home—it was mentioned in the prisoner's hearing, that it was at Bell's—we all three went to Bell's—the prisoner took the coat into the pawnbroker's—we waited a little way off—he came out with the ticket and money—Portman shared the money among us—I and the prisoner got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—Portman had the rest, and the ticket—the prisoner then said he would go and break into Mr. Bird's counting-house, and get the money to get the coat back again—he said he knew there were bags of gold and silver there—we all went to a show which was over at half-past ten—we walked about White<lb/>chapel and different places, and stopped in a coffee-shop till one, and went to Bird's counting-house between one and two—Portman was coming with us, but when we got there, a policeman saw him, and he walked off—the pri<lb/>soner and I got over the fence—it is partly wall and partly fence—we tried the counting-house shutters, but could not get in there, and then got into the brew-house—we did not get into the coach-house—he said, "Let us come to the counting-house first," and we did—he afterwards said, "Let us go to the house," and said there were two pistols there, but we did not go there—the prisoner brought two nails out of the brewhouse, and forced the counting-house window open—we did not get the pistols—he got into the counting-house first, and found the lucifers, and struck a light—he said his father worked there, and he knew all about the place—we found two half-sovereigns</p>

                  </hi>. I was under-butler to the late Lord Fitzgerald, who lived in Belgrave-square, in the parish of St. George's Hanover-square; his lordship died in the early part of Thursday morning, 11th May—Howse was his lordship's house-steward. On Friday evening, the day after his lord<lb/>ship's death, I remember seeing a tall man, who I did not know, in company with Howse in the butler's pantry, where a portion of Lord Fitzgerald's plate was kept, in consequence of some repairs that were going on; the chest that was stolen was in that room—I did not notice which way the man came in—I first saw him in the room—I did not notice which way the man came his back towards me—I was standing by the table in the pantry—he came in backwards—I saw no reason for that—there was nothing to account for his coming in so as not to show his face—I did not take that notice—on his coming in I left the pantry—Howse and he came in together—I returned to the pantry in about fice minutes, and found them still together—Howse said to the other man, "I think this pantry is larger than yours;" he said, "No, I think not"—he then took him into the plate-closet, and said, "You see we have had this done up for the old man, but it is no use now"—this was about half-past six in the evening—on the following day we were to be mea<lb/>sured for our mourning—no time was fixed for our being measured, that I know of—some directions were given to the men-servants by West, about being measured—I went up among the rest to be measured—just before I went up to be measured I went out for some beer—I went out by a door that leads into the area and up the steps into the street—that door has a spring-lock to it—when I went out I pulled that door to, so that the lock caught—there is an iron-gate at the top which was not kept locked, which opens into the street in the ordinary way—I think there is an iron-railling on this cross piece (<hi rend="italic">pointing out the position on a model of the premises</hi>)—I was gone about five minutes—I returned in the same way—I found the area-door fast as I had left it—I rang the bell, and smith the butler, and West the porter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184306120050"/>
               <p>opened the door—the door was again closed, I am sure of that—about three minutes afterwards I went up into the dining-room to be measured—I found all the men-servants there except Howse—as I was going up I saw Howse standing on the mat at the bottom of the stairs—he said, "Why don't you go up to get measured?" and I went—he stopped there—I had been about two minutes in the dining-room when I heard an alarm of the robbery of the plate—I went down stairs—I saw Howse at the bottom of the stairs where I had left him—he said, "Here is one of your boxes of plate gone"—I then ran to the pantry—Howse followed me—he told me the box was gone from where it stood—I was looking to see which box it was, and he said, "There, it stood there"—I said "Yes, and you know it, it was full of silver plate"—there were several other boxes of plate there—the box that was taken was No. 8, and I think there were 9, or 10—there was nothing outside the boxes to tell to a stranger which contained the silver plate—they did not all contain silver plate—this was a small chest, it stood on the top of another one—it was full of silver plates—I do not exactly know how many silver dinner-plates were in it—when I said to Howse, "Yes, and you know it, it was full of silver plate," I turned round and looked at him, and his hand shook and his lips trembled—he said "Humph!"—I then ran into the servants' hall and got my hat to go to look after the men—I do not know what Howse did—I left him in the pantry—I did not see him make any effort to go in suit—I had been in the pantry, I should say, three minutes before I went out for the beer—the chest was then safe—I had occasion to go to that plate chest a short time before this occurred, to take out the silver plate which was used in administering the sacrament to Lord Fitzgerald—I re<lb/>turned that plate into the chest on Friday morning—when I returned from fetching the beer I noticed a chaise-cart standing near the railing, and a man with it—I took no particular notice of it—it was standing on the side next the area that I went up, by the curb-stone, opposite the area-gate—I did not notice it when I went out—I am sure it was there when I returned—there were some repairs going on which had made it necessary to have the plate in the butler's pantry, instead of in the room where it was usually kept—I was there the chief part of the time superintending the repairs—I did not hear Howse give any direction with respect to the repairs—there was to have been an iron door put up, and about ten o'clock, on the morning of the robbery, I heard Howse say to Smith, "We will not have the door put up to-day, as my lord is lying dead, I do not think it proper"—the workmen had been at work on the Friday, but not on the Thursday—the effect of Howse's direc<lb/>tion would be to stop any workmen coming on that part of the premises on that day—no workmen came—Howse saw the men at work there on the Friday.</p>

               <p>look at his face—I think there were ten boxes of plate altogether—some of them contained gilt plates—I think there was one gold plate in the box that was stolen—all the chests were in the pantry—the one this stood upon was on the ground—this was the top one, and the smallest of the two—there was valuable plate in the one below it—I do not exactly know the chests Nos. 3 and 7—none of the other chests contained plate of greater value than the one that was taken—I should say it was the most valuable of the lot—it was more valuable than the larger one, which stood below it—when I entered the service the plate was all counted over to me—there is a door at the bottom of the area steps, and another door leading into the passage between the still-room and the steward's-room, and that passage leads into the main passage, which goes from the housekeeper's room to the kitchen, but there are no steps to that area—there is a sort of curve or scroll in the iron railing of the area, leaving a space through which a man might drop down into the area, and by that means get to the centre door—the area runs round the house—one part of it fronts Belgrave-square—it is a corner house—that centre door was always kept shut until that morning, and all that morning it was open—it was opened to go out to clean boots and shoes, and shut when we came in again—it is sometimes kept open on a fine day to admit air—that was often done of an afternoon—the area gate was kept locked at night, but not in the day—anybody could unlatch the area gate, and come down to ring the bell below—I have known Smith about eight or nine years—it was through him I was introduced to Lord Fitzgerald—no other servant was engaged while I was there—I do not of my own know<lb/>ledge know who was in the habit of engaging the servants—I was certainly much agitated at the time of the robbery—I was quite astonished and con<lb/>founded at this plate having been taken away in broad day light.</p>

About twelve o'clock on Saturday, the 13th of May, I received from Howse orders to send the servants up stairs to the dining-room, to be measured for their mourning—I was then down below in the passage near the servant's hall, at the bottom of the steps—about ten minutes after I received a second message—he said, "Why have you not sent the servants up into the dining-room?"—I said, I could not find them—I had not sent any one then—I went into the pantry to look for Thorpe, and then into the area, and looked in all the vaults, the three vaults that were open—the others were closed—I then saw him coming down the area steps with a pot of beer in his hand—I let him in—the door was fast before I let him in—no one could get in except they were let in by a person inside—Thorpe gave the beer to Smith—Smith opened the door—I told Smith at the time that they were all to go to the dining-room—I told Thorpe and Smith to go up to be measured—I went to the servant's hall, and then went up to the dining-room by myself, and they followed me—Howse was measured first, and he left the room directly afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I was butler to the late Lord Fitzgerald, and had been so about four months. The plate was usually kept in a closet for tie purpose, but, in consequence of some changes taking place, it was removed into the butler's pantry, about ten days or a fortnight before his lordship's death—on the Friday, the day after his lordship's death, Howse came into the pantry—I told him the men had come to work, which I thought was very improper-he said. "Why?"-I said, "Why, his lordship is lying dead in tne house, and I think it very improper for men to be at work, in the pantry, particularly, when such an event has taken place"—he said there had been an estimate made out for it, and it must be fulfilled—I said I thought it was very improper-however, the workmen went on—I told him I had also been to Mr. Cane, the executor, to tell him that I thought it improper the men should be at work at such a time—Howse said if Mr. Cane gate him one order and me another, he did not understand it-after this the men went on with their work that day—on the Saturday Howse told me that the men would not be there that day to put up the door, which was an iron door that was to have been put up to complete the closet—the box that was stolen contained fifty-four silver dinner plates, seventeen gilt dessert plates, two round official silver boxes, 1 think, I am certain there was one; twelve plated soup plates, and I think some others—I do not know, without I had the inventory, whether there was not some other plated dinner plates, I think there were, and a papier mache plate—I do not remember Howse making any observation about one of those boxes—the morning after his lordship's death, Howse remarked to me, in the pantry, that one of those boxes ought to be his, turning round to the plate chests that were behind us—I supposed him to mean, (I do not know why I should do so, certainly, but I supposed him to mean) a small box con-taining dessert things, which I had merely given into my charge, but had not signed my name for—when I entered the service I signed a receipt for the plate—that box was given into my custody at the time I signed the acknow<lb/>ledgment, but it was not in the list that I signed for—we were talking together about his lordship's death, and one thing and another—I brought some sherry down from the upper drawing-room—Howse helped himself to a glass, turned his head round, and said, "One of those, that small box, ought to be mine"—he said nothing further—I saw the plate-chest that was stolen safe in the pantry that Saturday morning—about twelve o'clock, or a little after, on that day, West gave me directions, as from Howse, to go into the dining-room—I went up directly-I found Howse and Woodbridge there, a man named Wright, a pic<lb/>ture-dealer,</p>

                  </hi>. I was housekeeper to Lord Fitzgerald, and should have been so fifteen months on the 21st of this month—I remember being in his lordship's bed-room on the Saturday morning after he died—I heard the call-bell ring about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve—it turned out that it was for me—I went down stairs to the dining-room—I then saw Howse, and found it was him that had sent for me—at that time he was being measured for his mourning—after he was measured, he told me I was to go up to the back drawing-room, to Mr. Cane, and speak to him about the fe<lb/>males mourning—he came out of the dining-room, and told me that—I left him, and went to the back drawing-room for that purpose—Howse went down the stairs, across the hall, down the kitchen stairs in a hurried way—when I had seen Mr. Cane I came down stairs immediately—I was a very short time with him—I had got about half-way down the kitchen stairs when I saw Howse at the top of the three stairs, going towards his room along the passage—I went before him towards his room—I said, "Now, Mr. Howse, I will speak to you"—I had frequently been in the habit of speaking to him in his own room before that time—when I got to his door, he said, "No, go, go," and put his hand in this way, in the direction of my room—that had the effect of pre<lb/>venting me from going into his room—I went to my own room—he followed me—I got into my own room, and commenced speaking to him about the mourning, and he said, "I must have a pen and ink"—I told him that was not necessary—he said, "Yes, I must"—I said, "Mr. Howse, you don't want it, for I will do justice to the utmost"—he went out of my room—he said he wanted the pen and ink to set down some things that I was going to tell him about the mourning—he said he must have a pen and ink—he opened the door about half-way, and pulled the door gently after him by his hand, not as any one else would do, catch it sharp after them—he kept the door in his hand till he got out, and pulled it to—I could have seen what was passing in the butler's pantry if the door had been opened—I do not think I could have seen him where I was sitting—if I had got up from my seat I could have seen into the passage—at the time he said he must have a pen and ink, there was a pen and ink in my room, which he had used occa<lb/>sionally, and even brought two or three persons in occasionally to use it in my room—after Howse had gone out of the room, and drew the door to, I heard footsteps of more than one person—it could not have been more than a quarter of a minute after—it appeared against the mat of my door, between the two doors, the mat of the pantry door and my door—the noise was a sort of a shuffling of feet—it is a stone pavement—it was a sort of shuffle which people make when carrying something heavy on a stone pavement—he returned to me I think in about half a minute after I heard the noise—he came in, shut the door, went to my table, and took the pen and ink off it, with his back towards me—he did not bring in any pen and ink for which he had left the room—his hand shook violently, and his face was very red—he looked excited—I was just commencing the conversation, and the cook, Mrs. Williams, came to the door—I heard her footsteps coming to the door—he made two strokes with his pen—he made a mark on two pieces of paper, which I understood him were bills, and that he had brought something wrong—I cannot exactly say what he said—when the cook came into the room she was going to say something—I said, "Now go, we are talking," and she</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say Howse made you no answer when you spoke to him about the loss of the plate; did not he say, "Have I not often told you not to leave the drawers open?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not to my recollection—I can swear that did not pass—the first time I was at Queen-square I did not name about the shuffling of the feet—I forgot it—I did remember it, but I omitted saying it—I did not remember it while I was giving my evidence, but I did before and after—it slipped my memory at that particular time—I had mentioned it before that to my fellow-servants—I think I mentioned it to Smith the but<lb/>ler—I am certain I did to the cook.</p>

On the Saturday on which this plate was stolen I was in the kitchen all the morning—I re<lb/>member Mary Hawkins coming there about twelve o'clock, or half-past, to put the potatoes on—she did so, and left the kitchen in a few minutes after<lb/>wards—when she came into the kitchen Mr. Bull was there—he remained there till after the alarm of this robbery was given—when she came in to put the potatoes on she went to stir the fire—I had some rice-milk to make, and I said, "Don't stir the fire, Mary, there is plenty of time to put on the pota<lb/>toes"—she said, "No, there is not, it is half-past twelve"—I said, "Half-past twelve! so late as that?" expressing some surprise—there is no clock in the kitchen, there is in the passage—I did not look in the passage—Mr. Bull made some observation—I followed Hawkins out of the kitchen—the was about two or three yards before me—she closed the door after her, and I opened it to go out into the passage directly after she went out—I went to look for Smith, as Mr. Bull wanted to go away—when I opened the kitchen door, the area door was shutting, and I saw a man's hand on the door, shut<lb/>ting it—he was outside the door—I heard a box or something knock against the door—I opened the door, looked into the area, and saw two men carrying a box up the area steps—when I first saw them they were going up the three steps that go up first of all into the area—they are close to the door; then you come to a straight piece before you come to the steps again—they were on those steps when I saw them—their backs were towards me, and part of their sides—they were carrying it between them—they proceeded with it along the area till they came to the steps—they then went up the steps—they turned when they got to the bend of the stairs, and I then saw Fuller's face—he was the first man—he went up the steps backwards—I had not known him before—I should think the other man was about five feet nine or ten inches high, a very fine looking man—I thought I had seen him in the house, although I</p>

               <p>did not see his face—the box was a square one, and had the appearance of a plate-chest—it appeared to be heavy, from the manner in which they carried it—Fuller is the man whose face I saw; and it struck me directly, when I saw the other man taking the box, that he was a friend of Mr. Howse—I thought it was the man who had come to see Howse the evening before—I shut the door when I saw the man's hand on the area door, and I went to tell Mrs. Parker I wondered what Mr. Howse had been sending out then, because something struck me it was wrong—I then went to Mrs. Parker's room—Mr. Howse was sitting there—Mrs. Parker said, "Now, just go, we are talking"—I left the room, went to the pantry door, and knocked at it—no one answered—I looked in, and then ran from there to the servants'-hall, knocked at the door, looked in there, saw no one, ran back to the housekeeper's room again, and said, "Mr. Howse, have you sent a box" or "a box of any sort away?"—he said, "No,"—(I did not stop in any of these places, I went as quick as I could)—I said, "Will you just go into the pantry and see?"—he did so, and said, "Yes, there is one gone"—I ran out into the area, went to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man that was stand<lb/>ing just opposite, and asked him something—I think I saw Howse standing by a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when I was making inquiries—a policeman came in a few minutes—I gave him a description of the persons I had seen take the box away—I said to Howse, "I think, Mr. Howse, I have seen that man, the tall, dark man come to see you"—he did not make any answer—I said nothing more to him at that time—afterwards I was with him in the housekeeper's room, and told him it was a very shocking thing—he said, "Yes, it is very shocking"—I said, "Mr. Howse, it looks like a planned thing"—he said it did—I said, "The men must have been in the house"—he said, "They must"—I said Mr. Wil<lb/>liam Russell's servant called out of the window and said she had seen a cart there for an hour—he said, "As for that I have seen two carts standing there all the morning"—Mr. Smith said, "Mr. Howse, if you had seen a cart there that looked suspicious, why was not you on the look out?"—he said he did not take notice of them—he grumbled something to himself, but I cannot say what his words were exactly.</p>

I am not in any business—I have been a gentleman's servant—I called at Lord Fitzgerald's house on the day in question, to see Smith, the butler—Howse came in while I was with him—I was about leaving the house, when Smith asked me to go and see his beer that he had been brewing for Lord Fitzgerald—I went with him through the kitchen to the cellar—Smith was then called to go up stairs—I remained in the kitchen with Mrs. Williams, the cook—I was sitting at the further side of the kitchen, opposite the door—Thorpe was sent out by Smith to fetch some beer—I remember his coming in and closing the door after him—I am certain he did so, for I heard the door shut to—soon after there was an alarm of the robbery having been committed—I had not moved out of the kitchen from the time Smith left, until the alarm was given—I heard them speaking about the robbery at the kitchen door, went out, and was told of it—from the time I heard the door close when Thorpe came in with the beer, until the alarm of the robbery was given, I never heard any one come in at this door, and I never heard the door open.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of May, in the forenoon, I saw a horse and cart standing below the area gate of Lord Fitzgerald's house, and a man with it—I believe I saw that cart standing there an hour—I then saw two persons come up the area steps of Lord Fitzgerald's house, with a plate chest—that was about half-past twelve—they put the chest into the hinder part of the cart—one man then secured up the cart, and the others went and got up into the cart—the other got up directly, and all three drove off very quick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the turnkeys on the debtors' side of Horsemonger-lane gaol. I had a person, named Dignum, in custody there, for debt, about four or five weeks ago—I remember Howse coming there to inquire for him—I opened the gate for him—I saw no gig—I am turnkey of the inner-gate—he went out after he had been in some time and returned a second time with some wine in a bottle—he staid somewhere about an hour, or an hour and a half—he came again to the best of my recollection, on the following day—he did not stay quite so long that time.</p>

About four or five weeks ago I remember a person coming to speak to Dignum in the gaol—I cannot say how long I saw them in conversation—I saw him talking to Dignum—I did not see him leave—when he first came, before he was admitted within the inclosure which confines the prisoners, Dignum said, "That is Mr. Howse"—to the best of my recollection, Howse is the person.</p>

I was concerned for the late Lord Fitzgerald in his life<lb/>time, and am one of his executors—I produce the probate of his will—I re<lb/>ceived a communication in writing from a person of the name of Dignum—I knew nothing of him until that time—in consequence of the contents of that communication, I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol to Mr. Dignum—I think the prisoners had then been fully committed for trial—it was on Friday, in the last week, that I went to Dignum—Lord Fitzgerald died on the 11th of May—the day before I prepared a codicil at his lordship's house, which he executed there—Howse was one of the witnesses to it, and Smith the butler, the other—I am not aware that any one knew of such an instrument having been executed, except myself, the persons before whom it was executed, and the family.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Mill-wall, Poplar. On Monday night, the 23rd of May, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the house where I live to ask for a light—I asked my mother for one to give him—he said, "Never mind the light, I want to speak to you for a minute or two"—he called me out, and asked me what I had hit him for the night before—I had not done so—it was my brother-in-law—I told him it was not my fault, and I supposed he wanted to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I asked him what made him come at that time at night—I saw his two hands in his pocket—he pulled his hands out of his pocket, and was going to hit me—I knocked his hands off, and hit him—he then hit me again on the side of my neck—then we hit one another, and I knocked him down—I did not see any<lb/>thing in his hand, but felt a knife go into my lip—it cut my mouth—I hal<lb/>looed out that he had cut me with a knife—I knocked him down, and took the knife away from him—he tried to get away, but I held him, and gave him up to the policeman—I cannot remember the first time I saw the knife in his hand—it was not before I fell on him—I gave the knife to the policeman.</p>

On the Sunday night, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came into the house, and kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—my brother-in-law turned him out—on Monday, the 23rd, they were keeping it up, and he came in about eleven, and stopped there till his mates were going home—he afterwards came back again to the door, and asked my brother for a light—my brother fetched one, and as he came to the door, he said he did not want the light, he wanted to speak to him outside the door a minute, and when he went out the pri<lb/>soner knocked him down—my brother had not said anything to him before that—my brother got up and hit him—they hit each other, and knocked one another down—I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, but could not tell what he took out—I did not see any more till my brother got up, all streaming with blood, and said, "Oh, you have stabbed me with a knife, have you?"—he took hold of the prisoner, and took the knife out of his hand—the policeman happened to come along, and he gave him the knife.</p>

On the 23rd, between twelve and one o'clock, I was on duty at Milwall, Poplar, and heard a cry of, "Murder" and "Police"—I went to Carter's-row, where the noise seemed to come from, and saw the prosecutor covered with blood—he said he had been stabbed, gave me this knife, showed me a wound on the side of his neck, and told me to take the prisoner into custody—the prisoner was standing among five or six others who surrounded him—I took him—he said he had his re<lb/>venge, and he hoped I should do all I could for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Circus-road, St. John's-wood. On Friday night, the 2nd of June, I was returning home from Bow—I got to White<lb/>chapel-road at near twelve o'clock, within ten minutes of twelve—I had drank something, but was sober—when I came into Whitechapel-road I met two females and a man walking together—I asked them where there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-stand—the two females caught hold of my arm, and said they would show me where there was a stand—I cannot recognize either of the female prisoners as the per<lb/>sons—I walked some little distance to discover a stand, and felt them pulling me by the arms—I was afterwards knocked down, and rendered senseless, in a certain measure—I was so stunned, I had no power left, and was robbed—I had, when I left Bow, five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and five sovereigns—the notes were pinned into my right waistcoat pocket—I am quite positive the notes and money were in my pocket when I left Bow, and after that I was not in con<lb/>tact with any person, or in any situation in which that money could be taken out—it was inside, and my coat was buttoned—I felt a person's hand in that waistcoat pocket twice distinctly, and at the same time I felt a tugging—that is the first thing I remember after I was knocked down, while I was on the ground, I had not strength to resist—the next thing I recollect was the police<lb/>man coming up—I was lifted off the ground—my hat was gone—I remember feeling it taken off, after the money was taken—I did not see who did it—I was quite stunned from the blow, and paralysed in a measure—I lost all my strength—I was knocked down not more than two or three minutes after seeing the females, in my estimation—I had a pocketbook and handkerchief in my hind coat pocket—they were also taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wentworth-street, and am on the town. On Friday night, the 2nd of June, I was at the Pavilion theatre, in Whitechapel-road, with Garland—we came out at twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoner Martin go up to a man and call him as he was standing at the door of the Gardener's public-house—she said to him, "Come along, make haste, here is a chance;" or some such words—he followed her—in about five minutes I saw Mr. Wood and the two female prisoners with him, one having hold of each arm—I knew Martin before—I am certain of her—Hill had on a lilac-coloured frock, a dark shawl, and a blue velvet bonnet with red ribbons—I saw a bonnet in the hands of Alderman, the constable, before the Magistrate—it was such a bonnet as she had on—I pointed Bannister out the morning after the robbery, to the constable, as the person who had been with Mr. Wood—she was dressed the same as the prisoner Hill.</p>

I went with White on the 2nd of June, to the Pavilion—I know Martin—when we came out I saw Martin run to a young man who stood at the Gardeners' public-house, and say, "Here, come, here is a chance;" or some such words—he followed her shortly after—I then saw five young men behind Mr. Wood, feeling the outside of his pockets with their hands—there were two women, one on each side Mr. Wood—I know them both by sight—I know Martin was one—I cannot say whether Hill was the other—she was the same height as Hill—I know Brown—he was among the men in the crowd, talking to the young man who was on the right-hand side of Mr. Wood—as soon as the women left Mr. Wood, two young men took his arms—Brown was at that time alongside those men—on the right-hand side—they walked Mr. Wood a little further, then he seemed as if he was knocked down—he was laid on the ground—the men immediately ran up Black Lion-yard—a few minutes after Martin ran up the same turning with a hat in her hand—Brown staid a few minutes, and then walked away—I was two or three yards before Mr. Wood when he was knocked down—I was behind him at first—I turned round on hearing the men run, and saw Mr. Wood on the ground—I did not see him knocked down—I believe Stacey is the man who was on his right hand—I saw that man put his hand down the right-hand of Mr. Wood's coat.</p>

Just as we got to Great Garden-street, there was a lot of them came behind us and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the gentleman down; <hi rend="italic">Carrotty Fred</hi>, was one, Andrew Murphy was another, and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Matthias, the prisoner, was another. They took hold of bis arms and unbuttoned his coat, and took out something; what it was I do not know, and they ran down Black Lion-yard: the gentleman was knocked down; I did pick up his hat; just as I got by the pump, some one took it out of my hands. I went as far as Whitechapel-church, and was going round home the back way: we met a good many chaps coming out of the Bell; I and Mary Ann Hill was telling the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> about the gentleman being knocked down, and the policeman came and took me; that is all. I saw <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Mat<lb/>thias take the money out of <hi rend="italic">Carrotty Fred's</hi> hand, and put it in his mouth; he said to somebody there, 'they are all counters' (sovereigns.)</p>
               <p>"The prisoner, Mary Ann Hill, on her examination, says—I saw the man knocked down; Andrew Murphy knocked him down against the shutter, and I saw <hi rend="italic">Carrolty Fred</hi> and two or three more run away; I was standing there when the tail policeman came up—there was a great mob round—I saw Char<lb/>lotte</p>

               <p>Martin taken, and I went and told lier sister in the morning—I Went with Mary Ann Martin to the Archers—I saw Andrew Murphy there—I did not see Matthias—I know nothing about the robbery."</p>
               <p>"The prisoner Matthias says—I am innocent of it."</p>
               <p>"The prisoner Brown says—I was coming down Whitechapel with a young man, John Bateman, and I saw the gentleman leaning against the shutters; Simmonds came up to him immediately; I heard the gentleman say, 'Where is my hat?' there was another policeman; they call him Irish <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi>, and he asked the gentleman if he had lost anything; there were only those two con<lb/>stables there; they got up to the gentleman before I did, and had hold of him. By the time I got up, a third constable came up, and he took the gen<lb/>tleman across the road, towards the station; that is all I saw. I went home with Bateman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Johnson, a shoemaker, and live in Alfred-terrace, in the parish of Stepney—it is his house—we slept in the front room, ground floor, the window of which has outside shutters—on the 15th of June my husband was up last—between two and three o'clock in the morning I was awoke by the sliding up of the window, and saw a man's arm inside the window, taking off a pair of cloth boots by the bottom pane—I called out, and he ran away—I directly awoke my husband, and shut the window and the shutters again—the shutters were opened, and the window was down at the top, and up at the bottom—the boots were gone—I am certain they were there the night before—the shutters were quite close when I went to bed, but not bolted—the window was closed, and the bottom sash was fastened—there are two fastenings, one in the middle, and one at the side—I cannot say whether the middle one was fastened, but the bottom one was—my husband got up, and dressed himself—as soon as he was dressed I heard persons passing by and talking—I directly ran to the door, and saw two young men walking near the corner, three doors from our house—it was quite light—the arm that was put into the window had on a light jacket, and one of the two persons I saw in the street had on a white jacket—he went round the corner—the other waited for him against the public-house door—the other then came back, and both went down the street together—I watched them till my husband put his boots and hat on, he went after them, and brought them back—I saw no other persons outside the door but them.</p>

I was awoke by my wife—I counted the boots, and missed three pairs off the top part of the window, where I had seen them about eleven o'clock the night before, when I went to bed—the shutters were then quite closed, but not bolted—the window was also shut, and fastened at one corner, so as to fasten one sash—when I awoke I found the top window <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down—it had been quite closed the night before—I went to the door after my wife, and saw the prisoners walking down Alfred-street together—just before I got up to them they separated—one went to the right—I came up to Harris, who was in the light jacket, and who crossed to the left hand side of the road, standing with his face towards the wall—when I came up to him, he said, "Halloo, master, what is this? here is two pair of boots"—I picked up a handkerchief at his feet, and found it contained two pairs of my boots—I said that he or his mate had got another pair, which he denied—Fisher came up, and I immediately took them back to the house—I said, if he would produce the other pair of boots, I would say no more about it—he would not, and I and two young men took them to the station—as we were</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners in charge, with the boots—as we were walking along, Harris said that they saw a bundle lying on one side; that the prosecutor was walking after them; that he turned round, and said, "Master, here is a pair of boots"—they gave their addresses at the station—I made inquiry there, but could not find any one that ever knew or saw them.</p>

On Friday evening, the 19th of Dec. last, the prisoner Hawkins came to my father's shop, in company of another person, and looked at some jewellery—they wished to see some more, which I had not at that time forthcoming, and they agreed to come next day—my brother Henry was present on that occasion—they came next day, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon—Hawkins was spokesman on the occa<lb/>sion—he asked to look at a tray of rings—there were diamond rings among them—he looked at some, and ordered some, but purchased none—he left a little ring with me, and said he wished a diamond put into it, but would speak</p>

               <p>about it on the Monday morning—soon after, they left suddenly—he said they were going to Richmond, and they would call on Monday morning and com<lb/>plete the order—he also said that he would bring a gentleman with him on the Monday who knew more about diamonds than he did—he took out his watch, and then hurried away—the ring he left with me is not worth more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the outside—between two and three hours after they were gone I missed from the tray four rings—I showed that tray to one other person after they left, before I missed the rings—it was a person whom I knew perfectly well—he certainly had the opportunity of taking them, but he is a highly re<lb/>pectable person, a Captain Blankley, of the Royal Navy—I showed them to no other person—neither Hawkins or his friend came on the Monday—I saw nothing more of him till he was taken into custody.</p>

On the 12th of March, last year, the prisoner came to my shop in company with another person, and asked to look at some gold watches—I showed him forty-two watches—he was about ten minutes looking at them—he afterwards selected one, and wished me to keep it going till the following Monday—it was not going at that time—I turned my back to go and get a key to wind it up, leaving the gold watches on the counter in front of the prisoner and his companion—I came with the key, wound up the watch, and he went away about half a minute after, and in half a minute I missed two gold watches, worth about twenty guineas—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody on the last charge.</p>

I was going home about half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 3rd of June, and met the prisoners Miller and Layton, who asked me to treat them with a drop of gin—I said I was not proud, I would treat them, or any other woman—I was then in Strutton-ground, about two minutes' walk from Union-court—I ted to pass Union-court</p>

               <p>great noise between twelve and one o'clock, as near as I can tell—it appeared to come from the back parlour, down stairs—I heard two women's voices and a man's—it was Miller and Layton's voices and the prosecutors—I heard him cry out, "You have robbed me"—she said, "Go and b----yourself, for I have not robbed you"—I then heard a great noise, as if shoving him about—I got out of bed, and opened my window—I heard the back parlour door being opened, and when I looked out, I saw Ronayne, Mat<lb/>thews, and three or four females standing against the street door—Miller came to the door with a candle in her hand, and said, "You b----fools, why don't you come in;" and they went in immediately—the candle enabled me to see the faces of the two men—I am sure it was Ronayne and Matthews—no one else went in—they went in at the passage door, which would lead to the back parlour—after they had gone in I heard a further noise in the back parlour—I heard one of the men say, "hit him with the b----<hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>"—it sounded like Matthews' voice—I had never had any conversation with Matthews, but I had heard him talking a great deal in the court before that time—imme<lb/>diately after I heard the expression, "hit him with the b----<hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>" I heard the prosecutor halloo out, "Oh, murder," and afterwards "police"—Ronayne came out immediately afterwards—I did not hear him say anything—I never saw him go in again—the prosecutor said he would go out directly he had his hat—I did not hear Ronayne say anything on that—Matthews took and shoved him out of the back parlour into the passage, and by the shove he fell on the stairs in the passage—I did not see that, but heard him—Matthews said to him, "Are you going out? if not, I will kick your b----breast-bone in"—I am sure it was Matthews said that—there was no other man in the place—there was nobody in the parlour with him besides Miller and Matthews when that was said—I am clear it was Matthews said that—my deposition was read over to me before the Magistrate—I am sure it was Matthews said it—after that I saw two or three females speaking to Ronayne, and Matthews spoke to Ronayne when he came out of the passage—when Ro<lb/>nayne came out, he remained at the step of the door outside—when I heard Matthews say "Go out, if not I will kick your b----breast-bone in,"I heard the man halloo out "murder," and "police," and I said to the females and Ronayne outside the door," For God's sake, are you going to murder the man, or what are you going to do?"—one of the females said, "Hold your tongue, Mrs. Penn, we are only going to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>"—I do not know who that woman was—she was a stranger—Matthews came out of the passage door directly after, and said, "Come along; that b----cow will spoil us; we had better go," and Matthews and Ronayne went away together towards Orchard-street—after that, Miller came to the door again with a candle in her hand, went over to Eldridge's door, and said, "Come and help get him out, for I cannot get him out, for I have hit the old b----three or four times with a candlestick"—I saw the prosecutor noon after—these three or four females went over to him at the door, and told him his hat was at the next door—he said, "If you will give me my hat I will go out"—one of them said, "Come, old cock, your hat is next door"—he came out, went to the next door, and they told him that was their <hi rend="italic">crib</hi>, and not to go there—he was turned back from there, and went to No. 13 again, and then Miller <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him, and by the shove he fell—he got up and ran into the next door passage—some girls fol<lb/>lowed him in; Eldridge was one—she had a poker in her hand—one of the females hallooed out "Oh," several times—the prosecutor hallooed out "Mur<lb/>der"—after he had been in the passage some time, I heard a man's voice say, "Hit him Louey," meaning Louisa Eldridge—it was a man's voice—I cannot say who it was—I could not see Eldridge then, but I saw her come out with the prosecutor and the other females, and at that time she had a poker in her</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 13, Union-court. I was in Orchard-street between two and three o'clock, on Monday morning, the 4th of May—when I got to my house I saw the prosecutor next door, crying, "Give me my hat, give me my hat"—I saw a female open the door, and he fell in on his face as he was leaning up against the door, pushing it—I did not see Eldridge come up the court, but, directly after the man tumbled into the house, she struck him with a poker as he was in the passage of No. 14—she site inside the house—she had come over from her own lodging on the oppo<lb/>site side, No. 7—I saw Miller push the prosecutor down, and kick him at Eldridge's door—I did not see Layton at all—I went for a policeman—they were coming down the court, and took the prosecutor away—he was bleeding very much—he was lying by Eldridge's door at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Captain Hawker, his Christian names are Henry Frederick. On the 19th of April, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a ring at the bell—I went to the door, and found several persons there—one of them told me what had happened</p>

               <p>about the clothes—I went into the orderly room, and found that the cloak, and coats were gone, and the window quite open as far as the Bath would go up—the wire blind was lying on the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How do you know Captain Hawker's names are Henry Frederick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard it called over on being sworn the last time we were here—Captain Hawker was with us when we went to give evidence, and Walter Creed with us, and all the witnesses—when they were making out the bill, I heard Captain Hawker's name inquired after, and Captain Haw<lb/>ker came in a few minutes afterwards—I had before heard that his name was Henry Frederick.</p>

I am a laundress—I work next door to Captain Haw<lb/>ker—on the 19th of April I was looking out of the laundry window, about twenty minutes after one o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing, with two other men, about the length of this Court from Captain Hawker's house, in front of it—I saw Price, who was one of them, go into the garden in front of the house—the prisoner and the other one walked by the garden gate—I cannot tell where Price went when he went in the garden; but he had no bundle when he went into the garden, and he had a bundle under his arm when he came out—Price came out twice, and gave something out of his pocket each time, and the third time he came out with the bundle on his arm, and gave it to the other one, who was then standing with the prisoner—the outside of the bundle was red—they then parted; Price went to the right, and the pri<lb/>soner and the other went to the left together—I ran out, and called "Stop thief"—Price then joined in the cry, and ran after his companions—he then joined the prisoner and the other, and they all ran together—when they got to the lunatic asylum on the green, the bundle was thrown oter the palings into the garden of the asylum—I followed the prisoner and hit companion, but lost sight of them—I received these keys from Howard.</p>

I am a servant—about ten o'clock in the evening of the 26th of May, I was in Pudding-lane—I met the prisoners—they asked me to treat them—I went to a public-house with them—we had something, which I paid for out of some silver which I had in my left-hand trowsers' pocket—I afterwards went with them down a dark lane or passage, close by the Monument—after I had been there three minutes Morden ran away—Madden was talking to me, and about two minutes after she left me, saying she would go and look for her friend—I missed my purse from my right-hand pocket, containing thirteen sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and two half-crowns—I went after Madden, and overtook her in King William-street—she topped—I said, "Where is your friend you were looking for?"—she said, "I don't know who she is, nor where she is, I never saw her before"—I said, "Just come across the street, there is something wrong"—she said, "I will"—I saw a policeman, and gave her in charge—I afterwards went with the policeman to Smithfield—I there saw another policeman, named Courtney, and we found Morden—I am sure she is the person—she was conveyed to the station—as we were going along I said, "How do you do? you are just the person I was looking for"—I nipped her hand, and she said, "Oh my thumb"—she had showed me her thumb when first I met her, and said she had had it bit—I said, "I forgot about your thumb"—I do not know whether it was the same thumb—she did not show me the thumb again—my purse was afterwards given to me—this is it—I was sober.</p>

I produce this property—I saw the prisoner coming along Yardley-street, Wilmington-square, with this copper in a bag—I followed him down to Bowling-gardens—I stopped him, and asked what he had got there—he said a copper, which he bought of a man in Roso<lb/>man-street, who was moving—he came in a contrary direction from Rosoman-street—I told him to come with me and point the man out who had sold it—to let go the string of the bag, dropped the copper and the three locks in it, and ran away—I pursued, crying, "Stop thief"—two butchers stopped him in Rosoman-street—I took him to the station, and found on him five skeleton keys, one of which opened the door of No. 18, Henry-street—the finger-plates were in his coat pocket—I compared the copper with the house in Henry-street, and it fitted exactly.</p>

I am single, and live in New-way, Westminster About one o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 22nd of May, I met the prisoner—he asked if I had a room of my own—I said, "Yes"—he asked me to take him home—I did—he asked me to fetch a pot of beer, and while I gone he took these things, and he was gone—these are my things—I am an unfortunate woman—he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a pot of beer, and I could not get it.</p>

At half-past one o'clock I stopped the prisoner in Great Chapel-street, about ten; minutes' walk from the prosecutrix's, with these things wrapped up in a gown, except a pair of sheets, which were wrapped round his body—he had no coat or hat on—the looking glass was in his pocket—I asked where he got them—he said he had a row with his wife, and took the blanket to go and lay down with a comrade—at the station he said, "I will tell you the truth; I have been home with a girl; I gave her the money to go for beer; she has <hi rend="italic">done</hi> me, and I thought I would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> her"—I found 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

The prisoner was in my service for a fortnight, the last week of which I re<lb/>peatedly missed money—between eight and nine o'clock on Saturday morning I counted a bag of silver for a customer, and put it into a drawer in my bed-room—the drawer was locked, and at ten I missed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from it—between eight and nine on Sunday night I had a sovereign safe in the same drawer, and I missed that between eight and nine on Monday morning—I then called</p>

The prisoner came as housemaid about a fortnight before the 21st of May—on the 22nd of May, I and the prisoner were called up by my master and mistress about some money that had been lost—my master asked us for the key of out boxes—I gave him my key, and the prisoner gave him a key, and said it was all she had got—my mistress afterwards searched her boxes and mine—a key of the shop was found in her box—my mistress searched the prisoner—I was present at the time, and she found two more keys in her bosom—my mistress took one key and unlocked the cash-drawer—she said to the prisoner, "I think this will unlock my drawer"—I afterwards went and searched her box again—the prisoner was present then—I found all the things on the floor as the prisoner had thrown them out—that was directly after the first search—we went back, and I saw my mistress pick up these two pieces of silk off the floor—she said they were pieces of her dress—the prisoner said nothing—my mistress said if the prisoner had got the sovereign, she had better give it up at once—she said she could not give what she had not got.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner's box was searched on two occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, my master was there on the first occasion—my box was searched after the prisoner's, and while it was being searched, the things out of the prisoner's box were lying about the room—I did not assist in taking the things out of the box—she took them out herself in presence of my master, and mistress, and me—I could see every thing that was taken out—my box was at one part of the room and the prisoner's at another—I took all the things out of my box while my mistress was standing by—nothing was found in the prisoner's box but the key—the silks and satin were not found in the box—when we had done searching both the boxes I went down stain to get the children's breakfast—the prisoner was up stairs—my mistress went down into the parlour, and my master was in the parlour too—the prisoner was left up stairs by herself for half an hour—when I went up again Mrs. Heb<lb/>ditch was up stairs, and the prisoner was there, and then we found the pieces of silk on the floor, wrapped up in a piece of silk belonging to the prisoner—I know it belonged to the prisoner, because it did not belong to my mistress—I had never seen her with it, nor seen it in the house before—I generally see what my mistress has got—I have the charge of the children's clothes and of my mistress's—I generally go to every drawer except the cash drawer, and I never remember seeing the piece that these were wrapped up in before—the prisoner was by when these pieces of silk were found—Iam not a judge of these articles—I should think this satin is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and this silk worth 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is not very uncommon in the texture—I do not know that females in my situation wear satin, they may wear satin scarfs.</p>

               <p>about the money, only the bits of silk"—there were three pieces of silk in the drawer—I found this bit of green silk matches with this piece—it is cut in a zigzag way—this bit of black satin corresponds with a piece that was in the drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Marquis of Granby, at Ratcliffe-cross. I have known the prisoner three or four months, by his coming to the house—about May I had some expectation of letting my house—the person was to take possession on the 8th of May—on the 24th of April I hired a room of the prisoner, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-week, in Caroline-place, Commercial-road—he told me he had been out of employ some time, and I told him to take my goods to the room at his leisure—after the 24th I removed two feather-beds, six boxes and hampers—in a hair trunk was a piece of New Orleans cloth, some gowns, and other apparel, some linen, and a pair of sugar-tongs—I have an investory of what it contained—the person did not take my house, and I determind to bring my things back—I told the prisoner I wanted these things—he said, "I will go and speak to my wife; the people in the house are religious people, and Sunday is not a fit day to get them back"—next morning, the 15th of May, I went myself, and found all the things gone, and the prisoner absconded—I could gain no intelligence of him—these boxes did not nearly occupy the room—I told him to make use of the room if it was of any service to him—he came and offered me a key—I said I did not want it—I received imformation, and found the prisoner's wife at Stratford-marsh, at her mother's—I went to No. 1, Alfred-street, Stepney, on the 19th of May—I went into the room with a policeman, and found nearly the whole of my property—I have got nearly the whole, except a bed, which had been pawned, and a few other things—on the 25th of May I found the prisoner nearly opposite the Thames Police-office—he told the officer he had pawned the bed—he did not say any<lb/>thing to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen her in company with the man that she described herself to have gone through this ceremony of the ring with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, but on one occasion, when I visited her at No. 17, Manor-street—before we were married a person came in and described himself to be her husband—but she met me the same evening and declared to me that the ceremony that was gone through was what I have described, and on the faith of that I kept com<lb/>pany with her—she declared that there had only been the ceremony of the ring and that had taken place at Henley-upon-Thames—she absconded from me the day week after our marriage—I had been living in the same house with her up to that time—I produce a certificate of the marriage—I have not examined it with the register—I was present when it was drawn in the vestry, and I have not the smallest doubt of its being faithfully copied—I am acquainted with the parish—it is the parish church where people go on Sundays—I have heard it called by the name of St. Mary Abbot's, Kensington.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High Holborn, and am a tobacconist; Hen<lb/>rietta Haywood lived with me for two months as servant of all work; the other prisoner is her father. On the 3rd of June she had the charge of my house—I went out, and came home about a quarter before seven o'clock—the door of my parlour, in my passage, was open—I had left it locked—I found the drawer open in which I kept my cash-box—I had left that drawer locked—I did not look into my cash-box at that time, but on going to the drawer some time afterwards, (after having gone out in the mean time)—I missed all the money from the cash-box except a fourpenny-piece—I had lost about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver—there were sovereigns, half-sove<lb/>reigns, half-crowns, and a great many fourpenny-pieces—I got an officer, and found Henrietta Haywood at her father's at Holloway—I saw her give the officer a reticule with a portion of the money in it, saying, "There is part of your property"—when we took her to the station we went back to her father's house, and there we found these ten cigars, three tobacco pipes, and the rest of the things that are mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>before seven o'clock, I found that my razor-case and seven razors had been taken from the dressing-table in the front room, on the second floor—a diamond pin was left on the dressing-table, I had seen it there the day before, and that was gone—I have seen the rasors in possession of the police, but not the case—I recognised the razors instantly—these are them—I have no hesitation in saying they are mine—I am quite sure they were in the house the day before—I use them every day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Armour, a cabinet-maker, we live in Old Cavendish-street—on Friday, the 21st of April, Vickers called at our house to look at some lodgings which she said she wanted for a family—she said a lady would arrive that evening, and the rest of the family on the Tues<lb/>day following, that she, herself, was the lady's maid—I showed her our apartments—it was then about three o'clock, and she went out in the afternoon and ordered goods, which were brought to the house by the trades people—she left at six o'clock, and said she was going to meet her mistress—she came back afterwards with another woman, whom I did not see till the next even<lb/>ing, and it turned out to be Manship—Vickers was up and down, or in attend<lb/>ance on what she called her mistress—on the Saturday evening the drawing room bell rang, and in the absence of Vickers, the maid, I answered it, and saw Manship in the room alone—she inquired for her maid, I told her she was absent, and I believed giving orders to trades people for the next day—I offered to send her any thing she wanted—she said she was alarmed about her maid being out so late in the evening, as she was perfectly unacquainted with London—(I think it was then about ten o'clock)—I said, if it would be any satisfaction to her to know that her maid was not alone, I had permitted my daughter to walk with her—on the following Tuesday Vickers left the kitchen about half-past three o'clock, saying she had to meet another part of the family, and about five o'clock that evening I found the prisoners were both gone—I missed a tea spoon, two India China plates, a water bottle, and a stopper for the ink stand—they were all my husband's, and were in the apartments let to the prisoners—they went up for their use when they required them—these are them.</p>

About a month ago to-morrow, I met him in Aldersgate-street, near where he lives—after say<lb/>ing, "How do you do," he stopped, and said, "I think I have something that will suit you, as you are in the woollen line; I have got some silk serge that you might sell, they are used by the tailors and drapers; those who buy cloth will buy them; you might sell them when you are selling your cloth"—I said they were out of my line, I did not deal in them generally, but perhaps I might sell, as I was passing round, when I was out on my own business, if he would give me some patterns—he said would I call and look at them—I said, "Yes, when I came back from the City, or on the follow<lb/>ing morning"—I then left him—I called at his shop the following morning, and he showed me four or five pieces of silk serge in the parlour—he said these were the things that he had mentioned to me the day before—I asked the price, and he told me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "If you like to cut me patterns I will take them with me, and see if I can sell them"—he cut me patterns from the end of each, and I took them with me—I asked him if they were cheap—he said, "Yes, very cheap"—I called at Messrs. Bardwells, and showed them the patterns—they would not give me the price I asked—I called on the prisoner as I came home in the evening—I told him I had shown them, but they were too high—then he said he would take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—he said they were very cheap—I said I did not know, but I thought by what they said, they were not cheap—I called at Messrs. Bardwells again, and they offered me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard for them—I went back to the prisoner and told him I might sell them if he would take 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was for two pieces only—he said if I would get him the money he would take that for the two pieces—I said, "I can give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for these two," which were the two that Bard well had offered me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—one was a black, and the other a brown—he said he would take that price if I could sell him the lot he had there—I said I did not know whether I could or not—he showed me four or five pieces—I said, "If you will let me have these two at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I will keep the patterns of the others which I have got, and endeavour to sell</p>

               <p>them"—he said he would let me have the two at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I was to endea<lb/>vour to sell the others—I gave him the money—I borrowed the money to pay for them, and then I took them to Bardwells and sold them to them—I called on the prisoner again, and gave him the patterns back of the other three, and said I could not sell them—he said, "Very likely if you look in in the morning I shall have two or three others of different colours"—I looked in on the following morning, and he had three or four pieces more—he said, "Here are some fresh ones, can you do anything with them?"—I said, "I don't know, but cut me patterns, I will try"—I said, "You have a good many of them"—he said, "No, they are not many, they are a few I have taken from a customer of mine, instead of money"—I called at Bard<lb/>wells, and said, "Here are some fresh ones"—I sold them two more at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they said they thought they were not so good—I paid the pri<lb/>soner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he wanted to know if I could not sell the others—I said, "I do not know, but if you let me keep the patterns, as I am about town, I will try and sell them"—he said, "I wish you could sell them, as I want the money for them, you will be down in the City to-morrow morning"—I said, "Very well"—on the following day but one I called and saw him—he then said he had two or three more—those I had the patterns of were gone—I said, "You have sold them?"—he said, "Yes, I believe they are gone"—I took out the patterns, and said, "They are of no use to me then"—he said he had another piece or two, and that was all—he said, "There is one here which is of a superior price to the others, I won't take less for this than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "It does feel stouter, give me a pattern of it, and I will try to sell it"—he said, "I wish you would try to sell the whole of them"—I said, "Give me a pattern of that that seems to be better"—I took the patterns, and sold one to Mr. Lowe for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had told Lovell before that the two last I had sold at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard less than the others, and I said, "Let me have that at the same price as the others"—he said, "Well, well, sell that, I don't think we shall be very nice about 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard," and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were two or three left—he said, "What do you say to these?"—I said, "I don't know, if I have the patterns, I will try to sell them"—I think they were different to what I had seen before—I had the patterns of one of them, and showed them to several persons—I could not sell them—I could not get above 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I called on Bartram again, and sold them another for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he said he had got four pieces more left—he said, "There are these left, they are all I have got"—I said, "I will see what I can do with the drab," and I took it directly to Bardwell, and showed it them—a man, who I did not know, came up to me, and said, "What have you got there?" and I told what it was.</p>

I can sell this"—that was the drab one—he said, "Come in here"—I walked into the parlour behind the shop, and then this conversation took place in the parlour about the drab—I told Mr. Bardwell they had been taken in exchange for goods, not that I had taken them—I said, at the time of the examination, that that was a mistake—I did not tell Mr. Lowe that I had taken them in exchange for goods—I said they had been taken in exchange for goods—I did not tell either Bardwell or Lowe that I had taken them in exchange for goods—I have been engaged in the cloth business forty-five years out of forty-eight—I was apprenticed in the trade—I worked in it when I was between three and four years old—I had a warehouse in Basinghall-street from 1818 till 1822—I gave it up because business was bad—I failed, and took the benefit of the Act in 1825, I think—I have done so twice, but it was for the same thing—there was something left out the first time I took it—there were some goods that were sent in, and were omitted to be put down, and thus, after six</p>

I keep a shop and sell Berlin wool, and am in the silk, woollen, and trimming trade—I sell fancy goods in general—I have an agreement for a lease of my premises—I pay 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year rent—I have known the prisoner between sixteen and seven<lb/>teen years, and have been in the habit of dealing with him—on the 24th of May, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I went for an order which I had given to be done by twelve o'clock—some gimp fringe and tassels, and buttons, and sleeve-ties—it was not completed, and I waited in consequence of it—I saw a person come in to the prisoners with a bundle under his arm—I saw the bundle opened, and it contained silk serge—there were two colours and black—one of the colours was a kind of drab, but I did not look at the coloured ones at all—the others were black—Mrs. Lovell was present when I went into the shop, and the person who came asked her whether Mr. Lovell was at home—she said, "No, he is not"—he said he wanted to see him, as he had got a job of serges which he could sell cheap—he could sell them at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-yard, if she would take the whole—she said she did not want any—I saw the colours at a distance, but the black I looked at and handled, and I felt disposed to make a purchase of them—I nodded to Mrs. Lovell and went towards the parlour—she followed me—I told her if she would buy the black, I would not mind giving 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-yard for them—I did not want the coloured, it was no use to me—the whole six pieces of serge were then left—he had asked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-yard for them—Mrs. Lovell offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the black, after what I had told her, and he said he would take it—he asked for scissors and cut some samples off, but whether he cut from them all I can<lb/>not say, but I know he cut some from both the colours, and from the black—after he had cut off these patterns, he said he did not know whether he could part them, but if she would allow him to leave them there, he would let her know in an hour or two whether he could sell the black without the colours—Dafton has very much the appearance of the man, but I could not say posi<lb/>tively that it is him, my eye-sight is very bad—to the best of my belief he is the man—I used my glasses to look at the serge—after the patterns were cut off, the man gave Mrs. Lovell something wrapped up in a piece of brown paper—I do not know what it was—he said they were some patterns of goods that had been sold and done with—they were of no use to him, and Mrs. Lovell might put them behind the fire—Mrs. Lovell's little child, who was behind the counter, said, "Mother, give it me for my doll"—I did not see her give the bundle to the child—it was on the counter—the man then went away—the shopwoman was in the shop at the time—Mrs. Lovell took up these pieces of serge, and put them on one side at the further end of the counter—they were there when I left.</p>

On the 2nd of June, I sent Macklin with a truck to Mr. Hewitt, to order two chests of tea—he came back with only one. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MACKLIN</hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—I went to Mr. Hewitt on the 2nd of June, for an order—I got the order, and went to the London Docks—I put a chest of tea into a covered truck—I saw the prisoner at the Docks, with a low cart and a grey horse—he bad some chests of tea in the cart—he took three from the Docks—he said. "Where are you going?"—I said, "Near Nicholson's wharf"—I said, "Will you give me a pull behind your cart?"—he said, "No, I go too fast for you, if I see you at Nicholson's wharf, I will give you a pull up Fish-street-hill"—I went to Nicholson's wharf, and met the prisoner there with the cart—I asked him where I should go for my tea—he pointed out where I was to go, and said, "Do not leave your truck in the middle of the road, or the police will take it away, but if you back it against my cart, I will take great care of it"—I believed he was</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of a manufactory at Wapping. I lost a penknife belonging to George Howard and others, and some cigars, a lock, and a key, of my own—they were safe on Tuesday night, the 13th of June—these are them—the box was broken open in the counting-house. Daniel Sugg. I received information, and went to Whitehead's lodg<lb/>ings, between one and two o'clock in the morning—he was in bed—I found this book at his lodging—I found Casey at his lodging—he denied knowing anything of the robbery—nothing was found on him or at his lodgings.</p>

About a quarter to three o'clock in the morning of the 14th of June I was in my dressing-room, which gives a view into the prosecutor's premises—I saw the three pri<lb/>soners come from the prosecutor's wash-house on to the water-butt, they jumped into the yard, and escaped—I ran down, and saw Whitehead come down—he was the last—I swear Casey was one of them—I knew him before by sight.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 7th of June, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in King-street, Green<lb/>wich, and saw the two prisoners following two gentlemen, who were arm-in-arm—Simmonds went up behind one of the gentlemen, followed by Kitchen, who spread open his round smock-frock close behind Simmonds, covering him, to hide what he was doing—I looked over Simmonds's shoulder, and saw his left hand go into the gentleman's left pocket—it was a Chesterfield wrapper—he took out a handkerchief and gave it to Kitchen, who put it inside his round frock—I afterwards found it in his breeches pocket—I found this other handkerchief in the back of Kitchen's breeches, which had a hole in them, and this other handkerchief I found round his neck—I spoke to the gentle<lb/>man at the time—he said he had lost his handkerchief, and would follow me to the station, but he did not—I have not been able to find him.</p>

Between four and five o'clock on Monday afternoon, I saw the two prisoners talking together close by a public-house, not five yards from the prosecutor's house-Duncan had a basket—I was afterwards at the station, and heard the watch drop from Duncan's person—I saw the prisoners come direct from the house.</p>

Mrs. Duncan, you have got me into a nice thing"—Duncan said, "I know nothing about it"—I took them to the station—as a female was about to search them, I heard the watch drop from Duncan—she said, "Mrs. Emery gave me the watch before we entered the station door"—Emery said, "For God's sake, Mrs. Duncan, ease me with it, (or words to that effect,) and I will do all I can for you."</p>

Duncan stated, that when Emery went to the prosecutor's house, she remained ten or twelve yards from the door, and was never in the house; that when Emery came out, she gave her the watch, and asked her to pawn it.</hi>)</p>

I was at home on the night of the 29th of May—I am not aware that any<lb/>thing disturbed me, but I awoke about a quarter to two o'clock, got out of bed, and looked at my watch, which was safe then—about half an hour after<lb/>wards I was in bed, and had not gone to sleep again—I fancied I heard a noise of somebody walking up the back staircase—I listened about two minutes, and was then almost satisfied that I heard somebody go into the billiard-room—I got out of bed, and went into the billiard-room with a light—not finding anybody, I went down stairs, searched the house—I found nobody, and returned to my room—I got up, about half-past three, as I was going out—it was quite light then—I looked out of my window, and saw the prisoner in our meadow, adjoining our garden—I watched him—he was standing under a tree—I saw him pass over a stile in the rick-yard, and walk towards the gate of our stable yard—I went down, and met him at the gate—he had a bundle—I asked what business he had there at that time in the morning—he said he had lost his way across the fields coming from Bexley—I said he ought to be ashamed of himself for walking across people's grass in that way, and ordered him off the premises—he took the bundle with him—about four o'clock I was going to Farningham, and missed a great coat which had hung in the hall—I then suspected he had stolen it—I immediately went round and gave information to all the policemen I could find, and described him—I then went to Farningham—I returned in the evening, and found him in custody at New-cross, and the same bundle was in the custody of the</p>

On Saturday night, the 20th of May, I heard cries of "Murder," went to the bottom of the court, and took two policemen to Stephen Skillin's house—when the door was opened Davis was on the bed, on the top of Stephen Skillin, beating him with her hand—he was drunk—his wife was lying on the floor—Davis shut the door, and said, "There are only two of those b----s, we will soon do for them"—the other two prisoners were in the room with her—there was a great noise, and the policemen got in—after they were got out there were brick-bats flying—Mrs. Skillin is since dead—she was very ill after this, from a blow she received in the scuffle—her finger was broken.</p>

On the 15th of May I went to bed at eleven o'clock—I left the kitchen all secure—I am quite sure the window was down—I got up next morning at twenty minutes after seven, found the kitchen window open, and a square of glass broken—the plate drawer in the kitchen was partly open—nothing was taken out of it—there was six forks in it, but they were left—I missed the articles stated—this thimble and cotton are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live at No. 43, Feather-stone-street, St. Luke's—I keep a van and two horses—I know the two pri<lb/>soners. On Tuesday, the 25th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Reardon came to me and asked if my van and two horses were at home—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Put them to, for my master wants you"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "On Saffron-hill, Mr. Cohen's"—I immedi<lb/>ately put the horses to, and away we rode together to Cohen's house—I stopped there about ten minutes—Cohen said, "Go along with these three men"—I saw Walders there, and two other men, who I do not know—I have not seen them since—Reardon staid behind at his master's, Cohen's house—I asked them where they were going—they said, "To Great Suffolk-street, overthe water"—I said, "I don't know Suffolk-street"—they said, "If you will go on, we will tell you which way to go"—Walders jumped on the top of my pony, and rode all the way over till we came to Suffolk-street, nearly to the bottom—when we came to the yard, they told me to stop—Walders told me to go and get something to drink, and they would pay for it—I did not go to the public-house, but stopped to look at a picture shop close by—I did not go into the yard then, but stopped outside in Great Suffolk-street—while looking at the pictures, Walders came and called me, and told me to bring the van up the yard, and the two horses—I did not see any difficulty in getting into the yard at first—it was open—there were no gates to it that I saw—I took the van and horses into the yard, and backed the van close to the warehouse ladder, by Walders' direction—I have since learnt that ware-house to be Mr. Mahon's—when I backed the van I saw the two men up stairs in the loft of the warehouse, chucking bundles of paper down to Wal<lb/>ders, who helped to load the van—when I thought they had nearly enough for my two horses to draw, they put a bag of paper, tied up in small parcels, about the width of my hand, on the tail of the van—the other paper was se<lb/>cured in bundles about a quarter of a hundred weight each—I should judge by my springs that there was near upon two tons of paper put into the van</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184306120256"/>
               <p>—they also put in some scales, ropes, and a beam, from the warehouse—they were large scales, similar to warehouse scales—I immediately put my pony to the van, and we drew out of the yard—just as we got out of the archway one of my traces broke—Walders assisted me to mend it, and during the time there was a cart waiting to come up—I pulled my van out into the main road to let the cart come by—when we mended the trace, we came on—this was about half-past seven or a quarter to eight, between seven and eight—I did not see the other two men—they did not join the van any more—Walders kept me company all the way over the bridge till we came to the Old Bailey—he told me to stop at a public-house there—I said, "No, I don't want to stop here, because it is up a hill for my horses"—he said, "Stop and have half a pot of beer"—I stood outside, and had one drink, and away I came—I saw the two men in that public-house, who were in the loft <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> the paper down—they drank after me, and Walders also—Walders and I then came on across Smithfield, up Thomas-street to Saffron-hill, to Cohen's house—the other two men did not come on with us—we got to Cohen's house at half-past eight or a quarter to nine—Cohen and Reardon were outside the door—I did not see Walders and the other two any more that night—Cohen, and Reardon, and a little boy, whose name I do not know, helped me unload the van—it might be some strange boy about there—the paper was unloaded, and put into the cellar with the scales, beam, and rope—after the van was unloaded, Cohen asked me how much—I looked at the time, and said, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—he changed a half-sovereign at the bar, and paid me—next day, Wednesday, between twelve and one, Reardon came to me, and said, "My master wants you"—he was going to wait till I put my horses to—I told him to go on—I overtook him facing St. Luke's church, in Old-street—he was along with one of the other men that had been along with me over night—that man was drunk—they got up into the van, and I drove to Cohen's house—when I came there, Cohen <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up, and said he would kick his backside for stopping so long—some of the paper was put into the van—I should think sixty or seventy bundles, and the rest in bags—it had been put into bags since the over night—Cohen told me to take them down to a yard down the hill, and be and Reardon accompanied me to the house—when I got there it was an empty room in Pump-court, Saffron-hill—Reardon, Cohen, and a lot of boys about there unloaded the van into the room—I then went to Cohen's house again, and Reardon asked me what was to pay—I said 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live at No. 128, Lambeth-walk, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—I keep the house. On the 10th of May I missed several things—the prisoner lodged in the house, up stairs—I had a wooden partition, which fenced off my shop and parlour from the passage, and on coming down, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 11th, I noticed that the partition had been moved and altered, and the screws drawn out, which would admit anybody into the shop—I found the prisoner under the counter in the shop—I had locked up that shop overnight, so that the partition would exclude anybody, unless by drawing the screws—I missed a best beaver hat, a silver caddy spoon, a large brass brewing kettle, a silver thimble, a pepper top, and several other articles—I had missed several things the day before, but those I am now speaking of were safe the overnight, when I went to bed—I asked the prisoner what he did there—he said he got there to protect the shop—the policeman afterwards found a silver thimble of mine in his possession at the station—I searched his room in the house, and found a saw, and the top of a pepper castor, which had been safe overnight in the par<lb/>lour, which is inclosed in the same partition as the shop—I cannot say how long the saw had been there—I also lost spades, pick-axes, trivets, and other things—the parlour and shop communicate by a door—the partition is a moving one—one part of it is moved every day, and stands against the wall, and the other part goes back on hinges, to throw part of the passage into the shop—it is closed and bolted at night, so that no one can get in without breaking it open, or drawing the screws—I missed property both from the par<lb/>lour and shop, which were both fastened up overnight—I found the screws drawn—I occupy the bottom part of the house, and sleep on the first floor, over the shop—I have not found anything but the thimble and this candle-stick—one part of it was concealed under the counter, where the prisoner was, and the other part was found in the privy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. I have been living lately at the Bell Tavern, Wellington-street, strand, as cook—my husband was liv<lb/>ing during that time at Wimbledon-common—on Thursday the 25th of May, I received this letter from him—it is his handwriting—"Mary Ann Clarke, at the Bell Tavern, Wellington-street, North Strand, May 23, 1843, 9 o'clock. My dear Wife, I just received your letter, but you are so fond of that <hi rend="italic">feller</hi> as you were a living with, as I wonder your sending to me, as you do not intend to come home to live with me; but I assure you that I have known no woman since you have been away from me; for I have the confidence still to think you will return home and make me happy once more. I have one thing to tell you, that is, you have heard me speak of my uncle, and at his death I should receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have had a letter from the lawyer to say he is dead, and died on the 25th of August last, and we all brothers and sisters are to meet on the 25th of August next to receive our dividends, but he has not said how much: but my brother wrote to me on Saturday to tell me that the lawyer told him that it was above 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and be it right I will bid fare<lb/>well to sawing. So now, my dear wife, if you have got the love for me, as I always thought you had, return home to me and make me happy once more as before you left me. I thought there was no man so happy as myself; and since then, I have been so unhappy, I hope you will consider yourself and come home, and be comfortable, and make me the same. Several people have tried to persuade me to take a warrant out against you; but how can I hurt</p>

               <p>the woman I love better than my own self? it is impossible for me to do it, as the love I have for you, no person knows besides myself. My housekeeper is a going to leave me, for she has a cook's place in London, and she is going to it in a fortnight. So, now, my dear wife, let me know your mind by the return of post. So no more at present, from your ever dutiful and loving husband,</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, and live in St. Mark's-road, Kenning<lb/>ton. In September last year I saw the prisoner—he ascertained my name from me, and delivered this card to me—we had some ale together—nothing particular occurred then—I saw him again on the 10th of October—I met him in the street—he asked if my name was James Callow—I said, "Yes"—he asked if I had a brother abroad—I said yes, and his name was John Callow—he then said there was money in Chancery, left by a John Callow abroad, to James Callow, and he had searched all about, but could not find James Callow till he found me, and he was sure it was right; it was up in Chancery, and by the side of the account of the money it was said, "Foreign"—he said, "You was advertised in Kingsland-road," which was where I had lived—he said he could get it for me—I saw him again, I think, the next night—he then said for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he would file affidavits in the Court of Chancery, to make applica<lb/>tion—I gave him five half-crowns, to the best of my memory, and he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him write it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Received of Mr. Cal<lb/>low, Oct. 11, 1842, the sum of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for filing affidavits on application made to the Lord Chancellor.

Horne—I have thoroughly searched and inquired, with an attorney, at the Chancery courts, and find no account of any proceedings, or any death of my brother advertised, or anything of that sort—I went with the attorney to search—(<hi rend="italic">The paper purporting to be the order was here read; it was addressed by Blake to the prisoner, and informed him that property to the amount of </hi>4000<hi rend="italic">l. was left by John Callow, of Vermont, United States; that the applicant, James Callow, was his rightful heir, and directing him to take out letters of administration, upon which the Court would grant him an injunction.</hi>)</p>

I wrote to him—on the morning of the 25th he came, showed me some pieces of parchment and papers that he was doing business for other people; and he said they were similar to what I was to receive—he said, he was going to the Court of Chancery, where he would file an application, that it would cost him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on his return he produced a piece of parch<lb/>ment similar to the one he produced in the morning—it had my name and address on it, and some other writing besides—I scarcely looked at it—he said he had paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, for applying to the Court of Chancery—I had told him before that if he brought me the paper I would pay him the money—I gave him a half-sovereign and half-a-crown, believing his statement, that he had paid it for my benefit—I asked him for a receipt, and this is the one he gave—I saw him again a few days after—he said he was going to present my petition, which would cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, it was not in my power to pay, it must rest a little while—I had but 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave him—he said, "Your business shall not be at a stand-still for the want of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will lend you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a fortnight"—he said the petition must be signed by some person that knew me for many years—I hesitated, to thiok of some old neighbour, and he said, "I can do it myself, I have known you many years," and he signed it for me—he went away, at I thought, to present this petition—he called again, and said my business was getting on very well; that I had Sir William Home, one of the oldest Masters in Chancery, to do my business for me—because I should not forget the name, I wrote it down on a card which the prisoner had given me of his address—this is it—he likewise informed me, one day when he came, that the property was near Oakingham, near Reading, that it was three times advertised, and was left in the unclaimed dividends—he took me to the Writ-office in Lincoln's Inn-square, to search the books for my name, and I felt surprised it was not there—he said, it was all the better, for if any one had put in a claim against me, my name would have been there—I have since discovered that that office has nothing to do with the Court of Chancery.</p>

On Tuesday, the 23rd of May, I missed a watch from the boat, which was on the Thames, coming from Reading to London—I had seen it safe at Read<lb/>ing on the Friday, in the cupboard of the boat, and I felt it there the next day—the cupboard was not locked—I and my brother were the only persons who slept in the place—the prisoner belonged to the vessel, but he was not on board when I felt the watch—he was employed till we got to Lon<lb/>don—this is the watch—it is John Snozell's, my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Gray; we are tailors and drapers at Nos. 70 and 71, Blackman-street, Borough—Hide was our foreman—it was his duty to keep the stock, and to give out all the goods to the tailors who were at work for us—he was to keep a book in which he was to enter all the goods that he gave out—Gwyther was a tailor who has worked for us out of the house, rather under twelve months—in consequence of in<lb/>formation, I applied to Mr. Stevens, and caused this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to be written—it was sent to Stevens, who lived in the same house with Gwyther, at No. 132, Great Suffolk-street, on Monday the 5th of June—on Tuesday the 6th, I had some black cloth in from the damper's—it was put in a place where the customers do not usually go, to be rolled next morning—I saw them there</p>

               <p>safe till ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 7th, when it was taken to be rolled—I saw Gwyther in my shop on that Wednesday morning, about nine o'clock, and I saw him there as late as twelve o'clock, when I saw him go away, he had a bag with him very full indeed—the same afternoon I saw one yard and three-quarters of superfine black cloth, and three yards of ker<lb/>seymere, in possession of Stevens, in Great Suffolk-street—they were our pro<lb/>perty—the kerseymere had been previously marked in my presence—this is the piece of black cloth, and here is a particular notch on the edge of each of them—the ends of both correspond—the one yard and three-quarters correspond at one end with the bulk, and at the other, with a piece that was torn off—this piece of cloth should have measured eighten yards and a quarter, but it just two yards deficient—I was present the same afternoon when Gwyther's apart<lb/>ment was searched, and I found there a quarter of a yard of cloth which, being joined to the one yard and three-quarters, would make the entire of the roll, and account for the whole deficiency—a piece of cloth, measuring two yards, was produced by Mr. Worley, a pawnbroker—it matched in cutting, with a piece of cloth in my stock, and I missed this on Wednesday night—there is no entry in my books of either of these pieces of cloth—I have looked through the books—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) in which it was Hide's duty to have entered them if they had been given to the tailors for work for us—Gwyther was taken into custody—I then went to my shop to Hide, and Mr. Gray, my partner, asked Hide in my presence how that piece of black cloth came to be cut—he said he had given it out to make a coat for an order which stood in the book at a blue coat for a man of the name of M'Carthy—I said, "How is that, when the order stands for a blue coat?"—he said, "The man has altered his mind from a blue to a black"—I said, "How does it hap<lb/>pen you have not altered the order-book?"—he said, "I cannot tell, in my hurry I forgot it"—I said, "If this is the case what is become of the piece of blue cloth?"—he said, "I have had it back again"—I said, "Where is it, if you have had it back again; produce it?"—he said, "I do not know where it is; I cannot be answerable for cloth that I have had back some days"—I sent for M'Carthy and gave Hide into custody.</p>
