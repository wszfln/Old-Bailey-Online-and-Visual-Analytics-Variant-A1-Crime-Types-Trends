                  </hi>. I am a carman to Mr. Charles Lyall, he keeps mustard and flour mills at Lambeth. On the 12th of January I was driving his cart with this cask and 60lbs. of mustard in it—I got to Mr. Adams's at Rotherhithe between six and seven o'clock at night, and when I went into his shop to deliver some mustard I missed this cask—I must have lost it in Pudding-lane, where I had stopped to deliver two sacks of ground ginger, as that was the only place I had called at—I was away about five minutes—the cask could not have fallen out, as it was a tilted cart—I gave information at the station-house—I came back to Pudding-lane and found the cask of mustard in the prisoner's wagon—when I was in Pudding-lane first I saw the prisoner there, and he asked which way I was going—I said I was going to back out, and he said be was going to draw down to load at one of the warehouses—I then went on to Rotherhithe, and when I came back I found his wagon drawn lower down to the place where he said he was going to load—there were two more persons standing talking with him when I got back, but he was the person who had the care of the wagon—I found this cask of mustard in his wagon covered over with a sack, and some loose straw put on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, and live in Finsbury-place, in the parish of St. Luke. My dwelling-house opens into the street at the side door, which I fastened myself about half-past ten o'clock at night, the last thing—there is one warehouse in front, opening into the street, and two warehouses behind—Vickery fastened the warehouses—the dwelling-house was fast when I went to bed, both front and back—I was called up, about half-past one clock in the night, by two policemen—I went into the counting-house, which joins the passage leading from the dwelling-house,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040016"/>
               <p>and found the door leading into the first warehouse from the counting-house open, a pane of glass was taken out, and the key, which had been left inside the lock, turned—they could put a hand' through the glass to open that door, and it was open—I found my desk, which I had locked, broken open, and the cash-box, containing cash and bills to the amount of about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taken—the cash-box was a black japanned one with yellow stripes—I had fastened that counting-house-door my self that night about half past ten o'clock—it appeared that somebody had been concealed on the premises—it must have been so, as the warehouse door was open, and the large gate leading into the street—there were no marks of violence on it, and the warehouse door, which was fastened with two bolts and a lock, was also open, without any appearance of violence—it must have been opened from the inside—in consequence of suspicion I directly went to the residence of Bignold, who has been convicted, and had been my errand-boy for three weeks and three days—I got there about two o'clock—his mother looked out of the win<lb/>dow, and said he had not been at home all night, and she did not know where he was—we afterwards found him—I made inquiry of him, but never could find the prisoner until within the last few days—the other pri<lb/>soners were tried in November—we have not brought the cash-box here to-day—it was produced at the last trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Scaley, of No. 23, Col<lb/>chester-street, Savage-gardens, in the parish of St. Olave, Hart-street. On the 30th of January, between one and two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner coming out of the back-attic of Mr. Scaley's house, with a blue bag in his hand—he went down stairs—I followed him—I did not observe him drop any thing—Mr. Kemapley, master's clerk, stopped him as he got out of the outer-door, to go out—my fellow-servant and I sleep in the back-attic—none of my property was taken—it is the custom to keep the outer-door of the house shut, but how it was that day I cannot say—the inner-door, leading to the dwelling-house, is usually kept shut—I had not noticed it that morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM</hi> Axom. I am a pork-butcher and a little farmer, at Romford. I had a bill against me of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I came to town to take up that bill—I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, tied up, on purpose to take up that bill—there was 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and a note for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Romford Bank—I got to town ra<lb/>there before eleven o'clock in the morning of the 5th of January—I ex<lb/>pected the bill was at Hill and Son's, in Smithfield; but when I got there it was in Lombard-street, and I went back to Lombard-street—I met the prisoner Brown, as I was going to Smithfield, very near to St. Paul's church—he said, "What church is this here?"—I said, "I believe that is St. Paul's"—he asked me to show him round it—I told him I had business to do at Smithfield, I could not stop then—I walked on, and he walked with me as far as Little Britain, and there he asked me if I would take a drop of something to drink—I said, "I don't care if I have a glass of gin"—we went into a public-house, and he said, "Suppose we have a glass of gin and water"—he called for it, and paid for it—while we were there the pri<lb/>soner Smith came in, and another man came in just after him—the other man took out of his coat pocket a great bundle of notes of some sort—they ap<lb/>peared to me as though they were Hank of England notes—he said he had got them from the bank, that he had received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and be meant to be very liberal to the poor—he asked me where I lived—I told him I had just come from Romford—he said he would treat us, and asked whether there were any poor people at Romford—I said, "Yet, there are a great many poor people round the neighbourhood"—he asked me if I would take a £5 note, and take the trouble to buy 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of coals to give to the poor where I thought they were needy—I said, "Yes, if you think proper to let me have a £5 note I will put my trouble to it, and it shall be done"—he then separated a note out, and said I had better put it away with toy money—I was foolish enough to take my purse out with my money in it, and Smith, the prisoner, snatched it out of my hand—they were all three at that time sitting close together—after my purse was snatched Smith put it between his legs—they then had a large sheet of brown paper and began to rumple it up—I thought I was with sharpers—I caught my own purse and got it again—I could feel by the weight of it that I had got it right—I left the room instantly—Brown came out after me, and walked with me as far as the banker's in Smithfield—I said to him, "They are the sharpers, I think—I thought it was best to be off as quick as I could"—he said very little to me then, but the man who had the notes had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down a half-crown, and Brown said, "We may as well nave a glass of brandy and water"—I said, "No, this will be quite enough for me"—they</p>

               <p>had a glass of brandy and water—I cannot say whether the man who had the notes had any of the gin and water—but Brown asked him to drink—the man who had the notes went out for two or three minutes, then he came in and called for two glasses of brandy and water more.</p>

On Saturday, the 5th of January, about twelve o'clock, the prosecutor and the two prisoners came to my house—there was another person—they all came in within a few minutes—the prosecutor came in with one of them—I did not take particular notice of their coming in, but I am certain the prosecutor was there, and the prisoners, and another man—they all followed each other along the passage, and went into the par lour—I went in with some ale, gin and water, and brandy and water—when I took the grog in, the money was on the table—after they had been there a little while, they all drew their chairs close round the prosecutor—I spoke to the officer, and he came in just as they were going out, and after they had gone out, I saw one or two of them go to another public-house, not above twenty yards from mine—I do not know whether the prosecutor went in, he was at the door—one of them went out of my house a little before the other—the pro<lb/>secutor, and two of them, went out together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company. On the 15th of January, I was engaged in the tea warehouse of the West India Import Dock—the prisoner was an extra labourer in that warehouse, and was at work in the east wing—there are four floors on each division—I observed the prisoner in the west division, where he had no business—I asked what he had been doing there—he said "looking for a truck"—I told him to go to his work, and took no further notice of it—on the next morning, about the same hour, I saw him going to the same spot—I then said nothing to him, but watched him—there</p>

               <p>was in that west wing a chest of gunpowder tea, No. 13—I saw him remove the lid, put his band in, take out some tea, put it in a small bag, and put the hag into his pocket—he then left, and went to another room—I followed, and called him, but he went on—I called him a second time—he took no notice, but ran—I ran, and caught him—I told him to give me the tea he had—he said he had none—I said he had—I attempted to take the bag from his pocket, and in the struggle he contrived to empty the whole of the contents of the bag into a basket of rubbish which was there—I sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge—I then went back to the chest, and saw evident marks of its having been plundered—I weighed it, and found it one pound deficient, as near as I can tell—I saw him empty about three-quarters of a pound into the basket.</p>

In May last I appeared against him about driving a coach—on the night of the 16th of January, shortly before ten o'clock, I went into Palace-yard with Fel<lb/>stead for tlie purpose of taking a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to go home—I had not been there many minutes when I saw a person named Norris go into the tap under the King's Arms tavern there—he came out shortly after with one Job<lb/>bins and several others—Felstead was assaulted by Jobbins, who com<lb/>menced beating him with a bludgeon, a thick stick—Norris said, "Go it! give it 'em!"—I called "Police" as loud as I could, and while doing so I was knocked down by the prisoner—I had not said or done any thing to him—after I was down he fell upon me, and inflicted a wound on my chin, which cut. It very nearly to the bone—I lost my hat in the struggle, and picked up another, which, to the best of my belief, was the one which the prisoner wore—that hat is now in the constable's possession—my chin bled profusely—I made the best of my way home, and, as soon as I could, got assistance from Mr. Collambell, a surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you followed your respectable occupation of common informer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly six years—in the course of that time I have laid many informations against other people as well as the prisoner—I live by it—it was a summons I had against the prisoner, not an information—it was addressed to the proprietor of the carriage and to produce the driver—I did not give the prisoner any money after the conviction—I do not recollect ever giving him any money in my life—I did not give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after the conviction, to the best of my belief—I gave his wife 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believe—I recollect giving her something perfectly well—I have a doubt about how much, but I think it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Felstead is one of the same class with me—he is my assistant—he gives evidence on oath—I stated at the police office that Jobbins assaulted Fel<lb/>stead, and that Norris said, "Go it, give it 'em"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)</p>

               <p>—this is my hand-writing—I do not think what I said was taken down it the exact terms I gave it—I believe the words in the deposition are "Fel<lb/>stead was assaulted"—I swear I mentioned the name of Jobbins—what was taken down was read over to me—I was not particularly desired to attend to it, but I did attend to it—I signed it—I did not tell the clerk he had not taken it correctly—the substance was there—I told the Magistrate that I was knocked down by the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read, was</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">"he was assaulted by a man there"</hi>)—I had been taking some<lb/>thing to drink that evening—I had drank at the Shades at Charing-cross, and at another house in St. Martin's-lane—I do not know the sign—I might have been to other places, but I do not recollect it—I may have been in one or two more houses—I was in one in Palace-yard—that is all to the best of my recollection—I swear positively I was not in three others—there might have been one other—the first was in St. Martin's-lane, the second in St. Martin-street, the third at Charing-cross, and then in the neighbourhood of Palace-yard—they are all I recollect, and I think I can swear positively that is all.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 16th of January I was in company with Carter all day—I am also a common informer—at near ten o'clock at night we were at the coach-stand in Palace-yard—neither of us were at all the worse for liquor—after we had been there a very short time a person named Norris went down into the tap of the public-house, and in a short time the prisoner and fifteen or sixteen more came up—the tap is a low cellar under the King's Arms tavern—a man named Jobbins began beating me with a bludgeon, and Norris said, "Go it, give it 'em"—Carter called out "Police," and Jobbins ran away—I turned round and saw the prisoner knock Carter down with his fist—they both fell together, and when the pri<lb/>soner got up I saw something in his hand which I thought was the blade of a knife—Carter was cut across the chin two inches or two inches and a half in length, and was bleeding very fast—he had lost his hat—there was another old hat lying on the pavement, which he took—I took him home, and a surgeon attended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Canterbury-place, Lambeth. On the night of the 16th of January I was called in to the prosecutor—I observed a wound on his chin, about an inch, or an inch and a quarter, or rather better, in length—it appeared to be an incised wound, made with a cutting instrument—I consider it could not have been made by a blow of any blunt instrument, or by falling against any thing, because then it must have been a contused wound—the skin would then be lacerated and uneven, but the edge of an incised wound would be perfectly clean—it was not a bruise—I considered it an incised wound—I dressed his face at his own house on two succeeding days—I called on the third day, and he was out—I attended him twice after that at his own house—it was a deep wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suppose a man fell on a sharp flint, would not that give the appearance of an incised wound? I should say not—it would not give it the appearance that wound had, nor would a piece of glass—it might cut it clean.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the employ of Mr. South<lb/>gate, a packer, in Old 'Change. In the latter part of November I packed a bale of goods marked "A F N 1000," for exportation—I took an account of the goods packed in the bale—it was sent to the West India Dock—on Saturday, the 5th of January, it was brought back to me, and I examined it again—I found it had been cut open, and seven or eight pieces of print and some remnant of calico wrapper and a bundle of tape taken from it—I afterwards saw articles of that description in possession of Montague the constable, one of which I can speak to having packed in the bale—the goods produced by him make up the deficiency in the bale.</p>

I was on duty at the south quay gate on the afternoon of the 1st January—I locked the shed No. 2 at four o'clock—the warehouse has a slated roof, and has battens all round it—I had only one bale of goods in that warehouse at that time—it was marked "A F N 1000," and was for exportation—I saw it safe that afternoon—I went next morning with the constable about about half-past eight o'clock, and found the bale had been cut open, part of the goods taken out, and a lot lying by the side as well, and there had been a batten cut—we sent information to Southgate's, and they fetched the bale away—all the battens of the warehouse were safe when I left at four o'clock.</p>

On the 9th of January I saw Foster in company with two other men—they were going down the Mile-end-road trying to get something from the hind parts of carts—about half past seven o'clock I saw Foster near Dog-row—the prisoner Carion and some men were with him—Carson went to Mr. Rabbeck's shop door, and fixed herself in the door-way—she then went to the men again, who were near the Duke of Cambridge—Foster then went to three boxes which were on the pavement near the prosecutor's shop, and a truck near them—he went behind the three boxes, and Carson went to the shop door again—Foster then took up the smallest of the boxes and carried it in his arms across Dog-row—he was placing it between two carts, the shafts of which were joined together—I jumped over the shafts and said, "<hi rend="italic">Phil,</hi> I want you"—he looked up and said, "I don't care, I can't starve"—I took Foster, and Sampel, who stands at the corner of the Dog-row with a stall, ran after the other two men—I had observed the prisoners seemed to be communicating something to each other, and at the time the box was re<lb/>moved Carson was at the door-way of the shop, as I thought, to take the atten<lb/>tion of the person in the shop—I did not see her touch Foster—she followed me down to the station-house, and made use of very base language to the man who was carrying the box for me—I told her, if she did not hold her tongue, I would take her—she then went away—I went in an hour and a half afterwards, and took her in Whitechapel-road—I knew where to find her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Marylebone, with my aunt, Elizabeth Stevens, who keeps a chandler's shop. On the 10th of January, about six o'clock at night, I heard a noise outside—I went to the door, and missed eight soup-plates and two tea-pots—I found a foreign boy at the door, who pointed to where the things had been taken from, and beckoned me to follow him—I did so, and saw the prisoner in Great Marylebone-street, and found the plates on him—I took him back, and met the policeman—I gave the prisoner into custody—these are my aunt's plates—the tea-pots have never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I was fourteen years old last September. I live with my father, and am in the service of Mr. James Pitt and his partner, hatters, in York-street, Covent-garden—on the evening of the 2nd of January, between half-past eight and nine o'clock, I was in my masters' shop, and the prisoner came in—he asked the price of the very best hats—my master said 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked to try one on, which he did, and that fitted—be then asked to try on another of a different shape, and that fitted also—he then asked my master to get them ready, and he would call in five minutes—he said he wanted them to show to his father, and which his father liked he should have—he then called and asked my master to let me go with the hats to Long-acre—as we were going along, the prisoner told me his father kept two houses, one in Long-acre, and one in Carnaby-street, and if he was not in one, I must go to the other—when we got to Long-acre, the prisoner told me to give him the hats, which I did, and he went into Mr. Clark's public-house—I followed him in at the door, as I thought there was something wrong—he went up the passage, and I heard Mr. Clark's son call out "Stop thief!"—I believe the prisoner threw the hats away—he was taken into custody—he had said he would bring me the money down, and one of the hats, and keep the one his father approved of—they were to be sold for ready money—I let him have them, believing he was going to take them in to his father.</p>

               <p>last—I first saw him at the George and Vulture, in Haberdasher-street, Hoxton, between four and five o'clock in the evening—Aspland and Far<lb/>mer were with me in the same house, and Macartney had been there, but was not there when the deceased came—we then went to the Carpenter's Arms door—we afterwards went to the Duke of York public-house about eleven o'clock at night, and remained there till nearly one o'clock—when I left the Duke of York, there was Aspland, Cresswell, Farmer, Macart<lb/>ney, and the deceased with me—it was rather a dry frosty night—we left the Duke of York between twelve and one o'clock, about a quarter to one o'clock—on coming out, the deceased took Aspland on his back—Aspland being lame, and not having his crutch with him, could not walk home—Aspland, Cresswell, Farmer and myself were sober—the deceased was a little the freshest if there was any difference, but he was not intoxicated—he went with Aspland on his back in a direction of the middle of the road, but rather to the left—we came down the Hertford road, on the left-hand side of the road towards the Whitmore bridge—there is a turn in the road about half-way, to go to the madhouse—the deceased ran along the road at first with Aspland on his back, and made a noise imitating a horse—he went, "Hey, hey," and so on—I, Cresswell, Farmer, and Macartney were from twenty to twenty-five yards behind him—we were on the footpath when we turned the corner—there are gas lamps in the road—it is a public road, and there are policemen about—as we were coming towards the mad-house Aspland and the deceased were going along before us, and Aspland was still on the deceased's back—they both fell down, and Aspland fell over his head—a little further on there is a short crossing to get to Whit<lb/>more-bridge—this was ten or fifteen yards from the crossing—at the time Aspland and the deceased fell, the prisoner Bull came by—I was still twenty or twenty-five yards behind the deceased and Aspland—I think I saw the prisoner come across before the fall—he came in a direction from Whitmore-bridge, towards us—there is a waste ground on the right-hand side of the crossing—as the prisoner came by them, Aspland and the deceased were on the ground, and when he had passed, the deceased got up out of the road from where he was, and came in a direction towards the prisoner, in a staggering direction—he went about six or seven yards, in the direction towards the prisoner, and by that time the prisoner had passed Cresswell, Macartney, me, and Farmer, and we had got up to Rasbbrook—Rashbrook passed me, about a yard or two—he then turned round to me, and exclaimed, "Good God, I am stabbed," or, "That man has stabbed me—(I cannot say which)—I am a dead man"—he was holding his arm up in this direction—(<hi rend="italic">extending it horizontally</hi>)—I first saw him hold his arm up so, when the blood was flowing from him—I felt the blood with my hands—his arm was raised when he exclaimed he was stabbed—that was the first time I had seen it raised up—I let go of the deceased, and ran after the prisoner, leaving Aspland, Cresswell, and Macartney with him—the prisoner was running in the direction towards the Duke of York, in the direction we had come—I called out, "Stop him"—the police came up—the first policeman caught me, and let the prisoner pass—I fell, and lost my hat, but found it afterwards—I told the policeman he had stabbed a man—he let me go, and ran after the prisoner—I afterwards came up with the prisoner—he was in the hands of the sergeant and policeman—I said, "I give him in charge for stabbing a man"—the policeman said he must go back—he did not want to go</p>

               <p>back, but I cannot say what he said exactly—he stated that he had no occasion to go back, and said, "I have done it in self-defence"—he was not searched, but he put his hand into his coat-pocket, pulled out a knife, and delivered it to the sergeant—he stated that he had done it so, (<hi rend="italic">moving his arm in a back-handed, direction,</hi>) and he would do it again—I went up to the deceased, with the prisoner and the policeman, but did not hear any thing said—I instantly left, and went for a surgeon—I did not find the deceased in the same place as I had left him—I found him against a wall, about six yards from where he fell, moved to the footpath—I did not hear the prisoner or the deceased say any thing before I heard the exclamation, "I am stabbed"—I consider that I was near enough to have heard if any thing had been said—I did not hear the prisoner cry out any thing—I did not bear an exclamation from any body, except when the deceased and Aspland fell down, Farmer, or somebody exclaimed, "All right, good night"—nothing had been done to the prisoner by any body, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>and then on the other, not on the footpath, and the deceased snorted like a horse when he took Aspland up—I continued behind until the deceased fell—we met a policeman, but I cannot say whether it was before or after we passed the corner—when I came up by the madhouse, I saw Rash<lb/>brook fall, with Aspland on his back—I did not take particular notice where Aspland fell—I saw the prisoner coming up in a direction towards them—I should say he was not close enough to touch him at the time he fell, nor at any time before he fell—I should say he would be up about a minute after he fell—I was about twenty yards off—they were in front of me—the prisoner might have been three or four yards from them, I think, when they fell, but I cannot exactly say—it was rather a darkish night—there are gas lights there—I do not know whether there was one near—I think they are only on one side, which is the footpath—while the deceased and Aspland were lying on the ground I had time to come up to them—at the time I came up the prisoner had got up to the party also—the prisoner was coming in one direction, and I in the other, and we both, as near as possible, met—he had got up rather before me—it did not take long to run twenty yards—I saw him, before the deceased fell, coming forty or fifty yards from me—it was light enough to see forty or fifty yards by the gas light</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it light enough for the prisoner to see Aspland on the back of the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might not have been looking, I cannot say—I could see the reflection of a person coming by the gas light—when I came up to the deceased and the prisoner, I did not hear any thing said by either of them—I saw nothing done by either of them at that moment—I was the person that exclaimed, "It's all right"—the deceased and Aspland were then lying on the ground, and the prisoner was standing between me and them—I said, "It's all right," because I thought the prisoner might think they were quarrelling or something.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near did Rashbrook get to the prisoner before he ex<lb/>claimed, "lama dead man?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say, he walked eight or ten yards towards him—I could not see whether he had got up to him, as his back was towards me—I did not, at that time or any other, hear any words pass between the prisoner and Rashbrook—I and my companions were quite peaceable at the time—I never heard any words between any of us—I have no reason to know that the prisoner and deceased were acquainted at all—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see more than one gas light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, several, in the way the prisoner ran—there was no lamp between me and the prisoner, when I first saw him coming along, but the one by which I saw him—there was one behind us—the part where the deceased and Aspland were was some distance from any lamp—I kept my eye on the prisoner till he came up to where the two men fell—there was nobody else coming along—I was sure to see him—I am sure the two men fell before the prisoner and I got up to the place—I concluded they had slipped—it was very frosty and slippery—it appeared to me that the prisoner stopped when be got up, in consequence of the men falling—the other persons of our party were not far behind at the time—the prisoner would see the two men on the ground, and me coming towards him, and some others behind me—it is rather a lonely neighbourhood—there are houses on one side, and a field on the other—I should say it was a lonely spot at that time in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you have said that, seeing him stop, you said, "It's all right"—was that under an impression that a stranger might be alarmed at what he saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have thought we had been quarrelling—on my saying, "It's all right," he walked on in the direction he was going—he pas<lb/>sed me in doing so, but he turned round before the deceased went towards him—I was four or five feet from the deceased and Aspland when the prisoner passed me, and they were getting up—I saw the deceased get up—my back was not towards the prisoner, after he passed me, it was towards the wall—I was standing sideways—I could see the deceased get up, as well as the direc<lb/>tion the prisoner took—I cannot take on myself to say that the prisoner moved an inch back towards where the man had fallen, when he turned round after getting ten or twelve yards—I believe he had passed Pugh then, but I cannot be certain—I believe he had not passed Cresswell and Macartney, but I think he had passed Pugh, for at the time the deceased said "I am stabbed," Pugh caught him in his arms—the two men who fell, and I, were on one side of the prisoner, Pugh near him, and the other two on the other side of him—I should say he was in the midst of us—when the deceased got up, he went towards the prisoner—I cannot give any reason for his taking that direction—it was entirely opposite to the route we were going—it was about two minutes after the prisoner passed me, that the deceased got up, and passed me in the same direction—he did not go after him till he saw the prisoner turn round—on seeing the prisoner turn round, he got np, and went in that direction—he then appeared in perfect health as he was before—after he passed me, and went towards the prisoner, his back was to me—I looked at him all the time he was going towards the prisoner—I cannot say whether I looked at any thing else particularly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now from the position in which you stood, and his back being towards you, and his having got a distance of eight or ten yards, might he not have struck, or attempted to strike the prisoner, without your seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have done so.</p>

               <p>him exclaim he was stabbed—I did not hear him make that exclamation more than once—he seemed in perfect health to me when he walked the eight or ten yards, but he might have been ill, and I not see it—I did not examine where the blood was first discovered, or how far that was from where he fell—there is a canal near there—when the prisoner stopped and turned round, he was not on the side of the road, nearest the canal, he was on the footpath, against the corner of the gateway—there is no footpath on the side next the canal—when the deceased made the exclamation, he staggered, and Pugh caught him in his arms—he was staggering when I heard him exclaim—in a very different state to what he was in before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a very different motion from that in which he had advanced towards the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the deceased had no stick or weapon in his hand—Aspland did not follow with him—he was lame, and could not move—he was not off the ground at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I drive a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and live in Bridegroom-court, Hoxton-square. I was in company with Rashbrook and the others, at the Duke of York, and left with them—the deceased carried Aspland on his back, and going along he went capering along, similar to a horse—just before he came to the bridge, he met the prisoner—we had met a police-man before that—I should think the deceased and Aspland were between ten and twenty yards before me at the time they fell—the prisoner came along past him, and Rashbrook fell down—the deceased and the prisoner were pretty close to each other at the time he fell—they were no distance apart—one was near enough to touch the other—when Rashbrook rose up, he said, "O my God, I am stabbed, I am stabbed, I am a dead man!"—he said that, I suppose, about a minute after he rose up—I picked him up, when he fell down again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far had he started from the spot where he first fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He only made a bit of a reel round—the prisoner had passed him then, and got nearer to the Duke of York, and as soon as he heard him halloo out "O my God, I am stabbed!" he immediately began to run—I assisted in help<lb/>ing the deceased to the wall—I lifted him up, and Macartney helped me to get him to the wall—he was lying down, and the blood laid in a puddle in the middle of the road—I remained with him till the prisoner was brought back—he died in three or four minutes—I did not see any thing done by any of our party to the prisoner, before the deceased cried out "I am stabbed"—I did not hear a word spoken by one or the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Hert<lb/>ford-road, on Saturday morning, the 19th of January—I remember meeting six men in the road, one was on the back of the other—there was no disorder—they were merely talking and <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with each other—I did not hear any disorder just before that in any way—I was with Tivey when there was a cry of "Stop him"—when I passed the six men they were about one hundred and thirty yards from where the deceased was afterwards lying, past the corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Hoxton. I was called on the 19th of January, and went to the Hertford-road, between fifteen and thirty yards from Whitmore bridge—I found the deceased sitting against the wall, supported by a man behind him—his clothes were bloody, and he was dead—I had him conveyed to the nearest public-house, and found the axillary artery and the axillary vein divided—that is situated in the arm-pit—the division of the artery was the came of death—such a wound would no doubt cause almost instantaneous death—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) would inflict such a wound—I afterwards opened the body, and found that I was correct in the artery being severed—I discovered that the pectoral muscle was not divided, nor touched—that is in the front part of the arm-pit—the wound was under the arm, and part of the front part of the arm was cut, in the arm-pit, and part of the arm as well—the artery and the vein could only be exposed by the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man to have his arms thrown back in the way the offi<lb/>cer supported the witness, would that so expose the axillary artery and vein as that they might be wounded without wounding the pectoral muscle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the artery and vein would be completely behind the pectoral muscle—it was not possible to inflict such a wound as I saw, while hit arm was in that position, by a back-handed blow—it was impossible to do it in any way with the arm in that position.</p>

He lives at Hope-cottage, Church-lane, Chelsea—the prisoner was in my ser<lb/>vice in January—I missed a pair of scissors which had belonged to my de<lb/>ceased mother, on a Monday, about a week previous to my finding them I had them using on the Saturday at my work-table—the prisoner had</p>

               <p>no scissors of her own—she had borrowed my daughter's—but when I spoke to the prisoner she said she had a pair of her own, which were in her box, in the chaise-house—my husband gave her warning, and she was to leave me on Thursday the 24th of January—I had two rings which I wore at a party on the Friday evening, before the 24th—they were then enclosed in this box, and locked up in a drawer in the wardrobe, in my bed-room—I saw them safe on the Saturday morning—in consequence of information from my daughter, I went to a drawer in the prisoner's room on the Tuesday morning, and found a pair of stockings—I shook them, and the scissors and the two rings fell out of the feet of the stockings—the rings were then loose, and the case in which they had been kept was left in my box, in the drawer of the wardrobe—I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in Mr. Wright's dressing-room—I said to her, "Oh, Harriett, what have you been doing?"—she said, "Nothing."—I could hardly believe she had done it—I went to the wardrobe, and missed my rings—I then said to her, "Harriett, I have found my scissors, and you have taken them"—she said, "Then you have been to my drawer"—I can swear to these rings—they belonged to my mother, and were given to me by my father after her death—I was present when the prisoner's room was searched, and two flannel waistcoats which belonged to my eldest son were found under the mattrass, and between the laths of the bedstead, where they ought not to have been—my family consists of Mr. Wright, a daughter, and two sons, the prisoner, and a man-servant—these rings are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in High-street, Whitechapel. The male prisoner brought me this note, (No. 49342) about nine or ten o'clock at night—I cannot say whether it was on the 1st of January, or afterwards—he asked for change for a £5 note for his master—whether he bought any bread at the time, I cannot say—I knew him before, and knew who his master was—I have written on it, "Whiteside," but no date—I think I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In gold, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In silver—I should not have given him change if I had not known him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of police. In consequence of instructions I received, I went to No. 17, Redman's-row, Stepney, and saw the female prisoner—I asked her what family she had—she said the had one son, and that he had been in the service of Mr. Whiteside, of Aldgate—I asked if he lived with her—she said no—I asked where he lived—she said somewhere in Whitechapel—I asked if he was employed—she said, "Yes, at the shop of Mr. Wainwright, a brush-maker," but she did not know the street—I said I should like to see the boy—she said she would go and fetch him—I told her I would walk with her, and did go to the house in Thomas-street—I there saw the prisoner William—I told him I wanted to speak to him, and took him to Mr. Smith's, in Whitechapel-road—I asked him if he knew me—he said, "I have seen you at the post-office"—I told him I was a police officer, and to be very cautious what he said to me—I then put the Bank-note, No. 49343, into his hand, and asked if he knew Mr. Cornish's shop, in Fenchurch-street—he said yes—I asked him if he recollected changing that note at Mr. Cornish's shop—he said no—I then asked him if he had ever changed a note at Mr. Cor<lb/>nish's—he said no—I searched him, and found a knife on him, nothing else—I asked where he lived—he said in Essex-street, Whitechapel—I have since found he has a lodging there—I left him in charge of a person,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Upper Fitzroy-street. On the 24th January, I was called in to examine the body of Eliza Donald, in a small street, near Cromer-street, St. Pancras—she was a fine healthy young woman, about twenty years of age—she had a bruise on the right eye, (a common black eye,) and a bruise on the right side of the body, above the hip, between the hip and the ribs, from the abdomen down to the edge of the hip—there was one bruise on the lower part of the abdomen, near the groin—that bruise must have been inflicted with vio<lb/>lence—on examining the body internally, I found marks of extensive in<lb/>flammation of the peritoneum covering the inside of the abdomen—that is a very dangerous inflammation—it appeared to be more severe in the parts corresponding with the external injuries—I concluded that the external injuries were the original cause of the inflammation which caused her death—I have no doubt of it—she was a very healthy subject—there was nothing but the inflammation to account for her death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-surgeon to Mr. Delisair. I saw the de<lb/>ceased before death, on the Saturday afternoon about three o'clock—she died the following day at one o'clock—I found her labouring under severe inflammation of the peritoneum—I did not examine her to see any external bruise, but she complained of severe pain on the right side—there was certainly severe inflammation on the side where she told me she had been</p>

               <p>hurt—I saw her again about five or six o'clock in the evening—I said when I first saw her that I did not think she would live till the next day—her pulse was sinking—I found her worse in the evening—I saw her body examined after death by Mr. Ladbury, and agree with him in opinion—I found bruises where she complained of the severe pain—I have not a doubt she died from inflammation caused by the injuries she told me she had received.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not drinking immediately after the injury, instead of retiring to rest, aggravate it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If inflammation was going on at the time, drink would increase that, no doubt—a little bleeding might have put it all to rights, but that is according to the state of the inflammation—understand<lb/>ing that she was out on Monday and Tuesday, and not confined to her bed till Tuesday night, I consider that at first the inflammation was not very active.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased, Eliza Donald—she was about twenty years of age, and was an unfortunate girl. On Sunday, the 13th of January, I went with her to No. 11, Zion-terrace, which is a bad house, and is in the next terrace to where I live—I was standing at the next door, No. 12, and saw the prisoner go in—she had not been in there two minutes before I heard a scuffle, and saw her pushed out, and the door shut immediately—I did not see who pushed her out, whether it was a male or fe<lb/>male—it was not with violence—I went and spoke to the deceased on her being pushed out—I saw the prisoner immediately after come out of the house—she is also an unfortunate girl—I saw her come behind Donald and strike her on the back of the neck with her fist, and they both fell—the deceased had not struck her or given her any provocation that I saw—I should have seen it if she had—the prisoner was very much intoxicated, more so than the deceased—they had both been drinking—a young girl came out of No. 8, and hit Martin to make her leave go of Donald's hair—I saw the prisoner kick Donald with her feet several times, but I cannot exactly say where it was—it was in the stomach—she was on the ground at the time—the prisoner had got up—I think the kicked her about three times, not more, and then the prisoner staggered very much against the railings—the deceased got up after the kicking, and walked into No. 9—she did not appear much hurt—I did not see the prisoner kick her any where else but in the lower part of her belly, not her hips—she fell against the wall when she fell—she did not return any of the kicks—I did not see any provocation given by Donald—I saw the prisoner holding her by her hair—I saw her eye was a little red when she got up, but I did not see any blow struck in the face at all—she fell with her face against the pave<lb/>ment, and on her side against the wall.</p>

A little before nine o'clock, on the 21st of January, I went into my shop and missed two waistcoat pieces, and a remnant of cloth—I found the glass of the window broken—it had been cracked previously, but there was no aperture in it before—I had seen it whole at noon—the goods could be drawn through the hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of police. On the morning of the 31st of December, I was in Sharp's-alley, St. Sepulchre—I met the prisoner about half-past ten o'clock, about seven minutes walk from the prosecutor's, with this part of a looking-glass frame tied up in this pocket-handkerchief—I asked him what he had got—he said, "A looking-glass frame"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said he bought it in Petti<lb/>coat-lane, with some rubbish—I said I should take him to the station-house, and at the corner of Field-lane, he got his leg between mine, and tried to throw me—I took him to the office, and he was discharged for want of evidence—he was taken again in a week afterwards—I found in his pocket the screws of the looking-glass stand,</p>

               <p>couple of yards from the cart, and put them against the stable-door—I then saw a sack put down by the man on the top of the cart, which dropped down by the side of the cart—the prisoner attempted to catch it, but he missed it, and it fell to the ground—I was then about ten yards from the cart, and concealed—I had a full view of the person and face as well as the dress of the prisoner—I ran up to him while he was stooping to pick up the sack, and I said, "Stop, you are my prisoner"—he left the sack, ran away, and escaped—I turned the two trusses of straw round the cor<lb/>ner, so as to have them in my sight, and I told the man who was on the cart to surrender, he was my prisoner, but he slipped down by the aide of the cart, and ran off—I observed that the ropes of the straw-cart were loose—after some time I took the straw and the sack of beans to the station-house, and then went to London in pursuit of the man—I came to London, and was going back, when I found the prisoner, who was going from London—I said to him, "You are my prisoner; you are the man who escaped from me this morning"—he said nothing to me—I am perfectly sure that he is the man—I saw the trusses of straw that I speak of, and the beans, shown to Mr. Wilshin on the Monday following."</p>

I was on my rounds on the evening of the 23rd of January, at half-past six o'clock, near the Mermaid tavern, at Hackney—I went into a privy, from information, and found the prisoner there and Joseph Massey—I asked them what they were doing there, and they gave me a reason coupled with the place, but I heard some<lb/>thing drop down which sounded to me like glass or a chain—I took them both to the station-house—I returned directly, and found five glass bottles thrown down the privy—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in Weston-street, Penton<lb/>ville. On the 8th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Guildford-street, and saw a baker's barrow at the end of Lamb's Conduit-alone street—the barrow was closed, but it was a baker's barrow, standing—I saw the prisoner walking from Caroline-place up towards Lamb's Conduit-street—he passed by the barrow, and under the wall stood a baker's basket—he took up the basket, and went back to the barrow with it—he seemed to be watching, as though he was looking for somebody or something—this took my attention, and when he got to the barrow he put the basket down, opened the barrow, put his hand in, took out a quantity of bread, and put it in the basket—he did that a second time, and then he went round to the head of the barrow, and took out some more—I cannot tell how many loaves he took in all, I should think about thirteen, which he put into the basket—he then took one more in his hand, and put the basket on his shoulder—he then walked up Lamb's Conduit-street, and went down Great Ormond-street—I was going the same way on busi<lb/>ness, and I went on and met a policeman—I told him my suspicion—I then left them—I am sure the prisoner is the man I left with the basket when I gave information to the policeman.</p>

On the 23rd of January, we had a table outside our house fastened with a cord—about ten minutes before eight o'clock I heard a noise—I went out and saw the prisoner going off with it—I overtook him, and took hold of the table with one hand, and his coat with the other—he put it down and ran off—before he got to the corner of the street he threw off his hat and knot—when he got to the corner he then kicked off his shoes—I caught him, but he got away from me and ran off—I saw him again in about an hour and a half—I said he was the man—he denied it—I asked him to pull his shoes off, which he did, and I felt the bottoms of his stockings were wet, which convinced me that he had been in the mud without shoes—I have no doubt whatever that he is the person.</p>

               <p>Shoreditch. On Friday afternoon, the 24th of January, I was passing in a private road, near the New North-road, at Hoxton—my attention was called to a ditch, and on looking into it, I saw the head of a child lying, with its face upwards—there was very little water in the ditch—it was muddy—the face was partly exposed, and partly covered—it laid sideways—about two or three feet from the head, I saw a newspaper, containing the body of a child—the left arm was off the body, and the head was off also—Mr. Preedy, a medical man, came up, and the head and body were taken to the station-house, by his order—about nine o'clock the evening before I had been near that same spot, and saw <hi rend="italic">a</hi> person two hundred or three hun<lb/>dred yards from the spot—she was going from there, towards the canal—she saw me, and altered her direction, and went towards the spot where the body was afterwards found—she had something in a basket in one hand, and something in a blue bundle in the other—I could not see her face exactly, for her hair was over her face—she appeared in a distressed state—I could not swear to her—the basket she had was just such a one as this <hi rend="italic">—(looking at one</hi>)—it was very dark then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old. I am no relation to the prisoner—I was in the service of Jones and Chatfield, in January, as housemaid—the prisoner was cook—I had been there two months, within two or three days—I slept in the same bed with the prisoner—nobody else slept in the same room—one evening, I do not know the day of the month, my master had a party to tea and supper—I had noticed something par<lb/>ticular about the prisoner before that—we all noticed it—I spoke to her about it about a week before the party—I told her she looked very large, and that she was in the family way—she strongly denied it—on the night of the party she went to bed, about half-past nine or ten o'clock—I went between eleven and twelve o'clock—she was in bed when I went in—a few minutes after I had been in bed, she got out, and exclaimed, "Good God, I cannot lay"—she said nothing else—I did not speak to her—she seemed to be in pain, and very ill—I did not ask her what was the matter, or speak to her at all—I do not know what she did after she got out of bed, but the bed shook very much, and she went out of the room several times—I went to sleep after she went out of the room—she did not go out directly she got out of bed—she stopped near the foot of the bed some time, and then went out—she went out of the room two or three times before I went to sleep—that occupied, I should think, ten minutes, or it might be a little longer—I heard somebody cry, as it sounded to me, like a child—it was similar to a child crying—I have said that I could not tell whether it was the cry of the mother, or the child, exactly, as I would not be positive—I heard this cry, similar to a child—I should say it appeared the cry of the child, more than of the mother—I did not hear her get into bed at all that night again—she was not in bed when I heard the cry—I did not find her in bed when I awoke the following morning—she called me up at our usual time, seven o'clock—she was then up and dressed to the best of my recollection—I believe she did not come into bed at all that night again—there was a frock of mine hanging at the foot of the bed that night—I had occasion to put it on that afternoon—I did not find any thing on it when I put it on, but I went into the shop, and a strange woman called my attention to it—I then found there was a good deal of blood about the back of the frock—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and said it must have been her, as no one else could have done it—she said it was</p>

On the afternoon of Wednesday, the 30th of January, I was in the waiting-room at Worship-street, where the prisoners are placed previous to going before the Magistrate—the prisoner, and the witness Reeve, were there with a policeman—I said to the policeman, "Are these the two parties charged with murder, that Mr. Robinson has in custody?"—he said, "I don't know"—that induced me to say to the two prisoners, "Are you the parties charged with this horrible murder, where the child was found in the ditch?"—the witness Reeve said, in a low tone, but sit<lb/>ting so close, the prisoner must have heard it, "Not me, but" (pointing to the prisoner on the left side) "this one"—the prisoner immediately said, "The policeman charges me with murder, but I am not guilty, for the child was still-born"—she then added, "I put it in the ditch, but its head was not off then"—on the following day I searched her box at Jones and Chatfield's, and found some linen and articles, which appeared to have been recently washed—I found no preparation for the birth of a child—there were several aprons, which appeared to have been recently washed, they—were rolled up, and put away quite wet, there was no baby-linen whatever—in the prisoner's bed-room there appeared to be a stain of blood on the wall of the chimney, which is close to a little sideboard—the bed had been taken down when I was there, but the foot of the bed must have come towards that part where the blood was—I think Mr. Chatfield staled to me where the bed had been—the stain was, I suppose, two feet eight, or three feet from the ground—it was not done by a bloody hand—it appeared to have run down from a small sideboard in the recess, as if something bloody had been put on the sideboard.</p>

On the 24th of January I was passing by the New North-road, Hoxton—my attention was called to part of the body of a child found in a ditch—I delivered it to the policeman No. 121—it was the trunk, with the exception of the left arm, and the head, which was detached—I desired it to be taken to the station-house, but it was taken to the house of Mr. Coward, a surgeon, in the neighbourhood—I afterwards saw an arm fitted to the body, and the head, and am decidedly of opinion it all formed one body—I have no doubt at all of it—it was perfectly fresh—it might have been dead a few days—I think decomposition does not go on so rapidly with new-born children as others—my impression is that the arm was taken off by a sharp instrument—the tearing an arm of a child off would be attended with some difficulty, but would not be very difficult after decapitation—I am certain that both the head and arm were separated by a sharp instrument—there was a divi<lb/>sion of the cartilage by a sharp instrument—the decapitation took place after death decidedly—both had evidently been severed after death—I noticed a contusion on both sides of the head, on the parietal bone, and on the temporal or frontal bone on the left side—I was enabled to make a more minute examination afterwards at Mr. Coward's—I have no doubt those contusions were inflicted during the life of the child—that is my opinion as to all the contusions I observed about the head—there were dark blue and black appearances externally, ecchymosis—I thought I could feel extravasation—that is, it was given during the circulation of the blood—there was also a bruise on both sides of the body, and slight ecchymosis spots on different parts—I confined my observation more particularly to the head—on the following day the body was opened by Mr. Coward and myself, and on a subsequent day Mr. Leeson was present—I opened the head, and found very great extravasation between the scalp and the bone, and a further extravasation on the brain—I examined the bones of the</p>

               <p>head, and found both the parietal bones, the temporal right side, and the frontal bone on the left side fractured—that appeared to have been produced by the external violence the child had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I dare say you have known instances of children delivered without assistance being given to the woman, and the child falling on a hard substance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A child might receive a fracture of the skull from something of that sort very possibly, presuming the woman to be standing in an erect position—assuming the prisoner to have been delivered of the child, and it having fallen on the hearth-stone or boards, the skull might possibly be fractured in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think such an occurrence would satisfactorily account for all the appearances of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I do not think that would fracture the several bones that were fractured—it is pos<lb/>sible, but not probable—I think it possible if she had dropped the child twice it might account for the fractured bones, but it is pot probable—I proceeded to open the chest—the lungs were not at all decomposed—I took them out and put them in water, and they floated—I should imagine from the general appearance of the lungs that they had been properly inflated—I have heard of children living two or three days and not having their lungs thoroughly inflated, but never knew of such a case—these appeared thoroughly inflated—there have been cases where the child has respired, and yet died before it left the mother—that is very common—it might be from the pressure on the umbilical cord, the weakness of the child, and other causes—I should rather doubt the circumstance of the lungs being inflated being a certain test that the child was born alive—the hydrostatic test may have been a good deal blown upon, but I still have a great opinion of it, not that I should like to stake the life of a fellow-creature on it—I do not think I should rely on that alone—children frequently receive inju<lb/>ries on the head during delivery—I do not think I could refer the injuries I saw to that—it appeared to have arrived at the proper period.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might not the mother, having no assistance, by compres<lb/>sion of her own hands very innocently destroy the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might produce external marks—I imagine that putting her hand round the child's neck during labour, would produce external marks—if it occasioned death, I think the marks of the fingers would be plain—I think if there had been, pressure on the skull at that time, the bones would lap over, but they would resume their position immediately—by the shape of the head I think no extensive pressure was used—I think it rather doubtful whether a fracture would be produced by the woman endeavouring to assist herself by com<lb/>pression of the hand on the skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say it would be possible for a woman taken suddenly in labour, without assistance, in her struggles to deliver herself, to cause the fractures found in this child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by endeavouring to deliver herself—I attribute death to external violence, producing the extravasation of blood on the head—the appearances could not be produced by compression of the hands of the mother—I have not the slightest doubt that the child was born alive—it was decidedly born alive, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean it had undoubtedly respired—the lungs were fully inflated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

               <p>rather in a decomposed state, but it assisted our inquiry, because I imagine that the circulation had been kept up between the mother and child to the time of birth, but that is conjecture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you have had opportunities of witness<lb/>ing a great many deliveries <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I have known instances of self-delivery before assistance could be got, where the parties have been in good circumstances—I have seen cases where the act of parturition has been at<lb/>tended by total absence of mind, but they are not numerous—I have, on one occasion, had under my own notice a mother, in perfectly good circum<lb/>stances, manifesting an eagerness to destroy her child—the mother, in that case, was at times, not in a condition to know what she was about at the time—I had delivered that person myself—I gave the nurse instruction to take the child from her, to prevent the possibility of a repeti<lb/>tion—these things would be just as likely with medical assistance as in self-delivery—the effect of fear and shame, the woman not being married, would, no doubt, have additional effect on the mind, I have HO doubt it might produce almost insanity—the head of the child was not at all decom<lb/>posed when I first saw it—it exhibited slight signs of decomposition externally, when we commenced the internal examination—that was about the face—it was merely discoloration—a child falling down would be one of the means of producing ecchymosis—ecchymosis is a strong proof of vitality, it shows that, at the time of receiving the injury, there was cir<lb/>culation of the blood—it does not show the means by which the violence was inflicted—I do not know that it has been the result of experiment in France, that a new-born child falling from the mother, not more than eight inches, on a hard floor, has almost invaribly fractured the skull, but it is possible—in this case the umbilical cord would be quite long enough to admit of the child falling to the ground—it was unusually long—I should say it was a yard long—supposing the mother to have got out of bed, and stood in a posture to deliver herself, and the child to have fallen on the ground, it would certainly not be unlikely to produce a fracture—it is by no means impossible—if she had stamped her foot on the head in her agony it would have been likely to produce such a result—I do not say it is probable—if she had her shoe on it would be more likely—I think it possible, but not probable—the umbilical cord was not secured in this instance—there is a chance, under those circumstances, of the child bleed<lb/>ing to death, but it is not certain—if left any length of time, the blood is attracted into another channel often—it was broken, I should think, about eight inches from the placenta.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the appearances have been what they were, supposing the child to have died from loss of blood from the umbilical cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police. I was sent for to the station-house by the Inspector, on the 30th of January, and saw the prisoner there—I made an examination of her person—she did not object to it—I ascertained that she had been recently delivered of a child—I asked her if it was not so?—she said "Yes"—I had seen the arm of the child at the station-house—I asked her if the arm of the child I had seen was any portion of the child of which she was delivered—she said "Yes".—I asked her where the other remains of the child were to be found—she said, "where the arm must have been found"—she said the child was still-born—she said she suffered for a considerable time preparatory pains, but that ultimately she was delivered in a short time—I assisted the other gentlemen in the examination of the body—I have heard their evidence, and concur in it to a very great extent—I do not suppose the whole of the fractures being so extensive, could have occurred from the mere circumstance of the child falling on the floor or any hard substance—a portion of them might have occurred so—I should think it improbable, but not impossible, that it might happen by her being delivered on the stairs, and the child falling down several steps.</p>

I found this iron bar in a pocket inside a rough coat he had on—he said, "It is only a piece of old iron I found"—he had the hat produced on his head—I afterwards showed it to Lapthorne, who said it was his—I went to Mr. Nowell's house, and on the bed-room door were marks of some instru<lb/>ment—eleven marks above the lock, and two or three underneath, between the door-post and door—I compared this piece of iron with the marks, and they corresponded—there was something black on every mark there, and on this bar there is black, as if it had been in the fire—Lapthorne described his hat minutely to me before he saw it—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Stan well Mill, near Staines—the prisoner Lane has been in my employ about pine years. I received an order from Mr. Philp for twenty sacks of flour, which were to be delivered on the 2nd of January—there were to be ten sacks of each sort of flour, and some toppings, which is hog's victuals—they left my premises to go to Mr. Philp, on the 2nd of January—there were tea sacks of household flour, and tea of seconds—each sack contained 200lbs. weight of flour, and we usually allow 5lbs. for the sack—I delivered them to Lane myself to take to Mr. Philp, at Hammersmith, and I gave him this delivery ticket (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) on the morning be started—he was to go there that day, and return to me after delivering what is specified on the ticket—on the same evening, a little after six o'clock, Mr. Philp and a friend came to me—Lane came home afterwards, and in consequence of what I had heard from Mr. Philp, I got into the wagon and found in it seven empty sacks, which had come from Mr. Philp's—I sent for Lane, and said that Mr. Philp had been to complain of one sack of flour being deficient—he said when he left Mr. Philp's there was a sack of stuff in the wagon, which a man on Hounslow-heath had asked him to take up in the morn<lb/>ing—I said, "Did you ever see the man before?"—he said, "No"—I said, "What were you to do with it?"—he said, "To leave it at Turn<lb/>floor, ham-green"—I went to Mr. Philp's, and saw there ten sacks of household which I believe were correct as I had sent them—I was shewn ten sacks of second flour, and was satisfied that if there had been any wrong delivery I should be able to know it—I came to one sack, and I said, before I touched it, "There is something wrong in this sack"—I took it to a scale and found it was 26lbs. less in weight than when it left my house—I put my hand in it and found something which I was convinced did not leave my mill—I took a tin scoop, and put a scoop full of it into a sieve and sifted it, and these bits came from it (<hi rend="italic">producing them,</hi>) which I am satisfied never left my mill—I had the whole sack sifted, and found a con<lb/>siderable portion of doughy particles in it, and the flour in the sack was of a very different quality to what went from my mill—the other sacks were ail right—here is the receipt which Lane gave me for having delivered twenty sacks of flour—it is signed by him and Mr. Philp.</p>

               <p>pocket—he did not tell me the name—I expected he had got the ticket—this rather excited my suspicion, and I went into my bakehouse—I found Miller there—he was just going out with some bakings—I asked him where the flour was which the man had brought in—he said there were four sacks in the shop, two in the bakehouse, and the rest in the ware-house—he pointed them out to me, and I saw, to my mind, that there was the number—I was rather dissatisfied, and in half an hour after<lb/>wards I followed Lane to the Coach and Horses, at Turnham-green, kept by the prisoner Buckingham—I saw the wagon drawn close up to the house—there was a sack in the wagon, but no flour in it—when a sack of flour has been emptied, it is the custom of the trade to have the sack turned inside out and well shaken, to get all the flour from it, but the sack had not been shaken nor turned out—perhaps two or three pounds weight of flour will adhere to a sack that has not been shaken—there was flour hanging all about it, and there were empty sacks beside in the wagon—the unshaken sack had the name of Henry Carpenter on it—I went into the public-house, and saw Lane—I asked him what he had done with that sack of flour—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I asked him again to come and look at the sack, empty and unshaken, in the wagon—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he would not come—I asked him, I think, three times—I then went again and looked at the sack—I went home, and the same evening went to Mr. Carpenter, before Lane got home, about six o'clock—I told Mr. Carpenter what I had seen—I was there when Lane came in, about an hour afterwards—I asked what he had done with the sack of flour—he said he knew nothing about it, bat he had had a sack of something given to him on Hounslow-heath to take to Turnham<lb/>green, but he did not know the name of the person he was to take it to—that he took it to my house, and then to the public-house, left it there, and did not know what became of it—the next day Mr. Carpenter came to my house, and we examined the flour—there were ten sacks of household flour, and ten of seconds—the household flour was all right, but there were twenty-six and a half pounds weight deficient in one of the sacks of se<lb/>conds—on the day the flour was delivered, there was no person on my premises but Miller, and about half an hour would have been a reasonable time to have taken in that quantity—one man could not have filled an empty sack, it must have required two persons, one to hold whilst the other filled—I have a half-bushel measure that I use for the purpose of filling a sack—that would have required more time than delivering twenty sacks—I went to Mrs. Buckingham again the next day—I told her I was come on a very unpleasant business, and asked her if she would give me a sample of flour that was in her pantry—I said I did not like to pay for twenty sacks when I had only nineteen—a great many words passed between us, and, at last, she granted me leave to take a sample—I found in the pantry about a bushel of flour in a sack, or rather more—I took a sample from it—I requested her to come into the pantry, and see me take it, but she would not—I submitted that sample of flour to Mr. Carpenter—on the day before the flour came from Mr. Carpenter, I had examined my stock, and observed one sack of flour which had had a mouse-hole in it—I put my finger in the hole, and felt some dirt in it—on the 3rd of January I missed about three parts of the flour out of that sack—I asked Miller if he had sifted it—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you find any thing in it?"—he said "No"—he could not have sifted it without finding this dirt in it—</p>

The prisoner came to the shop on the 18th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, and asked if I had a pair of shoes to fit her—I shewed her a pair, which were hanging outside—they fitted, and we agreed about them—she went away, and in about an hour returned and asked if I had a pair of boots to fit her—I showed her three pairs, but they did not suit—she asked if I had any more—I said "No,"—she had not been gone two minutes before I missed a linen shift from the counter—the next morning she came about ten o'clock, and asked if I would change the shoes that she had bought the night before, as they were too tight—I said I had not got any more—I then saw her put some cotton down from the counter and watched her—I went to the end of the shop,</p>

I knew the deceased, William Poole, he was nearly seventy years old—on Thursday, the 27th of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was near the station-house, at Old Brentford, and saw a chaise coming along with two persons in it—it was rather a moonlight night, but cloudy—I saw Poole step into the road to cross—I and two or three more hal<lb/>looed to him directly we saw the chaise coming—it was going, as near as I can tell, at the rate of sixteen miles an hour—it was galloping at times—I saw the horse knock Poole down, and the wheel went over him—one of the persons in the chaise looked back, and the other who was driving whipped the horse two or three times—I cannot say which was driving—I should think he could see what had happened, by the light that was there—he whipped the horse two or three times after Poole fell—we hallooed to him to stop—he did not make any attempt to stop, but went on—I ran to Poole's assistance, and helped to carry him nearer the path—I took him to Mr. Ralph's, the surgeon, and left him in his care—he died on the Sun<lb/>day following—I saw him when he was dead—it was a one-horse open</p>

On Monday, the 7th of January, about twenty minutes after five o'clock, I saw a bay mare, and cart, at the corner of George-street, Bethnal-green—the mare had ail the harness, and the nose-bag on—I saw the prisoner take the nose-bag off, put it in the tail of the cart, and lead the horse away, with the harness on it, down George-street—Shillingford came up in about a quarter of an hour, and I told him I had seen Johnstone take it.</p>

On the 7th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought a bay mare to me, with a collar, hames, and bridle on, and asked me to buy her—I asked what was the matter with her—he said she had fallen down, going up Snow-hill, in a brick-cart, and had almost killed him—he asked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I bid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he took—he took the bridle, collar, and hames off, and took</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bruton, a labourer, who lives at No. 18, Durham-row, Stepney church-yard. On Friday, the 11th of Janu<lb/>ary, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I left my house, leaving nobody in it—I double-locked the door, and took the key with me—the doors and windows were fast—I returned between twelve and one o'clock, and found the door on the single lock—I missed my canary bird out of the cage—a small box had been broken open, and two sovereigns and a guinea taken out, a table spoon, two tea-spoons, seven yards of narrow edging, and half a yard of net—I also missed a pair of boots, two flannel petticoats, some stockings, and three shirts—I complained to the officer, and found the prisoner at the station-house about two o'clock that day—he had a very dirty face, and a remarkably clean shirt on, and on looking at it I found it was my husband's shirt, which I had left in the drawer.</p>

On the 7th of February, after I was gone to bed, I heard a noise in the house—I went down, and called out "Hollo"—he made no answer—at last he said, "It's me"—I said, "Who is me?"—he said, "William"—he said he was ill—he was in the scullery—I kicked my foot against a bottle of gin, and asked what it was—he said water—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said he did not know—I found both the windows of the bar unfastened, which I had fastened before I went to bed—he had got in at one window just under a door, and opened the door—I brought the gin away, called in a policeman, and he shewed us the tub he took the gin out of—I found a bottle of rum in the kitchen, and a funnel wrapped up in one of the children's dresses—he had broken the window by falling down, and that disturbed me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Catherine Parry and Sons. We are tallow-chandlers in Fleur-de-lis-court, Spitalfields—Harwood was our errand-boy for about three months—on Friday morning, the 11th of January, our man found a sack in the cellar, which he brought up to me—it had the appearance of having had tallow in it—I desired him to put it where he found it—about five o'clock, Harwood left to go to tea—I followed, with our man—he went into the shop of the prisoner March, in Lamb-street—it is an oil-shop—I went in, and saw Harwood and March there, and the bag which I had seen before, was on the weighing-machine—Har<lb/>wood was taking the money off the counter as I went in, and March was behind the counter—the bag contained thirty-six pounds of Russia tallow—I asked Harwood what he did there—he said he came to buy soap and soda—I pointed to the bag—he then immediately began to cry, and begged I would forgive him, as his father had died that morning, and he did it to buy a coffin—I told March I was surprised he should buy tallow of such a boy</p>

               <p>as that—he made me no answer—he was serving a customer at the time—he asked me to walk into his parlour—I did so, and he told me he bought it in consequence of the boy representing that his father was a pastry-cook, and this was his perquisite, that he said it was dripping, and he bought it for dripping—I said I thought that was impossible, for I remembered him coming to our shop to buy candles, and putting them to his nose to try the quality—I thought he could not make that mistake—I left the shop, and gave Harwood into custody—I went again and saw March—I asked him how much he had of it—he shewed me two casks which had been in his possession—I asked if that was the whole he had got—he said he believed that was the whole—I said he must know if he had any more—he said, no, he believed he had not—Harwood was not there then—Mrs. March came, and asked me to look over the place—I went into the passage, and found another cask—I said "You forgot this"—he said "Yes, I had forgotten that"—I asked him what he had given the boy for it—he said 21/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, as dripping—I said that was a very inferior price, as we were giving, for common kitchen-stuff, 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt—I told him it cost us 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., which would be about 61/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—I then took March into custody—there was about 21/2 cwt. altogether in the three casks—I believe it to be my tallow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Broad-street. On the 15th of November I paid the prisoner five shillings on account of his master, Mr. Griffiths—I have his receipt here—I saw him write it—I knew it was the custom to give printed receipts—I looked at this receipt when he gave it me—I forget the words I made use of, but I know the prisoner said, "I have given you this on a blank piece of paper, as I have not any printed receipts with me," and he said, "I am a partner with Mr. Griffiths."</p>

                  </hi>. In December last I was in the service of Mr. Hill, a town-carman, and drove one of his carts—I went out daily, and took a stand among other carts, to be hired—I was standing in Thames-street, on the 4th of December, and saw the prisoner Vincent in Thames-street—I had known him before—it was about eleven o'clock, as near as I can guess—I had been doing a little job for a gentleman in Thames-street, and had some beer with five or six others, at the Lion and Key—Vincent was there—I saw him again about half an hour after—he said he had got some friends coming down for twenty casks of butter, and as I had nothing to do would I do it—I asked him whether it was Priestley's work (Priestley is a master carman, who generally does the butter work)—he said, "No," it was not Priestley's—he went away then for about a quarter of an hour, then returned, and gave me a note—he said there was twenty tubs of butter all ready to put into the cart, in the new warehouse, and they <hi rend="italic">knowed</hi> about them—he did not mention Barber's quay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this, is it the order ho gave you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, because I never opened it—it was doubled up like this—I can read writing a little—when we had this conversation we were close to one part of Mr. Barber's warehouses—the warehouse I received the butter at is called the New warehouse, because it has been lately built—I went there—I did not take my cart at first—I gave the order to a young man there—he went and showed it to Mr. Murphy, in the warehouse—Murphy told him to go to the counting-house and show it, which was done—the young man came back, and said I might have the twenty tubs, I am pretty sure he said twenty tubs—I went and fetched my cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was Vincent when you went with your horse and cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was in Thames-street at the time, he was ten or twelve yards from the warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I brought the horse and cart to the warehouse, he stood about the same distance—the twenty tubs were put into the cart—I saw Vincent while the cart was loading—he stood close against the tail of the cart—I had some mats over the horse and on the copse of the cart—when the butter was put in, Vincent got to the off-side of the cart, and moved the mats more back into the cart, which would partly cover the tubs, but not all—my master then came up to me, and asked where I was going—I told him—I then proceeded with the cart over Tower-hill—Vincent ordered me to take the road to Whitechapel—he kept on the near side of the way—he walked on the path, and I rode on the near side of the cart—I went on till I got near Whitechapel-church—I saw Vincent most all the way, and I found him there when I got there—he asked, by Whitechapel-church, if I had got money to pay the toll—I said</p>

               <p>"No"<lb/>he said he would get some—he then left me—he kept on, and spoke to some man going along—I cannot say who it was, as his back was towards me—I lost sight of him for some time—I went on to Mile-end-gate, and stopped at Mr. Man's, a little brewhouse, and called for halt a pint of beer—Vincent came up and said, "Make it a pint of beer"—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the toll, and told me to go to the King's Arms, down the road—I went—he kept on walking—when I got to the King's Arms Vincent went in—he came out again, and said the parties were not there—we had some beer there, and dined—we staid there an hour and a half, or from that to two hours—while there a man named Roberts came up and joined Vincent—Roberts lived in North-street, Whitechapel, and kept a <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry-shop,</hi> a beer-shop and chandler's-shop—I said that I was stopping there too long, and told Vincent I was squandering my time, I wanted to get back again—Vincent came out again—Roberts was outside and spoke to him—we turned round, and went down a lane at the side of this pub<lb/>lic-house—it might be a quarter of a mile up that lane—we stopped at a public-house there—Vincent and Roberts were there—I saw two more men there—I knew one of them by sight—it was neither of the pri<lb/>soners—I saw a van near that public-house, with one horse in it—nothing was done with the butter there—the van drove away—Vincent and they all went away with the van and left me there—and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes Vincent came back, and told me to go on—he got on the cart itself, and drove it down another turning out of the lane, and there I found a van—I cannot say whether it was the same—Vincent and Roberts moved the butter out of my cart into the van, and drove on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the turning they went down take them out of sight of the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was one horse in the van, I think—I did not assist to move the butter into the van—I did the ropes up—Roberts and the two men went off with the van—it was about one hundred yards from the public-house—Vincent remained with me—I spoke about the money just before the van went, and Roberts told Vincent to pay me—after the van was gone, Vincent told me, as we came along, if they asked me where the butter went, to say it went in a van with four horses—he returned with me in my cart—we did not stop any where till we got to Roberts's house, in North-street—I went in there, and called for a pint of beer, and Vincent went into the chandler's-shop side—he came outside after that, and paid me a sovereign—the proper charge for the cart was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said I was to give my master the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for my<lb/>self—I gave my master 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and kept 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we came into Whitechapel-road afterwards, and had a quartern and a half of rum—I kept 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., had the rum, and gave Vincent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told my matter the butter was put into a van with four horses.</p>

               <p>warehouse before—I had been to Barber's concern, and removed butter for Priestley, the town carman, when he was busy, four or five times—I am well known there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Vincent tell you nothing about the butter more than to go and take it away by virtue of that note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nobody heard him give me the order that I know of—there was no other carman by, I know—I went into the warehouse out of Vincent's sight, and there got the butter, which I brought out, and <hi rend="italic">put</hi> in the cart—he was about ten or twelve yards from me in the street when the butter was being delivered—Mr. Barber's people put it into the cart, I did not—I did not point out Vincent to them as having any thing to do with it—they did not ask any thing about it—I gave them the note, and they gave me the butter—they saw nothing of Vincent that I know of—when I drove off he walked on the off side of the cart on to Tower-hill—he then got on the pavement and walked on—I did not see him speak to any body there—I had often drank with him—It was about a mile from the warehouse that we had been when he said, "Make it a pint"—there were plenty of people there, but nobody that I knew—I did not ask where the butter was going to—Vincent did not tell me—I stated that it was a four-horse van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after the transaction did you hear of it again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About an hour after—my master said Mr. Barber wanted to see me—I went to him and told him I took it down Whitechapel-road, and put it into a van with four horses—I did not then tell him who employed me—I did after<lb/>wards—I did not then know why he was inquiring about it, or that it was stolen not till he said it was a forged order—he said so then—I did not then tell him Vincent had employed me—they took me up, and put me in the Compter—I was taken before the Lord Mayor two or three days after—I was in custody during that time, but nobody came to me that I could mention about Vincent to—I did not tell the officer who took me to the Mansion-house, of Vincent, nor the Lord Mayor, because the Lord Mayor asked me no questions—I was remanded—I was at the Compter from Friday till Monday, and then went to Lambeth-street—I then told about Vincent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard in the meantime that any body else had been taken up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was committed as a witness—I was never in prison before on any charge of felony, only for a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I was in the service of Mr. Thomas Bailey, as carman—I left'on account of a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the fore<lb/>man, and he accused me of stealing some silk—Mr. Bailey did not dis<lb/>charge me, it was the foreman—I was not discharged from any other ser<lb/>vice in the same manner—Mr. Hill pays me weekly, unless I have money in the course of the week—I have frequently kept money back in the course of the week, which is taken out of my wages on Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were your wages under stoppage at any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the time I buried my wife—he lent me some money, I took a little more, and it was stopped at so much a week—I gave Vincent the shilling for giving me the job, it is always usual—we always get something, and if any body is with us we always give them something—it did not occur to me that this was an ir<lb/>regular transaction at first, till Mr. Barber mentioned it—I thought it very queer when Vincent mentioned about the four horses, but not till then—I did not mention about it till eight days afterwards—I told my master it was a van and four horses that took it away—I described the person who employed me as a stout man—I did not give his name—I did not give a</p>

On Friday, the 7th of December, Sutcliffe made a communication to me, and I procured Shelswell and Taylor—I went in to Sutcliffe's while Shelswell and Taylor remained outside—I went into the warehouse at the back of the shop, and saw a cask of butter covered over with a sack—there was no head on it, nor any top hoops—I saw the place where the dairy mark ought to have been was cut out—while I was there Christall came in and spoke to Sut<lb/>cliffe—Hopkins also came in, took the cask in his arms, took it out, and put it into the truck—that was while Christall was talking to Mr. Sut<lb/>cliffe—Hopkins had drawn up with the truck as Christall came in—I came out, and gave notice to Shelswell, and he and Taylor went down Red Lion-street, following Hopkins—I afterwards went to Toy's, after borrowing a great coat of Mr. Sutcliffe, that I might not be known—Toy was not at home—he came in in seven or eight minutes with a butter-knife in his hand—it was a regular knife for drawing samples of butter—I asked him what he wanted of a butter-knife—he said he had borrowed it of Mr. Jarvis—I knew Toy before, and that he had one child—I asked him if he was aware my employers had been defrauded of twenty casks of butter, and asked him if he knew any thing respecting these butters—he said he knew nothing at all about them—I then told him, I had received information from Mr. Sutcliffe that there were some more casks in or near his premises—he said he knew nothing at all about them—I told him there had been two men stopped, offering a cask of butter for sale, and if he did know any thing I begged of him to tell me—he then said he did know, but he would not tell me, for if he did he should get other people into trouble—I never said, "Never mind other people, look to yourself, you have got a wife and family"—he then said he did know, but he would not tell me—I told him he must take his chance then.</p>

However, I hope things will be better with you; yet I must be candid enough to say that we have all had a jolly laugh at your expenes. Mr. Jones, begs to be very kindly remembered to you, and at the same time he hopes that you will not be so far forgetful as to leave his shirts in the Isle of Wight; don't forget to take your regular dose, for Jones is very uneasy about your welfare. Wishing that you may receive this safe, and that it may be of service, I am yours truly, F. TOY."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ilford, in Essex. A man named Hawkes lodged in my house, but I do not know that it was the prisoner—I never saw him myself till he was at Worship-street—on the 19th of January, between five and six o'clock, I lost the articles stated, and saw them at Spitalfields station-house on the 21st.</p>

On the 19th of January, about four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Lamb-street, Spitalfields, with a bag—I asked what he had got—he said some linen and other articles—I asked where he brought them from—he said from Ilford, in Essex, and was going to sell them; that he was out of work and wanted victuals—I asked if the linen was marked—he said, "No"—I looked at the linen, and found it was marked "M.

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to William John Clements, a hair<lb/>dresser, at Lewisham, about 150 yards from Mr. Dubois. On the 26th of December, about half-past eight or near nine o'clock at night, I came down stairs, and caught the prisoner at the sash of my master's window with one hand up to his right hand pocket, and the other hand in the window up to the elbow—I asked him what he wanted—he said, nothing, but held his head down, walked to the door, and ran—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief"—he got away—I missed about half an ounce of tobacco out of a jar, and some cigars from the window, also a pair of scissors and some razors—I found some cigars on the floor—I had seen the scissors at two o'clock that afternoon—the prisoner was in a situation to have taken the things—he did not ask to buy any thing, but ran out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, in the employ of Henry Simmons, who has a little house near the cage, in the Greenwich-road. On Monday morning, about seven o'clock, when I went to work, I missed some horse-shoes off some pegs in the workshop, under a window, which I had seen safe on Saturday afternoon, when I left work—the wire-work which had been nailed over the window was torn away sufficiently to get a hand in, and the frame-work broken in—the glass had been broken before, and the wire was put to prevent a hand being put in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Foster's Defence.</hi> On Thursday evening, about ten o'clock, I went into the King's Arms public-house in Kent-street, kept by Mr. Clark—I remained there till half-past three o'clock in the morning—I then came out, and went to the public-house where sergeant Featherton says he saw me at four o'clock—the doors were not open till a few minutes after four o'clock—there were some scavengers and several working men waiting there to get something to drink—I went in and staid there till half-past five o'clock, when Lambert and Donovan came in, and asked me to have something to drink—we had something, and soon after Lambert asked me if I would get him a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to see him home—I got him one, and we rode as far as Unicorn-square, where Lambert's sister lives—he went in there, and came out again while Donovan and I were waiting outside—he said, "I shall not stop at home"—I told him he had better, as he was very <hi rend="italic">fresh,</hi> and he would only get drinking, and if he had a shilling or two to take care of them—nothing would persuade him, and while we were talking, the policeman came up, and said they were his prisoners—they did not offer to take me, but took the other two—I walked four or five hundred yards along with them, and while they were searching Lambert and Donovan, I went into a public-house and had a glass of gin—I then went home to my landlady—I told her that Lambert and Jones were taken up while I was talking to them at their door, and I thought they would come and take me, so I would save them the trouble, and go and give myself up—I had a cup of coffee, and pulled off my coat, for I had been to the station-house several times before, and they knew I was rather a roughish customer—I went and gave my<lb/>self up—I have written several times to the landlord of the public-house in which I was until half-past three o'clock, but he will not come, because he is afraid of being fined for having his house open—if you will give me time to subpoena him, I could make him come and speak the truth—I do not mean to say I was not in the prisoner's company, but I am as innocent of the charge as a child unborn—I wish to ask Woodhouse whether he did not go and inquire where I was at the time the robbery was committed—he promised me he would.</p>

I have known the prisoner eighteen or twenty years—we were in the habit of visiting each other—her husband holds a respectable situation in Doctor's-commons—on Monday, the 14th of January, I changed a cheque at Barclay's bank—my landlady was with me, and she took the money, all but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which she gave me—the money was a £10 note, three £5 notes, and a sovereign—after I got home, I paid my landlady the £10 note, and two of the £5 notes—I put the sovereign into the other £5 note, and put them together into my purse, which I put into my pocket—I afterwards put it into my table-drawer in my front room—the drawer was not locked—that was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was in my room at the time—she came about four o'clock, and drank tea with me—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a broker's assistant. On the 21st of January I was employed by Mr. Turner, of Friar-street, Blackfriars-road, to make a distress on the prisoner's premises, No. 2, Hebden-court, Pearl-row. Blackfriars-road—I went there about half-past two o'clock in the after<lb/>noon—I met Prettyman the landlord at the door—the prisoner was only a tenant—I sent the landlord up first, and then went in myself—I went up to the prisoner's room, and found him sitting on a stool at work, conversing with the landlord—he is a shoemaker—the landlord was saying to him, "I wish you to settle this little thing without putting me to the trouble of putting a distress on your goods—I wish you to do it"—the prisoner said he had no money to settle it—I then said to the prisoner that a duty would devolve on me which I was very reluctant to perform on a man in his situation, but without he and the landlord could settle it, I was there with a warrant to distrain his goods—I held the warrant in my hand, and showed it to him—on my doing so, he said, "You are not going to rob my poor children of my poor bits of things?"—I said, I was very sorry, but I had a duty to per<lb/>form which I could not help—he immediately turned round to the left side of him, and snatched a knife from the seat on which he was at work—it was such a knife as shoemakers use—he rose up from his seat, swore a tremendous oath, and requested me to leave the room, holding the knife up in an attitude to plunge it at me—I said, "My good man, do lay such a dangerous instrument as that down, I have not come here to do you any harm"—I requested him two or three times to lay it down—he then turned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040272"/>
               <p>to his seat again, and snatched up a hammer—in the interim I looked round to get something—I saw a child's cradle, and just as he was coming forward to strike me with the knife, I got it up and put it between us—he got hold of the other side of the cradle, lifted it up, and instantaneously sprang under the cradle, and made a plunge at me—I put my arm down to keep the knife from my side, and received it just above my elbow—it was a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> under the cradle—I did not know the knife had entered my arm at the moment, till I perceived the blood flow—I then immediately felt a pricking pain—I turned the cradle round, and said—"You have committed a very serious act upon me,"—he made no reply—I moved the cradle round, went and seized him by the shoulder and the back of his trowsers, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him out of the room, and shut the door against him—I did not observe what he did with the knife—he came back again after I had closed the door, and requested to have his coat—I opened the door a little way, and perceiving he had not the knife or hammer, I allowed him to take his coat—he was in the act of going—I said he had no occasion to go, I should certainly give him into custody—he went away—I followed him, and he made a sudden rush into a house to escape—I went after him—a lad went for a policeman, who came, and I saw the prisoner taken in a water<lb/>closet, about twenty minutes after I had received the stab—I did not hear precisely what he said to the policeman, as the person in the house rescued him from me, but he said it was a very bad job, or something like it—Mr. Staddon, the doctor, has attended me—I was obliged to have my arm laid open—I am not well now, but am getting better.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William Kingston, we are linen-drapers, and live in Westminster Bridge-road. The prisoner was our porter—be came on the 1st of December, and, as I understood, he was in very bad circumstances—we received information which lad us to sus<lb/>pect him, and on the evening of Monday, the 4th of February, I placed myself at a skylight from which I could have a view of that part of the shop where he and the other porter slept together—I went about eleven o'clock at night, and when I had been there some the minutes, I saw the other porter leave his bed-side, and go down stairs—I then saw the pri<lb/>soner go to a distant part of the warehouse to the shawl department—he returned with something under his arm—I saw the black fringe on his white shirt, and it appeared to me to be shawls which he had—he stooped down, folded up the shawls, and seemed to have great difficulty in getting them in somewhere, I fancy it was into a pocket—I went to the station-house, and requested the assistance of an officer, and at seven o'clock the next morning the officer came to our shop, and took him into custody<lb/>Mayor, our clerk, went down, and fetched up the prisoner's coat—I asked the prisoner if it was his—he said "Yes," and if he had had it that morn<lb/>ing—he said "Yes"—the policeman took these two shawls out of the pocket of that coat.</p>
