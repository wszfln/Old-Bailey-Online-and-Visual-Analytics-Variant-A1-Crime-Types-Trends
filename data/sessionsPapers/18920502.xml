Lovell on 13th November—there is no entry of £4 7s. 4d., received from G.

J. P., dated; it is a London account—exhibit "E" is a cheque for £4 7s. 4d.; the endorsement on that is the prisoner's writing—exhibit "F" is a receipt given to Mr. Greenberg; that is in the prisoner's handwriting—he has never accounted for either of these <hi rend="smallCaps">SUF</hi>;—I have the balance-sheet of 13th November—the £4 7s. 4d. has been taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of proceedings in prisoner's bankruptcy; the petition is dated 6th June, 1891; the adjudication was on 1st July—an order was made under Section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act, for appointing the Official Receiver trustee on 26th June; the summary order was on 3rd July—there were twenty unsecured creditors; the total liabilities were £1,563; there was a cash account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cash account is on the file—I see in that account on April 20th a sum of £90 as received by the debtor from H. S. Haimsohn for flour; on 27th, £22 received from 8. Berlinski for van and pony; this cash account was supplied by the bankrupt; he filed it on 9th October, 1891; it commences on 1st January, 1891—he charges himself with the receipt of £9 from J. Dickson for books on 27th April; and on the same date with £14 from H. s. Haimsohn, of Pelham Street, on account, and with £54 lis. 3d. from D. Frost, for flour—on the other side of the cash account he shows the disbursements he made; I have the Official Receiver's report—on 27th he pays £17 18s. 6d. to Messrs. Sache and Howard for flour, monthly instalment of £3 to P. Mumford, £25 to Lavine as repayment of a loan; £8 10s. to J. Cohen, repayment of a loan; H. Levin £8, repayment of a loan; N. Frost £10, repayment of a loan—£21 to H. S. Haimsohn is not on 27th—at the end of the Official Receiver's report upon the bankrupt's application for discharge, on 27th January, 1892, it stated that the bankrupt has offered the Official Receiver all the information and assistance that was required—the petitioning creditor was the next friend of the child who was injured, Goodman Davis.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205020006"/>
               <p>appointed official trustee in this bankruptcy—an order of summary administration, which applies to small bankrupts, was made on 3rd July, and it was not necessary to appoint another Official Receiver unless by order of the Court—every bankrupt at the time of the making the receiving order is directed to bring in his books—the books he brought in consisted of ledger, day-book, cash-book, and banker's pass-book—subsequently a cash account was filed on 8th October—the bankrupt's public examination was begun on 25th August; it was adjourned for the purpose of the preparation of the cash account and goods account ordered by the Court—the bankrupt was examined at considerable length; he was asked as to his financial position, and as to what he had done with his property—the ledger appears not to be posted up—in the cash-book on 20th April appears an entry of £90 from H: S. Haimsohn, and opposite the name are words I take to be "a favour"; they have been struck through with a pen—I have noticed those words "a favour" frequently occurring; it means a short loan without interest, as distinguished from a more formal loan for security—the item appears in the cash account, which was filed as "H. S. Haimsohn, £90 flour on 20th April"—there are a great number of items referring to loans in the book, there are several items between the prisoner and H. S. Haimsohn—I find D. Frost and N. Frost there; two different persons—there are dealings, as shown by these accounts, down to the beginning of June; the cash account goes on for some time—the day-book stops in April, but there are items on the account subsequently filed—the goods account goes down to 1st July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are entries in the books of money received as favour money, and after a short interval of the repayment of the money—there was receipt of money in that way from H. Lavine, J. Cohen, and the Frosts—the petition was by the judgment creditors, the next friend of the child, and the child, who are jointly named in the petition, I think—no complaint of any kind has been made against the prisoner by his trade creditors; I think there is nothing exceptional in the way of opposition by the trade creditors—no doubt before the accident happened to the child the prisoner had been in pecuniary difficulties, and was paying two large flour merchants, Peter Mumford and Seth Taylor, by monthly instalments; but I cannot answer definitely as to his paying instalments—there are several items of the same amount, which rather implies that they are instalments—the prosecution took its origin from the Ike of examination taken on the public examination of the prisoner in August—I believe the prisoner was examined by Mr. Myers, the solicitor to the petitioning creditor and to the plaintiff in the action—the difference between a bag and sack of flour was discussed considerably, and I think it turned out that a bag is half a sack—the prisoner has admitted throughout the fact that he disposed of his property—there are very numerous items under the heading of "favour money"—the cash account shows several items on 27th April, which are described as loans—in the banker's pass-book there are payments in on April 20th of £126 and £27—the counterfoil slip contains items of £90 and other amounts, making up the £126—on the 20th find him by the cash account making payment to Sache and Howard, flour dealers, of £35 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a payment to Walker and Co., flour dealers; on the 21st payments of £9 12s. 6d. to N.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205020007"/>
               <p>on the 22nd £20 3s. 4d. to S. and L. Howard for flour, and a monthly instalment of £3 to Mumford—on the 25th to N. Pomfrey for the expenses of the action £20—there is no payment entered in the cash account of £27 to Frank Hutchinson, the flour, merchant, about that date; in the banker's pass-book on 24th there is "Hutchinson £27 4s. 2d."—losses and depreciation are mentioned in the prisoner's statements, but the immediate cause of his bankruptcy was clearly this judgment—I am not sure if he has been pecuniarily assisted since his bankruptcy by some of his trade creditors—an offer was made of £50 as compensation to this child; I don't know if it was made by a creditor or a friend; I believe a suggestion was made of something to be done—a prosecution once instituted is taken up by the Treasury as a matter of course, and there is no discretion about it if the Court of Bankruptcy has made the order—the Official Receiver, in his report on an application for the bankrupt's discharge, which is now pending, reported that he had received every assistance from the debtor—there is no doubt about the prisoner having been clearly insolvent before the action was decided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This appears to be a copy of the judgment in the action, £425—the Official Receiver moves the Bankruptcy Court, which considers the file of proceedings, and makes such an order as it thinks proper—I ibid in the receipts, Judah Cohen, a favour, £8 10s. on 21st April; H. Lavine, £8 on 21st April; Frost, £10 on 22nd; £25, H. S. Haimsohn; there are several small sums distributed over a time—I have been through the books, and find these flour transactions in the day-book in the ordinary way.</p>

               <p>I have a verdict against this man for the sum of £425"—he said he had bought these goods of his father, and I remarked that it was very strange, as he is not in the flour business at all; the son said, in answer, I am going into the flour business now," and he produced a receipt for £114—it was dated 25th April when I saw it, I am sure—it was a, receipt like this, dated 25th April, for the same amount as this—the inspector said, in the prisoner's presence, "I will give you assistance to watch where the goods are going to"—he asked the prisoner's son where the goods were going to; he said, "No. 21, Whitechapel Road"—the inspector said, "I should not advise you to move these goods so late at night, it being already eleven o'clock on Saturday night"—he said, "I can do as I like with my own goods"—instead of the goods being removed on Saturday night to 21, Whitechapel Road, they were taken to 56, Leman Street, a fancy box factory—the name of N. Lavine is up there—it is not and never has been a flour warehouse—when it was unloaded there the carman and I were there—next day, Sunday, 26th April, I came round about ten o'clock to Tenter Street, and saw the van being loaded up again with thirty-six sacks, right up to the brim; it started about eleven, and went to Leman Street, to the same place as the night before—it unloaded, went back to Tenter Street; it was loaded again with eighteen very large sacks, which went to 21, Whitechapel Road, a shipping agency and foreign money exchange, carried on by the prisoner's son—the second loading was over about twelve o'clock—then the van went back, and was loaded up with seventeen large sacks and two bags, which went to the son's place, 21, Whitechapel Road, and was unloaded there and placed in a cellar among a lot of bricks and rubbish—then the van went back again—it must have been about three o'clock when I returned again—my brother was with me all the time—a third load went to the Whitechapel Road, three went there and one to Leman Street—later in the day I was in Tenter Street again; when they had finished loading for Whitechapel Road the carman took an interval of about an hour and a half, and between five and six o'clock he started loading again, and a very big load was taken down Tenter Street into Levy's yard, occupied by Levy as stabling—only Mr. Levy was there; he is a carman and coke merchant—the sacks were unloaded there; the van returned again in two hours, and loaded up again, and went to the same place—by the time they were finished it was quite dark; it would be a little after eight—on the Saturday night the van and two horses were stabled in the prisoner's stable in Tenter Street, and on Monday they were stabled at oxen Square, at Burnell's stables—early on the Monday morning I was in Tenter Street; I was called away, and I left my brother there—late that evening I saw the cart coming back with a different name, Bellinski, painted on the side; it went to Burnell's—later on I again saw the van; it then had the name of B. Haimsohn by the side of thewheel—I only know the prisoner's son by sight—as I have been in the same neighbourhood all my life I know his business is that of a shipping agent and foreign money exchanger; he is at Whitechapel Road now—I was in Court on the day of the trial—the prisoner and his son were there—they were together before they went into Court, and they went away together.</p>

               <p>Police-court—I should say it was the same, bat when I saw it there it was dated 25th, and I suggested that the 25th has been altered to 20th—I knew the Haimsohns by sight in their business—I was never introduced to the prisoner—I was convinced he was a man in a substantial way of business, and I thought when the accident happened he could make substantial provision for the child, and pay a substantial sum—I knew nothing about his having made arrangements at that time to pay some of his trade creditors so much a month—he never told me that he was not to blame with regard to the accident which happened when his man was out with the van on a Sunday—the prisoner was not present then—the child was four years old, and it was playing on the kerb when its limbs were crushed by the van—the prisoner offered to give me £50 I could not accept that, not because I believed him to be a man in a substantial position, but because I considered it was no substantial recompense for the way the child was afflicted for life—I was sure he was in a substantial way of business; I had made inquiries—I have not seen any of his creditors—I was the petitioning creditor—throughout the bankruptcy I was represented by Mr. Myers, the same solicitor who had appeared in the action—he was present at all the examinations—I was; there, and saw the moving of the flour, but the prisoner could not see me—I went to the Police-station—I said to the inspector, "These are our Jewish Passover holidays," and the defendant considers himself a strict Jew, and it is a strict rule in our religion that during the nine days Passover there is no dealing in flour; I am a Jew myself, and I keep the holidays as such.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am living at the First Avenue Hotel—on Thursday night I was in Oxford Street and met Braun, and I went home with her to the Charing Cross Road—I remained there perhaps' a quarter of an hour—when we got into the room the door looked as if it was locked or shut, I tried to see whether it was so—in my pocket-book I had a £1,000 note, five £100 notes, and four £5 notes—when I was in bed I heard some sort of noise at the door—there were two gas burners alight—my clothes I had hung up on hooks on the door—the bed was a canopy bed, and was on the right-hand side of the door lengthways. (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant Merritt produced a rough plan of the room at</hi> 137, <hi rend="italic">Charing Cross Road</hi>)—this plan represents the position and shape of the bed and canopy—there was a mirror close to the door on the left-hand side—above the lock there was a bolt; whether it was open or not I cannot—before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205020015"/>
               <p>Braun came to bed she went to the door—afterwards, while I was dressing, a knock came to the door, and she went out of the room—when she came back I asked her what it was all about, and she said, "Oh, the woman only came to ask whether you wanted any coffee"—she was out a minute or so—I finished dressing and went out into the street; Braun accompanied me downstairs—I dressed near the door without looking at the mirror—when I had got outside and had walked a little distance the noise I had heard came back to my mind, and I immediately opened the pocket-book to see if I had everything safe—the pocket-book was in the inner pocket of my coat—I found that the £1,000 note and four £5 notes had gone, and that I had lost £1,020—I went to the corner, where I saw a policeman, who took me to the station-house, and I went with him to a house where I believed it had happened; at first I made a mistake and selected the house next to it, but I found out the mistake, and we went to the right house and searched it—I had not been drinking that night at all—the police-knocked at the door very loudly, but nobody came to open it at first, and then at last the landlady of the place was fetched, who took us round through the shop into the house—I searched the place; nothing was found—I received information afterwards at the hotel that the money had been found, and I afterwards saw the notes at the Police-station—when I returned to the room the bed had been put across, as it is in the plan, and the canopy had been pulled down; the whole room was arranged, no doubt, for the purpose of making it unrecognisable—there was no pole on which the curtains hung, but there was a holdfast and some knob or something which fastened to it—that was still there.</p>

At three o'clock a.m. on Friday morning I was in Gresse Street, when I saw the two female prisoners and another man and a constable—I went and asked what was the matter—Tolls said that Braun had accompanied a man to 137, Charing Cross Road about eleven o'clock; they stayed there a few minutes, and then, left; that she herself went upstairs to clean the room, and found on the floor four Bank of England notes, one for £1,080 and three for £5—she spoke English perfectly well—she said she took the notes to her brother-in-law at No. 11, Grosse Street—that would be a quarter of a mile or more from 137, Charing Cross Road, I should think—Tolls stated, that her brother-in-law had snatched the notes out of her hand, and re<lb/>fused</p>

               <p>—I have taken a good deal of trouble in trying to find out—the address given by the women was not the prisoners' house—the woman in saying that he had the notes was very angry, and showed it; she was very calm, but angry; she displayed in her words that she was angry; she was not excited—when he said he did not know anything of the money or notes she said he knew he had taken them, that is all I mean when I say she was very angry with him—I do not mean that she was very excited in making a charge against him—she talked a great deal, and he did not—I do not know the other man who was there—Mund spoke broken English; I understood what he said.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 14th April, about noon, I was with Miller in Queen's Road, Dalston, and saw the two prisoners leave No. 220; we followed them into Kingsland Road, where Miller missed me—I next saw the female prisoner about one o'clock in Finsbury Pavement, and Wood about forty yards behind her—they went into London Wall separately, and Glarke went into Lockhart's, a cook's shop, Wood remaining outside, apparently watching inside the shop—Clarke came out and stood at the corner of Blomfield Street, and Wood went that way and opened the Talbot public-house door and looked in, and then joined Clarke, who came back and went in at the same door—Wood remained outside till she came out; she went down Throgmorton Avenue, Wood following—they joined each other in Broad Street, and went through Gresham House, which is a thoroughfare, into Bishopsgate Street—they stopped in the passage and conversed, and Clarke gave Wood something, and then Wood gave Clarke something—Clarke went into Bishoppgate Street, Wood remaining in the passage—he then went out into Bishopsgate Street, and joined Clarke, and they went together into Gracechurch Street, where Clarke</p>

               <p>went into a sweetstuff shop, No. 11, while Wood remained. outside the door looking into the shop—Clarke came out and went into Bell Yard—Wood followed her, and she gave him a small paper bag—they then went into King William Street, where I got in front of them—they went into a cook's shop kept by Mrs. Stephenson—I spoke to the cashier, and saw Clarke come in, go to the counter, and give the cashier something, who gave her change and gave me this shilling—at that moment Miller came in—I saw "Wood standing in the passage, looking in the direction in which Miller went, who was speaking to the cashier—I spoke to Miller, and we went out—I noticed that Ward had his right fist clenched—I caught hold of his right arm, and Miller his left—he placed both his clenched fists together, leaned his weight on us, and bent his head to his hands, and I heard the clink of money—he threw himself on his back, and the three of us went down together—he apparently had something in his throat; we tried to make him disgorge it—I got my hand under his throat—I distinctly saw an impression in his throat, and he appeared to be choking—we lifted him up on his feet, and then he had something in his throat; he was making peculiar motions with his neck—not a word was said—we handed him over to Perry, a uniform constable—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw Clarke in Bishopsgate Street, and said, "I am a police officer; I am going to take you in custody for being concerned with a man already in custody in uttering a counterfeit shilling at a cook's shop in King William Street"—she said, "I don't know what you are talking about; it is all Latin to me"—I took her to Seething Lane Station; she was placed in the dock with Wood, and I said to her, "Do you know this man?"—she said, "No; he is a stranger to me"—I said to Wood, "Do you know this woman?"—he said, "No; I never saw her before in my life"—I had seen them together twice before; Clarke was carrying this small handbag; I found in it a purse containing three florins, a sixpence, and fivepence, all good—the inspector asked Wood for his address; he said, "I live at a coffee-shop over the water; I don't know exactly where it is" Clarke said she had no address—I know the cell in which Wood was confined.</p>

               <p>and saw Clarke go into 64, King William Street, a cook's shop; Wood stood a short distance away, with his back to the window of a boot-shop—when Clarke came out I went in and saw Murphy, who spoke to me—Wood was standing in the passage, looking through the glass door—when we came out he turned his back to us—his hands were clenched—Murphy caught hold of his right hand, and I of his left—he drew both hands together, and changed some shillings from his right hand into his left, threw his head forward, put his mouth to his left hand, and put something into his mouth; he then threw himself on his back on the pavement, and struggled very hard—I said to Murphy, "Be has put something into his mouth"—we tried very hard to make him disgorge it, but he kept his mouth closed—we let him get up—Murphy called Perry, and we took him to Seething Lane Station—he was choking and very faint when we got there—I told him he would be charged with being concerned with a woman in uttering counterfeit shillings—he made no answer, but when we got into Great Tower Street he said, "You say I shall be charged with being concerned with a woman?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have not been in the company of any woman to-day"—I found on him £3 17s. in silver, a watch, and other articles—Clarke was brought to the station, and Wood said to me, "Is that the woman?"—I said, "Yes; do you know her?"—he said, "No; I have never seen her before"—he was put in the dock where Clarke stood, and Murphy asked him if he knew her—he said, "No"—he then asked Clarke if she knew Wood—she said no, she never saw him before in her life—I found four sixpences and 3s. 7d. in bronze, loose in Wood's coat pocket; the other money was in a purse in his under-coat pocket.</p>

I live at 7, Goldstein Terrace, Battersea, and am a fish fryer—on 24th April, about one o'clock, I was coming over Chelsea Bridge, and saw the constable moving the prisoner on; I stepped back, as I suspected something wrong—she had one child in her arms, and the other one by her side—as soon as the constable had left her she picked up the child that was on the ground, and attempted to throw it over the side—I ran and caught hold of her and the child—it was level with the rail, and had hold of it with its hand—she was trying to put it over the side—the child cried out, "Mother, don't put main the water"—the constable came up and took her to the station.</p>

On 24th April, about half-past one a.m., I was on duty at Gerald's Road Police-station, when the prisoner and her two children were brought in by Annis and Cliff, who told me what they had seen—I said to the prisoner, "This is a serious matter; do you wish to say anything?"—she said, "All I have to say is that I did intend to take my children's lives and my own; if I had got the one over I could soon have got over with the other. It is not the first time. I have got five children, and my husband has done no work since Christmas Eve; he has only earned a few shillings. I expected a good week's wages from him last Saturday night, but he gave me none, and I was compelled to sell a glass for half-a-crown to be able to take my sick child to a doctor. I have had to dispose of nearly all my home to keep ourselves. I have only had two pieces of bread to-day, and my husband has not been home. He can find money to get drunk with, and get locked up"—she was charged, and made no reply—she was quite sober—I thought she seemed somewhat strange and excited, and I sent for the divisional surgeon, Dr. O'Brien, who came and said in her presence she was perfectly sane, and able to be put in the cell—I went to 28, Tyneham Road, Battersea, where she lived; the door was opened by a little girl—they lived in two rooms in the basement—on entering the back room, which was poorly furnished, I found the husband lying drunk on the couch—I had great difficulty in rousing him—there was a sick child lying on the bed, and two other children dressed—I found no food; only a pennyworth of butter and some bread—the husband was in the precincts of the Court here on Monday, drunk—he is a tailor; he was in good employment up to last Christmas at the Civil Service Stores, but was discharged on account of his drunken habits.</p>

I am a daughter of Orlando Kinsey, tobacconist, 70, Mansfield Road, Kentish Town—on 21st April, about six o'clock, I was serving, when Marks came in for half an ounce of tobacco, price twopence, and gave me this half-crown, which felt very light—I called my father into the shop, and he asked her where she got it—she said at the linendraper's at the top of the road—that would be Mr. Howse's shop—my father went out with her—on 16th April Cove came in for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me this half crown, which I put in the till, giving him two shillings and fourpence change—he went away—I went to the till about ten minutes afterwards; I examined it; it felt very light; I put it back again, keeping it by itself, and when my father came in some time afterwards I gave it to him—I afterwards went to the Police-station, and there picked out Cove from a number of persons.</p>

                  </hi>. On 21st April my daughter called me into the shop in the evening, and showed me this coin, which I examined, and found to be a counterfeit half-crown—I asked Marks, who was in the shop, where she got it from—she said she got it at a draper's shop at the top of Gordon House Lane—I said, "He is a particular friend of mine; I will walk back with you, and I will get a good one in return, no doubt"—we had gone a little way down the road, when she said she must leave me; she did not want me to follow her—I allowed her for decency's sake to go out of my sight, but as soon as I looked round the corner she ran away—I followed; the male prisoner, whom I had seen opposite my shop, and who had followed me down the toad, came up and said, "You don't want to do that woman any harm; she is only a poor prostitute"—I said, "No, what I am doing is for her benefit; she tells me she has taken a bad half-crown"—I went on till I met a</p>

I am the wife of Charles Govier, who keeps a tobacconist's and sweetstuff shop at 5, Mansfield Road, Kentish Town—on 21st April Marks came in about 5 o'clock for twopennyworth of cough drops—she gave me a half-crown, which I bent in the tester, and told her was not good, and gave back to her—she said she had taken it from the linendraper up the road—she did not name the linendraper—there is one in the Gordon House Lane, and one in the Mansfield Road, on each side of us—she took the coin and went away, turning to the left—the same night we heard from Mr. Kinsey—I next saw Marks on Thursday at Marylebone Police-court, where I identified her from among other people—I only know it was a bad coin by its bending in the tester.</p>

On 21st April I met Kinsey and the two prisoners about half-past six—Kinsey gave Marks into custody, saying, "I give this woman into custody for passing a counterfeit half-crown, and you would be doing right in taking the man as well"—Cove was there—he said, "I shan't go to no station; I saw this man speaking to this woman; I don't know her; he accuses me of being with her"—I said to him, "We know each other; you had better go to the station and clear yourself"—Marks said, "I got it from the linendraper's at the corner of Gordon House Road; I bought three yards of calico, and these socks"—she produced the calico and socks—"I changed half a sovereign"—I took her to the station, Cove walking in front, and Kinsey going with me—at the station Cove was placed with ten others, and Miss Kinsey identified him as the man who had uttered a bad half-crown to her on the previous Saturday—I searched him, and found 6s. 4d., good money, a silver watch, a pawn-ticket, and a receipt—after Marks was searched, I received 2s. silver, and fourpence, and a small velvet purse—before the charge was read to them, Cove said, "I don't know this woman"—Marks said, "I don't know him"—when charged they made no reply—Marks gave 36, Preston Street, Norland Road, Kentish Town; and Cove, 7, Cromwell Terrace, Upper Holloway, as their addresses.</p>

I carry on business at Oak Lane, Limehouse, as a coppersmith and brewers' engineer—in April, 1890, I recovered a judgment, with costs, against George Ferdinand von Weisenfeld for £250—Mr. Birchall was my solicitor in that action—I instituted bankruptcy proceedings against Von Weisenfeld—he was declared bankrupt</p>

               <p>in June, 1890—I was appointed trustee on 2nd April, 1891—a protracted litigation took place with reference to that bankruptcy, and with reference to some furniture in Stoneleigh; likewise as to a bill of sale that was set up respecting a claim by the Produce Company, Limited, to that furniture—the issue was, whether I or the trustee was entitled to that furniture—judgment was given by Justice Vaughan Williams; there was an appeal, and his judgment was affirmed—on that I took steps to compel the bankrupt to attend his public examination—he did not attend—he did not file any statement of affairs—a summons was taken out, under Section 20, for a private examination of the defendant Betts—that was issued on 7th May, and on the 28th he came before Registrar Linklater and gave evidence—I have never seen the furniture since, or recovered a farthing—I know that Von Weisenfeld had an interest in two houses, Stoneleigh and Grafton House, in Clissold Park, Stoke Newington—he was also supposed to rent Oak Lodge—I did not know of the furniture being taken there on 18th April or 20th May.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no order of the Bankruptcy Court for this prosecution—I am prosecuting as trustee—there are several creditors—there is no committee of inspection—the Official Receiver and myself, as trustee, conducted the whole of the litigation—there were proceedings extending over nine or ten days about the bill of, sale—Mr. Justice Williams set it aside in my favour, and the Court of Appeal affirmed his judgment—the date of the information was 17th July, 1891—I first gave evidence in this matter a week or two after, at Bow Street—the case was adjourned by Sir John Bridge until the proceedings in the High Court had been adjudicated upon—after the judgment of the High Court I applied for a day to be fixed for the hearing of the criminal charge against the defendant—I cannot say when I first heard of the removal of the furniture from Stoneleigh House—it is twelve months ago; it may have been about the end of March, 1891—we could not take proceedings because we did not know where it went to—we took steps to watch Oak Lodge after we heard of the removal, I can't say the date—I took steps to try and recover my debt, and instructed my solicitor to proceed accordingly—the man bad become bankrupt, but we understood that he had a lot of property—my solicitor applied for authority to break into Oak Lodge and see if there was any property there belonging to me—I did not break into the place; I don't know whether my solicitor did; I was not there when they went in—I went there afterwards, but I never got in—I believe an inventory was taken—I left Mr. Birchall to take all necessary proceedings.</p>

I live at 171, Morrison Road, Camberwell—I am a salesman—in April, 1891, I was engaged by Mr. Potts, the late tenant, as caretaker on the premises known as Oak Lodge, Green Lanes, Stoke Newington—on 18th April, 1891, the defendant came there about eight in the morning, and knocked at the door—I opened it; my wife was with me—he put his foot inside the door, and said, "I have come to take possession of the house"—I said, "Where is your authority?"—he could not produce one; he was a complete stranger to me—I told him I had not received any instructions to allow him to take possession—to the best of my belief he said the furniture was coming—upon that I bolted the door—he said, "Is that your little game?"—I went to the back and bolted the door, and when I came to the front again he said, "We know your little game"—he stood with his back to the door to prevent my shutting it—the door gave way—he called another man, and told him to go for the agreement and the letter—he went away and came back—in the course of the day, about three, van loads of furniture came to the house in two pantechnicon covered vans—the defendant told me it came from Stoneleigh House, and by his direction it was put into Oak Lodge—he supervised the putting it in—he remained in the house all day—I declined to leave the premises—he threatened to turn me and my wife out—he told me he came in on an agreement with the owner—he showed me the agreement the next day—he remained there till the 20th, and I then left with my furniture—I read part of the agreement; I don't think this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; I am not sure, I should possibly know the letter better—the name of Dr. Wilde was mentioned during the day—I understood the agreement was between Mr. Elton and Dr. Wilde—I saw Dr. Wilde on the Sunday; he was a man of military appearance, rather taller than myself, and stouter—I did not see much of him—he appeared to be a foreigner; I could not say whether he spoke English; I could not say whether he wore spectacles—the defendant had told me that Dr. Wilde was coming in on Sunday morning; he came, and I was afterwards told by Horton that he was Dr. Wilde—I can't say that Horton was caretaker after I left.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 5, Mark Lane—I have been acting for Mr. Hendry—Mr. Flaxman is my managing clerk—we acted in the bankruptcy proceedings—this is the office copy, I think, of the bill of sale, 1890—I am acquainted with the litigation that has been going on, <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> the Concentrated Produce Company <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Von Weisenfeld, and the different claims that have been made on the property—the company claimed the furniture at Stoneleigh House under this bill of sale, which is from Von Weisenfeld to the company over the bankrupt's furniture—the consideration is £270, I think—it has been alleged that the company have made an assignment or something—there is an inventory attached to the bill of sale—about 3rd of July last year I went to Oak Lodge, where I found Horton in possession—I had the bill of sale in my hand; I went over the house, and compared the furniture in it with the schedule, and the articles we found there answered the description given in the schedule; we did not find some pictures that should have been there—an offer was made with reference to that furniture, which they said was in Oak Lodge, in the bankruptcy proceedings, by a solicitor or</p>

               <p>of £30,000 last Thursday, before which he was a labourer I getting £1 a week; that it was from au uncle in Ireland, who added a I codicil to his will by which he, Cox, was obliged to give £5,000 to the poor in any part of the globe—I noticed that his hands were not those of a labourer, and told him he was very foolish to tell such a story, and to show so much money to strangers—he said that he should seek agents to give the £5,000, and they must be persons of honesty and substance, and neither lawyers nor clergymen—I had told him that I am a doctor—he told a story about an Irish schoolmaster to whom he had given £200 for the poor, and £20 for his trouble, and who had proved his position by showing £200 cash at the bank, and he, Cox, would do the same with us if we fulfilled the same conditions, which were that he should see the money, to be sure we were men of substance, and he must see cash and not letters of credit, because he could not understand them—Martin then offered himself to be such an agent—Cox said it would be necessary to show £200, and then he went down to £150—I told him I could not show him such a lot of money, but I could take him to our Legation, where I could prove my honesty—I asked their names—Cox said he could not produce a card—I invited him to write, but he refused, and Martin put down the name of Cox, and also Patrick Lynch, of Pryor's Hotel, and said that in London he stayed at the Great Western Hotel—the other man said he was Mr. Watson, of the Talbot Hotel, Richmond—I am looking at my pocket-book—the first name was written by Martin, and the second by me—I gave my address-card—Cox said that he should see the money that afternoon—I said that I could not produce money that afternoon, because my money was in Switzerland—it was then 1 or 1.30—we were to meet at Holborn Restaurant at 5 p.m., when Cox said we were to show as much money as possible-Martin came with me some 100 yards, and said it seemed to him that this man was very stupid, and he might be a fool, but he could do much good with the money, and he recommended me to brine as much money. as possible for the interest of the poor—I went home alone and fetched some money, and went to a solicitor and told him the story, and he and I went to Scotland Yard and saw Mr. Williamson, the detective—I kept the appointment at five o'clock, and saw the detective in the saloon bar—he gave me a sign, and I went to a chair, and soon afterwards Martin came and told me he could not get so. much money as he expected, only about £40 or £50—I told him I was unsuccessful in getting money too, but the thing was so important that we could have another appointment with Cox—he was very anxious to now from me how much I had got, and whether it was gold or bank notes—I said I had about £4 in cash with me, but I could in case of necessity show my watch and chain—Cox then came in, and offered to pay for a bottle of ale; Martin objected, and I objected too, and then Martin told Cox he was sorry he had not got so much money as he expected, and I said I could not get more than about £4—I saw in the looking-glass that Williamson was standing behind us with two or three gentlemen—I observed that Cox changed colour, and was out of composure—he said, "I shall go back to my quarters," and walked to the door—I looked after him, and saw that he was arrested and Martin had disappeared—I went to Bow</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No one else was with them—I was acting on the instructions the police gave me when I entered into conversation with the prisoners at the Holborn Restaurant—I have been in England since the end of October; it is my first visit here—I have been in Germany-Martin said that he thought Cox's story was a little strange—I was convinced that they were swindlers, and I only went to the Holborn Restaurant to lay a trap for them—I took £4 there—the police did not advise me to show my money.</p>

On 22nd April, about 5 p.m., I went with Norland and Nash to the saloon bar of the Holborn Restaurant, and saw the two prisoners, and the prosecutor sitting between them—on our approaching them they got up and went away—I told Cox I was a police officer, and should take him in custody for attempting to obtain £150 from the prosecutor, pointing to him—he said, "Don't make a scene; you can't do much to me, for I have had nothing out of him"—I took him to Broad Street, where he was charged—I found on him sixteen pieces of paper, eight representing £ 1,000 notes, and. the others £5 notes on the Bank of Engraving; they are dummies—he was charged, and made no reply.</p>

Surely we ought not to have to warn Anarchists of the danger of conspiracies; these death traps; these gins set by the police and their spies, in which so many honest and devoted men have perished. Surely those who desire to act can do as John Felton did, when, alone and unaided, he bought the knife which struck down the tyrant. Are there no tyrants now? What of the Jesuitical monster at the Home Office, who murders men for taking a few head of game? What of the hyena who preys upon bodies of hanged men, and whose love of the gallows a few years ago won him the title of 'Hangman' Hawkins?—this barbarous brute, who, prating of his humanity, sends our comrades to ten years in the hell of the prisons. What of the spy Melville, who sets his agent on to concoct the plots which he discovers? Are these men fit to live? The Anarchists are criminals, vermin, gallows carrion; well, shower hard names upon us; hunt us down like mad dogs; strangle us like you have done our comrades at Xeres; shoot us down as you did at Fourmies; and then be surprised if your houses are shattered with dynamite, and if people shrink from the companionship of officials of the law as 'dangerous company.'

I was at the meeting in Hyde Park on Sunday, 10th April—I heard your speech—you did not say "Justice Hawkins, Home Secretary Matthews, Melville, and Coulon are the chief actors in the Walsall plot; two of them must die"—I heard another speech before yours, and I waited about five minutes after you had finished—you said something about coming face to face with Justice Hawkins—you did not say anything like individual aid, and striking back—I did not take notes of your speech.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I only heard him make one speech—I think I can tell you what he did say about Justice Hawkins; it was something rather like what he said, "What must be Justice Hawkins' feelings when he meets so many persons in the street that he has condemned to death, and who have got off since?"—he called him "Butcher Hawkins"—he was not complimentary to Mr. Justice Hawkins—he was generally abusing him, calling him "Hangman Hawkins" and "Butcher Hawkins," but nothing that could in any way be interpreted into a threat or inducement—he was speaking of Melville in the same strain he said he went about employing men to get up plots, spies—I could not say what more—he was talking in that strain—he said the Home Secretary was a party to the Walsall plot—he was speaking about half an hour—I was bail for Charles, one of the Walsall prisoners—I was convicted at Norwich with Mowbray for inciting to riot, for a speech; that was either in 1886 or 1887; I am not sure which—I am not an Anarchist; I regarded them as being Radicals—it was a speech I am not proud of; it was merely a speech—I had not gone to attend this Anarchist meeting—I frequently go to Hyde Park on Sundays—I was rather interested in the meeting, having stood bail for one of the prisoners.</p>

I am a shorthand writer, and I am connected with the press—I was present in Hyde Park on Sunday afternoon, April 10th, to take a report of the Anarchist meeting—I heard your speech—I did not hear you say, "Two of them must die"—I heard you tell a tale with reference to Mr. Justice Hawkins sentencing men to death and meeting them daily in the street, but I have no recollection of hearing you make a reference to "striking them back"—I was present till the meeting was over—I only heard you deliver one speech.</p>

I was stationed in the Commercial Road about four p.m. on 15th March—a communication was made to me—I saw the prosecutor standing outside the Victory—he complained to me—the prisoner was walking away, and I went after him and brought him back—I took him into custody—the prosecutor said, "I shall give you into custody for kicking me in the leg"—I took the prosecutor on an ambulance to the London Hospital—he was suffering great pain—the prisoner said, "Why don't you charge the other man as well as me?"—I said the old man would have to go to the hospital first—there was no reference then to the loss of money—I saw the prosecutor the next morning—he was still in great pain—I was only with him a few minutes—I next saw him a week afterwards—he then told me he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> You were about 100 yards away when I walked after you—I did not say, "That scoundrel wants to lock you up for breaking his leg"—you said, "If his leg is broken it is an accident"—you wanted to give the prosecutor in charge—I handed you over to another policeman—I did not see anything the matter with your eye—when I went to the hospital I got the prosecutor's address—I did not ask him questions, nor if he had any property about him; nor if he wanted to be sent home—he was unable to make any statement—I saw him the next day; I asked him how he was—he said he was very bad—I asked him where he lived—he told me—I went again to the hospital the following Wednesday—then he told me he had lost 1s. 8d., and that he would prefer another charge against you for robbing him—I came back and told the Magistrate—I searched your pockets; I took no money out—I did not say, "That man charges you with stealing 1s. 8d., but you have 1s. 5d."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I gave evidence at the Police-court on 13th April—I was there every week—the prisoner did not charge the prosecutor till I had taken him into custody—the prosecutor was very ill, but a week afterwards he was out of some of his pain, when he complained of the robbery—that was three weeks before he came out of the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at the London Hospital—the prosecutor was brought in on 15th March—both bones of the right leg were broken—the fibia was fractured through the internal malleolus, and the fibia three inches from its lower end—there was a good deal of stain about the fracture—he remained in the hospital till April 15th—he was there a month—I attribute the injuries to the wrenching of the foot outwards—I found no external marks of violence—the injury could not result from a kick from the toe of a boot.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This enclosed cheque to cover acceptance which has been duty retired, and enclosing prospectus of the Gold King, the largest property on the run</hi>)—among other things my attention has been directed to what purports to be the holding of Edward Marshall's shares in this company—I have examined the cashbook of the company; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was acknowledged by Mr. Gilbert to contain the whole transactions of the company—this is the only book in which I find any cash entries, this and the pass-book—the book does not contain the whole of the entries in the pass-book—this is the passbook; it contains very few entries—these two books together contain the whole record of the company's transactions that have come to my knowledge—in neither of these books do I find any record of a receipt by the prisoner of the £4,000 which he acknowledged on the 29th February in going through the books and documents of the company I found no forms of application for shares—in consequence of that I made application to the prisoner for them on 11th August, 1891—we have received no reply—Mr. Larchin, the manager of the company, was examined by the</p>

               <p>all I could find—the letter gave me particulars as to the holdings; I do not remember having a prospectus; terms of subscription were given by letter—in consequence of it I applied for 400 shares in that company by an ordinary letter, in which I forwarded this cheque for £200, dated 17th February—I had a receipt from the prisoner for that £200 on 20th February—on 28th February I forwarded a cheque for £300 for 600 more shares; no communication was made to me between those dates—on 28th February I sent two acceptances for £4,000 for 4,000 more shares, and I received the letter of 29th February from the prisoner, acknowledging the receipt of my £300 cheque and the acceptances—I had seen Mr. Larchin—I think I Knew him before that—he had nothing to do with my application for the Gold Queen shares—I received a letter (of which this is a copy) of allotment, dated 8th March, and a receipt for the moneys I had paid—I have tried to find that letter, and cannot do so—about 28th March I forwarded a cheque for £500 for the balance of my purchase, so that I had then paid £1,000 by cheque and cash, and there were acceptances for £4,000 lying in the defendant's hands—I have not got the acceptances, they were destroyed; I sent £2,000 for one at the end of May and £2,000 for the other at the end of June in each case, and had these letters acknowledging receipt, and the acceptances were retired and returned to me and destroyed—I received the certificate for the shares—I have not retained the letter of 16th May enclosing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head of the telegraphic department of Brown, Shipley and Co.—in March, 1888, we received £1,000 from the London Trading Bank, with instructions, in accordance with which we remitted £1,000 to the First National Bank, Denver, Colorado to the credit of J. S. Merchant—on 16th March, 1888, we received £1,000 from the London Trading Bank with similar instructions, and we remitted it in due course to the same bank and to the credit of the same person—on 4th April we received £1,000, and remitted it in the same way to the same person; and on 6th April another remittance of £1,000 was made under the same circumstances—on May 1st we remitted £800, and on May 10th £500—£5,300 was the amount altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had no account with the prisoner or with the London Trading Bank; they paid us each amount with distinct instructions every time—the transactions with the London Trading Bank began on 8th August, 1887, as far as I have been able to trace, and from then to October, 1889, there were remittances of this character on behalf of the London Trading Bank—by far the larger number of remittances were in the name of J. S. Merchant—the remittances between the dates I have given come to fully £36,570—there may have been one or two small sums under £100 altogether in addition to that, and there was a further sum of 16,000 dole., not sent to Mr. Merchant, but to Mr. S. P. Gilbert—we did not know what they were connected with—that was a total of about £40,000—there is nothing in our books which attribute particular sums in that amount to the account of any particular company—there is nothing which distinguishes sums sent to J. S. Merchant in March and April, 1888, from others—besides the sums I have given, there were sent to America £50 on 7th March, £370 on 21st, and £200 on 5th April—I have no knowledge of return of moneys from America to this country since the date of this account; there has been nothing that has been identified with this company at all—I know of no remittances by Mr. Merchant, or anybody on behalf of Gilbert to this country during 1889.</p>

               <p>a statement of the account, and I have supplied them with all the information they asked for.—<hi rend="smallCaps">COOPER</hi>. I am a director of the London Trading Bank, where in 1888 the prisoner had an account of his own for the Gold Queen Company, by direction of the directors—it was a private account, opened by the prisoner for the purpose of the Gold Queen Company—in March, 1888, I believe, we directed Brown, Shipley, and Co. to send £1,000 to Colorado for the Gold Queen; it was payable to Merchant or Shipley, I don't know which—there were only three people we had directions to send the money to—our directions were by letter and cheque to send the money to the Gold Queen—we had instructions about that remittance through the prisoner or the managing clerk in the Gold Queen office, mostly from the clerk—the instructions were mostly verbal, but sometimes written—a cheque always accompanied them—I have not got the writings with me; they were simply slips written by the clerk, to say, "Please remit £500 or £1,000 to the First National Bank," and enclosing a cheque—I have found some of the slips; I don't know if the others exist now; these are all that can be found—I have searched, and I have sent a messenger for them since I have been here—these are all that can be found—upon instructions from the prisoner, or the Gold Queen office we Bent another £1,000 on 16th March to Brown, Shipley, £1,000 on April 4th, £1,000 on April 6th, £800 on May 1st, and £500 on May 10th—we should enter those in the pass-book—these sums are not entered in the pass-book of the Gold Queen, as that was all there was in that account of the Gold Queen—I don't know what the object was in having an account for the company—the prisoner's account was to be used for the purposes of the Gold Queen—a correspondence took place in connection with the company as to how the account should be conducted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I opened this account for the Gold Queen in February, 1888, in consequence of receiving this authority. (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter of 7th February</hi>, 1888, <hi rend="italic">from the Gold Queen Company to the London Trading Bank, authorising the bank to honour the company's cheques when signed by two directors and countersigned by the secretary</hi>)—we afterwards had the authority of the prisoner and two of the directors (Mr. Norman, I think, was one; I cannot recollect the other) for opening a private account, in the prisoner's name, for the purposes of the company—they stated that the prisoner was acting as banker—I should think that was done both orally and in writing—I know they were present—I cannot find any such document—I cannot give a date on which I think it is possible you would find such authority in the company's letter-book—I should say such a conversation took place between myself and the prisoner about a month or so after the company's account was opened; it might be in February or March, 1888—our directions were that the prisoner had authority to take and conduct the account of the company, and the other account was not used—this account was conducted for the company and in the interests of the company, at the direction of the prisoner and of the company itself; every transaction was for the company—I pledge myself that two directors as well as the prisoner gave me directions of that kind—Mr. Norman was one; I cannot remember the second—I have no book or paper, further than this account, which shows that the amounts I have given</p>

               <p>as having been sent to America were sent on behalf of the Gold Queen—we understood it to be so—the entries in the account are, 12th March, "Merchant, £1,000"; 16th March, "Merchant, £1,000"; 4th April, "Merchant, £1,000"; 6th April, "Merchant, £200"—I don't think there is anything in my book which shows those sums were for the Gold Queen—the entry in the account on 6th April, "Merchant, £1,000," was to the best of my knowledge for the Gold Queen; we had no other intimation—I could not say that all the amounts entered under the head of Merchant were for the Gold Queen; I cannot distinguish between them—the "£800 Merchant" on 1st May I believed to be for the Gold Queen; I could not say that it was—our authority was from the secretary in writing, together with a cheque, and we understood the money was to be paid to the Gold Queen—the authority in these cases was one of the prisoner's cheques and a written slip such as this; these are all I can find; we do not keep them as a rule, but searching through our papers we have found these—small memoranda are not kept when the cheque is there—sometimes the slips have got into their proper place; they have no use—I suggest that the reason some of these slips have been kept and not others is because these have been placed in the correct form, and the others have been thrown away as waste—I should prefer that they were kept, but they are not always—this letter of 1st October, 1886, headed "Jenkins, Son and Nephew," was long before there was any Gold Queen account. (<hi rend="italic">This letter requested</hi> £50 <hi rend="italic">to be sent per cable to J. S. Merchant, Denver</hi>)—moneys were being sent to Merchant by the prisoner long before; I do not know for what purpose—I cannot produce any evidence that these sums were for the credit of the Gold Queen; I cannot say so definitely, but we understood they were—the prisoner came to me and wanted me to discount these acceptances; I was conversant with the whole matter—the prisoner offered to let us see his letter to Mr. Gibbs if we discounted the bills, as we wanted to be in communication with the actual acceptor ourselves apart from dealing with the prisoner.

               <p>Company paper, but that heading does not instruct us that we received money on its behalf; all these mines are in the United States, and we do not distinguish one from the other—I say, although I have no documents to verify it, that certain amounts were sent on behalf of the Gold Queen, because the prisoner and Mr. Scott told us they were; we could not note everything we are told; we do what we are told—Mr. Gibbs' acceptances was brought to us without a drawer's name—we did not discount them, but we received just about that time, on 12th March, two sums of £1,000 each, credited to this account, and on 16th another sum of £1,000—I did not know at the time, but I have been told that that the bills have been discounted at the London and South-Western Bank—I do not know if the prisoner has an account there—no such amount as £2,000 was paid into our account in May or June by a cheque of Mr. Gibbs'.</p>

               <p>he was prizing between the door-post and the door—they both pressed towards the door, and Reynolds was standing on the kerb—I walked towards them on the opposite side of the way—I was in uniform—they moved out of the doorway, and Reynolds made a hissing noise—I crossed towards them, and all three ran away—the two prisoners ran into the Crown public-house, Charing Cross Road—I ran after them, a very few yards behind them—Sutton ran straight through and down stairs into the basement and I after him—I arrested him in the wine cellar, I believe it was, and I said, "I shall take you in custody for trying to break into a shop in Cranbourne Street'—he made no remark, but began to struggle—I brought him up into the bar, where Cunningham was with Reynolds—at the station Reynolds made no reply at first, but when being taken to the cells he said, "I was not there "; and on the way to the station he said, "I was not there"—I was about fifty yards from the three men when I first saw them, and about seven yards from them when they began to run—Sutton got into the public-house first, but the other was very close behind, in fact he tried to pass him, and Reynolds was not a yard behind the other, and about three yards from me—I knew Sutton by sight; I had seen him for the first time the night before—I did not know Reynolds.</p>

I was against Pratt's shop, a large clothier's shop, when I first saw the prisoners—that was about 12.5—I did not hear Cunningham examined at the Police-court; I was out of Court—we have not talked about the time; I do not think he said the time was 12.5—I have been in that division eight years—I have never had a case here before—I have ordinary constable's boots—I did not walk on tiptoes, I passed slowly down—there was very little traffic—the Empire Theatre was over—any person must have heard me coming—I can't swear whether Sutton was using a stick or a crowbar—I could see, at fifty yards away, which man was using the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I kept my eyes on Sutton the whole time, and followed him into the public-house—I did not find a stick or a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on him, nor did I see him throw anything away, but it was possible for him to get rid of it—he ran into the saloon bar—I cannot say whether you can go from bar to bar, round the whole house, without going into the street—I ran forty yards; I was not a bit puffed or blown—Mr. Jennings did not say to me, "What is the matter, policeman?" nor did I say, "I will tell you when I get my breath"—I did not start to run sixty or seventy yards away, nor did I lose eight of these two men as I turned the corner—I had my great coat on, with my belt round, but I have often run three times the distance without puffing or blowing—that is Mr. Jennings—he spoke to me in the public-house—two shillings were found on Sutton, but no housebreaking implements—he had not that light coat on; he had a light check suit—it took from five to seven minutes to charge them at the station—he did not, in the dock, deny being there; it was going back to the cell—I had never seen Sutton and Reynolds together before; as far</p>

               <p>—there is a clock in the bar; we left at 12.5 or 12.10, and I went back to the Crown with Sutton—he stood at the door, and I went in and went upstairs, and in less than a minute I heard a struggle in the passage leading from the bar to the kitchen stairs—there is a lavatory there, with the word "lavatory" on the door, and stairs leading down to the kitchen—I went down to the lobby and saw Sutton struggling with a policeman in the kitchen—from the time Sutton drove up at twelve o'clock till he was taken in custody he was not out of my company—I went up to his room to get a latch-key out of his pocket, which I have got here—it was a dark brown coat—Alice Smith is also a barmaid at the Provence; Priscilla Brown is at the Crown.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am under Sutton, his wages are ten shillings a week—he does not often take hansoms—there is no special order that he must be in at twelve o'clock to a minute—he arrived at two minutes to twelve as near as possible, and went into the kitchen; we stayed talking a minute, and then walked to the Provence, which took us a minute—we were there five minutes—I looked at the clock there, because I had to get home to Westminster—Sutton lives in the house—it is only on the nights he is out that I stop till 12.30—Miss Barnes and Miss Money were serving at the Crown—Sutton was not on duty at all that night, but he had some work to do when he came in—the house shuts at 12.30—he generally comes by omnibus on Thursday night.</p>

               <p>March—he was employed in the lamp stores—it was his duty to sort and count lamps; there were numbers of stems of broken lamps where he was employed—the platinum wires to which the carbons are attached are kept; they burn about a thousand hours, but the platinum wire gets twisted, and it has to be melted before it can be used again—we allow our customers for broken lamps—the value of the platinum in these lamps is about 9d., and in the small ones 2d.—the present value of platinum is about 39s. per ounce—these broken ends were kept in several large boxes in the stores—some of these platinums are made only by us, in a way that enables me to recognise them—when they accumulate we send them to our refiners, Johnson and Matthey, who replace them with good wire—the police showed, me this platinum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was taken from the prisoner—it would weigh twenty-seven ounces—it is composed of many thousands of these wires—I have examined the parcel thoroughly; it consists of such wire as would result from the breaking up of lamps at our place—there are at least ten varieties of wire—there was among them an experimental stem; it is not here, the Magistrate took charge of it—we do not send any of these things out to New Zealand—the experimental stem was never taken out of our factory, but others were supplied to the Admiralty—our company has the monopoly for manufacturing incandescent lamps for Great Britain, and these are the stems of incandescent lamps; they are in a mass, which has been beaten up and solidified, but not melted; all the glass is cleared away off it; and it has the appearance of heat having been applied to it; we just knock the brass off, and then send it to the refiners—we found less at the stores than we expected to find.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first examined the stores after the prisoner had been arrested—we knew that the boxes were there before he was arrested—we then examined them—the special parcel consisted of several boxes—it would not be necessary to empty twenty boxes to get twentyseven ounces of platinum—there were not more than three or four boxes in that room—we do not make the platinum wire; it is manufactured for us—the incandescent lamps are made with platinum wire, there are thousands of them made—those made out of this country are riot of the same dimensions—there is nothing but the dimension and the form to go by; by dimension I mean length and diameter—I can positively swear to this particular wire having been in our possession—it is not all comparatively the same, we designed some for the Admiralty, a special stem, and in this box you will see we put on a piece of common iron wire—I am unable to say I can identify any single wire-all manufacturers have more or less the same thickness; I cannot swear to this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) being one of our wires—I do not identify the whole lot; I recognise the experimental stem by its thickness and length, and the one supplied to the Admiralty by the twist and form—the broken ends do not go into the stores; these are not customers' ends, they are a few resulting from defective lamps; the stores are all for the manufactured lamps—pieces of a broken lamp, or a whole lamp, would come into the prisoner's possession—the record has been lost of the amount of platinum in the stem—in the absence of other portions we could not keep the record—the order sent to the Admiralty in 1891—I have said, "I think the portion claimed by the police has been cleaned"—when I last examined that heap it was pounded together; it was separated after<lb/>wards</p>

               <p>at our works; it appeared to have been cleaned—there was not a lot of dross—I took one piece in my hand and measured it—I knew that to be a stem which we use for experimental purposes—when I was measuring in that minute manner I had not an experimental stem with me; there was not one in existence, there were only a few made—they were made about eighteen months or two years ago, long before the prisoner was in our service—I cannot say that it is inconceivable that any other maker should have a piece of wire like this in his possession—about six of my staff were present when I made the examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. The only wire I have with me has not been used in any lamp; this is simply the stem, broken off at the collar; the upper part is made of pure carbon, the diameters are not in any way altered by the light, or by the process of disintegration—there is not sufficient alteration to prevent my identifying them; they get out of shape, but that does not affect the thickness; you cannot corrode it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I only know of one person who has to do with the disposition of platinum in London—when the prisoner came into our employment he did not suggest that he knew anything about this kind of stud, not until his arrest, then he said that he had some in his possession which he brought from New Zealand—platinum is the only metal which would do—it is not affected by heat—it is not a thing that would be sold in the street—the company is getting more known now—I saw that the wires had been hammered for the purpose of getting the mass together, and that it had been subjected to heat—the stems from other makers generally pass through our hands before they go to the refiner—I saw the prisoner in August, before he came into the employment, I think he came to my office—he made about 25s. a week.</p>

I am an engineer; I have worked at a stereo-typer's in Shoe Lane for nine years, at £2 a week—we have lived at 5, Gunpowder Alley for six years; the prisoner lodged with us for about eighteen months—I allow my wife money every week—I pay for the gas every quarter; my wife never pays for it out of her housekeeping money—on 24th June I gave her £1 11s. 11d. for the gas, and at five p.m. I saw this receipt—on 1st December the prisoner left; on 9th December, about a quarter-past one, she brought this key, and I said she should have brought it on the 7th, and I was going to summons her for another week's rent; she went away—she has said nothing about having lent 30s. to my wife, although I have seen her several times—I went to the Court on 29th January and 15th February, but did not give evidence—I owe no money to anybody.</p>

I am Medical Superintendent of Greenwich Infirmary—I saw this child when he was bought in—he was about four years old, and a delicate child; he had been in the infirmary, and the mother took him out the day before, against my wish—his face and the front part of his hair were wet—if his face was held in six inches of water it would become discoloured, but it would pass off.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in her statement before the Magistrate and in her defence, said that she took the child out of the Union to take him to see his father at the Dreadnought Hospital, and then to her sister's, and a lot of boys followed her, shouting, "Old Mother Gilby" and tore her dress; that she was in great danger of falling with the child; that she went to Mrs. Gardner, and the boys threw the gate open and pushed her down on her face and threw water over her, and she put her hand on the tub to save the child from going in, and the next she heard of it was that it was in the infirmary; and that she had had eleven children and had only this one left, and would lay down her life for him.

On 14th April the prisoner came into my yard, surrounded by a large mob of boys, and said, "If you let me in I have plenty of money"—she had occupied the next cottage formerly—I had to go out on business, and left her sitting on the doorstep—this was a butter tub, it was not mine—it had one hoop to it and part of another—it leaked at the upper part, but it would hold five inches of water—there were a great many boys at the gate, and I was glad to get away—they were hooting when they first came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I carefully examine the paper before I pay the money, and see that it is correct—the witnesses receive 1s. an hour and 1s. afterwards—I cannot say how long the inquest lasted—this only represents the witnesses who receive payment—the house surgeon would not receive payment in some cases—if 2s. was put down I should allow it if they came from a distance—there has been some disappointment about the new rules, about reducing the officers' fees—the prisoner got 5s. in the first case for summoning the jury and witnesses, and his mileage, and 3s. 6d. afterwards—if a witness refused to take the money the prisoner would be entitled to keep it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If he gave 1s. he would not be entitled to take 2s.; it was his duty to see that the amount was put down before the witnesses signed; if they are unable to sign they put a mark and he writes their names—he had not authority to sign for 2s. for Samuel Bateman—if a person is paid money which the scale does not authorise, the Coroner would have to pay it out of his own pocket—it is only as a matter of charity that I have put my hand into my own pocket to provide money not included in the scale.</p>

Mills would be payable—this is my casting; I have to rely on the fidelity of the Coroner's officer, and I paid him £1 6s.—there was another inquest the same day on the body of a man named Spires; this is my casting too, and this is the letter announcing the matter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this the official record of the expenses—my son signed for three sums of 6s. and one of 2s. 6d.; no such sums would be payable, as the man died in the hospital—I paid the prisoner £3 9s. on the faith of Bateman's signature.</p>

               <p>—there had been very strong complaints about the fees being reduced; the fee for summoning jurors is disallowed, and we used to have 1s. allowed for each juror—he might bring me the document and receive the £3 9s., and then go and pay the witnesses; he signs, and I give him the total—I should assume that he had already paid the witnesses—we have two or three cases going on at the same time—I have no knowledge of his having got the receipts first, and paid the people afterwards—I do not think he has ever come to me with the paper and the signatures already there, and I paid him the money, and he then went and paid the witnesses—if he hired two or three men, the bathman and the washer, he might pay them first and come to me for the money—I know no case where he has filled up a person's name who was not able to receive the money himself—he has been with me three years—I appointed him on the death of his father—he has always been a young man of excellent character; I have not the slightest complaint to make—I was quite surprised at the suggestion of fraud.</p>
