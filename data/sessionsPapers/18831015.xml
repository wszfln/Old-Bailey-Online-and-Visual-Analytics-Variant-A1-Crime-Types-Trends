                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 432). On the morning of 8th September, about half-past 2 o'clock, I was in company with Police-constable Cooper in Southampton Row; I there saw the prisoners Walsh and Smith on the right-hand side of the road; they were coming from Holborn towards Bussell Square—we watched them for about five minutes; they were standing in a doorway on the right-hand side of Southampton Bow—they then crossed over the road and joined Hall and another man at the corner of Bloomsbury Place—they stood there about 10 minutes; during that time I and Cooper were talking to a female, at the same time keeping our eye on the men—they then passed over and went towards Russell Square—we continued to follow them on the opposite side—they remained in Bussell Square in conversation together; we crossed over to them—we were in plain clothes—we told them that we were police constables, and asked them what they were doing at that time in the morning—they said "Oh, we are just out for a walk, and are going home"—I asked Hall where he lived; he said "I live in Penmark Street"—the man not in custody</p>

               <p>said "I live there too"—I told them they were going away from Den<lb/>mark Street—he said "That don't matter"—I said their answers did not satisfy me and that they would hare to come to Tottenham Court Road station—I then took hold of Walsh and Hall; they threw me to the ground, and Walsh gave me a kick on the right-hand side—I jumped up; my walking-stick was lying by my side, and I struck Walsh with it over the head—I tried to strike him on the shoulder—he fell down; I took hold of him and threw him on the top of Walsh and held them down—Walsh tried to get away; I told him if he tried to get up I should hit him again with my a tick—he jumped up afterwards and caught hold of me by the throat and threw me to the ground again—Hall got away from me; I had to let him go after Walsh got me down—Hall gave me two or three kicks on the left side, at the same time he said "Lie there, you b—," and then he ran away—Walsh was then on the ground—I saw Hall throw something away; I shouted out "Police, stop him!"—Constable Roach came up and stopped him, and we took them both to the station—I searched Walsh at the station—I found on him this chisel, and on Hall a pocket-knife and twopence—I charged them; they said nothing at the time—the four men got away—before I charged the prisoners I went back to Russell Square, where we had had the struggle, and at the exact spot where I saw Hall throw something away I found this dark lantern, in the area of 58, Russell Square; it has three different glasses, red. white, and green, all trimmed ready for use—I was under the doctor's cure for some time—I have resumed duty again.</p>

I live at 29, Addington Road, Bow, and am a chemical light manufacturer—on Tuesday afternoon, 18th Sept., about 1.40, I was proceeding up one of the avenues of the Poultry Market with my wife—I was obstructed by Batchelor getting in my way and hovering round me—I heard a cry soon after from some one behind me "That gentleman has lost his watch," and my wife called my attention to my chain hanging down—I felt for my watch, and it was gone—I gave the two prisoners into custody—they both pleaded innocence and respectability—I had seen my watch safe just before entering the avenue from Grace-church Street—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bow of my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Devonshire Terrace, Erskine Road, Walthamstow—about 2 o'clock on this afternoon I was coming through the poultry market, leaving the Ship Tavern passage—I saw the prosecutor with a lady, and two or three men hustling him about—the prisoners were the two principal ones, the others I should not recognise again—I saw Batchelor take the watch, and heard a click, and then saw the watch in Batchelor's hand—directly I saw it I touched the prosecutor on the shoulder and told him he had lost his watch—he turned round and I saw Batchelor turn to Macpherson and go close to him and pass the watch to him—a constable was fetched and they were given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I will swear I saw Batchelor pass the watch to Mac<lb/>pherson—I saw Macpherson pretty closely—I did not notice that he was lame, there were too many people, I had no change of looking at his legs—I did not notice he had a stick—I should think if he had a stick a watch could be passed to him—I could not positively swear it was not one of the other men I saw him pass it to; there were two or three men together with him, and it was passed to one of them—Macpherson was the one nearest to him, he was the one it was handed to in the first instance—I turned round and said to the people in general "Fetch a constable"—</p>

I live at 30, Hereford Street, Russell Square, and am a cashier—on this day I was in the poultry market, and saw a crowd, and the prosecutor with his chain hanging down, and the last witness stated that Batchelor had taken the prosecutor's watch—Macpherson was standing close to Batchelor, and he nudged him in this way, and held his hand for the purpose of receiving something—I saw nothing pass but only the two hands meet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about two yards off, near enough to see their hands meet—Batchelor was on Macpherson's right hand—I did not notice anything in Macpherson's right hand—the nudging might have been an accident—it was a very crowded place indeed—in my opinion it was a nudge, but I could not swear it was—I saw nothing pass—I fol<lb/>lowed them all the way to the station, and kept my eyes on them all the time and saw nothing pass.</p>

I am a cook, of 48, Burlington Road, Bethnal Green—on this afternoon I saw the prisoners given into custody—shortly after I found the bow of a watch just where Macpherson had been standing, at his feet—I had seen the two prisoners and another man for three hours before this together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is no shop in the house—the other articles were things his wife sold on the barrow, and a few glasses and a writing desk—all missing property is described in a list furnished to the police—this is the only thing identified besides those of Mr. Dyson—I did not know at the time he was taken into custody that this mug was stolen—there was an interval of 13 days between the first charge against him and that of the mug; during that time he was on bail—he is a man of good character, and nothing is known against him.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 1st September, I was in the Favourite beerhouse, Islington—the prisoner, and Cumming, and two men named Butterfield and Harris, were there playing at dominoes—Cumming's wife called him out, and he asked the prisoner to finish the game for him—he did, and lost it, and had to pay 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for beer—the prisoner came back, and Cumming asked him for the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he would not pay it—there was a quarrel, and they went outside and fought, and fell, and the prisoner hit Cumming as he was falling, and he hit his head on the cause way—he was taken up, and carried indoors, and died.</p>

I am a surgeon in partnership with Dr. Morris, at Percy Circus, Clerkenwell—on 5th September I was called to the deceased, Dr. Morris having seen him on the Monday—I found him sitting on a couch on the first floor, very feverish and tremulous; his breathing was short, and he complained of pains all over his body, and of having been beaten—I found a puffy swelling on the upper part and another on the fight side of his head—the skin was not broken—I found a narrow wound from his right temple along the right side of his cheek, about four inches long, and two small bruises over his right boulder and another across his right forearm—he had congestion of the left lung—his head was tender to the touch—those injuries might have been inflicted with this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I attended him till his death, at 2 a.m., on the 9th, from disease of the lungs.</p>

I am manager to Henry Gray, Jun., a lighterman, of 19, Wafer Lane—we <hi rend="italic">do the lighterage for the</hi> London and St. Katha<lb/>rine Dock Co.—at the end of April last we received instructions from the Dock Company to convey a quantity of ivory ex Pekin from the Albert Docks to the London Docks—I employed a man named Vorley to bring his barge into the Albert Docks on the 27th, Friday—I did not tee the ivory then—I saw it and counted it in the London Docks on Monday, 30th April, about 12.30—when I counted the tusks they were covered <hi rend="italic">in</hi> canvas—there were 48 small ones of this description and size and four large ones (<hi rend="italic">parcels produced</hi>)—there were four bales or packages wrapped in hides—I should say at once, having seen so many of this kind of packages, that they were tusks—the tusks were marked "E S"—I am referring to a note made at the time—the outer covering and the tusk itself were marked the same—I saw them all afterwards in the warehouse; they all bore "ES"—the bales were marked "C A A" internally on the tasks themselves, and "CA S" on the outside—I did not find the "Pekin" on them, that was marked on after it reached the London Docks—I informed the police.</p>

I first saw the ivory at the London Docks—the man who was employed would have discharged his duty then—three men were employed to bring it from the Albert to the London Docks, Vorley, Harris, and another man whose name I forgot; the three were employed for the purpose <hi rend="italic">of</hi> giving relief—the unloading into the barge began on Friday; he did not leave the Albert Dock till 3 on Sunday morning—the loading was not finished till Saturday, and then he would have to wait for the tide on Sunday morning to come out of the Albert Dock—with goods of value we are always anxious to complete the loading on the same day to make the time as short as possible—it commenced about 2—as far as I can judge one tusk formed a package by itself, marked "ES" on the package, and those I examined at the London Docks had "ES" on the tusk itself also—I believe the ivory is from Zanzibar—I have been employed before to carry ivory from one dock to another—a very large quantity of ivory arrives in this country, and possibly a large quantity with such marks on as these—I cannot explain why "C A S" is on the outside and "C A A" on the end—I don't deal in ivory.</p>

I am foreman of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> ivory department at the London Docks—on Monday, 30th April, we received four bales and 48 tusks into the warehouse—a deficiency of three packages was reported to me; I examined them—the tusks were wrapped in gunny, a coarse sort of cauvas, on the outside of which was marked "C.S.," "C.A.S.," and "P E."—I examined the tusks themselves; this is one of them—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188310150038"/>
               <p>was "C.A.A." on the face of it—the outside of the gunny of the large ones was marked "E. 8." in black, and on the tooth itself "E.S." in red—on the centre of the tooth was marked a Zanzibar stamp in black with a number and Arabic figure underneath it—there is a similar mark on the smaller one where it has been cut—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the large tusks found at Fennell's; the Zanzibar stamp is obliterated here; the red "E.S." is erased; there are no traces of red letters; you can see where it has been erased, it has been scratched in the same place as it is on the others, about the position of the red mark on the other—the Zanzibar mark is nut there—it is scratched on the same position where you find the Zanzibar mark on the other tusks—there is a slight indication that there has been something there very similar to the Zanzibar mark on the others—I have had over 20 years' experience of ivory—this piece shown me by the police is very similar in size, quality, and every way—the mark outside the bales was "C.A.S."—I examined the ivory in them—this is one of the tusks in them—there were no other marks on the tusks by which I could identify them—on this from one of the bales there was the Zanzibar mark with the Arabic number and letters, and on the face of it "C.A.A." in black, and a few foreign marks on the front here—the ship's name is put on by the Company—there were no other marks on it when it reached us—on this piece which the police have shown me I can trace "C" and a portion of the two A's—it looks reddish here on account of its being erased—I should say from my experience of ivory marks that it was originally black—there is no Zanzibar mark—there is an appearance as if something had been erased—there is the mark of an erasure at the end of this piece; a portion of the "C" is left, only there is a scratching at the side where the Zanzibar mark is on the other piece—I have the weight of certain ivory shown me by the police; I have not weighed it nor seen it weighed; Mr. Saint did, I believe—I weighed what we received; I did not weigh any produced by the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. In many cases where we erased black marks they became red in the process—we erase marks sometimes—I could not trace any marks on the large tusks at all—they are marked as a rule, but not always, there are exceptions; some of a consignment are marked, and some not—all the Zanzibar ivory is not marked "C.A.A.," that is the shipper's mark on this parcel—I found it on the ivory that I examined at the London Docks—we have had that shipper's mark before, several consignments of it—sometimes it has the Zanzibar mark on and sometimes not—I do not see any Zanzibar mark on this, and no trace of obliteration—I think this red mark is the remains of a black "C," and not part <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the grain—it is in the same position—we frequently have similar consignments bearing similar marks—I have no other pieces of the bale here—I examined every piece in the four bales; every tooth is marked—each piece contained the mark "C.A.A." exactly like that—I won't be certain if each had the Zanzibar mark; it is not necessary that each should be marked with the Zanzibar mark; we did not look at that, it may be every one had it on—I do not find a trace of the Zanzibar mark on all these—the ivory we receive passes out again into the public market for distribution and sale.</p>

I live at Manchester, and am a general commission agent—I have dune business with Fennell for some time—I received this telegram from him on 1st May: "I have 250 lb. fine tusk ivory; can you do with them? say early"—I seat him this telegram in answer: "Send ivory to goods department, Sheffield Station, to my order; no doubt I can sell it there; send full instructions to-night" (<hi rend="italic">Then followed directions to send indigo in the same way to Manchester</hi>)—I received this letter marked "C," dated 2nd May; the writing is similar to that I have been in the habit of receiving from Mr. Fennell. (<hi rend="italic">This dated that he sent ivory, very fine indeed; that if he referred to the "Public Ledger" of the 28th he would find all he wanted to know; that he must get the market price for it, and that it would do for billiard balls, that there were two large tusks at about</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per cwt., and that if he could not all it the carriage back would be paid</hi>)—then I wrote him a letter; this is the press copy. (<hi rend="italic">This confirmed his telegram, and staled that doubtless he could dispose of the ivory at Shiffield to some of the cutlers, and that if he would let him know what was the lowest price he would accept, he would try to get as much more as he could</hi>)—I referred to the <hi rend="italic">Public Ledger</hi> to see the current price—I received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the letter "C" as a sort of memorandum: "Elephants' teeth, 2 cwt. 1 qr. 19lb., at 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." (<hi rend="italic">And then quoting the indigo</hi>)—I could not obtain the price named for the ivory, and on 12th May received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner: "Dear Sir,—Let the case at the Midland Station remain; do not offer it in any way, and I will see what I can do with it"—on 13th May I received this: "Will you kindly send back the case from Sheffield as soon as you can?"—I sent instructions to the railway company at Sheffield to forward it back to Garford Street—I had the indigo removed to my office; it was never sold, and I returned it to Inspector Reed—it is the quantity described in the invoice, none of it was sold.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. As far as I knew 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the full market price for the ivory—I formed my opinion from the <hi rend="italic">Public Ledger</hi>—I made attempts to sell it at Sheffield, but did not at that price—I did not offer it myself personally; I left it with a gentleman to whom I was introduced—I could not find a purchaser at Sheffield at 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cwt., and then Fennell had it returned to his own place of business—I have done business with Fennell for two or three years, and have received various kinds of goods from him—I have seen two of his places of business in London, one in the West India Road and one in Garford Street—he carried on a pretty extensive business as far as I could see—I have seen all kinds of goods both new and old lying on his premises—I know nothing about advancing money on goods—I had had from him before indiarubber, indigo, and wool; I may have had other things, but no ivory before—our correspondence with regard to the ivory was transacted in the same way as with respect to the other goods; there was no difference in the nature of the commission—it is not unusual for him to send a tele<lb/>gram that he has goods and wishes me to dispose of them—sometimes I bought, but in most cases I sold on behalf of Mr. Fennell in his name for a commission—I disclosed his name to the persons to whom I sold in</p>

               <p>Manchester and Sheffield—if I had sold the ivory in Sheffield it would have been sold in the name of Charles Fennell—the indigo came to Manchester about the same time as the ivory—I took the indigo to my warehouse, not the ivory—I had the indigo under offer and endeavoured to bell it I did not see Mr. Fennell between May 2nd and the early days in June, when the difficulty arose—whatever passed between us was by this correspond<lb/>once which has been disclosed—I have been 21 years in business in Manchester on my own account—I think Mr. Fenuell got first to know my name through my being an indiarubber manufacturer there; he offered me indiarubber; then when I ceased to be a manufacturer I bought goods of him and sold goods on commission for him.</p>

Knight did not hear the conversation till he was asked for the keys—I believe Knight is a servant—Simley was in Fennell's employment—I don't know if he is here to-day; he would know Knight's exact position—Knight unlocked the door, and when I said I must have the case opened Knight opened it with a hammer, and then while opening it Fennell said "What is it?" and as he was opening it said "Ivory"—I think I sent to Mr. Wontner that day or the following to tell him about the conversation with Knight on the 22nd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Ballenger, a builder, of Adelaide Road, St. John's Wood, and have been in his employ nearly three years—he gave me this letter on 12th September: "45, Warden Road,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188310150047"/>
               <p>Kentish Town. Mr. Ballenger,—Hampton informs me that yon did not like me because I did not speak out. I will now commence with Hampton. Many things have been missing: two brass taps, one from the butt that was cut up and another from the cistern in Carlisle Street He said that would do for a job he had on hand at 17, Gloucester Road; he has been doing repairs. Again, when at Ealing, he distempered a kitchen right out and charged for the same and booked his time on to my time. The curtains he stole, only me and the carman knew anything about it. When yon told him he must have them he said he had left them in the cupboard. That was untrue. He came and asked my advice, when I told him to take them back. He said he would say he had been to Ealing for them and charge yon for it. He said he had often lent you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go on with it, so you could not say anything when Hampton was estimating bills for contracting; so cease to blame others until you find whether this is true. Many things have been missing that others have been blamed for. I send my name in full, and you can use it for what you like, Edward Smith."—There is no truth in that letter—it is in the prisoner's writing; I have seen him write once since he has been on bail—I can also swear to his writing by his time<lb/>sheets—he was not in Mr. Ballenger's employ at the time he wrote this letter—I believe this time-sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in his writing—the time between his leaving the employ and writing that letter would be about a month—I spoke to him once after he left, and said we had a job, to under<lb/>pin a house, and if we started very likely we should want him—I had not seen him since till the receipt of the letter, when I went to see him the same night.</p>

I am an engineer in charge of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Station, Commercial Road East—on 21st September a constable called me to Pell Street with an engine and men, and on arriving I saw Wells at the first-floor window—he called for a hand<lb/>pump—I handed him up buckets, and got in at a window, went down to the street door, and found it looked inside and bolted at the top—Evans was brought to me in the front room, ground floor, and I said "Can you account for the two separate fires?"—he said that he could not, and I also asked Holman, who said she did not know anything about it, that she went to bed upstairs, and was awoke by a sense of suf<lb/>focation, and called the man—Evans said "I went to bed; I was reading a newspaper for some time, and fell asleep, and woke up by the smoke, and jumped up at if I was suffocated, and called to the woman, and hunted and found the rope, which I had had in the house five years, with which I assisted in getting her down into the street—a police sergeant was called in—he was shown the two distinct fires, and took the prisoners away—I saw a candlestick near the bed in the first-floor front room—there was no candle in it; it was burnt, and one corner of the bed had been burnt, and a table which was before the fireplace, which was blocked up by a canvas screen, and the table was very much burnt—it was two or three feet from the end of the bed, which was burnt—the floor between was not charred—there was nothing to show any connection between the fire which burnt the table and that which burnt part of the bedclothes—I think there had been a cover on the table—the bed appeared to have been slept in—there was, I think, no. carpet in the room—none of the other bedrooms appeared to have been occupied that night—I asked Evans what the cupboard it the bottom of the stairs had contained—he said "Old bills and papers"—the dresser adjoining it was slightly damaged by fire; the end nearest the cupboard was scorched—a bed cover which was lying in a heap on the floor between the table and the cupboard was burnt in two or three little holes, as if fire had fallen on it—it might have got kicked about—it was saturated with water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The top of the bed was about the same height as the table, and supposing the fire in that room to have originated on the table or mantelshelf a flame might very well have licked across from one to the other—it was about two or three feet, more or less—I said before the fire in the first-floor front room may have been one fire—a small towel had been hanging on the rope, which was partially burnt; that was all I saw on the floor; none were left on the rope—the cupboard which was burnt was two or three feet square—nearly the whole of it was destroyed—it was</p>

               <p>built over the entrance to the basement—Evans speaks with a foreign accent—I had a difficulty in understanding him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have not the least doubt that he said he had had the rope five years—he said that in plain English—it was the foot of the bed which was burnt—Mr. Campbell, the superintendent of the Fire Brigade, was there.</p>

On September 21st I was on duty at Leman Street Station—the prisoners came in with two con<lb/>stables—I asked Harris what it was in the prisoners' presence—he said it was in connection with a fire in St. George's Street—Sergeant Wright came in in a few minutes and said "There was a fire in St. George's Street, in two places, which it was impossible could have com<lb/>municated with each other, and the beet thing he could do was to bring the prisoners in"—they were brought in; no charge had then been entered against them—Sergeant Foster then came in and said to me "What have you done in the matter?"—I said "Simply nothing"—he said "I am pleased with that," or "That is all right; it is a case which requires very careful inquiries; I do not know whether it will be a charge or not, I shall have to question them to hear if they can give any account of the matter"—he then separated them and put questions to each of them, and after they had been answered they were charged with setting fire to the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the police-court on the 28th September—no doubt Inspector Foster had been called before me, and Wright and the other constable, but I was not there on the first occasion—I did not hear that there had been a cross-examination about the numerous questions which had been put to the prisoners; the only thing Mr. Foster said was "I think I shall require you on the remand," and I was questioned by the Solicitor to the Treasury—the prisoners were in custody before Foster came to this extent, that if they had wanted to go away I should not have allowed them to go out of the yard.</p>

I am manager at the works of John and Henry Wright, ropemakers—Crane and Lane were both in their employment, Lane as a labourer in the warehouse, Crane as a carman—on Saturday we close about 1 o'clock in the afternoon—when closed the keys are usually hanging up at the gate—I have seen a quantity of rope at Fennell's premises, in possession of the police, which I believe was manufactured by our firm—I saw some Manilla rope at Arbour Square Police-station—I believe that wan my employers' property—we had tome of that same kind manufactured specially for us—I saw two other pieces of white rope at Fennell's warehouse; it was manufactured at my employers' for a special purpose—I believe there were three other coils of rope there; one is small warp, 3 1/2-inch, that was made specially for our firm, and was new—there was a 5-inch coil, which I identified from its being tied up in a particular way—the 5-inch was in stock last to my know<lb/>ledge at Christmas—I knew Fennell by sight—Crane baa been in our service 11 years—the value of the Manilla rope was about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this large coil of tarred hemp 1 identify as Messrs.

During the years that Crane has been in the service I have never found a single act of dishonesty except this—I made inquiries after the case was brought up; I found nothing else but this that I could bring against him—in the ordinary course of business Crane would go out with his cart in the morning usually, and when he first came in he would have his orders, and where he was to go to—he never knew till the morning where he would have to go as a rule—sometimes, if it was anything special, he would know the night before—I think Crane was using his own cart that day—I can't say whether it was the ordinary cart that he used, Mr. Heibel can tell that.</p>

Wright's cart standing unattended at the corner of the street, outside a beerhouse about 200 yards from Fennell's—previous to that I had been to the first floor of Fennell's warehouse in Emmett Street and found two coils of hemp rope, two coils of ratline rope, which I had shown to Laidlaw, who identified them as his property—the rope was between a pile of oakum and other goods at the back end of the warehouse.</p>

I live at Lincoln Terrace, Clapham Junction, and am a German—I was formerly a captain in the German merchant service—in June last I was in Germany and saw an advertisement in a paper, and in consequence wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the prisoner—I got this reply—I understand German and am thoroughly acquainted with English—my solicitor translated the letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that his salary would be</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">marks a week, and that 1501. in cash was to be deposited with the prisoner at 5 per cent, or in the bank</hi>)—subsequently, on the 26th, I came to England—I saw the prisoner on that day—he was living at 2, Margaret Street, Cavendish Square—I ascertained that his business was getting up concerts and balls and trying to sell tickets—I was to act as cashier and</p>

Adam Street I could not find the solicitor—I went to the German Consul to know what steps to take, and lie sent me to a solicitor, Mr. Goldberg, of Finsbury Circus, and when I came home the prisoner had gone away without his clothes—he gave me no notice that he was leaving, and left no address; I did not know where he had gone to—I received this letter in English of 28th August on the 30th; it is not dated from any place. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the statement,</hi> "I have had 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of your money, which I owe you")—I went to the bank on the 29th and was shown these three deposit notes—the signature on this first for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "Otto Stoeckius," is not in my writing—I did not authorise the prisoner or any one else to sign it for me, and I had no knowledge that he had done so—I did not write the signatures on these others for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor authorise them to be written—with his letter there was returned to me by the prisoner this deposit note for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been taken out of the bank and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left.</p>

               <p>shortly afterwards came out with a bag on his back, which he put in the van and then returned to the office and brought out a second, which he put in the van and drove away—I saw through the window that May was in the sample-room on the ground floor—I followed the van and felt one of the bags, which I could feel wan coffee—I marked them while the van was going along—it stopped at 70, Lower Thames Street, where the carman took the two bags into the house, which is let out as as offices—Howard has an office on the third floor, which I knew—I after<lb/>wards communicated with Messrs. Carey and Browne, and received instructions, in consequence of which I went to Lower Thames Street—Howard was not there—I left a constable there to watch the premises and went to Garland's public house, Leadenhall Street, where I saw Howard—I followed him out for about 30 yards, towards the Bank, when I said "Howard, I want to speak to you"—he said "All right, Mr. Hutt, what is it?"—we knew each other—I said "I am going to take you into custody for receiving two bags of coffee this morning"—I did not say "knowing they were stolen"—he said "I know nothing about it; I have had no coffee"—I said "You will have to make some one else believe that, because I saw it delivered at your place this morning"—he said "I have not had a bit of stuff since I have been out, only from the warehouses and docks"—I took him to Seething Lane Station, where I asked him for the key of his office—he said "I have not got it, my brother has it"—I said "Where shall I find your brother?"—he said "I don't know"—I then went to 70, Lower Thames Street, and saw the housekeeper, Mrs. Wood, and got the key—I had not actually seen the bags delivered on the third floor—I went up to the office on the third floor—the prisoner trades in the name of Gregory and Nephew—in the office I found the two bags which I had marked in the morning—I then had them taken to the police-station, locked the door, and came away—each bag weighs 1 cwt.—I marked them with ink—I went back to Messrs. Carey and Browne, in whose presence I saw May—Mr. Browne said to May "These two men," meaning Halse and myself, "say there were two bags of coffee that went from here this morning"—he did not answer—I said "Do you mean to say you do not know Howard?"—he said "No"—I said "I saw two bags go out of your employers' premises at 8.40"—he replied "There was nothing that went out of here"—May was head porter there—Mr. Carey said "John, do you mean to say there were not two bags that went from here"—he said "Well, yes, there were, Sir; they were sweepings"—Mr. Carey said "You know you have no right to dispose of that, as that is our property"—he said "We cleaned it and sent it away"—May said to another man, Ray, who was charged at the police-court, and said he knew nothing of it, "I have made a clean breast of it"—Mr. Browne then gave them in custody, and they were taken to the station—May and Ray were charged with stealing, and Howard with receiving—I searched Howard and found a gold watch, which he was wearing, and two deposit notes in the Monarch Building Society; one was dated 1st May, 1883, for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 20th July, 1883, for 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I searched 70, Lower Thames Street with Halse, and found a quantity of coffee, cocoa, indigo, gutta-percha, and miscellaneous articles—some of the coffee was in bags and some loose on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Carey and Browne, general brokers, of 36, Mincing Lane—on 29th September, Hutt and Halse came to my office and made a communication to me—we knew May as John—I called him in, and said "John, what is this about two bags of coffee?"—he said "I know nothing about two bags of coffee"—Hutt said "What, you do not know Howard? I have seen you drinking with him scores of times"—he made no answer—Mr. Carey then said "John, is there any truth about these two bags or not?" or words to that effect—John hesitated a few minutes, and then said "Well, sir, I will tell you the truth; two bags did go out this morning; me and Ray did it"—Mr. Carey said to him "You know they were not your property; what right had they to go?"—I cannot say the exact words, but something like that—he said nothing that I recollect—Ray was then called up—May said in his presence "You may as well make a clean breast of it as I have"—that is the whole of the conversation—they were taken to the station, and I charged them, and examined these bags of coffee—I cannot identify either the coffee or the bags—I should say they are not sweepings—it is perfectly clean and whole—there might be a certain amount of sweepings in them, because they said they had cleaned the sweepings—it is not the custom for the porters to take the sweepings, and May was perfectly aware of that—we have sever allowed our servants to do so at any time—I estimate the value of this coffee at 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., duty paid—I have ascertained that if the sweepings were collected they would amount to about 301b. a week.</p>

I am chief cashier at the Army and Navy Stores, Victoria Street—the prisoner was a check clerk in the grocery de<lb/>partment from 27th October, 1879, to 2nd July, 1883, when he was taken into custody—the customer wakes out the bill himself in most cases—the duties of a check clerk aw to check the items, and see if they are properly entered on the slip, cast up the bill, enter, the ticket number of the member, the name and the amount of the bill in the check book, stamp the bill with a blue stamp, number it, and pass it through a slit in the partition to the cashier who sits next to him; then the cashier enters the number of the bill, the name of the customer, and the amount of the bill in the cash-hook, and receives the money from the customer, and stamps the bill with a red stamp—if the goods are to be taken away the bill is returned to the member, if the goods are to be sent the bill is filed—at the end of the day the check clerk adds up his book, the cashier does the same, and the two should agree—they compared them with one another at that time—the course of business has been altered since—the check clerk then initials the cashier's book for the amount of his total for the day, the cashier makes up his money and passes it over to me—I compared the totals at that time, and saw that they were signed for by the check clerk in the cash-book—I did not see whether the totals of the two books corresponded; that was done by the accountants next day—I compared the totals in the cashier's book—the next day the accountant compared the two bills—it was his duty to add up the accounts and sec if the totals were correct—one book was the counterpart of the other, and if right there would be no suspicion of any<lb/>thing wrong—the prisoner and each check clerk had a separate stamp—this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is 1st July, 1882, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and bears the prisoner's stamp—this on 5th July bears his stamp, and is for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10th July 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 11th July 9th.—they are all stamped—12th July 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 27th July 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9th August 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 21st August 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know the prisoner's handwriting—this is his check<lb/>book—on 1st July, 1882, at page 111, Book A, is an entry in prisoner's writing, the customer's number and name, 46788, Mrs. Lerroyd, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I stated to the best of my belief that the prisoner had been in the service of the Stores only 18 months—he came there in October, 1879, with a strong recommendation from Messrs. Travers and Son, of Cannon Street, wholesale grocers, one of the highest firms in the trade—I don't know he was there 16 months, and left in consequence of a reduction of their staff—I have no reason to doubt that his father is a very re<lb/>spectable man, living at Brixton, and carrying on business—I did not make inquiries—his first wages, in October, 1879, were 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; about May 1881, he was raised by half-a-crown; about August, 1881, by another half crown; about February, 1882, by another half crown—in August, 1882, by another half crown, so that in August, 1882, he was getting 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and these were his wages when the matter was investigated—the cashier sat in the middle of two check clerks at that time—we have altered the system since the discovery of great frauds—there was one check clerk on Ryon's right and one on his left—the prisoner first acted as relief clerk, as cheek clerk merely for an hour or two at a time—that lasted about 18 months, and ceased in February, 1882—that would account for my saying he was there about 18 months—Rvon pleaded guilty to embezzling 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Mrs. Learoyd's money, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Street's amount, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Patrick's amount—that was the only charge preferred against him—he had six months' imprisonment—I can't say if he made a statement to the solicitor for the prose<lb/>cution—when Ryon pleaded guilty he said "I can truly gay that</p>

               <p>Goldsmith had none of the money"—the first count with regard to Mrs. Learoyd's bill on 1st July for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is one of the charges for which Ryon was sentenced—the fourth count with regard to entering 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Mr. Patrick's account was also a charge of em<lb/>bezzlement, to which Ryon pleaded guilty—the prisoner and Ryon were indicted together on that indictment, at the last Session—that was the only indictment against them—I left the matter entirely in the hands of Mr. Dutton, the solicitor—I don't remember the prisoner being first, placed at No. 4 desk—I believe I had a cashier named Denny—Fraser was a cashier—it is impossible to say where he was, they change so often—there would be a record of it—Ryon left for his holiday at the end of September, 1882—Dawson was cashier in his absence for about a fortnight—Dawson is not in the service of the Stores now—we make no charge against him—the entries made during the time Dawson was cashier have not been checked—we have not searched to see if there were any fictitious entries when the prisoner had an honest cashier—I had a cashier named Burton—I believe he took Ryon's place after the holidays—I believe he was cashier, and the prisoner check clerk, for some months—no charge has been made against Burton—he left the service of the Stores early this year—that was before any charge was made against Ryon or the prisoner—I can't say where he is—I make no imputation on his honesty—it would have been impossible to see whether during the month he was check clerk to Burton every entry was correct; we merely obtained sufficient evidence for the prosecution—we indicted him for eight instances—the prisoner was put in a new 100m in the grocery department, where Mr. Stevens was a cashier—Stevens is still in our service—I presume he is an honest man—the system was altered when they were together—it was altered about Christmas last—a more perfect check was put on the department—you may take it that it was impossible for Stevens to em<lb/>bezzle, but he has been in the service a long time—the cashier is now entirely separated from the check clerk; he is in a different part of the room—the cashiers sit together, and the check clerks sit together—if the cashiers make a mistake in tasting columns, and take too little money from the customer, we make the cashier responsible for the difference—we do not divide it between the cashier and checking clerk—the check clerk is a check on the cashier—if it is the check clerk's mistake, and we do not receive it, he will pay the difference—if he casts it short, and it is a gross error, he is called on to pay—it depends on circumstances what is a gross or what a trivial error—I don't know that I have ever enforced the penalty of making the clerk pay—I don't call to mind that I have ever made a check clerk pay for a gross error in casting—I will not swear that they have not been made to pay—no gratuities are given to the check clerks—gratuities given to the cashiers depend on the accuracy with which they perform their duties—we make them responsible for any little inaccuracies by withdrawing from them their gratuities—I don't know of any maximum punishment of withdrawal of gratuities previous to dis<lb/>missal—Sims was a cashier for four or five years; he is in the correspond<lb/>ence office of the Stores now—he in an honest man—he was in the depart<lb/>ment when the prisoner was check clerk—I don't remember them ever having been together—he may have succeeded Stevens at that desk this year—all tie frauds took place last year—there could have been no dis<lb/>crepaucies in the prisoner's checking while Sims was cashier—I have not</p>

               <p>gone through Sims's books when the prisoner was his check clerk—Tren<lb/>dall is a cashier still in our employment, and an honest man, I trust—I don't remember his ever being with the prisoner, he as cashier and the prisoner as check clerk—I could not swear, it is so long ago—I have not looked at the books of that time to see if there are any discrepancies—Trendall only joined a few months ago—there is no person in the em<lb/>ployment of the Stores who has given evidence against the prisoner ex<lb/>cept myself—it was the duty of the check clerk to write the amount in the book from the bill—I have had no interviews with Ryon—I don't know from any one that Ryon has purposely sent the prisoner away from the desk for change, and used his stamp in his absence—Ryon has made a statement I believe since he was sentenced, and that it was written down.

               <p>would be no use the check clerk making false entries unless the cashier made the same—last year our only mode of checking was by comparing the totals of the check clerk and the cashier, and unless there was collusion no offence could be committed—besides the eight cases in the indictment there are other cases where Ryon was cashier which are not included in this in<lb/>dictment—I and the prisoner were present when Ryon was taken into custody—I heard Ryon, in the prisoner's presence, say something to the effect that "They will find the books all right; when receiving money from the customers we entered them sometimes under, sometimes over the amount tendered, and the totals are ail right"—I did not hear the prisoner make a statement—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day if his totals were correct applied only to the cashier, and had nothing to do with the check clerk—his wages were 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">In custody</hi>). I was employed by the Army and Navy Stores in Victoria Street—I entered their service on 29th August, 1881, and after about nine mouths acted as cashier—I did so during July and August, 1882—the prisoner was one of the check clerks—he sat on one side of me and another check clerk on the other—there was no lock to his desk—I used the prisoner's stamp when he was there checking other customers' bills—I afterwards, when we were at work, told him what bills I had put his stamp upon and the number of the customer's bill the name, and the amount—I pleaded guilty last Session to the charges in respect to Learoyd's, Street's, and Patrick's—those were cases in which I had put on his stamp and mine—he had no portion of the money, the difference between the amount entered and the amount paid by the customer—I called out to him the smaller amount to be entered by him—that was the case in respect of Mr. Patrick, 11th July, when 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was entered instead of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the difference being 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the bill in my figures and the customer's—I put his stamp on that bill—he had no portion of the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the initials are the counterman's—the bill looks like the counterman's writing; it is not the prisoner's writing—he could write it if he were asked—the bill is stamped for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here the amount is 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I embezzled in that respect 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had none of the money, and knew in no way of my misconduct—I was taken up to the accountant's office on 2nd July, when Chamberlain was there—I saw some bills, I think Learoyd's was one of them; yes, this is the one—Chamberlain before that said he was a police officer—I was asked some questions by Mr. Yeldham and Mr. Francis—I think it was Chamberlain who asked me whether I could account for the deficiencies, and I paid "No" at the time, and Chamberlain said "You will have to tell some one else that tale"—I think I was taken to the police-station then—I think the prisoner was asked the same questions as I was—I cannot remember his saying any<lb/>thing—I think he said "If you look at our books you will see some of the bills are entered over the amount"—I think there was a sum of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the difference between Mr. Street's account and the amount I paid over; that I embezzled—at this interview, when Chamberlain said we should have to tell the story elsewhere, the prisoner said that was an amount which he had not checked and not entered in his book at all—that was referred to in Chamberlain's presence—he was check clerk while I was cashier at that desk—we were together so for about nine or ten months</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188310150079"/>
               <p>—I went for a holiday at the end of August, 1882—I don't know who was his cashier then—I could not mention the time during which I was taking money—whatever time it was the prisoner had no knowledge at all of it—I made a statement to the Governor of Coldbath Fields Prison; it was put down in writing, and he said he would send it to the prosecution—that did not vary from the statement I have made to-day that the prisoner had nothing to do with it—it is quite true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I pleaded guilty, and was sentenced last Session to six months' hard labour, which I am now undergoing—I was taken to the same room with the prisoner on 2nd July, and was charged with having committed certain embezzlements with him of moneys at the Stores—no other check clerks were present—I then said "You will find the books all right"—I said "When receiving money from a customer we entered them sometimes over and sometimes under the amounts, but the totals were all right"—that was true; I mean to say that when the prisoner made a mistake in his bill in casting up, to save getting seen by the foreman he toed to knock it off the next one—that is not embezzlement—I have robbed the Stores of a few pounds—I swear that I did it all myself—the prisoner did not assist me; nobody assisted me—it was not embezzlement in those cases when we entered sometimes over and sometimes, under—in Learoyd's bill it is the case—Learoyd's was one of the bills produced on that occa<lb/>sion, and one of the cases I have pleaded guilty to for embezzling the money of my employers—there was also another bill in which I pleaded guilty to embezzling their money on that occasion—I did not mean these bills when I spoke of our sometimes entering over and sometimes under the amount—I was accused of this very embezzlement of Learoyd in the prisoner's presence; I pleaded guilty to it—sometimes we entered amounts under the amounts and sometimes over the amounts to make up for other amounts that we have entered deficiently; when we made a mistake, to save taking the books up to the foreman we would enter a bill under the amount to make up for that allowance—I was not alluding to these cases, but to certain other bills not relating to these, or anything of the kind—I was in a box between two check clerks—my box is separated from theirs by a wooden partition in which is a little slit, through which it is the duty of the check clerk to pass the bill to the cashier—there is only room for one person in the check clerk's box—I affixed the stamp to these seven bills—I reached over the partition and got it from the prisoner's desk—I used to say "Lend me your stamp for a minute"—a lot of customers were round the desk, and I reached over and got it and used it—I told him to enter a false amount in his check book—I did not give him the bill; I handed it back to the customer—I can remember giving some of them back—I could not point out any now, it was a long time ago—I remember these because they have got my figures in the corner—Learoyd's bill I know I gave back to the customer, and Thomson's, Jones's, and Stannard's—I cannot recollect any others—I remember Learoyd's because I knew the price and I stamped it and gave it back to the customer—I did it in about 20 cases I should think—I cannot say I have taken my employers' money in all these cases, in some of them I have—when there is a false entry in the prisoner's book corresponding to my false entry I told the prisoner to enter it falsely and in every case I committed an embezzlement—I handed the bills back to the customers—I cannot say in every case—when I did not hand them back I</p>

               <p>usually put them on a file if they had to be sent—I cannot say whether the prisoner ever asked to look at a bill—I used to say over the top "Enter up" so and so—he never asked to look at a bill, though I had leant over the top and said I would stamp it—I could stand on the perch of the stool and reach over—he never asked to look at a bill whether it was filed or given to a customer—Mr. Yeldham and the police officer spoke to me about the charge on 2nd July—I said "You will find them all right," and it was then Chamberlain said "You will have to tell that tale to some one else"—it was not quite correct to say "You will find them quite correct"—the first thing I said when asked about it by Jupe was that I did not know anything at all about it—I think three bills were shown me; I cannot recollect any more—those were the three to which I pleaded guilty—I cannot remember when it was I said to Jupe "I used to take money for the prisoner"—I used to take the bill I mean—I cannot remember whether until the day I was sentenced I suggested to anybody that the prisoner was not a party with mo in this fraud—he was brought up with me at the police-court week after week from 2nd July to 7th August—I can't remember saving a word about the prisoner's being innocent until I was called upon here last August—I was asked at the police-court if I had anything to say and cautioned; I think I said "I am not guilty"—I did not say a word about the prisoner not being guilty because I was not asked anything about him—I was committed for trial for embezzling sums of money with him—I was not asked about him—I never said anything about it when we were brought up week by week—I have no reason for not doing so—I mentioned it because I thought it was a pity that an innocent man should suffer—I did not give it a thought when I was in the House of Detention—Mr. Keith Frith appeared for me here—my solicitor was Mr. Wells—I told him all about the embezzlement—my friends instructed Mr. Wells—he appeared for me once at the police-court, I cannot say when, and then Mr. Rymer appeared for me—I did not tell them what I have told the Court and Jury now about the prisoner—I did not tell my solicitor anything about the prisoner—I had no reason to—I have made the statement here for the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I said "Hand me your stamp for a minute, there are a number of persons here," there were a number of persons round the desk, and I put his stamp on my bills—unless goods are sent by the carrier the customer needs the cashier's stamp before he can get his goods at the counter—if goods were to be sent the bill would have the address on—one of these bills in the name of Myers had the address on, 59, Russell Square, and the Duke of Sutherland's is addressed Stafford House, S.W.—with the exception of those two I must have given them back if they had no address on—they could not have got the goods without the bills—I entered in the cash-book only the person's name and the amount—I put the ticket number on the comer of the bill for the prisoner to enter in his check-book—when I was speaking to my friends about getting legal assistance I had to think of my own defence—when I was asked in the other Court what I had to say I said "Goldsmith is truly innocent of it"—after I was sentenced I told the Chaplain the prisoner was innocent, and gave details—he referred me to the Governor, and I made a verbal statement to him—I had no communication with any one to induce me to make that statement—it is true.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">In custody</hi>). I am now suffering six month' imprison<lb/>ment in Coldbath Fields Prison.—I was in the employment of the Army and Navy Stores for 16 or 18 months—I went there in May, 1881, and left in December, 1882—no charge was ever made against the prisoner of being jointly concerned with me in any improper conduct there—he never associated with me or any of the Stores men after hours—I found him very silent—I was check clerk in the next desk to him; he was then acting as deck clerk to ryon, and was between me and Ryon—I have seen Ryon use the prisoner's stamp last year, I could not tell how frequently—some<lb/>times when there were a good many customers round the front of his desk, sometimes when not many—Ryon was doing this when the prisoner was engaged in checking long bills, or when he has been absent—I have heard Ryon send the prisoner for change, and while absent I have seen Ryon take his stamp—when the prisoner has come back or finished check<lb/>ing a long series of figures I have heard Ryon tell him to enter certain numbers, names, and amounts—the customers would hare gone—I have only heard him call out one at a time—there was no lock to the prisoner's desk—I heard Ryon say in the other Court when he was asked what he had to say why judgment should not be passed upon him, "Goldsmith is innocent"—it was after that I was asked if I had seen Ryon in possession of the prisoner's stamp—Mr. Paxon asked me that while I was waiting my trial at the House of Detention—Mr. Rymer was my solicitor—I think I had told Mr. Rymer before I saw Mr. Paxon that I had seen Ryon wing Goldsmith's stamp—I expressed a wish to see Mr. Paxon—I saw him in Coldbath Fields Prison last week, and told him a statement similar to what I have told to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Tuck and Sons, fine art pub<lb/>lishers, 72 and 73, Coleman Street—the prisoner was in our employment as a velvet mount cutter and velvet frame maker—these 88 pieces of oleograph and chromolithograph pictures are our property; I value them at about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—I never gave the prisoner permission to take them—on Thursday, 22nd September, he said to me "There are a lot of boards here that are useless; I don't come to business on Saturday, and I should like to earn some more money; I can use these boards up for the pictures that are in the place; I will bronze them while I am at home"—we dose on Saturdays—I said "How much will you charge us for bronzing them?"—he said "A penny each"—I said "Well, you may take two gross home with you of the boards and bring them back as soon as you have finished them"—two gross would be 288—he said "Will you lend me some money to buy the bronze with?"—I said "No, you will be paid to-morrow, and you can lay the money out of your wages, and will pay you for the boards when you bring them back"—he said "All right, sir"—on the next morning, Friday, I had occasion to go up into his room where he works in our establishment—he showed me a pile of boards lying on the table and said "I have got two gross; will that be right?"—I was in a great hurry and so did not count them, but I said "I suppose it is all right"—I did not see him again till the Sunday morning—that is all that took place with reference to the boards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Tuesday and Wednesday in the following week were holidays for the commencement of the Jewish new year; we do not have people at work then—I think the prisoner is a Frenchman—he has been in my employment ten or eleven months—he is not a Jew—these pictures are pieces of larger ones; they are utilised by being put in frames—the prisoner's regular work was not exactly that kind of thing—his business was to cut the remnants of these and make picture frames and any<lb/>thing else I asked him to do—it was rather superior work, the utilising business—we have done it for two or three years—I have employed other people away from my premises to do similar work before this—we do a large business—we never made these picture frames before he came to our place—we have not employed persons to bronze mounts and do this kind of thing before; we buy them ready made—the prisoner has taken home work twice before—I can't tell you the number he took home before or whether they were Scotch views—I did not give him any other work besides—I cannot tell exactly who gave it to him—giving orders is generally confined to myself and Adolf—Adolf and Hermann are not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> All the pieces are almost exactly the same size—the prisoner would make the frame to one size and bronze them like this out<lb/>side piece is done—if goods are taken out of our place, permission to take the exact goods must be given—workmen are not allowed to take a dozen or two as they think fit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a permanent labourer at the Royal Albert Docks—on 10th August I was at No. 2 group and was instructed to take charge of the new jute shed, which is in the opening between Nos. 17 and 19—in the morning I was going down between the sheds, and saw Hopkins rolling a bale of wool from No. 17 shed—I noticed a one-horse van", with "J. Field" on it on a red ground, and two bales of wool on the ground—there ought to have been a tally-clerk present when wool was loaded up—I did not notice one there—I spoke to Hopkins—he said "It is all right"—I went to the quantity foreman's place, he was not there—I went round some little distance to the warehouse foreman, and made a communication to him, in consequence of which I came back to where the van was at No. 17—Hopkins was then gone, nobody was with the horse and van, there were three bales of wool in the van—I remained there for two hours, noboby came there—after that I went with two dock constables to Field's and heard what he said—I saw the prisoner on 20th August in the Royal Albert Dock Hotel—I did not know him before.</p>

I kept gate No. 9 at the Royal Albert Docks on 16th August—about 11 a one-horse van driven by the prisoner came to the gate very slowly from inside the dock, from the front entrance, with three barrels—I said "What are those?"—he said "They are three empties; I brought them in at the front," and that he was waiting for some one, or wanted to see some one—I said "If that is to, there is no need 10 take your van outside, you can leave it here"—he said "I did not know I could do that, I thought the horse would shy at the engines"—he fastened it up to the fence alongside the electric light house, and went outside—I got up to see the barrels—they were empty—in about a quarter of an hour he came back, unloosened his horse, and went away in the direction he had come, along the main road, the way a cart would goto No. 17 shed—I saw the name "Field" on the cart while he was gone—No. 17 shed is quite out of my view—next morning I heard the carmen speaking of a cart being found—I went away for a holiday for about eight days, and when I came back Superintendent Grigg spoke to me—I told him what I have said to-day—on 6th September I was taken with Wilcox to the George, in the Commercial Road, where I saw the prisoner, and I recognised him as the person I had seen with this van—I have no doubt about him.</p>

               <p>August, and in consequence went to where the van was standing, at No. 17—it had Field's name on it, and three bales of wool inside, and a leather apron—no one was in charge of it—I took the address, 3, Devon port Street, Stepney, and went with Earl and Colo to Mr. Field's—we had a conversation with him, and then went for three days in search of the prisoner—we could not ascertain his address from Field or any one else—on Sunday, 19th August, I came across him in Whitechapel Road, and said I wanted to speak to him—Field and Earl came up—Field said "That is the man who hired my van on the 16th"—the prisoner said "Yes, I hired his van, and paid him a half-sovereign deposit"—I told the prisoner I was a detective officer of the London and St. Katherine's Dock Police, cautioned him, and said I wanted to speak to him with reference to three bales of wool found in a van in the Royal Albert Docks—he said "I hired the van to remove three pianos. I met a man near the docks, who told me that the pianos were not ready. We went into a coffee-shop and had some breakfast. The man then borrowed the van to do another small job, saying that he would return in about an hour. I waited for about an hour and a half. Finding he did not come back I felt uneasy, and went in search of the van. I heard that it had been stopped for some goods at the docks. Feeling uncasy, I did not go near the docks"—I then asked him whether he would walk with me to the superintendent of the police of the London and St. Katherine's Docks—he went there with me, and the statement was made to Grigg—I knew nothing of Hopkins or Cole at that moment.</p>

All persons are brought to me before any steps are taken criminally—on Sunday evening, 19th August, the prisoner was brought to me by Wilcox and another constable—I cautioned him—he gave the same statement as he gave to the last witness, very slightly varied, and then went on to say that on the pre<lb/>vious night he, a man named Smith, whom he had known for some years past as steward on a vessel, and a strange man whom he had seen before, fell in with each other at the tramway terminus near the East India Dock gate, and while in conversation, the strange man said he wanted to get a van next morning to remove two pianos, and asked me if I knew where I could get one. I told him I thought I knew. It was then arranged that I should get the van next morning, and meet this strange man at a coffee-shop in Barking Road, near the railway station. I hired Field's van, and paid him half a sovereign as deposit, took the van to the Barking Road coffee-shop, where I met the strange man, and we then went into the coffee-shop. We had a cup of coffee each, and then the strange man said that the pianos were not quite ready; that he had a little job to do at the docks, and would go and do it; that I was to wait while he went and did it, because it would take about an hour to do. I waited at the coffee-shop about an hour and a half, and finding he did not return, went to look after him, and hearing something was wrong, did not go near the docks"—I knew nothing at that time of Hopkins or Cole, and I thought it my duty to let the prisoner go—I instituted inquiries, learned from Hopkins and Cole, and gave instructions for his arrest—no one is allowed to take anything out of the dock without a proper pass.</p>

Between 11 and 12 o'clock, from information, I went to 28, Queen Street, and saw the prosecutor bleeding from a wound under the loft jaw—at 11.45 I met the prisoner in New King Street with his wife—I told him I should take him into custody for stabbing a man a short time ago in Queen Street—he said "I did not do it, for I have not got a knife"—at the station, when charged, he said "I was standing at the corner of Queen Street with my wife and a mate of mine. Roach came up and asked for a light I told him I had not got one. He asked my mate several times; also striking me in the mouth. I then went away, leaving him, and went to the police—station"—he had been drinking, but was not drunk—I searched him but found no knife.</p>

I saw the prosecutor on Monday morning, 1st Oct., about 12 o'clock—my assistant had dressed his wound during the night—it was a very dangerous wound, in a very dangerous position under the left jaw, close to very important bloodvessels, the carotid arteries and jugulars—it was such a wound as would be inflicted by any sharp cutting instrument; the parts being soft no great violence would be required—it would be more likely to be done wilfully than accidentally—I was called to see him because of secondary haemorrhage—a branch of an artery must have been wounded—there was a great deal of swelling about the neck, as if blood had effused under the cellular tissue—I thought it advisable to send him to the hospital—it appeared to me to be a very dangerous wound, a little more might possibly have proved fatal—I think he is now out of danger.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dock Police Superintendent</hi>) On 7th September I was at the Royal Albert Dock, and had an interview with Coker, who was warehouse foreman in charge of No. 18 shed—Mr. Williams said that something had sprung up in reference to some bags of coffee which might turn out a serious matter, and whatever he had to say he had better be cautious—he said "Well, I will tell the whole truth," and went on to say that two or three weeks before August 1st Mr. Furlong, the principal officer of H.M. Customs, came into the shed"—he said 'If you have any coffee sweepings here you had better get rid of them as soon as you can, otherwise there will be a bother about them.' I then went and searched the shed and found 10 bags, which I put into a railway truck to take to the kiln at Victoria Dock to be destroyed, and on the way home I met Moore and told him what I had done and how I was situated. He said 'Don't destroy it; I think I can get a customer for it.' I handed it to Moore with a ticket bearing the number of the truck, and left the matter in his hands"—Moore is a clerk in the Great Eastern Railway Company, and represents them at the Albert Dock—Coker said "I was ashamed of the transaction and did not say anything to my superiors about it"—he also said "I have seen Mr. Wilmot, and what I told him was a lie."</p>

I am a delivery clerk at the Great Eastern Railway, Bishopsgate Street—Parker is depot clerk there, it is his duty to look after the delivery of goods and collect the charges for them—he came to me on 2nd August about 6.45 a.m., and asked if I had seen a consign<lb/>ment of coffee from the Victoria Docks—I ran through a bundle of invoices in my hand and came across this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and asked him if that was the one he wanted—he said "Yes, they are for a friend of mine, let me have the advice note"—I then made out this advice note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and handed it to him, and he went away with it—the goods were consigned to Mr. Morrison—there was no name of Tawney or Morrison on it then—about 9 o'clock Parker came back with another man, who presented this as it is now, "Please deliver the above goods to J. Tawney or bearer, <hi rend="italic">Signed,</hi> Morrison"—I made out this delivery note for the ten bags of coffee and addressed it to Peachy, the lock-up foreman, signing my initials that gave him the right to get the goods at any time that day, and if he did not he would have to come for a fresh order—the man who accompanied him paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. charges, and signed the book J.

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Albert Road, Dalston—I have known Parker four or five years; he was a clerk on the Great Eastern Railway—I have had dealings with him—when he said that they had certain goods I went to see them—sometimes they had butter—I paid Parker the money—he never gave me a receipt—I always made out my cheque to the company—early in July I received a letter from him which I have looked for and cannot find, I suppose it is destroyed; it was, "Please call, I have a sample of coffee from a friend that may be worth your while"—I then went to Parker's office; he sent his clerk to get a sample and said, "A friend of mine has been speculating in a rummage sale and bought some coffee, is it worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound?"—I looked at it and laughed and said, "I should be sorry to give you half for it"—it was royal sweepings, and not suitable for home consumption, and the quantity being small it would be difficult to sell; it was in 10 bags, and it was for export—I said, "I would rather have nothing to do with it," and left—I do not export at all—on 3rd August I received another letter asking me to come and look at 10 bags of coffee—I did not go, and on 4th August I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Asking the witness to call at the station at</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 10.30, <hi rend="italic">as the</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">bags of coffee had arrived and must be sold at a great sacrifice</hi>)—I went to Parker's office, who said, "I have sold the coffee, but the party has not fetched it away; he does not care for it or has not got the money, if you like to have it for the same you can"—I said, "I don't care to have anything to do with it"—he said, "Come on to the <hi rend="italic">bank</hi> and see it"—he took me to Mr. Peachy and said, "Mr. Jones wants to see the 10 bags of coffee, will you show them to him?"——he did so; there were 10 bags tied up at the mouth; he opened them and gave me a small bit out of each—I said that I would take them, and Mr. Parker wrote out this receipt: "Received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for coffee sweepings. For D. Moir, Joseph Parker"—I gave him this cheque, and it has been cashed by my bank—it is "Pay John Parker," because he was going to get it changed to pay me something—lie then said, "I am going on my holidays, and when you want the coffee send your order and they will act on that"—he gave me a delivery order, I did not notice what it was, I think this is it—I see by my pass—book that the cheque was cashed the same day—he said that his friend T. Moore had given 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and if he had made a mistake he must lose by it—I sold the coffee a fortnight afterwards to Mr. Fleet, of Fenchurch Street, for, I think, 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had given 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am district goods manager at the Great Eastern Railway, Bishopsgate—Parker was depot clerk there—Moore was goods agent or clerk in charge at the Royal Albert Dock—about 28th August I received information from Mr. Jones about 10 bags of coffee sweepings; I made inquiries, and on 31st August saw Moore at Bishopsgate—I told him I wanted to know how it was he had anything to do with this coffee, and who the sender was; he said that the sender was a man who had bought it from a rummage sale, and had given "13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." or "15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—I said that there was something very suspicious about it, and it looked very much as if it was stolen, and he must produce the sender to me, otherwise I must suspend him—I am rather confused, as there were so many interviews, and it is difficult to fix dates; I have some pencil memoranda here—I had another interview with him next day, when he produced the sender, and said that what he had said before was untrue, that Coker was the man who told him the coffee sweepings had been ordered away by the Customs, and he had sent them to London to a friend of his named Parker to dispose of for us—Coker came in then, I think, and said "They were given to me by the mate of the steamer" (the Clyde I think he said); "I saw Moore and asked him to dispose of them"—Moore was present, and said that he was to have part of the pro<lb/>ceeds—I think he said that they were to pay Parker a small portion for expenses, and the proceeds were to be divided between three, but after<lb/>wards he added that they were to be divided between Moore and himself, and Parker was to have his expenses—I saw Parker on 3rd September; he said "I know nothing about it, I had the coffee and sold it, but I know nothing about having half of the profits, that is not true"—I said that I had ascertained that the consignee's name was Morrison, and said "Why did you give it in the name of Morrison?" he said "To avoid any difficulty with the Company, because they do not allow any servants to trade"—I then showed him the advice note B and the signatures of Morrison and Tawney; he said that they were both his writing—I do</p>

               <p>not think there is such a person as Morrison—this invoice from the docks is Moore's writing—that first raised my suspicions, because he so seldom invoiced any goods himself, his clerks did it—they would have to be made on that consignment note coming from the shed, and the clerk would make it out from the consignment note—I asked Moore for the consignment note; he said that it was on the file at his office at the docks—I caused a careful search to be made of the office and the files for a week or two, and then told him I could not find it—he then said that there was no note—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Parker's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Parker.</hi> Coker said that he knew nothing of the manner in which the coffee was obtained, and Moore said so as well; that is why I did not discharge you, but suspended you—I was satisfied that you were perfectly innocent, and we kept you in the service till you were appre<lb/>hended—I remember a conversation about a warrant being issued, and a re<lb/>mark was made that it was on your conscience or you would not have gone to the solicitor—you gave me some letters and receipts—a letter from Moore, saying "I enclose copy invoice," is in Court, and on that is the receipt for. the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have got a letter from Moore in which he says, "I send 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to clear all expenses, but it is actually worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another in which he says "I will make things right," and one from Mr. Jones, dated 24th July, in which he says that the coffee is not good enough for the price—I always found you honest and straightforward or I should not have put you in the position of trust you were in—I investigated the case myself, and was perfectly satisfied you were innocent, or I should have discharged you, but I reinstated you in a similar position.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Jones here stated that he believed he had never seen the receipt before, and had nothing to do with the</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—the name of the person who is said to have paid the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi> is Morrison, and the receipt is given in the name of Abbott by Alfred Howard—I do not know who he is, nor can I say anything about the writing; I only know that our clerks had got the money—this was a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Parker in his defence, stated that he met Moore, who asked if he knew any one who would buy some coffee, as he and a friend had been speculating at a rummage sale, which had cost</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.110<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">of it was out of his own pocket, and he was going for a holiday, and wanted to get his money back, and sent him (Parker) a sample next morning, which he showed to Mr. Jones, who declined it on account of the price, and afterwards to Mr. Tawney, who got Mr. Howard to buy it for</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that it was very dirty and mixed with tar and rope.

               <p>Croydon—on Sunday night, 19th August, I was coming up the Pridham Road, some woman stopped me, and my attention was attracted by cries of "Murder!" proceeding from the direction of the prisoner's house—I at once rushed to the front of the house, and I saw the prisoner having hold of the legs of a child in the action of throwing it against the wall—I was looking through the doorway; the door was open—he had the child by its legs in the action of swinging it against the wall—it might have touched the floor at the same time, I can't say—the head hit the wall, that I saw—the boy was standing in the front garden—Mrs. Cole was struggling with the prisoner in the front room; she had hold of him; I could not say in what way—the child went on to the floor—I could not see whether she took it up—I took hold of the prisoner and pulled him outside the front door—he struggled with me, and as we struggled I struck him a blow; he twisted round, and got away from me, and ran up to Mr. Knight—I did not hear what he said to Knight—I did not see him taken into custody—I went back to the house, the child was then in Mrs. Harding's—the prisoner seemed sober.</p>

I am the wife of Richard Harding, of 11, Pridham Road West, next door to the prisoner's—on Sunday, 19th August, about 20 minutes past 10, I was standing at my door—I have known the prisoner, his wife, and children for some time—when I was standing there I saw the prisoner—I heard him when his wife went in, but I did not hear him before—I could not understand the words he said; he was mumbling to his wife—I heard her say to him "Good God, Jim, what are you doing of? you have got my dear baby by the heels, as if you were going to dash its little brains out"—I never heard him make any answer—nothing more was said for a little time—a little while afterwards I heard her say "Oh, he has murdered my baby," and I saw Gilbert pull the prisoner out of his gate by the back of his neck—Mrs. Cole was inside—I then went in and was going to pick the child up at the same time as Mrs. Cole, but I drew my hands back, as she was the mother—I saw her take it up—we could not tell whether it was alive or not till I got it into my house, because it was dark—it was lying lifeless like; it did not cry at all—I saw that it was bleeding when I got it in my house—I washed it and attended to it till its death—the doctor came and saw it; it was quite senseless—I sat up all night with it, me and my mother; it remained senseless—it had convulsion fits for about two hours, it might be more—it died about 25 minutes past 7 the following morning—I had not known the child very long—the woman came to live by the side of me about three months, that was how I knew it—it used to play out in the street along with my children—it was playing out on the Sunday; it was all right on the Sunday afternoon—that was the last time I saw it, out in the back yard—on the night before this occurred I heard the wife say in the prisoner's presence "What am I to do? I have been to bed and I am obliged to get up, and the language is dreadful; if I go upstairs you are after me, if I go back into the back yard you are after me, and what am I to do?"—I had heard bad language used by him through<lb/>out the day—he called his wife a "b—f—mare" and a "b—f—cow," and such words as that, bad names, as if she had been a bad woman—I did not know enough of them to know if there was any foundation for that—I believe the woman to be a very respectable woman as far as I have known her, and I have known her a good many years</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What he said was "Rather than they should do as they like I would settle the lot"—I don't know that he used to fall into fearful passions without any reason—I know he is a very passionate man, for what reason I don't know—he was not very violent without cause—I was examined before the Mayor at Croydon—I might have said then "I believe him often to be violent without any cause"—I believe he was very passionate, and I don't believe he had any reason to be passionate with his wife—he did fall into passions—his wife has been to my knowledge and to the knowledge of the neighbours a hard-working woman and a faithful wife—if he had an idea of her being unfaithful it was pure delusion on his part—it might have been an interval of 10 minutes between the time of her saying "He is holding my baby by the legs" and her saying "He is murdering my baby."</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner—on Sunday night, 19th August, I was sent for to Mrs. Harding's; I got there about 11.10—I found the child there; it was unconscious, breathing quietly—there was a large bruise on the right side of the face, extending down to the cheek and up to the skull—on the right eye there was a small cut at the outer side—there was a bruise of the upper eyelid—the wound was a small one, bleeding just slightly—those were all the marks on the face and head—on the forearm there was a bruise, on the right forearm, and another on the front of the arm, and another small bruise on the left forearm—on the belly, the right side, and the side, there were streaks of dust, probably from the floor—there was a good deal of swelling, both on the head and face—there were no marks on the legs; I looked very carefully for marks on the legs, but found none—the child was unconscious, and died in about an hour and a half—it had no con<lb/>vulsions when I saw it first—I came back about 1 o'clock and remained with it till about 2.15, when it had convulsions and was sick and vomited some food; it remained unconscious all the time—I culled at 8 o'clock next morning and found it had just died—nothing more could have been done for it I think than was done—I made a post-mortem examina<lb/>tion—the skull was not fractured—the cause of death in my judgment was concussion—if the child had come in contact with some plain hard substance, that would account for what I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Durham Terrace, West<lb/>bourne Park—I am a B.A. and M.R.C.S.—in May, 1879, I was parish surgeon at South Norwood—I attended the prisoner's wife about 31st May—she asked me to see her husband; I cannot recollect the precise tools she used, but it was to the effect that she was afraid of him—I did see him; I found no symptoms of insanity about him at that time—I only saw him on that occasion, and only for a few minutes, five or ten minutes, I cannot recollect precisely—he was not sober, he was suffering from the effects of drink; that is as far as I can recollect, I cannot say more—I saw him again on 23rd August in the same year, two or three times, 'I think; that was by an order by the parish—on those occasions I saw no symptoms of insanity about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not recollect on one occasion taking from him a heavy iron boot—I may have stated that I took from him a heavy iron boot which he had seized in order to defend himself from persons who he thought were going to injure him; I don't recollect it; my mind is an entire blank on the subject—when I send a person to the workhouse infirmary I send a certificate; we are bound to do so—I cannot recollect certifying this man's disease to be mental—it is four years and a half ago since the events occurred, and I see so many patients that it is impossible to recollect—I have recollected the dates because I have looked them up in my private books—I recollect the fact of my sending him to the work-house infirmary because he was violent and his wife was frightened of him, but these symptoms were the result of drink, not insanity—I am perfectly sure that I then formed a judgment that he was not labouring under insanity—I remember enough to say that—I might have told his wife that he was wrong in the Road—I might have signed the certificate that the disease was mental—I didn't do so on the second occasion in July; I am sure of that—it was because he was violent that I sent him to the infirmary; for this reason, from his poor circumstances he could not afford to have anyone to look after him, and his wife was in bed ill, and in danger that in his violence he might do something—it was not a case that I could have sent to an asylum because I did not consider him insane—I did not inform the police, because I found that when I did inform the police they would not take any action in the matter—I cannot say that his wife said that she went in fear of her life; she said she was frightened of him; she might have said that she went in bodily fear of him, I cannot say—I do not live near Croydom; I am in London now—I didn't hear while I was in Croydon that the prisoner fancied that people were trying to poison him—his wife didn't speak to me about it, or that people were trying to injure him—I cannot swear that I never took a boot from him, but I don't recollect it—he never told me to my know<lb/>ledge that people were going about seeking to injure him—the two occa<lb/>sions I have spoken of lour years and a half, ago were the only two occa<lb/>sions on which I saw him.</p>

I have no note of what I asked him and what he said—I did not take any note in my interview with him, I did of previous inquiries which I had made of his friends-what passed between me and him is fresh in my memory—I did not ask him a word about his trial—I wanted to get at the question about poisoning—I asked him first "Has any one tried to injure you?"—he said "I have thought so"—"Has any one ever tried to hang you?"—"No"—"Has any one ever tried to out your throat?"—"No"—"Has any one tried to drown you or to throw you into a pond?"—"No"—"Has any one ever tried to poison you?"—"I have thought so"—"When?"—"A good many times"—"Has it ever been since you have been in the prison?"—"No"—"When was it"—"Well, many times when I have been at home; I have many times sent my wife out of the room and changed the cup of tea and taken hers and given her mine"—I said "Why did you do that?"—he said "Because I was afraid she was trying to poison me"—I said "Did you really believe it?"—he said "I could not believe she could, but I used to fancy so"—I said "What made you think that?"—"Because I used to think she was setting men to follow me wherever I went, and that she used to pinch me in the bed"—and in the night I found that he had a typical fit, one of those frightful fits the boy has spoken of; that he would shout out—he told me this, that he used to wake up and fancy some one was murdering him, and then I got a descrip<lb/>tion from himself corresponding exactly with what I had got from his wife; he would tremble all over and then break out into a furious state of perspiration—he also said that people were writing in the newspapers about him—he did not say that he believed all this in the gaol, but that he had at one time thought so; he also said that he had searched the cupboard on the very Sunday of the murder, but his mind was really a blank as to the after part of the day, even as to bruising the child and tossing it; he could not remember anything of that—then he had these pains in his stomach, and he used to think that was due to the poison—he said that his food was being drugged—he had only been out of prison three weeks, and he said he felt so prostrate that he could not do work, and when he did seek for work people often mocked him, and set them<lb/>selves, as he put it, against him—he said he used to think so—I did not lead him by questions, because I have no interests in this matter but those of justice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. I think I have stated the main facts—he acknowledged that he drank occasionally, but he told me that if he drank now, even a pint, and sometimes half a pint, he lost his senses in a moment and did not know where he was or what he was doing—he told me that he had been in prison over and over again for violence, he did not say for drunkenness—I asked him what it was for—he said on one occasion his wife was feeding one of the children and he thought she was about doing something against him, and he hit her with the spoon and cracked her skull, and she is insensible along that side of the head at the present moment, for I have examined her—he told me he was in prison for violence, he did not tell me it was for drunkenness; I don't know what he was in for—he told me he had been drunk; I don't know that he used the expression, "over and over again"—I don't remember the expression that he had been a hard drinker for years—I said, "I suppose you get drunk occasionally?"—he said, "Yes,</p>

               <p>but I find now that a very little makes me lose my senses in a moment"—everything he told me corroborated all I had heard from the neighbours, his wife, and family—I took the case up because I felt what it was from the first moment I was called to the child—his wife was in such a passion with him, and so were the neighbours, that I took the opportunity to make notes, and I felt sure that proper investigation would bring out the fact that his mind was not right; I felt sure that he was insane before I went to the prison; I felt thoroughly convinced that he was insane if the information given me was true, and I went to the prison to test that information—I wrote purposely for permission to have the interview with him—I did not go with a prejudiced mind; I had certain information, which I had got at great trouble—I have no doubt that he knows now that he is being tried for murder, but the insane know a great deal—I expect that he knows at this moment that the punishment following upon murder is death; I don't believe he knew it on that Sunday night—I asked him as to what he had done on that Sunday night—I said, "How could you do that act to your little child?"—he did not answer—then I said, "Did you undress Tommy that night?"—he said, "I don't know"—his wife had told me that he had undressed him and nursed him—I said, "Did you <hi rend="italic">cuddle</hi> the child?" because that was the expression used—he said, "I don't remember it"—I said, "Did you nurse him?"—he said, "I don't remember, but as I generally had him on my knee when I was indoors I expect I did"—I did not ask him whether he had got into a violent passion that night—he told me that he and his wife had had high words; he thought that she then was hiding people upstairs and down in the cupboard and under the floor—I am afraid I did not ask him what they had been having words about; he told me he thought she was worrying him continually—he did not remember about the food he had that day, he could not remember what he had had for dinner or tea.</p>

I was van boy with the prisoner on this day—I saw a little boy crossing the road from the right side to the left—the prisoner tried to stop the horses—the near horse knocked the boy down and the wheels passed over him—the prisoner was drunk—he had been in a public-house in Lordship Lane for about half an hour—I had been driving the van previous to the accident, but the prisoner was driving at the time—the horses are rather hard-mouthed, they had got no breeching on—the prisoner was sitting on some boxes inside the van, not standing up—I had been driving because he fell asleep—he was reeling about when he came out of the public-house, and he took the reins away just as he got to the corner; he said he would chastise me in the morning because I told him to get a box down which he ought to have done; I was rather angry with him, and thought he behaved very badly—the van was fully loaded, and was a heavy van.</p>

               <p>recollect whether I did or not—I cannot say what passed between us that morning, but he told me that he had picked up the scaffolding—I cannot answer for what passed between us that morning—I did not stop to talk to him—I could not say whether I had or not told him that if he would pick up the scaffolding I was authorised to pay him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I might have done it—the scaffolding had been thrown down in a lump, and Mr. Bruton refused to pay him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. till he had picked it up and taken it away—he said he had picked it up the evening before; I understood by that, that he meant that he had earned his 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not ask me for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that morning; I cannot say that he did; it was not my business to pay him till Mr. Bruton came home—the money was not given me to pay him—I expect there was some conversation about it the same day, and he asked me if I had the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give him, and I said not now, that Mr. Bruton was at home—I never talked about any larger sum being paid the prisoner—I never knew any<lb/>thing about the money affairs—when I came out to the gateway and saw the deceased, the words the prisoner used were "I have done for him, Bill"—I could not say in what tone he said it; I was running at the time—I don't suppose he spoke very loud, but he spoke loud enough for me to hear him—he didn't say it as though he was frightened—I have told you a portion of the conversation that I had with the prisoner on the previous Wednesday—I could not say that it was all—I am perfectly sure he spoke about Mr. Bruton; he did not refer his revenge to Mr. Bruton—I could not say who he referred his revenge to, but he spoke in that way, that he wished to have his revenge, and expose him in the County Court—I mentioned this at the police-court—I was examined at the police-court—I believe I did not then mention about the prisoner talking about the County Court—I have had time to think it over since—I could not say whether that was said previously, as we were in common talk at the time; the words were mentioned, but in what way I cannot say—I did not have any impression at the time that he meant his revenge on Mr. Bruton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner had been regularly at work at this building for some time, for about three weeks before he left the works—he was at work on the Wednesday before, only by picking up this scaffolding after we had closed the grounds—a heap of scaffolding had been thrown down and had never been put in its proper place—I could not say when he was last at work, because I had been laid up for a fortnight—I was at work the day before this happened, and the day previous to that—the prisoner was not there then, but he attended the job regularly every morning to see Mr. Bruton—he did not do any work—I know the cottage where the prisoner lives, it is close by the building, within sight of it.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, 27th September, I saw the prisoner at the station; I said "You are charged with the wilful murder of John Dimery Bruton by striking him with an iron chisel on the head at Ormley Road, Balham, on 27th September, 1883; having heard the charge, do you wish to make any answer? You are not obliged to; what you do say I will take down in writing and may be used against you in evidence on your trial"—he said "Thanks," and paused, and added, "I respectfully decline to say anything"—I produce the prisoner's clothes; there are marks of blood on his shirt, coat, and trousers, and especially on his right shirt sleeve.</p>

About 10.30 on this morning I went to Ormley Road and saw young Mr. Bruton lying on his back in a pool of blood; his head was frightfully battered in—I examined him, he was dead—he was removed to his own house, where I examined him carefully—there were seven distinct wounds on his head, varying from three-quarters of an inch to three inches long, on all parts of the head from the forehead to the back—one was right below the occiput, one on the back at the crown, and others; the skull was completely smashed, especially on the left side, smashed into small pieces—there was brain pro<lb/>truding from the left gash the size of my finger—all these wounds might have have been inflicted by blows from an iron instrument like this—death must have taken place almost instantaneously, I should say.</p>

               <p>was 24 years of age, he was my manager and assisted me in my business—I last saw him alive about twenty minutes past eight on this morning—he left home soon after to go to the works, I believe—the prisoner had entered into a contract with me to do the brickwork of two villas in May last—in September, I think on the 8th, I spoke to him about the work—I think up to that time he had had all the money he had asked for on account—that week my son was at Eastbourne—the prisoner asked me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he did very little work that week himself—he had got a man pointing the front on that very Saturday morning, and I refused to give him more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was understood by the agreement he was to have wages—when I gave him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him if he went on with his work properly he could have the other 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. early in the week—I went to Eastbourne that Saturday afternoon and returned on the Monday, 10th September, late in the evening—I was at the works on the Tuesday morning, and I then saw part of the scaffold taken down, or pitched down rather, all of a heap, some of it broken—I refused to give him the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. until he had put that in its proper place—he did no more work after that—I saw him several times and told him if he did not go on with his work I should have to engage somebody else to do it—he did not go on with it—on Saturday I think I wrote this letter dated 22nd, I gave it to West on the 24th to take to him—I have had letters from him and know his writing, I believe this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his writing—I engaged a young man named Curtis in his place—I saw Curtis on Wednesday, the 26th, at my premises at Pimlico, and engaged with him to meet my son—this is the notice I sent to the prisoner: "Sir,—It is now a fortnight since you did any work at my building at Ormley Road, Balham; I therefore give you notice unless you at once proceed with the work and finish it to my satisfaction, I shall according to your agreement put on other men to complete the contract, and deduct the costs of so doing from the amount which would otherwise become due to you." This is the letter I received from the prisoner: "Sir,—I am now in receipt of your note of this morning, and in reply I may tell you that on September 18th I received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was less than the wages, and I was therefore unable to pay the men, and so they have commenced an action in the County Court against me; if you do not choose to give me the money to pay into Court to save from the exposure I shall be compelled to take further proceedings against you. I will meet you at Balham to-morrow morning, and will hear what you say on the matter. Yours respectfully, H. Powell."</p>

I am a labourer, living at "Worplesden—on 9th August, about a quarter to 1 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house—he had a conversation with me—I assisted in putting out the fire at the barn—after that, about half-past 1, I saw the furze stack on fire, and I saw the prisoner in the road coming from the direction of the furze stack, going in the direction of Bowers Bridge—I did not see any one else in the road—the road in which these two fires were is a side road out of the main road leading from the Green Man to Burpham Court.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). I know nothing whatever about the post<lb/>office order or the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The reason why Mr. Spink, my late master, charged me with stealing the order is that I left home on Monday, having, through home affairs, occasion to do so. On the same day Mr. Spink received a letter from Mr. Spierpoint asking him to send a receipt for the money. Mr. Spink put himself in communication with the police without apparently having any evidence whatever till a day or so after, when he went to the General Post-office and saw the order, which he said was signed in my writing, which I deny before the Court. And another thing is that I knew when Mr. Spink left town and also when he returned. On the day when the order was cashed I was told by Mr. Cooper to take a book to No. 5, Frederick's Mews, Albany Street, and bring back one that had been taken by mistake. During this time it is asserted that the order was cashed (10 till 11), and the little girl who received the book from me also remembers the day and time. After that I stayed in the office the rest of the day, as I believe Mr. Cooper, a director, can testify.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The order was cashed soon after the opening of the office. I was in Frederick's Mews in Albany Street, and more about the order I did not know until I was brought back from Clacton-on-Sea. I left home because father went on at mother, and I took her part. Father went on at me, and I told him I should not come home any more, and I told mother I should go, and then I went. Father is always going on at mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 92, Tanner Street, Bermondsey, and am clerk to R.N. Hope and Sons, teadealers—my father rented five arches in Stan<lb/>worth Street Borough, and in March I saw James Lilley, who said "I want an arch somewhere close to my premises; I think you have some to let in Stanwell Street?" I said "I think my father has, I will ask him the terms"—I took him to the arch; we had two vans standing there—I said "Those are our two vans, and if you find them in your way they can be moved"—one of them was Boord's van, and the other an old van with only three wheels—he afterwards saw my father and agreed to take one of the arches from 1st April—he did not wish the vans removed, but the pole of one was removed in order to get to the arch.</p>

Surely Mr. Putley has not instructed you to arrest me for stealing his van?"—I said "Yes"—he said "Good God! why the man owes me 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on the way to the station he said "I have bought a van with 'Boord and Sons, Distillers,' on the front, and paid him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and sold it again at Barbican for eight guineas"—I said "Do you know the man?"—he said "No, but I have got his receipt"—I said "How came you to buy it from a man you did not know?"—he said "Because I saw the man use the van three or four times, and I thought it belonged to him"—I said "Recently?"—he said "Yes, and one day I told him that I rented the arches, and if he did not pay me for standing his van there he would have to take it away. He said 'I have no use for the van now, I will sell it. I gave him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—he said at the station "The receipt is at home," and gave his address, 47, Abbey Street—Haigh went there and brought back a file of papers, but I was not there when he returned—among them was this receipt—he took it off the file himself, and also this other paper, and said "Will this satisfy you?"—I said "I shall have to make inquiry." (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Received June 10, 1883, of Mr. Lilley the sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for pair-horse van. W. Johnson, 14, Pitt Street, Peckham.") I went to 14, Pitt Street, but found no Mr. Johnson—it is a private house; a constable named Hodgson lived there—I went back to the station and told the prisoners that Mr. Johnson did not reside there, and I had made inquiries up and down the street and could not find him—they both laughed—the charge was read over—they made no reply—the Magistrate admitted them to bail, and on Friday, about 9 a.m., James called at the station, but I did not see him—I afterwards saw him at his shop, and he said "Have you found out Mr. Johnson?"—he then said that he knew where Johnson was, and I went with him and Nunn to 56, Eastlake Road, Camberwell; I had an officer with me who I sent in, and he fetched out Mr. William Johnson, who is outside now, and Lilley said "That is the man who sold me the van"—I said to Mr. Johnson "Let us go over in the light of the public-house"—I was in plain clothes—I then said to Mr. Johnson</p>

               <p>"I am a police-officer," and stated the whole circumstances about the van and about the receipt, and then said "Have you seen this man before?"—he said "No"—I said "Have not you sold him a van at the railway arches, Stanwell Street, Bermondsey?"—he (said "No"—I said "You know your own writing, I have got your receipt here"—he said "Show me and I will soon tell you whether it is my writing or not"—I showed it to him, and he said "That is not my writing; come into my house and I will show you my writing in my books"—we all went into his house, he showed us his writing in his books, and he also wrote his name, which I compared with the receipt, and in my judgment they were not the same—Mr. Johnson asked me what sort of a man it was who sold the van; I read over to him in James Lilley's presence the description which James Lilley had given me of a man 36 years old, and Mr. Johnson said "Surely that description does not answer me"—I said "Mr. Lilley, you most have made a mistake in this man"—he said "No, I have not, truly, and if you don't take the man I shall take him myself to Kennington Lane Police-station, and they will take the charge there"—Mr. Johnson said "If I have got to come to the station I shall come, but I wish to have this case carefully investigated"—I took him to the station; he brought his books with him—I laid hold of him—I mentioned the circumstances to the inspector, and James Lilley said that he would charge him—the inspector read over the description from my book, and said "They do not at all tally, there must be something wrong; have you got any witness who can identify him?"—James Lilley said "Yes, I have got plenty"—the inspector said "Mention one"—he mentioned Mr. Francis, a beershop keeper—he was fetched, but could not identify Johnson—we were in the charge-room, and Lilley, who was standing at the door talking, I think, to the superintendent, ran away, saying "We have been waiting long enough for Mr. Francis"—I said "Do wait, he will be here in a few minutes"—he said "No, I will charge him in the morning"—when ho got some distance he met Mr. Francis and came back, but as he could not identify Johnson he was allowed to go with his books, and is here as a witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Fowler and Co., solicitors—we were instructed on behalf of W.J.

I apprehended Berger on 6th August—I read the warrant to him; it was for obtaining 12 casks of ink from Mr. Chandler, with intent to defraud—he said "You cannot do that, the estate is in bankruptcy"—I said "On this warrant you will be taken before a Magistrate"—I went to Wood's house, No. 12, Glebe Villas, Mitcham, the day he was arrested—I found these two bills of exchange, drawn by Berger and accepted by Wood, dated 1st January and 4th April respectively, for 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three and two months—I also found two cheques, dated 29th and 31st, 1883, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn on the Central Bank of London in favour of Ridsdale and Sons by Burger and Co., both marked "Refer to drawer," also six blank cheques on the Central Bank, signed "Charles W.
