The great one was a little frightened, and said he did not take any thing, but at last he confessed, that they had taken two pieces off a shelf, and he shewed me where they took them from; (the little one was hovering about at a little distance) and when he had acknowledged the little one had taken something, I called out , Stop thief! and he dropped the goods, and was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you upon any bed?</p>
               <p>Upington. Yes, upon some straw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent or resist at the time?</p>
               <p>Upington. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent ?</p>
               <p>Upington. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with your will or against your will that he lay with you?</p>
               <p>Upington. Against my will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out?</p>
               <p>Upington. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. What did Crew do to you?</p>
               <p>Upington. She clapped one of her knees against my arm, and put her hand upon my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first complain of this matter?</p>
               <p>Upington. The very same week it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in Crew's house afterwards?</p>
               <p>Upington. About half a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you immediately go home after that?</p>
               <p>Upington. There came a woman to Mrs. Crew's to ask about the coals that were given away, and so I got out, or else I had not got away at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get home?</p>
               <p>Upington. Sir, it was one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home, did you see your mother or any of the family ?</p>
               <p>Upington. My mother was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house then?</p>
               <p>Upington. No body but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your mother come home?</p>
               <p>Upington. About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When your mother came home, did you say any thing to her?</p>
               <p>Upington. I did not say any thing to her then.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to acquaint your mother with it then?</p>
               <p>Upington. Because I was afraid my mother would beat me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any complaint to your mother?</p>
               <p>Upington. I did not make any complaint at all; but my mother asked me what was become of the two shillings, and that if I did not tell her, she said she would beat me, so then I told her the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this that you told her the whole of it?</p>
               <p>Upington. On a Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mother, upon that occasion, when you told her the whole of it, examine your body?</p>
               <p>Upington. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any further discourse at that time?</p>
               <p>Upington. I observed that the child walked oddly, and I asked her what ailed her; she said she was chafed ; I asked her where; she said where she made water.</p>

               <p>Upington. I found she had been entered about half the length of my finger, and I don't know but she may have the foul distemper. The boy did put his hand, as she says, up her coats, but she was too many for him; and that the Prisoner said, after the boy was gone, he would lie with her; and that Mrs. Crew held her down upon a wad of straw, for they have nothing but straw to lie upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she was consenting to it, or that it was done against her will.</p>
               <p>Upington. She said she cried out, and that Mrs. Crew stopped her mouth; she always said so from the beginning to the ending.</p>

               <p>Moffat. Suppose a man to be extremely small, it may be, but if a man is full made, it is impossible to do it without there being a considerable quantity of blood.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search him?</p>
               <p>Guyther. No. I told him, he must have the money: he asked forgiveness, and returned me nine moidores, and three half guineas, which he pulled out of his side-breeches pocket; I asked him, if he had any money when he came into my house, and he said, he had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks upon the moidores?</p>

               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner formerly lived there?</p>
               <p>Bell. Yes.

Then I went up myself , and as I was going up stairs, I heard somebody there: I called out several times, who is there ? And at last the Prisoner said, it is I. I asked him, what he did there; he said, he came for a brush that he had left there; I said, I would go up for it; I went up and found the flap of the bureau quite down, and the things in a confused manner .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had found the brush?</p>
               <p>Bell. No, he did not say he had found it; afterwards I came down stairs, and went to a place where I thought Mr. Guyther was, but he was not there; a little after I met him at the door and told him, I had a suspicion that Simpson had robbed him, and desired him to go up stairs and satisfy himself.

               <p>Bell . The Prisoner went up stairs again , for I saw him come down after I came back from looking for my master; then Mr. Guyther went up stairs with the Prisoner, and told him, he had robbed him, and he pulled out a handful of gold, and gave it to Mr. Guyther; Mr. Guyther asked him if he had any money, when he came into his house, and he said, he had not a farthing; then he put his hand behind him, and slid the box, and Mr. Guyther took the box from him and opened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box?</p>

I desired him not to frighten me, for I had but a little while to go; there were two watchmen coming by, who did not cry the hour, and when they came up, I desired they would lay hold of that fellow, for he had robbed us: and the watchmen laid hold of him, and carried him to the watch-house, and searched him for what he had taken from us.</p>

            1747. and another with another mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of his marking these?</p>
               <p>Harling. Because he had missed some money, and suspected the Prisoner; a person came into the shop and bespoke some things, the woman gave him a shilling, and I saw him put that into the till and take another out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master challenge the Prisoner, or say any thing to him that he had taken a shilling out of the till?</p>
               <p>Harling. Yes, he called him into the compting-house, and asked him what money he had about him; he said he had five shillings and six pence; my master said he had some of his, and desired to look at his money; he then pulled out five shillings and six pence, and laid it down upon the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you see them?</p>
               <p>Harling. Yes; and a shilling, marked C. W. 1747. was among them. He was carried before my Lord Mayor, and he owned it then.</p>

               <p>Meads. One is hard and the other soft, the hard is the dearest and the soft is the cheapest; I believe the knitting yarn is not so good as the weaving yarn.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take that worsted to be worth?</p>
               <p>Meads. Three pence half penny, or a groat an ounce.</p>

               <p>Hales. I am a hosier.</p>
               <p>Q . Look at that worsted. What do you take it to be worth?</p>
               <p>Hale. As it is tumbled in this manner (though it may be better than it appears to be) I have as good for three pence an ounce, and I think I have as good for something less.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is a good judge of these goods himself?</p>
               <p>Hales. Unless he deals in it very much, I do not think he is; but I am informed he does not deal much in this article, and that he is not a judge of the goodness of it.</p>

I lost a cap and a handkerchief; the Prisoner came to my Mrs. to beg the favour of her to go with a message to a gentlewoman who owed her some money, and my Mrs. gave her a breakfast; this handkerchief was in an elbow chair in the kitchen, and I saw her take the handkerchief into her right hand, and put it under her cloak, but I took no notice of it till my Mrs. came home; when she came home, I said to her, Did not you see a handkerchief in the great chair? Yes, said she; then said I, Nanny has taken it. The next day she came again, and my Mrs. spoke to her about it, but she denied it; said I, Nanny, do not deny it, for I saw you take it; she said she knew nothing of it. She came the next day again; there is a bureau in the parlour, and all the drawers except one were locked up, and there I had put my cap; the cap lay uppermost, and was taken out of the drawer; the next morning the cap was missed, and the Prisoner came the next day as usual ; said I, Nanny, you have got my cap, and she said she had not; we talked of searching her pocket, and she pulled out a dirty cap, which was none of mine; I told her, if it was pawned or sold, I would go and fetch it, as likewise the handkerchief ; she said she never saw any thing of the cap and handkerchief , and wondered I should think so of her .</p>

               <p>Potts. I live in St. Martin's Legrand , I am a jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did you give before the magistrate?</p>
               <p>Potts. The same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with a robbery or not?</p>
               <p>Potts. The Justice asked me if I would swear a point blank robbery against him, or only an assault, with an intent of a robbery? Said I, I do not suppose a man should assault me with an intent to rob, when he stole my hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge him with?</p>
               <p>P. I said he stopped me in the street, and I lost my hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me an answer, whether you did, before the Magistrate , charge him with a robbery, or whether he was committed for a robbery?</p>
               <p>Potts. He was committed for a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge him for?</p>
               <p>Potts. For being stopped in the street, and robbed by his companions of my hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Did you relate the thing to the Justice as you say now?</p>
               <p>Potts. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Did the Magistrate say he had committed him for a robbery?</p>
               <p>Potts. Yes.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. I have the Magistrate's warrant for a common assault.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what you said, when you went to the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Potts. I told you that this man assaulted me in the street, and I lost my hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. What did you say to Smallwood before he struck you?</p>
               <p>Potts. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to knock you down?</p>
               <p>Potts. No, he took hold of me by my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck first?</p>
               <p>Potts. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you for any money, or order you to deliver any thing?</p>
               <p>Potts. No.</p>
               <p>- Burton . I am a watchman in Bridges-Street ; on the 5th of December, at night, as I was upon my watch , Mr. Smallwood, and two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150016"/> more, stood over against me, and by and by Mr. Potts came singly by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Burton . About eleven o'clock: and I heard Mr. Potts say, what do you assault me for? Can't a man go along quietly? and Smallwood said to him, I will fight you for a full pot; and Mr. Potts said, I am no fighting man, I will not fight you. Mr. Potts stepped six or seven steps forward, and a little fellow came and tripped him up; and Mr. Potts was almost smothered in the dirt, and I took Smallwood off him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both kept in the watch-house all night ?</p>
               <p>Burton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Coun. What passed at the watch-house ?</p>
               <p>Burton. Mr. Potts said, the Prisoner wanted to fight him, and he would not fight with him.</p>

               <p>Burton. He said, he believed he wanted to rob him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Smallwood charge him?</p>
               <p>Burton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Smallwood charge him with?</p>
               <p>Burton. I can't tell, but he was charged.</p>
               <p>Q. What words did Potts make use of?</p>
               <p>Burton. That he had lost his hat, wig, and stick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Coun. What passed before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Burton. The Justice examined Potts, and he said, he was stopped in such a place, and lost his hat, wig, and stick.</p>

            . I am a glover, and live in Vinegar-yard , in that neighbourhood; I was going home, and saw four men together: Mr. Potts, the Prisoner, and two others. I heard some blows, I looked and saw this gentleman and Smallwood engaged, and a little fellow came and tripped Mr. Potts up upon his back, and Smallwood lay upon him, and Smallwood gave the first charge: and the little man who tripped Mr. Potts up, gathered up his hat and wig, and went away with them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Coun. Was there any thing offered you to prevent you from coming to give evidence to day?</p>
               <p>Powell. Yes, there was.</p>

               <p>Prisoner . I had been drinking at a publick-house, and was going home to bed; I was very much fuddled, and run against this man, and fell down: and after I was down, he gave me several blows. I got up, and took him by the collar; I knocked him down, and I lost my hat and wig.</p>

               <p>Q. And are you answerable for them?</p>
               <p>Stroud . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any hose?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Yes. I am porter to the Kidderminster Waggon , and on the 19th of December last I lost a truss of hose out of the inn-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity there was in that truss ?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I believe there were twenty dozen, but I am sure there were ten dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think the Prisoner was concerned in taking them?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I had sent my brother of an errand into the Old-Jewry, and when he came back from thence , he said there was a man gone out with a parcel of stockings, and asked me whether I had delivered any to him. I said I had not; I followed the Prisoner, and saw him with a bag, and about one hundred yards from the Inn gate in Wood-Street , he turned up into Gold-Street; I saw him with the bag of stockings upon his back or shoulders, and I saw him drop the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him?</p>
               <p>Stroud . Yes, I pursued him and took him; he run out of Gold-Street into Gutter-Lane, and came into Cheapside ; I took him among the coachmen in Cheapside, and I never lost sight of him till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Stroud. It was about six or seven at night .</p>
               <p>Q. What clothes had the man on that you saw with the bag of stockings?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I think he had not all the same clothes on then as he has now, but the man had a white dussled coat, such as the Prisoner has on.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him?</p>
               <p>Stroud. My brother and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or your brother take the stockings up?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I ordered my brother to take them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay to see him take them up?</p>
               <p>Stroud . No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the Prisoner, did any discourse pass between you and him?</p>
               <p>Stroud. He said he was not the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came to run away?</p>
               <p>Stroud . He did run away, and I cried out stop thief , and the Prisoner he cried out stop thief too.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of what you say?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I know something of Christian knowledge, and I would not swear falsely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body go before the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Stroud. No, there was no body but my brother, myself, and the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take them out of the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Stroud. They were never put into the warehouse, they lay in the inn-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these stockings to be delivered?</p>
               <p>Stroud. They were, as far as I can find out, to go to the Swan at Holbourn-Bridge, to go to an other carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your brother your servant?</p>
               <p>Stroud . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you-take all the stockings out of the waggon?</p>
               <p>Stroud. My brother and I did; we took out six trusses of stockings.</p>

             on the 19th of December, I went with a pot of butter to Mr. Robinson's in the Old-Jury, and then I went to the Cross Keys in Wood-Street; it was between six and seven, and I saw the Prisoner turning out of the inn with a bag of stockings upon his back or shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I did not know him till my brother had taken him, and he had on a double-breasted lapel waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you came into the inn between six and seven?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Yes, and I saw the Prisoner with a bag of stockings at his back, just turning out of the inn-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoner at the bar, are you sure that is the man?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know him?</p>
               <p>Stroud. By the lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a lamp at the inn-gate?</p>
               <p>Stroud. There is a light within the inn-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Stroud. No, but I am positive he is the man, for he was never out of my sight , till he dropped the stockings .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint your brother with it?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I said to my brother, Richard, have you delivered out a bag of stockings ? No, said he: said I, there is a bag gone; I followed the Prisoner, and he had like to have tumbled the stockings upon me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150018"/>Q. Did you lose sight of the Prisoner till he dropped the stockings?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I did lose sight of him a little while to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked your brother whether he had sent any stockings out, you followed the man you say, and you are sure you did not lose sight of him till he dropped the stockings?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Yes; and I took the stockings, and carried them back to the warehouse: I did not pursue the man, my brother took him; he had on a light coloured coat, and a little light bob wig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Coun. Are you positive to the man?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Yes, I am. I know the world something.</p>

            . I am a news-man; I was coming out of the Horns in Gutter-Lane, on the saturday before Christmas-day, it was the 19th of Dec. between six and seven o'clock, and I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw the Prisoner running along, no body run before the Prisoner. I turned about, and saw him turn out of Cheapside, into St. Paul's Church-yard ; I run after him, and cried, stop thief; and he cried, stop thief too; and in a minute's time he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What clothes had he on?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. A light coloured coat, a double breasted waistcoat, and a light wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner is the man you saw pursued?</p>
               <p>Absalom . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any stockings upon him?</p>
               <p>Absalom . No, I saw no stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never cried out stop thief, till I came out of Gutter-Lane, into Cheapside ; and then I cried out, stop thief, as well as them; and I had a duffled coat on then, as I have now.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoner. Do you know any thing of that man?</p>
               <p>Reynolds . No. I was informed, that Mr. Gascoign's waggon, the Worcester waggon, put up at the Cross-Keys Inn; I enquired, and they told me, the Worcester waggon did not put up there , but the Worcestershire waggon did. There was somebody came into the Inn, and asked the Porter whether he had delivered out any parcel or bundle , and he said, no. They said, there was something lost, and that there was a man run away; the porter run out of the Inn after him, I was close at the porter's heels , but he was out of sight of every one; I lost sight of him at the corner of Gold-street, the next turning to the Cross-Keys Inn , in Wood-street.</p>

               <p>Q. What can you say to it then?</p>
               <p>Brittle. I was in Newgate last Sunday, and my father's brother was with me; my father had heard that the things were stolen out of the waggon - I ask pardon; these goods were delivered to my father in the country, and booked to him; he could not put them into his waggon , so he got another carrier to put them up, and he was to have carried them to the Saracen's Head on Snow-Hill , but there was a mistake, and they were left at the Cross Keys Inn. My father was at Newgate with the Prisoner one day, and my uncle another.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Brittle. No, I do not know him, neither does my father.</p>
               <p>Q. What brought you here?</p>
               <p>Brittle. I could not help coming, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Who subpoenaed you?</p>
               <p>Brittle. The man's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose wife?</p>
               <p>Brittle. The Prisoner's wife.</p>

            . I live at the Three Golden Sugar Loaves in Park Street, by Grosvenor-Square; the Prisoner lodged with me constantly for five years, except one quarter. I never kept my door open after ten o'clock at night, but he had a key, and used to let himself in at ten or eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>White. I believe very good; I have intrusted him in my house with a great many goods; he has borrowed two or three guineas at a time of me, and always paid me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any thing against his character?</p>
               <p>White. No, I never heard any thing, but that he was a very worthy honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not in Wood-Street then?</p>
               <p>White. No, and I was very much surprized when I heard it. I know some of his friends at York, and they say he always behaved well .</p>

            . On the 8th of this month, I heard a noise in my cellar about seven o'clock at night. I went to my hatch-door, and saw the Prisoner slip out, and run to a neighbour's house with these candles that are in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them from her in this handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Penn. No; I put them into this handkerchief, to carry them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had she them?</p>
               <p>Penn. She had them in her apron and pocket together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Penn. She had little or nothing to say; when she was brought back she owned she had them out of my cellar, and since that I have had several pounds brought home by my neighbours , half a dozen pounds at a time, and they said they bought them of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was with child and longed for candles , and I could not help taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever a one of them in her mouth ? if she had, I should have thought she had a mind to them.</p>
               <p>Penn. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you lose these?</p>
               <p>Bruton. In my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that part of your dwelling-house ,</p>
               <p>Bruton. Yes , it is part of my dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you lose them?</p>
               <p>Bruton. Between five and six at night, the Prisoner came to my house about four o clock, and asked for one Mrs. Gardner, who did live in Queen Street; I used to frequent the shop when she lived there, and used to see the Prisoner there, and as one was Shropshire, and the other Herefordshire , we used to call one another country folk; when he came in, he asked to sit down; I had some mutton chops for dinner, and I thought he would have gone; he said he had good news to tell Mrs. Gardner, for he had an estate of 90 l. a year left him, which was to come to him at Christmas, and then he said he should want a watch. I said I had got a watch that I must dispose of; he desired to see it; I gave it him into his hand, and he seemed to like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver it into his hand?</p>
               <p>Bruton. Yes, but he delivered it to me again, and desired I would keep it till Lady-day, and he would have it; I said I would lock it up, and keep it till Lady-day, and it should not see sun or moon till that time, and I locked it up in a chest of drawers that I have in the shop; then I went to broil the stakes, and he went into the little back room where I broiled them; the Prisoner sat still, but I expected him to go; said I, you plead a good deal of poverty, if you will stay and eat a stake you are welcome; said I, I have no beer in the house, and I asked him to go for a mug of beer; he said that he was so well known, that he did not care to be seen: He came out of the little room, and said it is time to go for the beer, for your stakes will be burnt; I went out to bespeak it, and left him in the room, not thinking the fellow would rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the same room when you came back?</p>
               <p>Bruton. Yes , but he had been very busy while I was gone; then he went out, as I thought he might do , upon a necessary occasion .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into any yard of yours, or into the street?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I do not know whether he went out of the shop; I thought he staid longer than he had need to do, but he did not return; I folded up my things, mended the fire, and went into the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150023"/> when, to my great surprize, I found these gloves rolled up as they are now in the shop; I turned to the place where my watch was, and found my watch was gone, and several other things, which were in the drawer; then I went to another drawer that was unlocked, and found that all my linen was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer where you put the watch locked?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I am positively sure that the drawer, where the watch was, was locked. I did not know what to do, or how to find this man, for he never was in my house before, only as I knew him at Mrs. Gardner's ; I went to Mrs. Gardner's to inquire after him, and she said he used some houses, which I went to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I took him at the George in St. Martin's Legrand, the Wednesday night after, I take it to be the 23d of December; I had been to seek for a constable, but could not get one; there were several gentlemen there, and I desired they would assist me to take a thief; I spoke loud, for I speak pretty loud sometimes. The Prisoner dropped the watch under the bench, but I did not see him drop it; he asked me what I wanted with him, I said my silver watch; he wanted to go home to my house, and he said he would make me sensible that he had not robbed me; said I, Will not you run away from me? he said he would not; so I went out with him, and got him to a gentleman's house by Honey-Lane market, and had him secured. I asked him where the watch was, he said it was under the bench at the

             ; I went there, and the watch was taken up; they had got a constable to take the watch up, and he delivered it into the hands of the woman of the house. The Prisoner owned the fact before several people.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this that you carried him to?</p>
               <p>Bruton . To Mr. Bird's , by Honey-Lane market. We went to demand the , watch, and the woman at the George would not show it us. I said to the Prisoner, You rogue , you have robbed me of my watch , and all my linen. The Prisoner lodged in Dove-Court , and his landlady said, if I would not do him any harm she would bring some of the things to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your things again?</p>
               <p>Bruton . I have them in part.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the rest ?</p>
               <p>Bruton . He said he was obliged to sell them, for he had been out of business a great while, and was poverty struck, and could not help doing what he did .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry him before a Magistrate?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I carried him before the Sitting-Alderman on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing else?</p>
               <p>Bruton. He said it was my watch, that he had taken the string off it, and put another on.</p>
               <p>The watch was produced, and Mrs. Bruton swore it to be her property ; there were two seals to it, but one was not hers .</p>

            . I am a constable in the liberty of St. Martin's Legrand ; I was sent for to the George in St. Martin's Legrand, the 23d of December, about four o'clock I believe: When I came in, there was a watch lay upon the ground between the bench and the table; they desired me to take it up, which I did, and delivered it to the woman of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never shewn it to Mrs. Bruton since?</p>
               <p>Francis. Yes, before the Alderman, and she knew it presently. This is the watch I found under the table, and the Prisoner said that this was Mrs. Bruton's watch, and that he had taken the string off, and put another on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she did not, and could not know it till I owned it.</p>

             . One Wednesday night I heard the Prisoner say the watch was Mrs. Bruton's, and that he dropped it at the sign of the George; I went with the Prosecutrix and Mr. Bird there, and the landlady would not shew it, but when we came before the Alderman, she produced it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been forty years in service, and never had any thing laid to my charge. Mrs. Bruton said, if I would eat a pound of stakes, she would treat me; I said I could not stay, but I did; she said she had no small beer in the house, so I went for a pot of beer, but the stakes were not come, and Moll Best was the girl that fetched the stakes, for Mrs. Bruton never went out of the house. I cannot say that I honestly bought the watch and paid for it, but I honestly agreed with her for it, and shewed it to a watchmaker, and he said it was not worth thirty shillings : I was to pay her so much a week, or the whole at the quarter's end, and I was to give her 5 l. 10 s. for it; she gave me four or five quarterns of gin, and I was drunk that night and lost my hat and wig; she often wanted me to come and see her when she lived in Cannon-Street , for she kept a shop there . I have no friends here. I lived seven years with Dr. Collins of Walthamstow as a footman, and in many other good places.</p>

            . Last saturday night, the 9th of this instant, between six and seven, as I was coming along <placeName id="t17480115-17-crimeloc101">Ludgate-Hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you drop it?</p>
               <p>Copeland. No. The Prisoner picked it out of my pocket, and since that, the book has been brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you say the Prisoner picked it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Because I saw him. I found my coat was pulled back, and I saw my book in his hand, and he put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you saw the book in his hand, why did not you stop him?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Because I thought it might be improper for a single person to take such a one as him; I crossed the way, and saw him pick another gentleman's pocket. I spoke to the gentleman, and informed him of it, and he said, if I took any notice of it, we might stand a chance of being beat; we followed him as far as Temple-Bar, and he returned back again. I went home to my lodging in New-street, by Fetter-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Yes; I observed the lower part of his face to be clarety. When I went home I got one to go along with me, and set a man and a boy on one side of the way, and I went on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Copeland . About a quarter of an hour after he picked my pocket. I came out of the house with my landlord, and I saw the Prisoner turn up Fleet-street , towards Fetter-Lane; and by St. Dunstan's church , I saw him attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket. Said I to a chairman, do me the favour to lay hold of this man, for he has picked my pocket, and he laid hold of him by the collar, and shoved him against the Temple-gate. There was another fellow with him: I laid hold of the other fellow, though I could not charge him; and I don't know but the Prisoner might think I had a proper officer; but when he found I had not a proper officer, he said, you little saucy dog, let me go: we carried him to a public house, the Two Kings and Key in Fleet-street, and I got an officer, and he said, he believed this person was no better than he should be. The Prisoner desired he might be searched, and the constable said, I don't feel any book, or any thing like it; I asked him if he would return the book, he said, he knew nothing of it ; I gave the constable charge of him, and he begged to go to Bridewell; and desired I would indulge him: the constable thought it dangerous to carry him to Bridewell, on account of a rescue; for it was said, that he had been there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the book again?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Yes, it was brought to me by a sailor, and he trembled very much; said he, is not your name Copeland? I said, yes. Said he, have not you lost a will and powers ? I said, yes. He said, that he wanted something for finding it, but I would not give him any thing. I said, let the person come, and I will satisfy him for it. Afterwards a woman came with the book wrapped up in a sheet of paper, all over dirt; and asked me a crown for picking it up; I told her, I did not know whether it was proper to give her anything, and I did not give her any thing, and she went away very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner at the bar is the man that took it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Copeland. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he saw the book in my hand.</p>
               <p>Copeland . Yes, I did; I saw it in his hand in this manner, as if he took a glance at it to see what it was</p>

            . On the 6th of January last, about a quarter after one at noon, I was about two hundred yards below Ludgate, and the Prisoner took my handkerchief out of my right hand coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the Prisoner with it?</p>
               <p>Power. I heard a person say, your pocket is picked; I turned about and saw the Prisoner endeavouring to conceal the handkerchief between his coat and waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner . Ask him whether he saw me drop the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Power. I can be positive that I saw him have it in his hand, and one corner was hanging out thus, and then I saw him drop it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman searched me all round.</p>

            . The Prisoner brought this holland to my master's shop, Mr. Norman's, a pawnbroker in Covent-Garden, on friday, the 8th of Jan.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Styles . Her business is to carry goods to Covent-Garden market: she offered to pawn it, and asked six shillings upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth?</p>
               <p>Styles . I believe, if it was to be bought out of a linen-draper's shop, it is worth five shillings an ell; but four shillings to be sure. I asked her whose it was, for I said it was not hers; and she said it was her own, three times over: and at last she owned that it was not hers, but that she brought it from a friend of hers to pledge. I asked who that friend was; she said, that was nothing to me, for she was the person that brought it. Said I, if you will let me know your friend, I will go and ask her whether it is her property; I thought she did not appear as if she was the owner of such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150026"/> holland as that; she had that child in her arms, and a boy of about eight or nine years of age with her. Said she to the boy, take the child out of my arms, and I will jump over the compter, and take it from him. I got a constable, and had her before Justice Burdus, but she did not confess any thing that I know of.</p>

I thought it was a pity the gentleman should have his pocket picked, and I went after him, but lost sight of him, and could not find him. Another gentleman said, if I saw such a thing done, I was to blame, if I did not take them up: for I connived at felony. I followed them into Wild-street, and I met a neighbour; he asked me what I was going about, I told him; he said, they were gone before. I took one of them in Clare market, and my neighbour, the next witness, found the handkerchief in the Prisoner Harvey's breeches. Harvey said, there is the boy that took the handkerchief: I secured him too, and they both charged one another with it. I am sure these are the two boys, whether they had the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, or not, I can't tell.</p>

             informed me where the bottom of my still was, and every thing else; I went to the Prisoner's house, and he abused me pretty handsomely; then I got a warrant, and he said what fool of a Justice granted me a warrant? I said, those that would answer it; but afterwards he owned he had cut it to pieces, and bought it for half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth?</p>
               <p>Duke. It cost me 15 s. He sent two people to me, and they said he would make me a new one, and he has made up one, and I would have taken it rather than have made any combusture .</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that these people were sent by him?</p>
               <p>Duke. I do not know: I would have taken it, but I told him he should have said that before I had taken out a warrant.</p>

               <p>Pris. I gave the woman 3 s. for it, which is 9 d. a pound; and gentlemen of the Jury, do you think that cost her 15 s.? I have a thousand witnesses to my character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your lighter lie on the Middlesex side or the Surry side?</p>
               <p>Sherwood On the Middlesex side. Two of the sacks were marked with my name.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. How many sacks were these three quarters in?</p>
               <p>Sherwood . They were in six sacks; they were taken out of my lighter on the Saturday night or Sunday morning, and I heard there were beans landed at Execution-Dock; there was a little cart and horse brought there, and I found this cart and horse belonged to Liggins; I got a search-warrant , and on Monday morning I went and searched his house, and found these standing in six sacks, as they were standing in my lighter on the Friday; I asked him how he came by them, he said he gave 24 s. for the three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they cost?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. They cost 17 s. a quarter, besides charges; we took Mr. Liggins before a Justice, and the Justice admitted him to bail.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he say he bought them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He said he bought them between four and five in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. What did Hoare say as to the taking them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He said he lent a man a boat to go, and he brought the boat to Execution-Dock, then went to Liggins's house, and sold the beans for 24 s. to Liggins.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this usual at three o'clock in the morning?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. I never heard of any such thing.</p>

               <p>Sherwood. He said he gave 24 s. for the three quarters, and that he sold one sack for 9 s. and that my brother might go and take the money for it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Liggins's Coun. Did he know the value of them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He sold them for a market price, and that is a sign he knew the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if he had bought these goods, knowing them to be stolen, he would not have shot them out into other sacks?</p>

               <p>Q. What is the price of beans, are not they sometimes at eight or nine shillings a quarter?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. The market price at that time was from 17 to 18 s. a quarter for this sort of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose these beans were for shipping?</p>
               <p>Sherwood . Yes, they were for the West-Indies.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. I think they are to prove where the beans were stolen from, and the Jury are to try the Prisoner for the fact where the offence was committed, and the indictment must be laid where the fact is committed; and as the river of Thames is always supposed to be in two counties, half the river to appertain to one county and half to the other; for this fact may have been committed in the county of Surry .</p>
               <p>Court. You need not give your self any trouble. Suppose the lighter lay in Surry , and he carries them into Middlesex, is not he guilty of the felony, wherever the goods are found?</p>

               <p>Prisoner Liggins Last saturday was sev'night, in the morning, I believe it was between one and two, somebody knocked at the door; I was in bed, and cried out, who is there? Said a man, here is one. What do you want, said I? He said, he had two or three quarters of beans to sell. I said, if they are worth my while, I will buy them, if they are honestly come by; said I, what sort of beans are they? He said, they were either fit for hogs or horses; (I had some hogs a fatting) Said I, where are they? He said, they were in a house by the water-side. Well, said I, if they are honestly come by, I will buy them. In about three hours time, Hoare and another man came and asked me whether I would have them; I took my horse and cart, and went. They went into a house by Execution-dock , and a man said, I could not have them just then; I stood at the arse of my cart some time, and a watchman came and unlocked a door. I said, bring them along, and I will load them, and I did: and I took them away.</p>

            . I have known Liggins twelve years, he lived servant by us several years, and worked two years with us ; and I have known him ever since, till he was in prison, and never knew any thing, but that he was a very honest man, and a very worthy servant.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Coun. What is your business ?</p>
               <p>Brown. I am a cowkeeper , I believe you know me very well; he has lodged twenty guineas in my hand, and never took any receipt for it . I have intrusted him with the care of my servants and have had my business as well done in my absence, as if I was there.</p>

            . I have known Liggins about twelve years, to the time of this accident ; he is a very honest and worthy fellow as any in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. What business does he follow?</p>
               <p>Field. He keeps hogs and cows, and is as industrious a fellow as any in the world; whether he was drawn into this thing or no, I cannot tell; but he is a very worthy fellow.</p>
               <p>Thomas Church. I have known Liggins four years, he is a pains-taking man; I have sold him tares and peas for his hogs .</p>

               <p>Church. No ; he is an ignorant man, and knows nothing of the price of these beans; they will rise five shillings in a quarter in a day sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth now?</p>
               <p>Church . I believe they are worth fifteen shillings.</p>

            's house; on the 9th of December, about eleven in the morning, the Prisoner came to see me (as she said) because I always gave her good advice; she said she had married a porter at an inn; I asked her how she came hither ? she said she came with a hare on Saturday night, and that between Saturday and Wednesday, her husband had run away and robbed her; said I, it is a commong thing for a woman to rob her husband, but not for a husband to rob his wife ; the Prisoner followed me into the inner room several times; I had washed one of the spoons, and put it into the cup which stood in a corner cupboard (with the rest of the plate that was stolen) in the inner room; and it being near two o'clock, I said Nanny, I must go, I wonder my husband does not come home; she said, when you go I will go. I went to make up the fire, and missed a little bit of a poker; I locked the door of the inner room as well as the outer room, and went out. I had been gone out about half an hour, and when I came home my husband said both the doors are broke open; what, said I, both the doors! yes, said he. I clapped my hands and said, Nan has done this I am afraid, meaning the Prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the door when you returned ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood . Both broke open; and I missed a silver cup with two handles, three large spoons, three tea-spoons, a silver strainer, a scarlet cloak and a black bonnet , which were all in the inner room when I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed the things what course did you take?</p>
               <p>Greenwood . I went to the Prisoner's father, and told it him as a secret; he said he did not wonder at it, for it was not the first time. The next morning I advertised her, and this young man, Mr. Prior, Mr. Young the goldsmith's man, that bought the plate of the Prisoner, came to me, and said he had bought a cup and a spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to see them since ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. I did not see them till last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the cup and spoon?</p>
               <p>[Mr. Young produced the cup and spoon, which Mrs. Greenwood said was what she had lost.]</p>
               <p>Eliz. Greenwood . The Prisoner was apprehended , and I went to Newgate to see her, and asked her how she could serve me so? for, said I, I always gave you good advice, and she did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with robbing you?</p>
               <p>Greenwood . Yes, and she did not deny it. I asked her how she did it; she said, she broke the door open with her hand, and thought the devil helped her, and she said she sold the cup and spoon to this young man, Prior.</p>
               <p>Pris. I cannot deny it in any shape, and leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>King's Coun. May it please your Lordship and you gentlemen of the Jury, the two Prisoners at the bar are indicted on a late act of parliament, made in the 19th year of his present Majesty, and which the Legislature was forced to make, after having tried a great many ways, in order to put an end to smuggling with an armed force, to the detriment of most persons in the kingdom, and to the terror of those upon the coasts; and because these people would undertake this method, rather than follow their own occupations, the Legislature made it a capital offence for persons, with an armed force, to the number of three or more, to assemble together, in order to carry on this practice of smuggling. The act says, that if any persons, to the number of three or more, armed with fire arms, &amp;c. after the 24th day of June, 1746, shall assemble together , in order to be aiding and assisting in the running of wool or other goods, prohibited to be exported , or to run any goods liable to pay duties , which have not been paid or secured, shall be deemed guilty of felony without benefit of clergy; but I need not trouble you with the other clauses of the act, because they do not come under this indictment , of running and carrying away uncustomed goods , and goods liable to pay duties, this the Prisoners are charged with: But there are two things to be considered, first, whether the Prisoners , with such as make three, assembled with arms ; and, secondly, whether they were assembled to that number and armed, in order to be aiding and assisting in the running of uncustomed goods, and I believe you have no doubt but that this will be proved. Gentlemen , on the fifth of December last, one of the officers of the customs saw a smuggling cutter coming within the bounds of the port of Southwold ; and, Gentlemen , you have had so many of these trials, that I need not tell you that they have little vessels , by which they run tea in oil-skin bags , and brandy in half anchors, and sometimes come to the number of an hundred or two hundred persons , and carry them off by force: On the fifth of December an officer of the customs observed a cutter hovering about the port near Eastbridge , he did very properly, and applied to some of the King's troops belonging to General

            's regiment, which were in the town they must go through; they went to a house the smugglers used to frequent, and inquired if there were any smugglers there, but they did not expect to be informed at the house where they used, but at last they got some information that they were in the stable; there the smugglers had concealed themselves , to the number of twelve , and the first salutation the custom house officers and soldiers were to have, was the smugglers firing upon the King's troops, and they did fire upon the King's troops, and the King's troops they returned it into the stable; there was never a man killed, but two horses were wounded, and a ball went through Scott's hat; they consulted whether they should stay there, or force their way out, and they agreed to force their way out , which they did, and one of the Prisoners (Scott) happened to come to some accident by his horse's falling, or probably he had not been taken. Scott had a brace and an half of pistols , all loaden with hall , which they took from him, and Chilvers had a musquetoon; they found that it was not then actually charged, but it had been just discharged, and was black, and had a scurf on it, and it is plain that this was one of the pieces that was discharged at them: the custom-house officer desired to know where they had got their tea and their brandy , but it is not discovered, and that remains in the dark, but the smugglers went down to the coast to take this tea and brandy that was on board this smuggling cutter , but when they came down, they were told it was not for them, but was designed for another gang ; whether they had these goods or not , does not come under this Act of Parliament, and that made me to state to you what the offence under this Act of Parliament is; it is being armed and assembled to such a number, with an intent, or in order to be aiding and assisting in the running and landing uncustomed goods; for the occasion and necessity of making this Act of Parliament arose from such great numbers being assembled and armed, and as to their being assembled there can be no doubt , and that they were armed ; and there were eleven horses left in the stable which they could not carry out. The next thing is as to their intent in being thus assembled and armed ; here is a cutter comes within the limits of the port of Southwold, this cutter could not come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150032"/> in there to pay duty, and the tea could not be landed there by law, and to pay duties at that place; and this cutter must come within the limits of the port without the knowledge of the custom-house officers, or applying to them; so if you believe the evidence , it is plain with what intent they were assembled; but this is plain here, for these goods were carried off by another gang; if you believe this, this makes it as plain as that case, in which they are proved to be armed and assembled .</p>

             called .</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. I am an officer of the customs at Southwold , in Suffolk.</p>
               <p>Q. Now give an account what you know of a cutter's coming on that coast , on the 5th of Dec.</p>
               <p>Wiggs. On the 5th of Dec. in the morning, I saw a cutter, and I went to my collector.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who the cutter belonged to?</p>
               <p>Wiggs . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it within the limits of the port?</p>
               <p>Wiggs . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it off the coast ?</p>
               <p>Wiggs . About a mile and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know by the make of her, what she was designed for?</p>
               <p>Wiggs . Yes; I know by the sight of her, what she was. My officer went to the officer of the soldiers, and he got his men together, and went to take their goods, and our officer got our men together .</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. At Eastbridge . We went to a publick house, where the smugglers generally used, and asked whether any smugglers were there; they said, no. I was resolved to search the house, and presently I heard a blunderbuss, or a musquetoon go off; and the lieutenant of the soldiers said, they were fired upon out of the stable, and the soldiers fired upon them through the stable-door: and the smugglers got out and run away; most of them got out at the stable-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. Not then, I don't know whether they were there, or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first time you saw these men?</p>
               <p>Wiggs . I went out of the yard into the street, and the soldiers were bringing them along; Mr. Scott had got but a little way, but Mr. Chilvers had got a matter of three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with them about smuggling ?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. Mr . Chilvers said to me that they went down to the vessel, and they were informed there, there were no goods on board of the cutter for them: for they were designed for another gang.</p>
               <p>Q. How many smugglers did you see?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. They stood pretty thick , I could not see how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than two?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. Yes, I saw five, six, or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the goods in the smuggling cutter?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the stable?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. Yes, after the fire was over, and I found three carbines and a blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses were there?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. Eleven horses, but two of them were wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that you have there?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. It is a carbine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for them to carry these carbines?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. They always carry them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they more commodious than other arms?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. They are lighter.</p>
               <p>Pris. Scott. Ask him whether he saw me fire out of the stable?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. I saw no man fire.</p>
               <p>Chilvers. Did you see any tea or brandy along with us?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Eastbridge from the shore?</p>
               <p>Wiggs. About two miles.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you, on the fifth of December, with any smugglers ?</p>
               <p>Blair. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Blair. At Eastbridge , Scott fell from his horse and Chilvers was on foot.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of the smugglers?</p>
               <p>Blair. There were ten or more; these two pistols I took from Scott, and there was another taken from him by my comrade .</p>
               <p>Q. Shew how they were wore about his person.</p>
               <p>Blair . They were in a belt , R. S. is cut upon each of them, they were both loaded and primed, and one of them was loaded with bullets cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the consequence of being wounded by them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150033"/>Blair. Very dangerous , I had rather be wounded by a ball than wounded by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Scott fire?</p>
               <p>Blair. No, I saw one of the smugglers fire, but I believe it was not Scott; Scott surrendered to me, I told him I would blow his brains out if he did not surrender; I took two pistols from him, but I did not suspect he had a third, and my comrade took it from him; we had ten men along with us; I told the Prisoners it is a wonder our men did not stand more together, if they had we might have got more of you; I asked Chilvers how many there were of them, he said about ten ; I asked why they did not go down to the coast to take their goods away; and Chilvers told me they did go down, but they were told there were no uncustomed goods on board of that cutter for them, for they were designed for another gang.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out of the stable?</p>
               <p>Blair. I saw Chilvers run, and Scott was mounting at the door, and one of my men let fly at him .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any fire from the stable?</p>
               <p>Blair. One piece was discharged from the stable-door next the street , the first was from the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many were fired?</p>
               <p>Blair. No, because our men fired so many.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us when and where you saw him.</p>
               <p>Barrett . I saw him on the 11th of February, 1746, at a place called Folkstone-Warren , about half a mile from Folkstone , with about fifty people, armed with fire arms, and about eighty horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Folkstone-Warren lie upon the sea-coast?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he and these people doing?</p>
               <p>Barrett. They were landing of goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods?</p>
               <p>Barrett. There were three ton weight of tea landed, and about thirty half anchors of wine and brandy; there were three bags of tea on each horse, and about a quarter of a hundred in each bag, and about three hours afterwards I saw him with fifteen or sixteen people, and he was driving some horses .</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Six.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses loaden?</p>
               <p>Barrett . Yes, they were loaden with tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him at other times?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes, I saw him on the first of November, and the third of November; when he was armed I did not see him with goods.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. What time did you see him at Folkstone ?</p>
               <p>Barrett. About seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that is the man?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As to these bags, do you know what was in them?</p>
               <p>Barrett. I did not see what was in them?</p>
               <p>Q. What are you ?</p>
               <p>Barrett. I am a blacksmith at Folkstone .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you to have no gratuity for this?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember the time?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Because I made a memorandum in my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you write and read?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not an allowance of ten shillings a week for coming here?</p>
               <p>Barrett. What signifies that.</p>
               <p>Q. But have you not ten shillings a week?</p>
               <p>Barrett. How should I live else?</p>
               <p>King's Coun. Have you that ten shillings a week to swear falsely?</p>
               <p>Barrett. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you had any money offered you?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes, I have had forty guineas offered me by Kemp's friends not to appear against him.</p>
               <p>Kemp. I never was in Folkstone-Warren in my life, and I am as innocent of the affair as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had any witnesses * you might have got them.</p>
               <p> * He was to have been tried last Sessions, and then he made an affidavit, that he had two material witnesses who could not be there then, and that he could not with safety proceed upon his trial without them; upon which account his trial was put off.</p>
               <p>Pris. I have been shut up, and could not have any opportunity of making my defence. I never saw the witness,

             . Yesterday was sev'night, the Prisoner at the bar came home a little before eleven o'clock at night, (I was in bed.) He desired to have a halfpenny dram, or a halfpenny worth of gin, I can't say which: which he had; and my wife desired him to go up to his own apartment . He had not been up stairs above five minutes, before she cried out, Palmer, Palmer, come up stairs: and the Prisoner said, G - d d - n you, you b - b.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his voice?</p>
               <p>Palmer . Yes, perfectly well; my wife would have had me have gone up, as I had several times before: but I refused. A little time afterwards, I heard a rattling of the sashes , as if they had been dashed to pieces; and I heard something fall lump upon the ground, in the yard; and thought something was thrown out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any struggling before you heard something fall to the ground?</p>
               <p>Palmer . No. I heard somebody say afterwards, my dear Esther has fell out of the window . I sat up in my bed and said, d - n you for a rogue, you have thrown your wife out of the window yourself, and murdered her at last.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to suspect any such thing ?</p>
               <p>Palmer . Because he was always beating and abusing her in a most barbarous manner. Then he came down stairs, I don't know who opened the door, the Prisoner or I: but we dragged her into the house; she had her shift and cap on, her shift was up to the reins of her back, and her nose bloody: but I did not observe what bruises she had. Mr. Tate the surgeon was sent for, and he came .</p>
               <p>Q. What was done afterwards?</p>
               <p>Palmer . I can't tell, for I was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner go for a surgeon?</p>
               <p>Palmer . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he returned?</p>
               <p>Palmer. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun . What house do you keep? Are you a distiller, or a publican?</p>
               <p>Palmer . If my Lord asks me, I will answer him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he often quarrelled with her; I would ask you, whether the woman was not strong enough to get the better of him? Whether you did not think the woman to have more strength than the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I have seen them fighting often; she was a lusty woman to be sure .</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a strong, robust woman?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I don't know, I never tried her strength. He was standing at the head of his wife, after he came back from the surgeon's: and I said, if your wife dies, you shall be hanged; will that satisfy you, said he?</p>
               <p>Palmer . If it does not, says I, you shall be gibetted; will that satisfy you, says he?</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether he lamented the misfortune , and seemed sorry or concerned for his wife?</p>
               <p>Palmer . He did not shew any sorrow at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Palmer . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any washing-tub found upon the ground?</p>
               <p>Palmer . No; there were two hoops found there the next morning .</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a sound was it?</p>
               <p>Palmer . As if somebody plump'd naked upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any clothes on?</p>
               <p>Palmer . No; she had nothing but her smock on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never any quarrel with him?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I never had any quarrel with him, only for preventing him from beating his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no quarrel with him at this time?</p>
               <p>Palmer . No; I only do this to do justice between God and man.</p>

When the Prisoner came home, I was at work up one pair of stairs; the Prisoner came and knocked at the door, and called to his wife to let him in; accordingly she got out of bed and let him in: not in at the street-door, but the door of his chamber.

               <p>Q. Before you heard the deceased fall upon the ground, did you hear any thing between her and her husband?</p>
               <p>Waldron . Nothing at all; and at the same time she fell, I heard water fall; they lived very badly together , and I have heard her cry out murder in the night. I believe, ten or twenty times.</p>

             . I am a lodger in the same house, one pair of stairs above them ; I was in bed, and I heard the deceased call to Mr. Palmer to come up, four or five times, and heard some disturbance in the room; and I imagined that they were throwing water at each other. Afterwards I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150037"/> heard the Prisoner go down, and he said, his dear wife or dear-Esther , or something like that; afterwards Mr . Palmer accused him of throwing his wife out of the window , and killing her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Prisoner and his wife live together ?</p>
               <p>Bryan . I can't tell, I had not lived there long.</p>
               <p>Joseph James, surgeon . I was called upon last thursday to examine the body of the deceased; I attended the coroner's inquest: there was a cut over the right eye, upon the forehead, which seemed to be done by a stone, or something ragged. There was another upon her right knee, and a cut upon her nose; and both bones of the nose were all to pieces , and her tongue was cut, and hung out of her mouth; and her knees were broke. These wounds seemed to be done all at one fall, because the wounds were all on one side .</p>
               <p>Q. The question is , whether you think she did die of the fall?</p>
               <p>James . Yes, I believe she did die of that fall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, if I was guilty in the least of this misfortune , I would not give you any trouble. I am a shoemaker, my master brought me some work, and said, if I would go with him to the Three Cups, he would give me some work, and he gave me a tankard of beer ; I said, I would be my three pence, and we would have another tankard. Afterwards I went to my brother at Newport-market, we had four pints of beer, and for fear I should be looked out , I came home the sooner. I called out several times, Esther let me in; at last the street-door was opened , and I went up stairs to my own door, and called Esther, and she let me in, and said , so you are come; I said, don't be angry, for I am not: and laughed at her. She took and threw up the sash, (being angry, as I thought ,) and was going to throw out a tub of water; said I, what do you throw the water out for? Said she, I will throw it out, and she did throw it out; and she went to throw it as far as she could, and threw herself out. I went to catch hold of her, but could not reach her; and I said, Oh my dear jewel! she is gone out of the window: and my landlord said, Oh you rogue! you have killed her . When she was brought in, she was all over bloody, and could not speak; says Mrs. Palmer, fetch a halfpenny worth of hartshorn drops , which I did; then my landlord fell a cursing and swearing at me, as much as he could: and then I went to surgeon Tate, and afterwards he got some of the watchmen, and took me Prisoner. I never touched my wife all the time I was in the room.</p>

               <p>Grundy. Yes. I had a letter sent me to inform me that some of my tar was landed at Beighton's-Wharf , I went to Beighton's-Wharf , in St. Olave's gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner there ?</p>
               <p>Grundy. Not the first day. When I came to Beighton's-Wharf I saw some of my own tar , and I went to see whether I had lost any off my wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your tar designed for abroad?</p>
               <p>Grundy. It was designed for the East-Indies , and was iron bound, because it was to go into a hot place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to fell it?</p>
               <p>Grundy. Yes; he at first asked 22 s. 6 d. and afterwards he said it was really sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he fell it to?</p>

               <p>Q. While you was treating about this was there any cart brought there?</p>
               <p>Grundy. Yes, and loaded six barrels; I followed the cart to Mr. Coffin's house, and he had bought it at 16 s. a barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it worth?</p>
               <p>Grundy. It was worth a guinea, and as it was in iron bound casks , it was worth 23 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Coffin take it in?</p>
               <p>Grundy . No, he was afraid it was stolen, and he would not take it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he have forced you on board the tender ?</p>
               <p>Grundy . Yes, but we resisted and he could not do it; then he went on board the tender, and we pursued him, and went on board.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave then?</p>
               <p>Grundy. He said, I think, down with the main hatches and take them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he did this in order to make his escape?</p>
               <p>Grundy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun . You say there was some tar upon the wharf, did the Prisoner make use of any person's name that it belonged to?</p>
               <p>Grundy . He said one Capt. Neptall had brought the tar for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he brought any before?</p>
               <p>Grundy . He had brought pitch before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money advanced on account of this pitch and tar? please to recollect, whether you did not mention that there were four guineas advanced by some woman?</p>
               <p>Grundy. There was some talk of money that was advanced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say his own wife had advanced some money?</p>

               <p>Pros. Coun . Was you at Beighton's Wharf when the pitch and tar lay there?</p>
               <p>Hattersley . Yes, the Prisoner at the bar came to my shop and offered to sell it me, and it was, he said, at his wharf; while I was looking at the pitch, I told him I could not tell the quality of it without seeing it, he cut a barrel in two, and it looked but very indifferent then. I examined the quality of the tar.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did he ask ?</p>
               <p>Hattersley. The Prisoner said he was to give 15 s. for it, and if he could make any thing more it was for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that they were iron bound?</p>
               <p>Hattersley. Yes.</p>

               <p>Hattersley. Yes. I said how came these to be iron hooped? he said it came from Northbergen , and that iron hoops there were as cheap as wood.</p>

               <p>Hattersley. Yes, and that was the reason I would have nothing to do with it; he followed me, and said I need not be in any doubt about it, for he would make me a bill of parcels, and give me a receipt.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Did not the Prisoner call a man out of a publick-house?</p>

             . The Prisoner came to my house the 17th of December, and said he had some pitch and tar to sell; he said he kept a publick-house at the wharf, and had twelve barrels of pitch and tar from a particular friend of his, a captain of a Guernsey man. I do not know whether he asked 18 s. or not, I told him the tar was very good, and worth more money, but the pitch was very bad; he said he was to give his friend 15 s. for the pitch and tar together; I bid him 16 s. a barrel for the tar, he refused to take it, and said it was worth more money; afterwards he called me back, and said it lay in his way, and I should have it at the price. I went home, and the Prisoner at the bar came and asked why I did not come for the tar: He had loaded this tar before the gentleman who owned the goods came down; I told my man I had bought some goods, and expected them to be brought. When the tar came, my man told me he believed it was not honestly come by, and I would not take it in; the Prisoner said the tar came from Northbergen .</p>

             . I went to Beighton's Wharf presently after Mr. Grundy was upon the wharf. I asked the Prisoner whether he had any tar to sell, he said yes; I said, is this your tar? he said yes; I said, is that your pitch; he said yes. I asked him the price of the tar, he said 22 s. or 22 s. 6 d. a barrel; and he said they were sold to a man in the borough: The Prisoner would not tell the name of the Person he sold it to; therefore Mr. Grundy thought it was not honestly come by, and I thought so too.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to suspect that ?</p>
               <p>Owen. When I find any iron bound tar in such a person's hand I always suspect it; the Prisoner had put the broad arrow upon the tar; said I, who put this on? he said he did, because it had not paid the King's duty, and said he was a King's officer; said I, if you are a King's officer, let it be carried down to the warehouse; but he did not let it go to the King's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put on the broad arrow?</p>
               <p>Owen. No; but he told me he had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson. I was desired by Mr. Sarp , to go to Mr. Beighton's wharf, and I saw the tar carried away in a cart; and in a little time it was brought back again in a cart, because Mr. Coffin would not take it in.</p>
               <p>There was a warrant got, and the Prisoner threatened to take us on board the tender, with a press-gang; there were four or five fellows, that pretended to take us away, but we resisted, and asked him whether he had any authority, but he could not produce any; then he discharged the men, and threw away his hanger, and went on board the tender. Some time afterwards, Mr. Grundy and I went on board the tender, and the Prisoner bid them shut down the hatches , for he had orders from the Lords of the Admiraley , to sail directly. I asked the commander of the tender, whether he knew the Prisoner, he said, he did not. I said, we came after him, in order to take him up on suspicion of a felony. Mr. Turnbull desired he might speak to the officer of the tender, and the officer said, we might take him on shore again; (he drew his hanger on board the tender) we took him on shore, and then got a warrant and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say, as to the reason of his putting the broad arrow upon it?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. He said, he put the broad arrow upon every one of them, and said, he believed they were goods that had not paid the duty, and therefore he seized them in the King's name.</p>
