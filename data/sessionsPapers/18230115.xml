            , Jun. I had observed several times that there was a deficiency in the bullion, and laid a plan to discover it. We applied to Mr. Parker and Mr. Field, to assist us. On the 10th of December, we were at work upon silver. The prisoner had been <rs id="t18230115-1-deflabel6" type="occupation">employed at the Mint</rs>

On the day in question, he was employed in cutting the silver out into round pieces, which we call blanks, for the purpose of being afterwards stamped. Our practice was to give out a certain quantity in the morning marked with the weight on it, and in the evening after it is coined it is weighed again. On the 10th of December Mr. Franklyn, Jun. informed me of a deficiency - and I stationed Parker and Field to stop the men and boys as they came out on leaving work. I was present and saw Field take hold of the prisoner - a tin box then dropped from him, containing a blank key waxed over for the purpose of taking the impression of the wards of a lock, a few blanks for the manufacture of crown pieces dropped from him at the same time - he was searched, and in all were found thirteen blanks upon him, weighing upwards of eleven ounces, the value of which was full 3 l. The Mint is in the parish of St. Botolph's, Aldgate. All who occupy apartments there, occupy them as the servants of the Crown.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In delivering it out in the morning, do you ascertain the weight - A. Yes, My Lord; each quantity has a ticket on it denoting the weight.</p>

            . I have been engaged in business connected with the Mint for some time with my father. Deficiencies had been discovered before, and on the 10th of December I met Mr. Atkinson in the neighbourhood of the Mint, and accompanied him there in consequence of a deficiency being discovered. As the workmen were about to leave, I stopped them at the gate; and took them back into the moneyers hall - the prisoner was among them; I immediately separated him from the rest - his hand was then in his great coat pocket, and as I drew it from the pocket, and there fell on the ground a tin box, which opened in the fall, and a skeleton key and a blank waxed key fell out, the skeleton key has had wax upon it, and is not quite finished. A key being waxed enables a person to take an impression of the wards, and file it to fit them; and some cotton was in the box for the purpose of laying the key on when it has received the impression, that it might not be rubbed out in carrying it. I took both the keys to the strong hold of the Mint, where bullion and other things are deposited - I found the pipes of the same bore at the locks; the one nearly finished would not quite pass the wards. I searched him further, and in taking off his coat three or four round pieces of silver fell on the ground, from his waistcoat pocket I believe, and immediately afterwards a bag containing more pieces fell from him; there were thirteen in all; they were blanks intended for crown pieces. He said he found the keys in his way to the Mint - with respect to the silver blanks, he supposed somebody must have put them into his pockets. I produce the thirteen silver blanks.</p>

I afterwards assisted Jefferson in apprehending her, and heard her say voluntarily, that she was very sorry it had come to this. She was convicted before the Magistrate under the pawnbroker's act, and sent to prison for three months. This was only for part of the property. She has received no punishment for some of the things.

The prisoners came together to our house, about eight o'clock one Sunday night; they had two donkies, and said they wanted to speak to me; I asked their business - Seabrook said they had a donkey or two to sell, for they were in distress, as they had been gambling at the Crown, public-house, at Anstead. I went with them to a public-house; they had three more donkies there. I at last gave them 10 s., a quart of ale, and a load of sand for one of them - they delivered it to me; they were both together. Seabrook said it was his own, but Barnes said he should not sell it for 10 s., for he would go without bread first. Seabrook said he should sell it, and Barnes said no more. Seabrook took the money. Both appeared to be dealing with me. Barnes fetched the donkey out of the orchard. I left them and on Monday morning they both came for the load of sand, and carried it away on the donkey which they had - Barnes helped to load. I did not see them again for a week or ten days, when they were taken at Ridley, both in bed at different houses. Barnes hid himself in bed after being dressed. I kept the donkey with my others. Dix afterwards saw it at the public-house - it had a sore tail.</p>

On the 2d of January, about six o'clock in the evening, after dark, I saw the prisoners Davis and Froom, with another person (not in custody), standing at my window - I suspected them. I was in the street coming home, and passed the door. The shop is part of the dwelling-house. About ten yards further I saw another suspicious character, walking to and fro and looking about. I then crossed the street, and saw Maller watching on that side of the way - I again crossed towards my shop, and stood about twenty seconds, and saw Davis push his fingers against the window; the glass fell inside. I seized him; his fingers went inside the glass, which I found had been cut by some sharp instrument. He slipped from me - I pursued, and in the pursuit I saw Maller running; I seized him, and Davis was taken by another person who is not here - I never lost sight of him. On returning towards the house with them two, I saw Froom endeavouring to hide himself against one of the pillars of the Opera colonade, which is opposite my house; I pointed him out and he was secured. I am certain of his person. I gave them in charge. I am certain I saw Davis's fingers go inside through the glass - I saw the tip of his finger through, on the other side of the glass, inside the shop; I could see that through the glass. I am certain his finger was inside the shop.</p>

On the evening of the 23d of December, I was standing in the shop, about a quarter past eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner come up and look round as if waiting for somebody in the shop; he went away, then returned, and took a piece of carpet which stood about three yards inside the shop, and ran across the road with it - I am sure it was him. I informed Mr. Cross, who was in the shop - we pursued; I lost sight of him as I turned the corner, and found my master had hold of him; the carpet was then on the ground - I brought it back, it was the same which he took, and is worth 3 l.

In consequence of what Calf said, I ran out; I caught sight of the prisoner turning the corner - he was running gently, in a direction from my house, carrying the carpet; he turned the corner. I did not see him put it down, but followed close, and saw him standing about a yard from it, and collared him; I had made no alarm. I took him back - he tried to get from us.

Mrs. M'Lean came there to me between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and said somebody had broken into the parlour. I returned home - I unlocked the parlour door where I lodge, and found it bolted inside. A man got in at the window, and unbolted it. I found two child's frocks on the sofa bedstead - I had left them in the drawers a day or two before, and had not moved them. Some of the drawers were partly open; I had left them shut. Nobody but me lodged there. I left the window shut and the blinds also, in the morning.</p>

I took some things out of the drawers, and mixed them with those on the sofa; but I saw the frocks there before that. The man who got in at the window is not here.

I knocked at the door, and then saw the prisoner getting out of the window - I am certain of him; he jumped down from the rails and ran off. There was no light but from the lamps. I could not see his face, but I kept within a yard of him all the way, and never lost sight of him till I caught him about a hundred yards off, at the corner of Archer-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you an opportunity of observing his face - A. No. I knocked at the door and called out mother before I saw him come out; my face was towards the window - nobody was between me and him.

            . On Saturday morning, the 7th of December, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning I received information, and went down the yard leading to my slaughter house, in Wheeler-street, and saw three men there breaking up a copper - they said they were employed by a Mr. Paget of Wheeler-street, to break it up there. I said,</p>
               <p>"I should like to see Paget before the copper goes off the premises" - I sent for him, and was left with the three men. I believe both the prisoners to be two of them; but will only swear to Clay; I am certain of him. They took the copper up, put it into a sack, and went out of the yard with it. I went out with them, and said,</p>
               <p>"I shall follow you." Paget came up, and said in their presence that he knew nothing about the property or them. Clay was going up Fleur-de-lis-court; Izard followed and took him with the chopper and axe - one of the others had the copper on his back, I think it was Smith; I followed him, he laid it down by the White-heart window - I took it up, and gave it to Hart. Clay was brought back and taken to the watch-house. Smith and the other man got off. I found Smith at Worship-street on the Tuesday.</p>

            . About a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning of the 7th of December, I went to the slaughter house for a sheep, and saw Clay and Smith (I am sure of them), and another person breaking up a brewing copper; it appeared nearly new - I went to Spitalfields-market, returned, and saw them still there breaking it up, Horwood desired me to go and ask Paget if he sent them to break it up there; I went, and he said he knew nothing of it - Clay immediately turned round and went up Fleur-de-lis-court with the axe and chopper, and at the top of the court he threw them down - I followed him; he ran up Elder-street and down Blossom-street, where I took him, and brought him back with the axe and chopper. I saw Smith at Worship-street, on the Tuesday after, and pointed him out from among other persons.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Old-street, St. Lukes. I know both the prisoners. On Friday night, the 6th of December, between seven and nine Clay came to me with a washing tray, a knife tray, a few old forks, three old sacks, and several other small articles - a few minutes afterwards Smith brought three coolers, and another person was with them; they brought other things as well, and left them all with me, and wanted me to buy them, but said they had a copper also, and I was to see that in the morning. I asked Clay where I could see it, and I think he said at No. 14, Curtain-road - I appointed eleven o'clock in the morning; they went away leaving the things with me, and about nine o'clock in the morning Smith and another man came to my house; they said Clay was gone to work - I said I was to go to see the copper at eleven, and they said their mother had moved, and that she had given the copper to Clay. I said they must take the things away, or bring their mother or brother - they went away, and I went to No. 14, Curtain-road, and found Clay had not lived there. I saw</p>
               <p>"Acton-place," chalked on the tun bowl, and as I thought No. 1, I went there, but the house was shut up. Smith had agreed to come at two o'clock, so I got an officer ready, who took him when he came. I advanced Clay 8 s. overnight.</p>

I had the chopper in my hand, and finding there was a disturbance, I put it down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150007"/>and walked away - I made no resistance.

I missed a quantity of coals from my cellar, and observed that the last thing the prisoner did of an evening before she left, was to get up a quantity of coals, and the same in the morning, and knowing I could not use them I was resolved to watch her. Last Saturday I saw her bring a very large pile of very large coals. When she had done every thing but opening the shutters, she went outside the door for that purpose, and in that interval of time I got out of bed, took a candle, and went into the attic room, and saw that the coals were there; she immediately returned, and left the room - the moment she shut the door I got out of bed again with my two sons, and the large coals were all gone. It was impossible anybody could have taken them but her; I had seen them not two minutes before. She has only lived with me since Christmas. I should think something less than half a bushel were taken - she returned about eleven o'clock in the day; I told her she had caused me great uneasiness that morning, she trembled - I charged her with it, she denied it. I told her how I had watched her; she still denied it, and said she would send somebody to silence me, and abruptly left the room, and returned with her husband. I had told her she had better throw herself on my compassion than insult me - her husband also insulted and threatened me. I told him it was not suspicion, but ocular proof; he then said his wife was innocent, and if I would not prosecute his wife, he would prosecute me. I gave her in charge.</p>

            . I am a sergeant major. The prisoner did not sleep in the Tower; his company had occupied the room were the clothes were. I was present when he was apprehended near the draw-bridge, on the 7th of January. Burgess pointed him out - he was dressed in a white flannel jacket. The battallion had been drawn up before that, and Burgess pointed him out. I afterwards placed him among others, and he recognized him again; he denied all knowledge of Burgess. I went that day to assist in searching his lodgings at a tobacconist's shop, and found a trap-door in the attick, over his room, and there the officers found a soldier's forage cap, and a bag containing skeleton keys. The prisoner said they were his, and he considered them as lumber, and put them there out of the way. Twenty-three of the coats were traced to Burgess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What had the room been used for before the coats were there - A. A barrack room, until the coats were put there, which I believe was on the 10th of December; they were moved into another room on the 27th. I cannot say which room they were stolen from. Burgess inspected about four hundred men on parade before he saw the prisoner; he was not among them. After that three or four people were with Burgess; the prisoner was brought - I said he had not seen that man, and then he said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." The prisoner's room was on the first floor - the house is but two stories high. When the keys were opened, he acknowledged that they were his. Two of them opened two doors of the rooms the coats were deposited in.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 6th of January, I went with a search warrant to Allen's in the Minories, with Sutton, and found some coats there. I went to the prisoners lodging next day; it is a second floor back room. He was not there, but his wife was - I went up into the attick, which is used by all the lodgers, and in the loft found the cap in a bundle, with a quantity of other things used by soldiers, and after the prisoner was pointed out, I asked him how he came to leave his keys and files in the garret; he said he generally used them there, and that he put them in the loft - I then produced them, he claimed the cap, skeleton keys, and other things. I shewed him the keys and asked for what purpose he bought them; he said he did not buy them, but found them in a cupboard where he formerly lodged - I asked if he had altered either of them; he said No, he had done nothing to them since he had had them. One key opens a large room, and another opens two doors, and another small one has fresh marks where it has been filed. He denied all knowledge of Burgess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Every thing but the keys are what he used to his gnn - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a dealer in old clothes, and live in Glass House-yard, Rosemary-lane. I have bought about forty soldiers great coats of the prisoner at different times - the first was last Monday four weeks; 3 s. was the average price I gave him. I asked if he was allowed to sell them; he said he was, that they were three years old, and he had bought them of his comrades, and was in the habit of doing so to make a trifle for his family. I sold some of them to Allen - I saw them again last Monday week at Allen's, and afterwards at the Mansion House. I was taken into custody, and afterwards made a witness.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in custody -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150009"/>A. From Monday till Wednesday. The officer said Allen bought them of me, and asked if I sold them to him, I said I did. I have dealt with the prisoner about five times; he was dressed in a regimental undress - I never asked what regiment he belonged to. I told the sergeant who I had them from. I was taken down from the Compter next day to identify the man. I deal in rag-fair, and have no shopman. When I bought the first, he said he should have more another day; I gave him 3 s.; 2 s. 9 d., and 2 s. 6 d., for them. I sold some to Allen - 3 s. 6 d. was the average price I got for them. I told them directly that I would find out the man.</p>

The articles stated in the indictment were delivered him to polish - the tea-set was plated, and all the rest silver. The urn and silver tea-pot were delivered him on Monday, the 12th of August; he was to return them on Friday, the 15th. As he did not come I went after him, but did not see him till the 28th of November. I have not found the property. I searched his house; his tools and every thing portable was taken away.</p>

I delivered him the goods myself; it was all my own except the plated tea service. I was brought up a Jew - my ideas now are solely a belief in a Supreme Being. There are parts in the Old and New Testaments which I do not believe. I entertain doubts of any Revelation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150010"/>being made by the Supreme Being to man.

I turned round and saw the prisoner running towards me as hard as he could; I seized him - he had a handkerchief in his hand wrapping something up; I took hold of the handkerchief, and he slipped out of my hand; I took him again; Brown came up, and said he was the man.

On the 3d of January, about half-past 10 o'clock at night, I went into a room which had neither fire or candle in it, to see if the window was safe, it was so. and I found the prisoner laying on the bench with a table rather over him; I asked what he was doing there? he said he was very sleepy; I told him to go out, for we were shutting up - he went out, and I shut the door after him; I fastened the door and windows - I went again and looked all over the house, and left all safe. I was the last person up; I heard nothing in the night. I got up about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, came down stairs and went into the bar, and found all the tills pulled out, and three of them gone, which contained a great quantity of halfpence, and four half-crowns wrapped up in a bit of paper; all this money was gone. The tills and money were safe after I turned him out of the house at night. I examined the house, every thing was safe in front, but in the back parlour I found a lower pane of glass cut clean out, it was quite large enough for a man to get in at - he could then come from the parlour into the bar; he was not in the back parlour the night before; I am certain that window was safe when I went to bed - it is a good height from the ground, but there is a shed he could get on and easily get in. The wash-house joins the parlour, I went in there and found two of the tills laying there empty, and a pail gone, and the wash-house door open, which was bolted and locked the night before - the key of which hung in the bar, and still hung there; I think the lock had been pushed back; I found the other till empty in front of the bar. I was the first person up in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I came home from sea, I always drank at your house - A. I only remember seeing him twice.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George in the East. On Saturday the 4th of January, about five o'clock in the morning, before day break, I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Phillip-street, about one hundred and fifty yards from the Angel, coming in a direction from there, and going towards his lodgings - he had a pail on his shoulder, and a flank of beef curled round on the top of it. I asked what he had got, he made no reply - I asked again, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Beef," that he belonged to a ship in the London Docks, called the Hope - he went on a few yards, and kicked violently at the door of a butcher's shop; I asked what he wanted, he said,</p>
               <p>"Some pork," he said he bought the beef in Ratcliff-highway. I saw two officers over the way, whom I called to my assistance; he wanted me to go to the butcher's where he bought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150011"/>beef - they went with him, and I remained with the pail, I found it very weighty, and on lifting up the beef, found a piece of printed cotton, and under that a quantity of penny pieces and halfpence; the officers brought him back, and said he had bought the beef. I then said what I found in the pail; we took him to the Thames Police Office, and I afterwards counted the copper, it amounted to 4 l. 19 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The pail was not on my shoulder - A. The moment I came up he put it off his shoulder on the ground.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner with Kendall, who called to me, the pail then stood on the step of a butcher's door - we went and enquired about the beef, and returned with him and examined the pail, which contained 4 l. 19 s. 6 d., a cotton apron and some beef; a silver sixpence was among the halfpence, I afterwards searched him, and found in his trowsers pocket three half-crowns, a shilling, and fifteen-pence in copper, all loose in his pocket. I asked how he came by the money in the pail, he said he could not tell, but that in his pocket was his own. Pawson claimed the apron; I found a key on him, which he said belonged to his lodging, but would not tell where that was.</p>

R. with a red stone, in it; he afterwards pulled a fine gold seal out of his pocket and asked the value, I said 3 l. or 4 l. he wanted me to advance 1 l. on it, I refused because it had a coat of arms on it.</p>

I was getting ready to go with her, and when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150012"/>was half naked, she said she wanted a pair of boot-laces, and then a stay-lace; I said; I had plenty of both, she then said she wanted to buy a pair of gloves - I said she had used mine, and could use them again - she said, she had had enough of me, and would borrow no more. I said,</p>
               <p>"Ann, I am afraid, there is some scheme in it" - she said,</p>
               <p>"No there is not, you know where to find me;" and immediately went out; I expected she was going to Burton-crescent, where we had appointed to go. I got ready and went, but she was not there - I never saw her again. Next morning when I went to breakfast, I found my tea-caddy wrenched open by a fork, and four sovereigns; three crown-pieces; three shillings and sixpence gone, which I had seen safe at eleven o'clock the day before, I missed nothing else that day, being too much confused to look about, on the 5th I missed a petticoat, apron, and a new shift; she left on Tuesday, and on Saturday week, I saw her at Marlborough-street I saw her stripped and my shift found on her back, with my name on it. I claimed it, and said I have been a mother and a friend to you, and why did you distress a poor person like me? I neither threatened or promised her, she cried and said,</p>

               <p>"Mrs. Harrison, I am very sorry, but I have done it, and do not know what possessed me to do it;" she said, she opened the tea-caddy with a fork, and that the duplicate of my apron and petticoat, were at the place where the officers took her, she acknowledged taking the money.</p>

Next day I went into the City, and on returning about half-past four o'clock, my wife informed me of something, and I missed the bag of money from the desk, containing 7 l. in silver, and twenty sovereigns. On the Saturday morning I missed two silk shawls from my windows, early in the morning, before I got up; and on Sunday, when we went out to chapel, my wife locked the shop door, and on returning we found it had been opened by some means, and found it open again in the afternoon. I immediately questioned the prisoner who had been left in the care of the house; she said no person had been in, and she did not know how it came open. I looked round the shop and found several things misplaced; she persisted that she knew nothing of it. I demanded to search her box, which she willingly acceded to. My wife went up stairs, and brought down a piece of flannel, and a piece of Irish; she said she bought both at Todd's, in Fore-street, and that her mother was with her at the time; she said the flannel measured two yards and a quarter wide, and a thumb over. I found there were two yards and a half; I cannot swear to the Irish, having no mark on it - there is a piece of dirt on one end of the flannel, by which I know it; she persisted that it was not mine. I sent my wife for a piece out of the shop, which had been cut off for a customer; I matched it, it tallied exactly - it must be mine.</p>

Wood came into my service on the 26th of November, and on the Sunday evening following, I heard the door shut, and asked her who came in, she said her brother and sister had just gone out; next morning at breakfast my man gave me information, and I missed two yards and a half of ladies cloth, part of a blue kerseymere, and a green pelisse cloth, cut; the ladies cloth was safe on the Saturday night, the kerseymere and pelisse cloths had been cut by small scissars, one yard and a quarter had been cut off the pelisse cloth. Having no other female servant, I charged the prisoner with it, she denied it, I asked where her brother and sister lived, she said,</p>
               <p>"No. 9, Charles-street, New Kent Road;" I accompanied an officer there; there were two Nos. 9, but no such name as Wood. The officer fetched her to point out the house, and said in her hearing, that she had confessed the robbery, and that her brother lived in Whitecross-street, she said nothing to it; she afterwards took us to the house in Whitecross-street; she went up stairs, I followed her into a room on the third floor, and there found the prisoner Ward, she said that was her brother, the window of the room was open. I called the officer up, he came up in about five minutes, during which time Ward was going to the door, I caught him by the collar, he tried to throw me down, I had not told him what I came about; when the officer came I gave him in charge, I loosed my hold and he sat down by the window; I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and drop something out of window; I looked out and saw a key rebound to the other side of the street; I called to a gentleman to pick it up, I sent Mr. Picket, down for it, and saw the gentleman deliver it to him, the officer tried to unlock a box in the room with the key, but could not, he was going to break it open, but the prisoner Ward said,</p>
               <p>"give me the key and I will open it," which he did, the officer took out two bundles, the second was tied up in a white pocket-handkerchief, it contained a yard and three quarters of blue kerseymere, and a yard and a quarter of pelisse cloth, which I knew to be mine; Ward said that was all belonging to me; I have compared them with other cloth, and they tally where they were cut, and there is a particular mark of white thread in the kerseymere by which I know it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of December, I was at Mr. Slack's house, and heard Wood deny the charge, she said her brother and sister lived in Charles-street, New Kent Road; I accompanied Mr. Slack there, and returned for her, to take her there in the coach; in Blackfriars-Road, I told her it was no use deceiving me, for I was determined to find it out, she bust into tears, and said,</p>
               <p>"I cut it off myself," I asked where her brother and sister lived, she said,</p>
               <p>"at No. 4, Lower<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150015"/>Whitecross-street," she said she delivered it to Ward; we went to Whitecross-street with her, she went up with Mr. Slack, I stopped below, and soon after Mr. Slack called out of window for me, I went up the wrong staircase, but when I got to the room, I found Ward and Mr. Slack struggling together, I collared Ward and pushed him down into a chair close by the window, I did not see the key go, as my back was turned, but Mr. Slack said.</p>
               <p>"He has thrown something out of window," the prisoner said nothing, it was brought up - I tried to open the box with it, but could not, but he said he would open it, and did so, and I found the cloth which Mr. Slack immediately claimed, he described it before he saw it; I found a key on Wood which opens the door of Ward's lodging, and found a similar key upon Ward's wife; Ward said the cloth was given to him to make 
               <persName id="t18230115-25-person313">Wood</persName>
             a pelisse; he said nothing about the kerseymere and other cloth. I took him to Guildhall and left him in charge of my partner, and he run out; but was secured half-way a cross the yard; Wood said she did give him the cloth at Mr. Slack's shop, she said nothing about a pelisse; I believe she said she cut the cloth before he came there.</p>

            . I am Mr. Slack's brother-in-law. I was in the coach at the time Wood made the confession. I told her the crime was a henious one, and if she had been induced by her brother to do it, she should confess. I made her no promise; she said she cut it off by the persuasion of her brother, and had it ready for him by the time he came - that he was in the house about ten minutes, and the bell rang, and he went away - that he took it away in his pockets, and that he sometimes went by the name of Ward. I went with her to Whitecross-street, where she said the cloth was; a key which was found on her, she said, opened her brother's door. A gentleman in the street gave me the key which opened the box; the witness's account is correct.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Lainson's. I was inside the door when the officers came. I followed him out, and saw the prisoner with the bale on his back at the corner of Watling-street, which is ten or twelve yards from our door; the officer was securing another man. I was close to the prisoner when he dropped the bale - he turned the corner, and I followed him, crying Stop thief! I never lost sight of him, he ran about twenty yards, when somebody knocked him down. I am certain he is the man who dropped the bale - he was given in charge; the bale had been left by the carrier about half an hour before; it was taken from the door in Bread-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether it was given him to carry or not, you do not know - A. I know it was safe a minute before; he said nothing about how he got it,</p>

On the 6th of December, a little after five o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner close to the prosecutor's house, I saw him go and jump against the door, trying to break it open. I told him not to do it, he made no answer; I knew him before by having lived in the neighbourhood; the watch was not on. I told my father of it the same night, and Mr. Page next morning. I did not lay hold of him, because I knew he would strike me. I left him, but saw him go to the window and take a shutter down.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call Stop thief - A. I did not know what to do. There was another boy with me, but there was two more boys with him. After taking the shutter down, he went to the window and tried to get the lead away to get in, and I told the boy who was with me to come away, or we should get into trouble. I did not call Stop thief! for it is a very dull place, as hardly anybody passes of a night. I told my father directly he came from work. I knew where the constable lived, but do not think he was at home, for there was no light in his room. I did not see the prisoner get into the house. I work with my father.</p>

I was standing at my door looking at him; he cut away the glass - there was nobody near to call to. I did not lay hold of him, because he could beat me and two or three together. I saw him get through the glass - he broke the box open, and threw the things out of the window. I could not see what they were - I was not near enough, but I believe they were clothes, I did not help him to take them away. I ran up stairs and told my master, whom I live with, and he went for an officer - he is not here; he got Page next morning. I did not tell him till next morning, for he was out till ten or eleven o'clock that night; and I was in bed when he came home.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 15th of December, a little before eight o'clock, I went down stairs for some water, and observed the street-door wide open - I immediately shut it. I came up in two or three minutes, and found it wide open again, (I have several lodgers) I shut it again, and desired my wife to take a candle, and go up stairs, which she did, and called out, that there was a strange man on the stairs. I went up, and found the prisoner on the first-floor stair case, and asked who he came for; he said he came for one Johnson, a gentleman's servant. No such person ever lived in my house. I asked who sent him; he said he came from a coach-maker in Long Acre. I said. I knew every coach-maker there, he could not tell whom it was. I sent for a constable, and went up stairs with him. We found the attic-floor room broken open, the lock was forced open, and the padlock broken off besides. The constable searched him, and found two keys in his pocket, and I saw four more keys found on the staircase between the attic and where I seized him; it had been dark a long time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you present when the keys were found. - A. Yes. Donahoe, who was bound over, is not here; he found them on the stairs. I did not see him pick them up, his father lodges on my second floor - he visits there. I understand he is a carpenter. I do not know him to be a bad character.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I went up stairs when he found the door open, I took a candle - it was dark. I met the prisoner on the third flight of stairs, he had got on the first stair from the garret passage, coming down - he had no light. I asked him who he wanted, he said one Mr. Johnson - I said, we had no such name in our house. I went down stairs, he followed me down two stories. I called to my husband, who came up and secured him. I heard my husband shut the door the first time. I heard nobody come in between that and when he shut it again. I asked Donahoe to go up stairs, and see if the garret was safe; he was on the second floor looking over the bannisters; he went up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150018"/>came down and informed me the garret was broken open; he brought four keys down - my husband did not go up then; there were beds and boxes in the garret, but nothing disturbed. I afterwards went up myself, the padlock was broken off, and the other lock forced open. I had been up about six o'clock that evening, it was dark then the asp and staple were safe. I locked the door, and brought the keys down with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not marks of violence on the padlock. - A. Yes, on the staple. I never knew Donahoe to have any tools in the house. He offered me no violence, nor tried to pass me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner, about eight o'clock. I searched him, and found two keys on him; four more were produced, one of them unlocked the padlock. Donahoe said in his presence, that he found them on the stairs where the prisoner stood. I went up and found the padlock laying on the floor, and the asp wrenched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you find any thing in my possession that would have done the violence to the asp - A. No. I know nothing of Donahoe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Saturday evening, previous to this Sunday, I was in conversation at a public-house in the neighbourhood, with a man who I had seen there occasionally; he asked if I was in work, and said he could put a crown in my pocket; that an acquaintance of his was in debt, and wanted to leave his lodgings, but could not carry his box away as he had a bad arm. I asked why he did not do it, he said it was too heavy for one. I said I did not object, and met him accordingly at Moses door, which was wide open; he told me to go in and wait till a person came down stairs. I went into the passage, and in two minutes a young man came down, and gave me two keys, saying,</p>
               <p>"These are the keys of the box, and another one; wait till you hear the room door open, then come up, and take the box out; it stands on the right hand." I heard him shut a door, which appeared to be the second floor, I then went up, and at the top heard somebody coming, I stopped, and Mrs. Moses came up, asked what I wanted, and called out. Finding myself charged with a robbery, I instantly made the best excuse I could, and asked for a person I knew nothing of. I followed her down, and on the second floor her husband came up. Donahoe came out; they gave him a light, to go up to the rooms; he came down, and said the door was open, and Moses produced four keys, which he said Donahoe had picked up - these keys correspond with each other. I relied on the appearance of Donahoe, to have made out a complete conspiracy between him, another man, and the officer. The prosecutor's persuasion, or his own conscience has kept him away.</p>

            , but not the prisoner. I was standing at my door in the morning, and saw a person come up and strike Flood in the face - the blow made him stagger; when he recovered himself and came towards the curb stone, a woman who is in attendance caught the person by the collar, (he was then making another blow at him); she turned him round, and said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake have you killed the man," or</p>
               <p>"Will you kill him;" I do not know which. Flood immediately took to his heels, and made a kind of run; the person followed him - the people then came between him, and I could not see what passed; but when I came up they were struggling together, opposite a gateway - I saw Flood down, and the person in a stooping position. Flood bled at the first blow, which was over the left temple; his face was covered with blood. He went himself for a constable - I saw him again about a week afterwards. I saw nothing pass between them before the blow was struck.</p>

            . I am the house surgeon of St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought in on the 14th of October; he had a contused wound over the left eye - it was bleeding at the time. He had repeated haemorrhage from the wound; I examined it and found a coagulation of blood - I removed and stopped the bleeding; he went on favourably for two or three days, and then became rather delirious, and had more bleeding from the wound. On the 20th he became still more delirious, and on the 21st he died. I examined the wound minutely after death, and found the bone denuded - I then examined the brain, and found the membrane inflamed, and a little matter under it, just where he received the blow; the inflamation proceeded from the blow. I did not examine any other parts of his body - his vitals were all sound. I think the blow he received was the cause of his death; but if he had had proper medical assistance at first, he might have been saved.</p>

A woman was holding him, trying to prevent his striking him. Flood got away, and ran about twenty yards, the prisoner followed him and threw him down; I afterwards saw the prisoner go after him into a lodging-house; Flood sent for a constable, and he was apprehended; the deceased came into my shop in the course of the day, his face appeared cut in a dreadful manner, I advised him to go home; I saw him again next day walking about; on the Monday morning I accompanied him to the magistrate; the magistrate told the prisoner he must send him to prison, if he could not find bail - he said he could not, the deceased then said,</p>
               <p>" Tom I'll make it up with you." Something was said about what he would give him, and he said he had but 3 s. in the world; the magistrate said the expences would amount to more, it was agreed that if he could make up 10 s. he should not go to prison; his wife went out to fetch the 10 s.; the magistrate told me it was settled, and I need not stop, I afterwards saw the prisoner at large; Flood said he never quarreled with him in his life, and the prisoner said, when they were drinking together, he never would pay any thing; they appeared to know each other very well; they were both pensioners; Flood walked about as usual, he never appeared in health, he was always so very thin; the prisoner appeared to me to strike him with his left arm, (the prisoner's left arm is a stump).</p>

I did not hear him say any thing, nor do I know who took my handkerchief or money; he is the man who struck me; he did not run away, but went into the Lord Nelson.

            . I was walking behind my husband; two women came up - one of them struck him, he told them to keep off, and the other fetched a man who struck him, and knocked him down, and as he rose struck him again - and as he rose a third time, he held his head between his legs. I screamed Murder. I cannot exactly say what passed in my fright.</p>

I went, but could not open it; I then went round to the back door, and found it pulled too, but not fastened. I went up to the bed-room, and found the bolt of the lock of the bed-room door broken, and my chest broken open; I do not know what was in it; the prisoner came in - she lived at one end of the house, and I at the other; we rent it of Mr. Trimmer; my wife's box was also opened; the prisoner pretended that her door was broken open as well. I looked at it, but could see nothing the matter with it; she appeared very much frightened when I examined my boxes. I could not find the property any where. I went to Crawford to my wife. I met Beswick, and told him; I accompanied him to search the prisoner's room - we found nothing; we then went to a room which is not occupied, and found concealed up the fire place, a bag with my coat in it, and all the other property.</p>

On the 16th of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoner's room - we found her in bed; I desired her to get up - I found nothing in her room, but in a back room unoccupied, we pulled the bricks down from the chimney, and found a bag containing all these things. The room door was tied with a string; she acknowledged the bag to be her's; she was present when we found it. As we went to the Magistrate's next day, I asked if she had done it; her mother was with us - I told her mother I did not believe but she had somebody to assist her, and she told her mother in my presence voluntarily, that three gipsy women pressed her to commit the robbery.</p>

On the 20th of December, the prisoner came to me at the work-house, a paper was delivered to me by the beadle, while I was engaged with a Committee of Directors in an adjoining room, I went out into the passage and saw the prisoner, and asked him if this was his order, he said it was, I pointed out two words in it, viz.</p>
               <p>"nine," and</p>
               <p>"each," which appeared to me incorrect, I pointed to them with my fingers; I do not recollect that I read them to him, he looked at them, I asked if they were correct, he said the magistrate wrote them, and that he received the order from the magistrate; he said his demand was 10 s.; I then returned into the adjoining room, and sent 10 s. out by

            , ESQ. On the 11th of December, I remember the prisoner bringing two boys before me, charged with having been found in Oxford-street first, and afterwards in Percy-chapel, with intent to commit felony, and from what he stated, I committed them to the House of Correction for a month; Harris brought me the paper to fill up for his reward for taking them; I inserted on the order the word nine, (looking at it;) this is it, the rest of the filling up is written by my clerk, the body is printed, the word</p>
               <p>"each" was not on it when I delivered it to him; I am confident that it is not the writing of any of the office clerks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Has not the word nine been altered. - A. Not in the slightest degree; 1 s. is paid as the office fee, and I thought 4 s. for each sufficient, the letter N. has been written over something which has been written before, I was going to make it ten, but recollecting he would have to pay but one fee, I made it 9 s., and delivered it into his hands; he was a parish constable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, if I had known there had been the least thing incorrect in the order, I would not have taken it to the work-house. I thought it was 10 s. I was to have, and got a person to write a receipt for 10 s. on the back, as I took it for ten, I knew nothing of the word</p>
               <p>"each" being on it; I can write nothing but my name myself.</p>

I asked him what he had got, and upon looking, found the basket to contain a two gallon keg, and a bladder of brandy; I asked where he brought it from, he made no answer; I then said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going to take it?" he said,</p>
               <p>"To No. 3, Cloth-fair;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been robbing your master," he said,</p>
               <p>"It is only a little drop for myself". I told him I should look him up, he begged for mercy. I took him to the Compter, and found 5 l. 18 s. in his pockets - of which sum I found 3 l. 18 s. belonged to some Society, and which I returned to Messrs. Browning's clerk, (he said he worked for them); he told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150022"/>me he lived at No. 3. Cloth-fair, but I found it was No. 3, New-court, Cloth-fair. I there found a four gallon keg full of gin, a six gallon cask nearly half-full, two bottles of brandy, three pints of rum, a bottle of red port, two sample bottles of brandy, and a quart wine measure, a funnel, a brass cock, and a bladder, all of which I produce.</p>

On Sunday, the 15th of December, about seven o'clock in the morning he came to the premises; he had no business there on a Sunday. I got up and let him in, he said he wanted a pair of shoes which he had left behind him, I do not know whether he had left any behind; he had a basket in his hand; he lighted a candle from the lamp, and went down into the cellar; there are two cellers, the spirit cellar is within the other. I finished dressing myself, and went into the privy - and while there, he came up and wished me good bye, and went away. I could not see him go out - he had nothing in his hand when he came up to me. I do not know what he took out.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the prisoner Warman. My husband is porter at the Bull and Mouth. My father lived at No. 3, New-court, Cloth-fair; I was at his house the week preceding the Sunday he was taken Dalton was acquainted with my father, and came after him. I saw him there two or three days in that week. On the Monday evening before that Sunday, both him and his son, and my mother, were all there; Dalton asked if there was any thing left out for him, I said,</p>
               <p>"No," there was nothing, and the son said it was very strange, for my father knew he wanted it to take with him next morning. I said there was nothing, and they left. I told my father when he came home. The prisoner Dalton came again on the Wednesday evening alone, my father opened the door; we were in the front room; he and my father were in the kitchen, which is on the same floor; my father gave him a glass of gin; they talked a few minutes, and he then left; he came again a few minutes past six o'clock the next evening alone - he walked into the front room, and asked my father if he had anything for him to drink, he gave him a glass of brandy. After that, he said he wanted two gallons of such brandy as that; my father said he had got it for him. Dalton said,</p>
               <p>"You must buy a two gallon stone bottle, and I will pay you again;" my father said, he had got it for him; he said,</p>
               <p>"You must let me have it by Sunday morning, for John wants it" (meaning his son, who is guard to a coach). My father said, he would rather put it off till Tuesday, as it was against the rules to go to the warehouse on a Sunday. Dalton said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Joseph will let you in." My father said, he had got it all ready, and he would go and fetch it on Sunday morning; a few minutes before seven o'clock he asked for something more to drink; my father gave him a glass of gin. He then said, there was two gallon stone bottles at John's house that wanted fetching, my father said he would fetch them; he said,</p>
               <p>"Why can't Jessee fetch them?" meaning me; he said he should want four gallons of strong gin, two gallons to go on Thursday morning, and two on the Friday afterwards; he said, the gin he had drank was not so good as what my father gave him out of the warehouse - that my father was to take the brandy to John's house on the Sunday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and John would settle with him. On the Monday after my father was apprehended, I saw Dalton in Old-street Road, and told him my father was taken with the liquor - and he said he knew it, and said,</p>
               <p>"If I am taken up, I will take care to have nothing, and I shall know nothing at all about it, and they cannot hurt me, and if you are taken, you know nothing about it;" he accompanied me to John's house, which is in Old-street-road, and there I saw old Mrs. Dalton, and John's wife - the prisoner Dalton walked up and down the room, and seemed very much agitated. Old Mrs. Dalton said, in his presence,</p>
               <p>"I thought it would be the case long ago;" (I had not told her of my father's apprehension, but suppose she alluded to that); she also said,</p>
               <p>"If there had been no receivers, there would have been no thieves." Dalton said, he did not know what to do - he told me John was out of the way. Nothing more particular passed. He came to my father's house on the Wednesday evening, to find a permit for some gin, which he wanted to shew in case he was taken up - he said he wished to goodness that he could find it; I told him my father had got it. He said he did not know what to do, whether to get out of the way or not, and he would employ a lawyer and counsel, if it cost him 100 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What age are you - A. Nineteen. I have lived at my father's house ever since my marriage. I was at Guildhall on the second examination - I had seen Dalton twice before that. I was examined by the Alderman, and said I knew nothing at all about it. I was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say anything about your father having a private still then - A. A few words; I answered what I was asked about conversations between Dalton and my father. I was asked if I ever took parcels to his place; I said Yes. I do not recollect saying that I never heard any conversation between them. I do not rightly know what I said, and cannot venture to swear whether I said so or not. I went to Guildhall twice after my father was committed. Mr. Browing's clerk desired me to go. I saw the solicitor twice before the examination. I went to Guildhall a fortnight all but a day after my father was committed - I then made a statement on oath; I mentioned what had passed on the Thursday, I am quite sure that the conversation took place a few minutes after six o'clock. My father, old Dalton, and myself were the only persons present.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What you have been stating about your evidence before the Magistrate, was before Dalton was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150023"/>custody - A. Yes; when he was taken I stated every thing as I have to day.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Dalton, and as I took him to Newgate; he said he had a little liquor, but he understood something about a private still. When I took him, I said I had a warrant against him - he said,</p>
               <p>"What is it about Mr. Browning's business," and said, the old man was the d - d'st rogue in all the world; I suppose he meant Warman. He said,</p>

            . I keep the Half Moon, public-house, in Duke-street, Smithfield, and have known Dalton about two years - I believe he drives a coach; I knew his son perfectly well. On the Thursday before the 15th of December, when Warman was apprehended, I saw Dalton at my house - he came about four o'clock, or it might be a little after; he came in, and said</p>
               <p>"Is John come;" he came to wait for his son, whose coach arrives about that time; he sat in front of the bar on the right hand. His son came in soon after; his father had not gone out of doors; both of them drank tea with us - we drank tea between six and seven o'clock, it might be six or a quarter after. I cannot say how long we were at tea, it sometimes takes three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did old Dalton go away - A. It might be five or six minutes before or after seven; he was not out of the house from the time he first came till then, that I swear. Mr. Gorsuch was there; I think he came in before six o'clock, and stopped till six or after. Dalton took some gin and water with me before tea, and some after - he had three or four glasses with me and his son John.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When did you see John last - A. About three weeks ago; I do not know where he lived; he drove the North Devon coach; it is quite uncertain what time he comes in - I have known him in at three o'clock; he puts up at the Castle and Falcon. I do not know where either of them lived. There might be several customers there. I cannot say how often he had been there that week.</p>
               <p>Q. And how can you speak to the day - A. I will explain; on the Thursday fortnight wanting a day, which was on the 12th of December, I ordered a surloin of beef for Christmas day of

            ; I ordered it then that it might have time to hang up.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a bill and receipt to enable you to know the date - A. No, but I had some goods arrive on the 12th, I know that from my books, which are not here. I know it was the Thursday before Warman was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear that he was taken - A. It might be three quarters of an hour after. Mr. Turnpenny brought the property to my house; but it was mentioned to me before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you not tell him that the moment Dalton heard of it, he bolted out of your house - A. No; I did not tell him so, nor anything like it.

            . I am the wife of the last witness. John Dalton generally calls at our house when his coach comes in, which is on Sundays and Thursdays. I heard of Warman's apprehension some time on the Sunday; on the Thursday before that, old Dalton came to our house to meet his son, who usually came from half-past four to five o'clock; when he came, he had gin and water with his father, and I made tea for them myself. I cannot say whether they went out, as I was absent about five minutes; they sat in a little room behind the bar - Mr. Gorsuch and Mr. Charles were there. Dalton went away about seven o'clock, or a little after. I am sure it was seven o'clock, for we seldom have tea till six. I ordered a piece of beef<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150024"/>of young

             that day, for Christmas, that it might hang up.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were you in court, and within hearing while your husband was examined - A. No, I did not hear a question put to him except the last, I swear that. Dalton was in the house from four o'clock to seven. I served several customers during that time. I think Mr. Gorsuch drank ale, and Mr. 
               <persName id="t18230115-40-person458">Charles</persName>
             a glass of gin. I do not recollect what any other customer had. Gorsuch comes to our house every day - they did not eat anything; we have no sitting-room; they were in a room behind the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what they drank on any other day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear they could not have gone out for ten minutes, and returned without your knowledge. - A. Not for so long as that; they could not go out without passing me. I was only in court during the last of my husband's examination, I just came in at the door.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where have you been till you came into court. - A. Over at the New Inn, All that I heard my husband say, was concerning the beef. The bar holds about half a dozen people; there is a door between that and the inner room, but it is never shut. A person must come through the bar to go out; they must pass me sideways. They sat down to tea a little before six o'clock. I heard of Warman's being taken; that did not bring the circumstance of Dalton being at my house to my mind, because I am always in the habit of seeing him on Thursday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you examined about this. - A. Only by Mr. Harmer, that was four or five days ago. I think my husband went to Guildhall on the day after Dalton was taken.</p>

I left the office at half-past four o'clock, went home and got to Garland's about twenty minutes, or half-past five o'clock. I might have drank a glass of ale. Garland asked me into the bar, old Dalton was there, and sat on the right-hand side of me in the little bar, and had tea in my presence; he was waiting for his son John, who came and took a cup of tea; his son came in after I got there. I left about a quarter or twenty minutes before seven o'clock, and left the prisoner Dalton there - he had not been out while I was there. The inner bar will not hold above six or seven people; you must pass through the bar where Mrs. Garland serves, to get out.

Two or three months before the transaction in question, I sold the prisoner a French gold watch for seven guineas, which he afterwards paid for, and called frequently afterwards to have it regulated. On the 24th of November, 1821, he called and asked for two gold watches, which were to be as good as we could make, and said he was commissioned by a young nobleman, who was then in the country, to send them down. I shewed him several, he asked me to pick out two such as I could recommend; I did so; one was worth forty, and the other forty-five guineas, I said, I hoped he would not consider it unreasonable, if I asked the nobleman's name; he said, it was a case of great delicacy, and I must excuse him, as the young nobleman did not wish his friends to know he was purchasing expensive watches, I let him have them, one was to be kept and paid for within ten days, and the other returned. He took them away, and called as usual to have his watch regulated for a month after, but never mentioned the watches till I pressed him; I think it was not more than fifteen days when I spoke to him about them, (he might have called four times before,) he said the young nobleman had received them, but it was the shooting season and he was not able to send him up the particulars; in a few days I began to be impatient, and asked him for a settlement as the time was exceeded, he said, the young nobleman was subpoenaed on a trial at York. I saw him again in about a month, he then said, the young nobleman was obliged unexpectedly to go out of the country. I saw him several times afterwards, the last time was when I called at his house one Sunday, in Cheyne-walk, Chelsea; he then said it should be settled immediately, that he had got into some difficulty by procuring articles for the young noblemen. I afterwards made an affidavit of the debt, and put a writ against him into the officer's hands, (looking at the affidavit,) this is it, it is dated, May 1822, it was never executed. I have never recovered our watches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You knew his name, and where he lived - A. Yes, (looking at a paper.) I gave him this, it is merely the particulars and price of the watches, but is not a bill. I never entered them in my books as sold to him; when stock was taken at Christmas, a memorandum was made about them, he promised me an answer in ten days at his own suggestion, I went with Redford the officer to get him arrested several times; I always saw his wife; I do not recollect telling her I had come for the money. I proposed taking a bill in order to get the officer in to arrest him; he did not come to my shop for a considerable time before I issued the writ, I never saw him after it was issued, except on a Sunday.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my box is about two hundred yards from Benjamin's house, in the next street. On the 27th of December, about one o'clock in the morning, I was sitting in my box, and saw six or seven young men come down Gloster-court, into White-cross-street, which communicates with Playhouse-yard, they were going towards Benjamin's house; I saw them returning in about five minutes, each running with clothes thrown loosely over their arms, I knew their faces when I first saw them, by having seen them about; they made a stand for half a minute. I believe the prisoner to be one, I saw him both times, it was a fine moon-light night, and exactly under a strong gass-light; I saw his front face as they went, and on returning I saw his side-face, they were about twenty yards off, and I only saw them for ten yards. To the best of my belief he is one of them, I got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150026"/>out of my box, made an alarm, and at last one of them dropped his load which I picked up, and followed them into the back allies, but there being so many avenues I lost them; I took the things to the watch-house, then searched about Playhouse-yard, and found Benjamin's door open, and alarmed him. Next evening I went with an officer to a public-house, about a hundred and fifty yards from Benjamin's, and pointed the prisoner out from among fifty others in the tap-room. I truly believe him to be one of them; I came out of the room to the officer, and said I believed him to be one, and went home; I expressed no doubt about him, he is not the man who dropped the things; I should know that man; but he had some.</p>

               <persName id="t18230115-44-person501">Benbow</persName>

               <p>"Can you swear to him before a Magistrate;" he said he could swear it within his own breast. I said it would not do for me to take him, as he did not speak positive. I saw Brown again next night; he asked if I had taken him, I said</p>
               <p>"No, are you sure he is one of the men concerned in the robbery;" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he is one that ran away." I went next night and took him at the same house, and told him he must come with me for a crack, in Playhouse-yard; he said,</p>

I went down and complained to my wife about its being open, and at two o'clock I went up to my box, which stood in the bed room, and found the lid forced open, and the lock hanging to it - I had not noticed the box at one o'clock; but had been to it for money at eleven, every thing was safe then; I locked it again, and locked the door. I missed all my property except a bad shilling. 343 l. 12 s. 2 1/2 d., was stolen - I had counted it the evening before, and entered the amount in my book, which was taken with the money; but I had a memorandum of it on my slate. I had the numbers of two of the notes on the slate, and every thing, but have left them at home. The reason I speak to the money is, because the night before being club night, I was at leisure. It consisted of three Spanish dollars, two hundred and twenty-three sovereigns, which were in one bag, they were my own property; a 40 l., a 10 l., and two 5 l. Bank notes; the 10 l. Bank note belonged to a club which is held at my house, and the 40 l. Bank note belonged to another club; I am responsible for them. The others were my own. I had the numbers of the two 5 l., and the 40 l. notes on my slate; I copied them from the slate at Bow-street. I went to Bow-street immediately, and gave information. The prisoner was apprehended on the 29th of July, and detained for six weeks, and then let out on his own recognizance. I traced a 40 l., two 5 l., and a 10 l. note to him - he stated that he took them of another person, and when that person was taken, we could not find the prisoner - a warrant was issued against him; he heard of it, and surrendered to me.</p>

            . I am an Excise officer, and have been so thirty-five years. I have known the prisoner eighteen or twenty years; he used to collect old china for sale. On the 11th or 12th of July, I met him in Castle-street, Leicester-fields, as he was coming to my office - he asked if I could get him change for a 40 l. note, which he gave me, and I got it changed at Mr. Smith's, a publican, at the corner of Earl-street, Seven-dials - I should know it again by my name and address, which I saw him write on it; the prisoner stood outside, I gave him the change - I was well known there. I met him again two or three days afterwards, in Great or Little Newport-street; he asked me to get him change for a 10 l. note; I changed that at Burohell's in Little Newport-street.</p>

I was apprehended, and afterwards discharged, but recollect nothing about being told to come again if wanted. I was out one day, and met a man who said two gentlemen wanted me, and in Macclesfield-street, I met Ingram's brother, who said Tom was taken in Sloane-street, and if I came forward, I should hang him; they promised me a pound a week to keep away, and bought me some shoes, and took me from house to house till night, and then lodged me at a baker's in Whitechapel, where I remained eleven days; the woman wished me to leave; he took me to his sister's at Shackelwell - she would have nothing to do with me. I was taken to Backchurch-lane, and remained there till the 5th of January; when he came, and said he had quarrelled with his brother, and I might go where I pleased, and on the Monday I surrendered.</p>

On Monday, the 6th, in consequence of suspicions, I tendered her her wages, and told her to quit my service; she refused to go, and I sent for Clinton, who found the articles stated in the indictment, in her box, or bundle. I believe her box was unlocked, her things were packed up, and brought down ready to go, but she refused to go. When they were found, she acknowledged them to be ours, and begged for mercy.</p>

            . The prisoner came into our service, on the 1st of January. I received a very good character of her from Mrs. Parry, of Bunhill-row; we discharged her on the 6th. I desired her to pack up all her things, and went into her room with her - she had a small box there; her behaviour was so suspicious, that I turned up her bed, and between it and the sacking, was about two yards of new flannel, I took it up, and she caught it out of my hand, saying it was hers. I desired her to be quick in putting her things up; she tied the flannel up with them, and took them all into the kitchen, then declared she would not go unless I paid for a coach to take her away; she was very abusive, and we sent for Clinton the officer. I did not notice what she put in her bundle; a pair of gown sleeves were found in it, which I kept in a work-closet; they were rather soiled, but not dirty; she had no business with them - we do not wash at home. The flannel is part of a piece of which Clinton has the fellow. I do not know whether I cut it off or not, but am certain it is mine, and was kept in the work-cupboard, in a room into which she was never desired to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You desired her to be quick in packing up - A. Yes, she did not make haste, my husband was in the kitchen, while I was in her room; it is close to her room. I think it possible for a person to see into the room from there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to Mr. Sewell's, and heard a violent noise up one pair of stairs, where the kitchen is. When I entered the room, Mr. and Mrs. Sewell, and the prisoner were there; her master said she had told many falsehoods, and pilfered a little, he wished to get rid of her, and there was her money; she afterwards said, she would not take her things away, unless her master paid a coach to take her away. I said, from her manner, I believed her to be a thief. Mrs. Sewell said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I cannot think she has robbed me, she has only been with me four days." I asked where her things were, Mr. Sewell said, he had kicked them down stairs to get rid of her. I went down, she ran after me, scratched, and struck me. I got them up into the kitchen, and found two yards of new flannel in the bundle. Mrs. Sewell said,</p>
               <p>"I should like to look at that again."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said she,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, that is my flannel, I bought it and paid for it;" she attempted to take it out of my hand. I asked, where she bought it, she said, indeed she did not know the person's name, but knew the shop. I said, I would go to the shop with her; in the mean time, Mrs. Sewell fetched a piece of flannel, which upon being compared with the other, she said she had no doubt of its being her's, for there was the mark where it was torn off, the prisoner immediately acknowledged its being her's, and said it was all she had of Mrs. Sewell's. On searching further, I found a pair of muslin sleeves, and several pieces of shirt-frills and new cloth, all of which Mrs. Sewell claimed; she made no answer to it; one sleeve was in her box, and the other in the bundle. Before I got to the bottom of the box she attacked me, and said she would not let me search, for she had got a deal of property in it. I found nothing more of Mrs. Sewell's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When the flannel was found, tell me the very words she said - A. She said,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, that's all I have got of yours." I saw that the pieces corresponded; there was no lock on her box to the best of my recollection, it was tied round with a silk handkerchief, the things appeared to be put into the bundle with care and not in a hurry, they were folded up. She ran away from me in the street; the flannel is in the same state as I received it.</p>
               <p>MRS. SEWELL. I have every reason to believe the flannel is mine, it corresponds in every respect with what remained; the gown-sleeves are mine. I bought the flannel last week in Wood-street, I have no doubt of it being mine, it appears the same in quality and width. She refused to leave, because her character was implicated.</p>

               <p>"Indeed it is my property." I asked again how she came by it, she said her master gave it her, I asked who he was, she said a gentleman at the other end of the town, whom she had lived with, that her mistress had died, and her master gave it her in remembrance of her mistress, by her request; I asked her master's name; she said, indeed she did not know, and that he was gone to France; I asked if any one saw him give it her; she said, her cousin did; she could not tell me the street her master lived in. Mr. Sewell gave her in charge. I took her to the Compter and found a watch-paper in it, which lead me to find Mrs. Parker, who claimed it. The prisoner told me she had had it two years.

M'Naughton was rather tipsy, and went to sleep in the house; the prosecutor came in with Newman - he ordered a pot of beer, and paid for it; they sat there for half an hour, and the prisoner offered to bet the prosecutor a shilling, that he had no money; the prosecutor then pulled out his pocket-book, and shewed him two sovereigns in a piece of paper, and returned it to his pocket. In a few minutes the prisoner swore he would have something to drink, he took the prosecutor's pocketbook out, and took out a sovereign; the prosecutor struggled to get it from him; he did not know that he had taken anything out; the prisoner gave it him, and went to the bar and got the sovereign changed - I fetched a constable. The landlord was busy and did not know it, he gave no reason for taking the money. I told him it was a shame, and he said I only wanted part of it, and abused me.</p>

            . I was fetched to the Vine, and found the prosecutor there, neither drunk or sober. The people said the prisoner had taken a sovereign out of his pocket book - I asked the prisoner if he knew him; he said, Yes, he was an old master of his, the prosecutor said he did not know him. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"He is my old captain, come and go on board captain;" M'Naughton said he was not a seafaring man. I desired the prisoner to return the sovereign, he said nobody should have it, and that there was a 5 l. note in pledge for 2 s., and he should not have it unless he went with him. He took him out, up the Minories, and into George-street, then said</p>
               <p>"This is not the place;" he returned back to Aldgate, and said,</p>
               <p>"We will go no further to night, we will go to-morrow." He took 6 d. from his pocket, and said to me, here is 6 d. for you. The prosecutor said he was robbed, and he should not leave him - I then took him in charge, and found 12 s. in his mouth, and 4 s. 6 d. in his pocket.</p>

I lost a 5 l. note - he was an entire stranger to me; I had been to different house. I did not see him till I got to the Vine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I fell in with him; a parcel of boys were hooting him, as he was in liquor; I drove them away - he said I should have a glass for it. We went to several public-houses, where there was a parcel of girls. He said he would pay me for a day's work if I stopped with him. We went into this house - he was so much in liquor that he could not get a sovereign out of his pocket, so I did it for him.</p>

I asked Morrington what he had there; he said he did not know - I said it was pidgeon (meaning lead), and told him to put it down, he threw it down - I asked Edwards to put his lead down, he did so. Morrington was going away; I said</p>
               <p>"I must detain you as well as the property" - Harrison who was with me, handcuffed them. We found a hammer and a knife upon Edwards; the rivet was broken, and there was marks of the hammer on the back of the knife. I found a knife on Morrington, which has been used in the same way - we took them to the office. We delivered the lead to Hooker, after marking it. Edwards said he found it in a ditch, and Morrington said he found it in the road; it was a very wet night. The prisoners and the bags were very wet indeed. I took them about half a mile from the barracks. They said they slept in a barn at Red-hill that night, and that was the way they became acquainted.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutor. On the 30th of December, the prisoner, myself, and the boy, were in charge of the shop. About eight o'clock in the evening, I asked the prisoner what money we had taken; he said about 8 l. I knew there was a good deal more, and asked how many sovereigns there were; he said six, I knew there were seven. I had counted the money myself, several times in the course of the day, and know that he knew there were seven; this excited my suspicion. Soon after this, he went to the till, and counted the money, and put it into a paper bag, then into a plumb-drawer - money was not usually kept there; this was an hour before shutting up; he then said he wanted to go out, and borrowed my hat, saying, he did not like his own, because it was a white one. When he was gone, I took the bag out, and counted the money in Holt's presence, and found six sovereigns wrapped up in paper, at the top then, 4 l. 12 s. 6 d. in silver, and a sovereign at the bottom, wrapped up in paper, by itself. I called Holt to notice it. I received one sovereign, and 1 s. after I had counted the money. I took it out of the till, and put the sovereign with the six others in the paper, and 3 s., with the silver; I left the one sovereign seperate as it was, there was then 4 l. 15 s. in silver, seven sovereigns, and one sovereign separate of itself; I replaced the bag in the same drawer, so as not to excite any suspicion; he came in about half an hour after, and said it was time to shut up; I asked him where my hat was, he said he had left it up stairs; I went up for it, leaving him in the shop, and when I came down, which was in about two minutes, he had got the money counted out on the counter, he asked me to count it after him, which I did, and only found 11 l. 0 s. 6 d. which consisted of seven sovereigns, and there was 15 s. deficient in the silver; I said nothing to him, but let him take the money to Mr. Loveridge; I told Holt and the porter what I had observed; and said I would go to Mr. Loveridge's after supper.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150033"/>Cross-examined. Q. When sovereigns were taken, were they wrapped in separate papers - A. No, there are two tills which have no locks to them; I had not heard of its being likely that he would leave; I know seven sovereigns were taken, as he counted six, and I took one after in his presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come from - A. Buckingham. I was in trouble there, about shooting at the Duke of Buckingham's carriage, to frighten the horses, about three years ago; they made a bungling job of it, and I was acquitted, and lived there for twelve months after, with Mr. Adams, whom I was with before.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Lowman. On the 29th of December, my master left town. Next day we were in care of the shop. Dancer called me to see the money counted, while the prisoner was out, about eight o'clock; it was in a plumb-drawer; there were six sovereigns in one paper, and one in a paper by itself; the money was on the counter when he called me; I did not see him take it from the plumb-drawer, I afterwards saw him put it into the plumb-drawer, he added a sovereign to the six in the paper; some silver was also taken out of the till and added to it; a sovereign was at the bottom of the bag, the silver on that, and the seven sovereigns at the top. The prisoner soon after returned and ordered us to put the shutters up, and soon after he took the money and went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the shop all day - A. No, I was backward and forward; I think I remember seeing the prisoner count the money out of the till. Dancer called me to see him count it; I was in and out afterwards. I did not know that the prisoner was likely to leave, but I thought Dancer would not stop long. I think the prisoner was out about an hour, I did not see him go out; the prisoner was a superior servant to Dancer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Lowman was at your house the next night when the prisoner came - A. Yes, he was apprehended; he brought 12 l. that night, and was not charged with any deficiency in that.</p>

               <p>SIR - This comes with hopes of forgiveness from you. I am given to understand that it lays with you and Mr. Dancer, whether I have a trial or not, for I understand you can throw out the bill of indictment, when you go to file it. I wish to see you to-morrow, if you will have the goodness to come to me. I never was in Newgate before, and never will be again, if you get me out, which you can.

On the 6th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came into the shop, and asked to see some feathers - they objected to the price; they were about five minutes in the shop; about a dozen small fur collars were on the counter within their reach - they went out. I had to go to the bottom of the shop for the feathers. I missed nothing; but Clements the officer brought them back to to the shop in about five minutes, and asked if the collar was mine, which he produced. I had but one of that colour, and that was gone.</p>

In consequence of what he said, I turned into Cloth-fair, following the prisoner and two others; he pointed the prisoner out - I collared him, and the other two ran off. I have not found the handkerchief; it was a red, yellow, and black colour.</p>

            . On the 10th of January, I was in Long-lane, and saw the prisoner take a dark coloured handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to a second man, who gave it to a third, who put it into his hat, which he had off ready to receive it. I informed Harland, and followed them - they were talking to two girls at the end of the court; I pointed the prisoner out, and he took him; the other two ran off. I had a large basket on my shoulder, so that I could not take either of them. I am positive of the prisoner's person - I had watched him for three minutes.</p>

            . I am the night beadle of Whitechapel. On Saturday morning, the 21st, about a quarter past six o'clock, I went down Whitechapel-road, and about four hundred yards behind the church, by a bell founder's, I saw a hay cart standing there - Law was walking up and down by it. The cart moved on a few yards at a time. I watched him for half an hour, suspecting he had something in the cart - I waited till he got to the church, and then asked what he had in the cart; he said a sack, but he did not know what was in it - I asked how he came by it; he said he took it up from two men, near the Green Man, public-house, at Laytonstone, who asked him to give them a lift - that one of them wore a smock frock, and the other was a short one. I then told Avis to give me the sack down; I found it contained eight geese, and thirteen fowls, quite warm; they had just been killed. I took Law to the watch-house with them, and sent his hay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150040"/>to the salesman, and then went into Black Lion-yard, public-house, opposite to where I first saw the cart, and in the tap-room there, I found Webb in bed with a woman - I desired him to dress, and told him I wanted him about some fowls; he denied all knowledge of them. I took him to the watch-house, and placed him with six or eight others - then let Law in, and asked if he saw anybody like the men who gave him the poultry - he pointed Webb out as one, and said he believed another young man was the other, but he could not be certain. Webb denied it. The name of</p>
               <p>"Barrell, North Wheel," was on the cart; it would not pass within two miles of Barking side to come to town. The waggon road is more than two miles.</p>

I saw Webb with the cart, about a quarter past six o'clock; he came round the horse's head, and went to the cart tail - he then went to a salop woman, and had a bason, and then went up Black Lion-yard. This was before Plunkett came up. I knew Webb before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I stood on the opposite side of the way, when the cart came up to the bell-founder's, about ten minutes past six o'clock, a man was riding on the hay; Law handed the sack down to a man, but he walked away without it; he then laid it on the cart again, moved on a few yards, then got up and moved the sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man saw you and walked off - A. I think he did; I am well known there.</p>
               <p>LAW'S Defence. As I came along the road, two men asked me to put the sack in my cart. Webb said, they would give me a shilling, and a pot of beer, when I got to town. When I got near the church; he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop we will have the parcel down here." I got up to give it him down; he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop till my mate comes, he is gone up stairs, I will go and see where he is"; he run away, and never came back; I put the sack on again, got down and walked round the cart to look for him, and after waiting till I was tired, I went on and was stopped.</p>

On Monday, the 23d of December, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at some shawls - another person was serving in the shop. I shewed her some - she bought none; she was there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I went to the window, to reach her some smaller patterns, as she said they were too large - some cotton lay on the counter. The smaller patterns did not suit her; two females came with her, and they all left the shop together. While I was at the window, I turned round to ask them a question, and from the prisoner's actions, I suspected she was taking something; she had put her hand in her pocket. I went after her, and about four yards from the shop, she pulled the cotton from under her coat, and threw it on the ground.</p>

On the 29th of December, about five o'clock, I left my great coat and shoes in the room; he was then in the room - I returned at seven, and they were gone; he did not return, but was apprehended on the Saturday following, and told me voluntarily that he took them.</p>

            . I keep a clothes shop in Rosemary-lane. The prisoner came to the shop on Monday evening, the 30th of December, with a pair of shoes, which I saw him self to my brother for 2 s. - I am certain he is the person. He came again next day with a blue great coat, with a single cape, and exchanged it for a pair of black trowsers, and on the Sunday following Hill claimed the shoes, and described the coat; I had sold it. He has got the trowsers on now.</p>

I asked her if she knew Captain Rule, she said Very well, I said so did I, and I would give her something to drink - I took her into a public-house, in Tower-street, and sat down in the same box with her; she had some rum and water. We left there, and she walked with me to the corner of George-street, Minories. I had a purse with eleven sovereigns in it, when I left the public-house.

She had left some clothes with me. I went to her next morning, and took her a gown - she said she had met an old friend very much in liquor, and took his purse from him, took the money out, and threw the purse away.</p>

The prisoner was out of place, and lodged with me; I had known her some time; she was backwards and forwards. I left home between eight and nine o'clock, on the night of the 23d of May; the watch then hung at the fire-place. I missed if next morning; I did not know that she had been into the house that day. On Monday morning, the 16th of December, I by mistake took up her pocket instead of my own, and suspecting her, I examined her purse, and found the duplicate of the watch. I asked her how she came by it; she said she found it. My father was not able to leave the room.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Gardiner. Thwaites fetched me to the prisoner, she put down half a crown, to pay for a pair of soles, we said, she had two pair in her pocket, she denied it; we were going to search her, she said nobody should but a constable, we sent for one, and while he was gone, she produced two pair, and asked to look at some inner soles, we refused to shew them; she afterwards produced two more pair from under her clothes.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Old Haggerston. On the 22d of December, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I met the prosecutrix and the prisoner walking together, I bid them good night, turned into my box, and shortly I heard her screaming out, and calling Stop thief!

            . On Saturday night, the 22d of December, the prisoner came up to me in Finsbury-square; and walked with me to the door of my father's house in <placeName id="t18230115-122-crimeloc674">Kingsland-road</placeName>

I said, he should not, and told him to go about his business. When we got to the door, he snatched the parcel from me. I gave an alarm, and Jones took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me" - A. I do not recollect saying so. I walked arm in arm with him part of the way. He offered to take liberties with me. I think he was rather intoxicated. I do not think he intended to steal it, for he behaved very well. He ran twelve yards with it perhaps. He carried the bundle for me once, and I asked him for it, and he gave it me.</p>

Next morning I went to look for him - he did not return to his lodging, and on Monday I found six pair at Vincent's - they were in the shop window; the shop was locked, and I had the key, but when I came home I found a window broken.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Hatton-wall. On the 26th of December, between six and seven o'clock at night, the prisoner brought two pair of boots to sell, saying he had four pair more, that his wife was at the door with them, and that he made them himself out of old boots, and lived a few miles off. I gave him 2 s. per pair for them. Richard's afterwards claimed them.</p>

On the 15th of December, between eleven and one o'clock, the prisoner came into my room, and offered to sell a silver thimble - I laid a brooch and ring on the table, and turned round to the shelf to find my own thimble, I turned back in half a minute, and missed the brooch; she said she had not got it, and hoped I did not accuse her; I said no more, but let her go; she returned in three quarters of an hour, and desired me to look at her duplicates, I did so - there was none for a brooch; she came again at five o'clock - my husband was at home then, and gave her in charge.</p>

On the 7th of December, I stopped Markwick in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, with this wrapper, and asked where he got it; he said he bought it of some servants in Bunhill-row - I asked if the master authorised his servants to sell it, he then said he bought it of the gentleman; I said I should take him to the gentleman, and when we got into Bath-street, he said he bought it of one Taylor, at a public-house. I left him in charge, and went to the Northumberland Arm's, City-road, found Taylor there, and asked if he had sold or given any wrapper to any man within ten minutes - he said not. I took Markwick there, who said he was the man; Taylor denied it - Markwick then said he bought it of a stranger in the street. I went to Markwick's house, and found a quantity of wrappers in boxes and drawers.</p>

            . I am a labourer in Mr. Dempsey's service. The house was finished, and the windows glazed. I had been at work there that day, and about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise like whispering, and something crack like glass. I called the watchman, who went up stairs - he called me up. I found the prisoner in his custody. We found the squares of glass in the same room against the wall; they had been taken out of the sashes; three out of eighteen were broken; they were all right at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not see him doing any thing to them - A. No, he gave no reason for being there, but begged to be let go.</p>

I told him, unless he returned, I would fire at him - he came back. I delivered him to Driscoll; he said there was one more with him, I searched, but found nobody.

I shewed her some galloon, and a piece which I left on the counter, was gone, and I saw her rustling under her shawl as before.
