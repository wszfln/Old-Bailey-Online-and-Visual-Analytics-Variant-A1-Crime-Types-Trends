On the 25th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came there, and asked for some fat; I told him it was ready, and he took away five sacks of fat - I heard it thrown into a cart, but I did not see it: I had known him before - he used to fetch Mr. Morgan's fat, and I thought he came from him then; there was another female servant at home at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q.Have you always told the same story? A. Yes, Sir, as far as I could- I was examined three times; they asked if I heard it thrown into a cart, and I said Yes, that was on the first examination; I said I thought the person had a smock-frock on, but I was not rightly sure, and did not swear to that - he had a fustian jacket on, but I did not swear particularly to his dress; I do not know that I stated to the Magistrate that he had a shooting jacket on - I said a fustian jacket; I did not say it was a shooting-jacket - (he appeared to me to be in a smock-frock) but he had been in the habit of wearing such clothes; I did not say I did not know the man, though I believed him to be the prisoner, nor any thing of the kind - the gentleman asked if that was the prisoner, and I said Yes; I do not know how I came to be examined three times - I never said I only believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, which had the man on, a fustian jacket, or what you have now called a smock-frock? A. I thought he had a smock-frock on; I will swear he had a fustain jacket on - I have seen a Mr. Colney; I do not know whether he was examined before the Magistrate - he took his oath before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you have given a stranger your master's fat? A. No, Sir; I had been about two months in the place, and during that time I had seen him come backwards and forwards for the fat several times.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler, and have had fat of Mr. Collingwood; the prisoner had been in my service, and was employed to get fat from there, but I had discharged him on the 20th of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long had he been in your service? A.Two months, or rather more.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLLINGWOOD. I am a butcher - this is my dwelling-house; it is in the parish of St. Faith, under St. Paul's. I had sold fat to Mr. Morgan for four weeks, but Messrs. Marshalls had had it before him, and they had it again for a week before the 25th of February, and should have had it that day - the prisoner used to come for the fat for Mr. Morgan; when I went out on the 25th of February I saw the five sacks with a note on them, and when I returned home in the evening they were gone; the fat was worth rather more than 10l. - the next morning Mr. Marshall sent to know why he had not had the fat, and I sent for my servant to inquire about it - I was present when the prisoner was taken - he did not deny it, but said it was a pretty go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate that the prisoner said it was a pretty go? A. I did not- he was taken in a turning up Hanway-yard, a place called Pepys-court, I believe, in the first floor of a house in which he lived; the Policeman was with me at the time, and Mr. Morgan, to recognize him - the fat had been sold to Messrs. Marshalls for a week before the 25th of February, and they were to have it that day; there was a note on the sacks stating the weight - I went out about six o'clock in the evening, but left no orders whatever; it was left for Messrs. Marshalls, and booked in their names; I left Brassington in the house, and my family; in general my men are there when the fat is fetched, but they were gone then - the prisoner was examined before the Magistrate; he was remanded to give an opportunity of getting hold of the receiver if we could - we have no doubt who was the receiver: we searched the premises of Mr. Colney, and we summoned him before the Magistrate - I do not remember charging him with any offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you examined him as a witness against the prisoner? A. I deny it - I do not know whether he was sworn; his examination was taken down - we have no hesitation in saying he was the receiver of the fat; I told the Magistrate I had no hesitation in saying that the fat went to Colney's - I did not see it go there; I never saw Colney before we searched his premises - Colney said no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070004"/>fat had come into his house for twelve minutes; we summoned him to answer before the Policeman, who swore he saw the prisoner delivering fat at Colney's that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was as a criminal you took him there? A. I have no doubt he was one; I told the Magistrate my opinion of him; I did not have him examined on his oath against the prisoner - I believe his deposition was taken down, but I do not remember that he was sworn; he was not a witness of mine.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not cause Colney to be taken before the Magistrate, and there examined as a witness against the prisoner? A.Certainly not, he was examined as a receiver - I cannot remember whether Brassington stated on the first examination whether the man had a fustian jacket or a smock-frock on; it is most likely that I had some conversation with her between the first and second examination- I think the officer had told me before the second examination that the man he saw at Colney's shop had a smockfrock on; I might probably tell that to Brassington - I do not know whether before I said that she said he had a fustain jacket on - I told her he had a smock-frock on, because the person where the prisoner lived said he had on a smock-frock when he went from the premises, which was a thing he never had on before; I think before that Brassington had said the man had on a fustain jacket, but I would not take upon me to swear which she said.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in Pepys-court -I asked where he had been on the 25th; he said over at Lambeth, and not at Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you summon Colney? A. He was summoned by the Magistrate, and appeared on the second examination - he was sworn, and the clerk was present, but I cannot say whether what he said was taken down - I have a doubt of it; I cannot say whether he was examined as a witness - the prisoner was not at the bar when he was examined - I swear that; it was on the second examination - the prisoner was examined first, and left the room in charge of the officer; then Colney was called up, and accused of receiving stolen property - I cannot swear that; he was accused of being a receiver, and then examined upon oath; I do not know whether his examination was taken in writing - I did not see him put his name to it: there was a third examination: Colney was placed in temporary custody for about five minutes - I am not the person who saw the prisoner take a cart of fat to Colney's house; Colney denied that any fat had been taken to his house - I do not recollect that he was present on the third examination, he might have been - I do not know whether there was any attempt on the part of any other officer to apprehended him.</p>

            . I was a Policeman, but have left. On the 25th of February, between half-past six and half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Strutton-ground, Westminster, carrying a sack into Colney's shop - he had a white smock-frock on, and a white apron; I do not know what was in the sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you discharged from the Police? A. No, I left it to go after a situation which I have not got, but I shall have it; it is gardening at Mr. Appleton's, at Bromley - I left the Police about a month ago; I cannot say the day - I was ill at the time, and Mr. Appleton promised me a situation; I shall go to it, but I do not think proper till I have done my business in London; I did not hear that the Magistrate was about to discharge Colney till I was examined - I was applied to by an officer of the E. division to appear as a witness in the case; I believe the first time the whole of my statement was not taken down; they took a part of it - I was examined as a witness; Young came to our watch-house two days before the examination, and asked who was on duty there, and I recollected the circumstance of the prisoner carrying in the sack, and running against a boy; when I got to Hatton-garden I identified the prisoner as being the person who carried the sack - I looked in his face, and knew him - then a summons was issued for Colney to come; he did not contradict on his oath, every word I said - he denied that the prisoner had been there that evening - I do not know whether Colney was charged as a receiver; I was not present all the time of the examination - I did not see what he said taken down in writing; he was allowed to go home after it was settled- I only saw him once at the office; I have seen him several times at his shop in Strutton-ground.</p>

            . I live at No. 50, Strutton-ground, Westminster. I received a summons to attend before the Justice when the prisoner was to be examined; it was a fortnight or three weeks ago; I cannot say whether I was summoned as a witness or charged with any offence; I do not think the summons specified that, it ordered me to be and appear before the Magistrate; I was not taken into custody - no charge was preferred against me - I saw Mr. Collingwood there; I do not recollect that he told the Magistrate I was the receiver - I was examined and sworn by the clerk; the prisoner was before the Magistrate at the time - I did not sign any thing after I was sworn; I heard the officer state that he saw the prisoner carrying a sack into my house on the night of the 25th of February, but I do not know what I was summoned for, and I think he was mistaken - it was not true; I told the Magistrate it was not true; I was allowed to go home - I did not see the prisoner on the night of the 25th of February, nor for twelve months before, or longer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your trade? A.

I was at home on Saturday, the 27th of November last - the articles enumerated in the indictment were all safe in the house that night; they were all in the kitchen - I am confident the house was locked up safe that night; I was the last person in the wash-house that night - the window was fast, and the bolts in the door; I came down first in the morning, between seven and eight o'clock, and discovered the robbery- on preparing breakfast, in about half an hour, I missed the spoons; I found a small pane of glass taken out of the wash-house window, exactly over the handle of the door, and the bolts of the door opened - the pane of glass laid in the yard, outside the window; I saw part of the property afterwards at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a yard is this? A. It is a small yard; there is a large garden, which is parted from the yard by a paling, and at the end of the garden is a wall - there is a wall all round the garden; I looked to see if there were any footsteps, but it had rained very hard, and was a very tempestuous night, and there were no footsteps.</p>

I was at home on the night of the 27th of November - I cannot speak to the house being secured; I went to bed first, and know my own property was safe at night - my umbrella, hat, two pairs of high ancle shoes, and a pair of low shoes were all in the kitchen when I went to bed; I have seen some of them since.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 1st of January I saw the prisoners before the Magistrate at Ilford, under examination, and had some conversation with both of them: I saw them in the lock-up room, before they went into the Magistrate's presence, and asked Potter where he got a handkerchief which I took off his neck - he said he had bought it at Deptford several months ago; I found a pair of ancle shoes on his feet - I took them off, and he said he bought them at Deptford, and had had them some months; I said nothing more to him then - I looked into Ralph's hat, and found a handkerchief, which I took from him, and asked where he got it; he said Potter gave it to him - Potter was present, and made no reply to it; I then took a pair of shoes off Ralph's feet, and asked him where he got them - he said they were made abroad - that he had them when on board a ship; I returned them to him, and Palmer afterwards took them from him - I believe those produced to be the same; I have no doubt of it - I asked where they lived; they both said they lived at Deptford - I received a letter that day, and showed it to the prisoners, about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards, at the lock-up room at Lambeth-street; I showed it to Ralph, and asked him if he had written a letter to Mary Berry - he said No, he could not write himself, but he and Potter had got one written when they were in Barking prison; Potter was in the lock-up-room, and he was at the door - I cannot say whether Potter could hear our conversation; I showed 
               <persName id="t18310407-2-person115">Ralph</persName>
             the letter - he said that both his and Potter's names were to it: I had received it from Miller, the governor of Barking gaol. (Letter read.)</p>
               <p>Barking Gaol, 20th N - , 1830.</p>
               <p>MRS. BERRY, - I am sorry to inform you that on Friday last, as we were coming towards home, the patrol took us up, and got us committed to Barking gaol for another hearing on Saturday week; I will be very much obliged to you if you will send us some tobacco - we shall be glad if you will come and see us, and bring Charles' discharge; I hope you will not neglect to come as quick as possible, for we are very unhappy at this time - we had our two copper-strippers with us, and they want to say that they are housebreaking tools, until a man came and told them what the use of them were; then we were remanded for a fortnight, to have another hearing, or else they were going to commit us for three months, under the Vagrant Act. So no more at present, from yours, Cus. POTTER and GEO. RALPH.</p>

            . I belong to Lambeth-street office. I was at Barking gaol on Friday, the 28th of January, and saw the prisoner Ralph in a private-room, belonging to Mr. Miller, the governor; I was sent there by Mr. Walker, the Magistrate - when Ralph was brought before me, I told him I came down because I heard he wished to make some disclosure; Mr. Miller said that he(Miller) had received some information about some burglaries being committed - I then asked Ralph whether he was willing to make any disclosure to me - I told him who I was; he at first said No; he then said,</p>
               <p>"I have told Mr. Miller all I wish to say;" Mr. Miller said, "Have you any objection to tell this person what you said to me?" he replied, "I have no objection to tell him what I have stated to you;" I then told him that I held out no threat or promise to him, but whatever he chose to mention I would take down, and I took it down as he related it - here is the paper; I have had it in my possession ever since - (reads.)</p>

               <p>"On the following Friday we all met at Smith's house, crossed over the water at Deptford, to the Isle of Dogs; we stopped at two or three public-houses and had some beer and gin, which Smith paid for - we went to Bromley; we got over a gentleman's garden wall - the wall was very high at the top of the garden, we got over the pales; we got over another, to the back of the house - Smith broke a pane of glass and undid the door; Potter and myself then entered - we went through the washhouse into a room, and took a woman's bonnet and an umbrella; in a cupboard in the same room, we took two table-spoons, about eight or ten tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, an old tea-caddy, two or three table-cloths, six cotton handkerchiefs, a copper teakettle, an eye-glass, two half quartern loaves, two eye-glasses,(spectacles) a cake, half a cheese, a small riding whip, a basket, a little glass, hanging in the summer-house, a fustian jacket, and a beaver hat - we got back to Deptford on Sunday morning; I think it was Smith took the property home - on Monday, Smith gave me 1l. 3s., and asked me if I was satisfied - I said Yes; Potter had the same - Smith said, 'I shall have three pairs of boots, and you and Potter may have the other boots, shoes, and handkerchiefs,' we had part of them on when taken from us in the gaol; at this time Smith's wife came in with a lot of duplicates, and threw them in the fire."</p>
               <p>Ralph. Q. Did not you and Miller sit down and write that yourselves, and then wanted me to sign my name? A. I told him to write his name, and he refused - he made that statement to me.</p>

               <p>Potter's Defence. I know nothing about it; the shoes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070007"/>I had on my feet, and the handkerchief I bought at Deptford for 4s.</p>

               <p>AMELIA POND. I am sister to the last witness, and stop at her house sometimes. We went to bed nearly together on the 26th of January - I fastened the house up myself; there was no hole in the brick-work then - when I got up in the morning, after some time, my sister's watch was missing - on examination a hole was found in the brick-work; I had gone to town, and it was bricked up before I returned - I had not seen it before I went; I had left some milk in a jug in the back kitchen, and when I got up in the morning the milk was gone, and I found beer in the jug - I know my sister's watch; I had taken it to Ogston, the watch-maker, to offer to sell it to him, and he was to come to the house to look at it.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Police. I met the three prisoners on the 15th of March, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, in Bermondsey-street, near Tooley-street, between three and four miles from Golden-square -Jones had got a coat tied up in an apron or handkerchief; Collins had a gown tied up in something - McMahon had nothing that I saw then; I asked Jones what he had in his bundle - he said a coat; I examined and found it was a very good coat, lined with fur - I asked Collins what she had; she said a gown, and it was so - I asked them where they had brought the things from; they said from Lisson-grove, and were going to take the coat on board a ship, that the gown was the woman's sister's - I told them I should take them to the station-house; they consented to go-in going along we met Hack, the inspector; he examined the coat and gown, and told me to take them on to the station, which I did - I showed the things to him there; I then searched McMahon, and found a gold watch inside her cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Who said they brought it from Lisson-grove? A.They all said so; the two women said they were sisters, and that Jones was their brother - she had the gown in her hand not concealed at all.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HACK. I am inspector of the Police. I met Allen in conversation with the three prisoners - he said he had stopped them to inquire what they had got; I put my hand into Jones' bundle, and found the coat was a very valuable one - I then examined the bundle containing the gown, which Collins said her sister had given her; I told Allen to take them to the station - I followed them there, ordered him to search them, and done up in the knot of McMahon's hair, I saw him find this gold watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070008"/>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the distance from the prosecutor's house to where they were taken? A. About two miles and a half or three miles, I should think.</p>
               <p>MRS. WARD. This is my watch; I had it a few days after McMahon came into my service - it cost about thirty-five guineas; it is no doubt worth thirty guineas - this is my husband's coat; I saw it that morning in one of the drawers in the bed-room - this gown I saw about two o'clock, laying on my bed; I did not miss any thing except the watch till the morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your gown? A. Yes - it cost nearly 4l.; I wore it but once or twice - the coat has been worn a good deal, but was very expensive when made.</p>
               <p>McMahon's Defence. The other two prisoners are innocent.</p>

Bank note out of my breeches pocket - the till was in my shop, and my breeches up stairs on the bed; somebody must have come up stairs - I had the 5l. note safe at nine o'clock at night I am quite sure; the keys of the kitchen, the shop, and the till were all brought down stairs; I found them in the doors and in the till - two of the keys were in the back room, and the key of the till was in my bed-room the night before; I slept with my little boy, who got up before me - he is twelve or thirteen years old; Gorton, the Policeman, has since shown me my note, (looking at one), this is it - I have written Mrs. Jones, Randall-street, on it, of whom I took it at six o'clock the night before.</p>

I keep the Black Horse, Kentish-town, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Dearlove's, the prisoner lodged with me ever since about Christmas - he was a journeyman baker, as I understood from him. I remember his going out on the Monday night, the 14th of March, at eleven o'clock, when I shut up - he did not return that night; I fastened up the house - he came the following morning rather intoxicated, and treated a person with something to drink at my house - he paid me 7s. 6d., which he owed me - I said he was rather flush of money that morning; he said he had met an uncle that morning, and drew him of 1l. - I heard him ask a man in the evening to accompany him to meet his uncle in Oxford-street; it was a man named Devereux, and another whose name I do not recollect.</p>

             gave me and my sister a penny each- the other prisoners were present; she desired us to go out of doors, and spend it - we made a feast up stairs; w were called down in about half an hour - my mother had had a little liquor, and she was worse then; she was very much intoxicated - Louisa Akins, I and Mr. Smith helped to put her to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear as insensible as your mother? A. No - they did not remain there above a quarter of an hour afterwards; the prisoners went home in a quarter of an hour, and Mrs. Harbour remained behind, asleep, in the parlour - she is the prisoner's mother; the next morning, as soon as my mother got up, I heard she had missed something.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mrs. Harbour had been drinking with them? A. Yes - she went to sleep in the parlour; I helped my mother into bed with Akins and Thomas Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. You could see any thing that was done there, I suppose? A. Yes - they came out of the room afterwards, and went away; I had seen my mother a little overcome with liquor before - my sister is only eight years old.</p>

               <p>Thomas Smith's Defence. On the 21st of February I went to my mother's house, and found Mrs. Phelps there, drinking - she asked me when I came in if I had any money; I threw down a shilling, and sent for some liquor - we remained drinking there till half-past twelve o'clock at night, and made an appointment to go and meet a party to go to the trial; in the morning, when I got up, I went out with my father-in-law - I had not made up my mind whether I would go or not: I went with him to the Caledonian Arms, and by; his advice came down here - I met Mrs. Phelps at the King of Denmark public-house: she said,"Let us go and have some drink;" I said she had had quite enough and persuaded her to stop till Mrs. Harbour came out of the prison, from seeing her daughter; after that Mrs. Phelps told me to go and ask the prosecutor if he would have any thing to drink - I did so, and we drank over at the Rose - we sat there from eleven o'clock till two, eating and drinking, both beer and spirits: when she came out she was intoxicated, and unable to walk - I said, "Let me conduct you, and I will get you a coach:" she had torn her gown - she had offered me money several times, but I made her put it into her pocket; I put them all into a coach, and I rode on the box - near Sobo-square she desired more drink; they sat in the coach, and had a pint of gin - I got on the box again, and drove them to No. 24, Hawkins-street, where they had more liquor, and being late, I led her home; she said, "Well, we have not had much dinner - I have got a bit of pickled pork, will you partake of it?" she gave me a sovereign to fetch a pint of gin - I gave her the change: as to the money she lost, I know nothing of it - I certainly put her on the bed, at her daughter's request, and left the daughter in the room.</p>

On the 12th of February I retired to rest about twelve o'clock at night; I live in the house - we pay the rent out of the partnership funds; about twenty minutes before eleven I saw the outer auction-room door fastened in the usual manner - the auction-room is under the same roof as the dwelling-house; there is a door communicating between the auction-room and the house - it was originally under the same roof, and part of it is still under the same roof and part is under a separate roof; when I went to bed I left the property safe in that room as usual, and about a quarter or twenty minutes after six o'clock in the morning of the 13th, I was called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070011"/>from my bed, and found the greater part of the plate, all the watches, and all the jewellery, were removed and gone - there are desks in the office, which is separated from the auction-room by a glazed sash; I found four of those desks broken open, and missed about 6l. 3s. in silver and copper, from my own desk, which I am certain was locked the night before - I saw Flannagan when I was called up; he was up, and had only his shirt on - I asked him how it was possible that he could have slept during the noise which the wrenching open the desks must have made; he slept within three or four yards of the desks, in the auction-room from which the jewellery and property had been taken - the property was totally gone; there was also a cupboard in the office where the desks, were that was broken open, and the greater part of the contents of it taken away, and one other desk was not broken open that contained private papers of my own; among other things which were taken was a fine gold chain - the value of all the property taken was about 300l.; I had seen it in the course of Saturday, the 12th - this was on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had your other partners rooms in the house? A. Mr. Debenham has, and sleeps there three or four times a week.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Sunday morning, the 13th of February, I observed Machin and Debenham's door open, about a quarter or twenty minutes after six o'clock - it was the outer door of the dwelling-house, leading to the suction-room; one door leads both to the auction-room and the dwelling-house - I rang the bell, and gave an alarm; the prisoner Flannagan answered the bell - he was dressed in his shirt; I did not observe that he had any thing else on - he came down to the other door, and exclaimed, "Oh, my God, the house is broken open, and all the property gone."</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him before he made use of that observation? A. No - I went into the auction-room with him, and saw some wearing-apparel strewed on the floor; among other things I saw a pair of old boots, which I have here - I found them opposite Flannagan's bed; I saw him get out of that bed - I asked Flannagan if those boots were his: he said not - I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, after taking the prisoner up. you had some conversation with him? A. I had - I neither threatened him nor made him any promise - when I took him I told him he was charged with robbing Machin and Debenham, of Covent-garden; he was perfectly sober - I questioned him as to how he got possession of that watch, chain, and seals (this conversation was in the coach) - he told me be had bought it, and given 2l.10s. for it; I took the boots from his feet, and asked how he came by them - he said he bought them also, he did not say when or where - this was on Saturday, and on the Monday I took the coat and trousers from him - he said they were his own; I then took him before the Magistrate, and after he had been examined he sent for me, and told me he wished to see the Mogistrate - I took him into a private room before Mr. Roe, the Magistrate, who told him he had been given to understand by me that he wished to say something to him; he said Yes, he did - he stated that the robbery had been planned nearly two months previously, that Flannagan had let him and Casley in, while White stood at the door watching.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was this confession made under an idea that he should be admitted as an evidence? A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Examination continued. He said they were let in about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 12th, and that he had been led completely into it - that Flannagan lighted the candle, while he himself forced open the desk (where some of the property was) with a screw-driver; he also said that the property which I had taken from him was property taken from the prosecutors' - that the sixteen sovereigns I had got were part of the produce of the property.</p>
               <p>Q.Then this was after you had been to the woman, and got the money? A. Yes - he said he had been given to understand the property had been sold for 62l., but he was not present at the sale of it; he said the boots I had got were what he had brought away, and that he had left the old ones behind; here are those I took off his feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was this statement made when the Magistrate was present? A. It was - it was not taken down in writing; there was no one but the Magistrate, the prisoner, and myself present - I gave it in evidence after.</p>

Gentlemen, I am truly innocent - I am not guilty of the crime imputed to my charge, and which is particularly enlarged by the press; nor was it ever my intention to rob or defraud although my situation, subject to my juvenile years, has exposed me to many temptations beyond expectations, which up to the present hour I have peremptorily rebutted, but must confess my aged employers were not altogether justified in placing so large and valuable a stock to the safety of only a boy; it likewise afforded a wide opening for attempts by duplicious associates; nor did I ever think that ever any of my connection would rob, until I was threatened with instant death, which took place after the door was opened. I certainly did open the door, but thought at the time that it was either my employer or alarm of fire, or some casual event or other; at this moment the parties rushed in, and put me into bodity fear - I did not participate nor share in the robbery; and true it is, I did not expose after the fact, being at all times in jeopardy and bodily fear by

            , whose desperate threats to blow my brains out if I divulged, was one cause that prevented me, and another, the fear of losing my situation; had the perpretrators of this dreadful deed not been discovered, I should have continued my situation - I considered I could not afford by confession my employers any benefit, as I never knew where any of the property was conveyed; as such, my intentions I considered could not be unjust nor fraudulent; I consider not to be fairly dealt with by the officers when taken, as undue insinnations and alarming threats were placed to me, containing many falsehoods, by way of forcing confession, and in my agitated moments - I could not now rehearse what I then said, although I own my situation at that time might cause them strongly to imagine that I was a guilty party. I have a list of my former employers. who have kindly volunteered to certify my honest conduct, as well as my prosecutors (Messrs. Debenham, Machin and Co.) the latter with whom I faithfully served as an assistant youth for three years, and I feel entitled to call my masters to my character for that time, and have been en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070013"/>trusted by them and hundreds of gentlemen in and about town, with various articles, and with considerable sums of money in their absence, and with extensive conveyance of property to very large amounts, of valuable descriptions, such as plate, jewellery and so forth, to some thousands of pounds - which, if I had been dishonest, afforded every opportunity, and this to all parts of town occasionally. And if it pleased God I am once returned again for the benefit of society, and my poor mother and her small family, whom I have much assisted at times, I am stedfast and firm I never will commit crime, or place myself under so great a charge of importance as my worthy employers eatrusted to my care. Gentlemen, hoping and trusting to your humane decision, I submit myself, most humbly, to remain your unfortunate youth and servant.</p>

               <p>Q.Was either of the men smoking when they came up to you? A. Yes - I did not ask him for any tobacco; the prisoner was searched immediately he was apprehended - he is the man who put his hand into my pocket, and took the money out: they all ran away directly - I did not hear any communication between the prisoner and the other two, nor see any thing pass between them; when he was searched I believe some halfpence were found on him - I did not search him myself; I was not tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told you went away for ten minutes, and afterwards came up to the prisoner and charged him with robbing you? A. No, you are told wrong; I had never seen him before - I never said I would hang him if possible.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. My attention was called by a cry of Police - I went into Wentworth-street, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner in contention; he had secured the prisoner when I came up, and accused him of picking his pocket - they appeared as if they had been running; I took the prisoner into custody - the prosecutor was quite sober; he did not appear to have been drinking at all - I searched the prisoner, and found a sixpence, and 3 1/2d. in copper on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say positively he was not drunk? A. Yes - he was struggling with the prisoner; he was not holding the prisoner - he could have got away if he chose; there was a contention between them in words - he was denying the charge; I found no half-crown, tobacco, or comb on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor was right intoxicated - when first he took me to the station. he charged me with robbing him of 2s.; I was locked up, and on Monday morning he charged me before the Magistrate with robbing him of half a crown, a comb, and tobacco, and when he went up stairs the short-hand writer said to him, "You seem a very vicious sort of a man:" he said,"Yes, and I will hang the prisoner if I can."</p>

            . About six o'clock on Thursday night, the 3rd of March, I happened to be in the field in which Mr. Stow's sheep were grazing; I shut the gate of the field after me - it is a common barred swing gate; it will not stay open unless it is kept back - I counted the sheep as they were put there to be drawn by Mr. Stow on the following morning; he was to take them home - I left home about seven or half-past seven o'clock the next morning; I passed by the field, but did not notice whether the sheep were there - I returned about one o'clock, and hearing they were gone I went to the field, and could see that they had been led out, not driven out in a flock; I could tell that from the footsteps - we should not have suspected them to have been stolen if that had not been the case; they had driven one or two away from the rest, and then the others had followed, as if they were going to water; they naturally follow in that way - they had gone out at a swing gate; there was no other way for them to get out - they were nearly full bred Southdowns; they were what I should call Southdowns. On Friday, the 11th of March, I accompanied Attfield, the officer, to a butcher's-shop in Long-alley, near Worship-street office; young Mr. Stow. the prosecutor's son, was with me - I saw eighteen sheep skins there; they appeared quite fresh, as if the sheep had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070016"/>not been killed above five or six days; I desired Mr. Stow, Jun. to wash one of the skins, which he did, and I observed the letter S. distinctly on the rump - from that mark and the quality of the wool, I have not a doubt of their being the skins of the sheep which were lost; I did not observe more than the mark of one then; I have since - the quality of the wool was an age, which is not usually sent to market; the whole flock were not more than fourteen or fifteen months old; the prisoner is the person who kept the shop in Long-alley - I went to Deptford that day, before I came to London, and found twenty skins at Mr. Agutter's the fellmonger, in Mill-lane, Deptford; they were undergoing the process of limeing - I had them taken out, and then discovered the letter S. on them distinctly, on the rump, and on the side of one - I found the mark on the whole twenty, but more distinctly on four, which the officer brought away; I had them marked by the fellmonger - an officer named Smith and young Mr. Stow were with me; the wool is precisely the same quality as that on the skins that were in Long-alley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.The skins had undergone some process? A. They had been put into line, which is to take the wool off, but I had gone over on Thursday night as soon as I had got information, to stay the process, and they had not been long enough in the lime to injure the mark - they had not been in lime more than four hours, I should judge; I selected four of them - three were marked on the rump, and one I think on the rump and side; I am able most-certainly to say they were the marks which were on Stow's sheep - I never saw the prisoner in Lewisham or the neighbourhood.</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son. I had seen the sheep which my father had sent to Mr. Tyler's to graze, and I believe I assisted in branding them. In consequence of information on Thursday, the 10th of March, I went to Worship-street office, with Attfield; I went from there to a butcher's-shop opposite the Dyer's Arms, Long-alley - I went into the back yard of the butcher's premises, and saw blood and other filth at the corner of the yard; I examined the privy in the yard, and found what I suppose to be the entrails of sheep - this was about noon; in consequence of what happened there, I went with Attfield to Leadenhall-market - Attfield apprehended the prisoner there: I did not see the sheep skins at the butcher's yard at that time I believe; Attfield said to the prisoner, "You are my prisoner," and asked him where he got the thirty-eight sheep - he said, "I bought them in Old-street-road, of a man," but he did not know the man - he said he gave 30l. for the thirty-eight sheep, but he did not inquire the man's name; after taking the prisoner to the office we returned to the butcher's-shop, and found eighteen skins - that was the same day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who first mentioned the number 38? A. The prisoner; we found eighteen skins in the front shop - they were in a very dirty state; I went next day to the same shop - we had left the skins there, and found them there; I washed part of one of the skins, and found the letter S. on the rump - I do not myself know whose shop it was; we searched, but found nothing more; we searched the privy more minutely; we found nothing but the entrails; there was no me it hanging in the shop for sale - it had the appearance of a butcher's-shop; we saw no meat there on the Thursday - there was no meat of any kind in the shop; I found a cleaver, a saw, weights and scales, a jacket, and other wearing-apparel there - Attfield took the jacket away with him; I went down to Mr. Agutter's at Deptford, on Thursday evening - I went to his yard, and found twenty skins in lime; I examined four of them particularly that evening, and saw the letter 
               <persName id="t18310407-11-person242">S. </persName>
            - we desired they might be taken out of the lime, which was done; the wool was of the same quality as that on my father's sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you ever been able to find more than thirty-eight skins? A. we have not - my father has no partner; when we saw the prisoner in Leadenhall-market, he gave the answer I have stated in reply to the questions at once - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WOOD. I am servant to Mr. Warmington a hide and skin salesman, of Leadenhall market. It is part of my business to go round to the butcher's-shops to collect skins for my employer; I do not know where the prisoner lived on the 8th of March, but I fetched on that day twenty skins from the house in Long-alley; the prisoner himself and two more younger men delivered them to me; there was a conversation between him and the other two, about the valuation of the skins - I brought them away, and delivered them to Devonshire, my master's foreman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your master here? A. Devonshire is - I was present when Mr. Agutter bought the skins of Devonshire; we collect skins, and sell them by commission - this transaction was in the ordinary course of business; I fetched the skins from Long-alley about one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you been in the habit of fetching skins from that place? A. No, I had never been there before.</p>

            , of Deptford - I had no other lot of the same kind of skins; they were an unusual description of skins to come to market - they were younger than are usually brought; I received them on account of Mr. Widget - it is a regular thing to go round to our connexion for skins; we had been in the habit of sending to Widgett before for skins, but never received so large a quantity on the prisoner's account before - we generally had two or three, and in one instance five from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this transaction in the ordinary course of business with Widget, with whom you had dealt before? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a fellmonger, and live at Deptford. On the 8th of March I purchased twenty skins from Mr. Warmington - I observed at the time of buying them that they were badly butchered, and said so; I afterwards gave Smith, the officer, four of those skins - I had the twenty skins washed before I gave Smith the four; I observed they were marked with the letter S. on the rump, and I marked them myself before I gave them to him, so as to identify them; Mr. Stow and Tyler saw the whole twenty.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they all been in lime the same time? A. There was not any lime on the four I gave Smith - they were only washed in water before.</p>

            . I am a constable of Southend, Lewisham. I went with Stow, Tyler, and others, on the 11th of March, to Mr.Agutter's at Deptford - I saw twenty skins there; I afterwards went to a butcher's-shop in Long-alley, and found eighteen skins - I took them to the office, and delivered them to Attfield; among other things in Long-alley I found a jacket, which was shown to the prisoner, and he said it was his; I made a private-mark on the four skins brought from Agutter's and on three which were taken out of the eighteen found at the butcher's-shop, so as to identify them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever in your life see the prisoner before he was apprehended? A. I have seen him at Lewisham within a month or two before he was apprehended: I have seen him there more than two or three times - I have noticed him passing my house, and have endeavoured to get into conversation with him; I cannot precisely say when I saw him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ATTFIELD. I am an officer of Worship-street. I went with young Mr. Stow to Leadenhall-market on Thursday, the 10th of March, and apprehended the prisoner, who was pointed out to me near a butcher's-shop, and pointing to some carcases of sheep which bung there, I asked him if those were part of the sheep which he had sent to market - he said Yes; I then took him into custody, and told him I took him on suspicion of having stolen fifty-one sheep from that gentleman, pointing to Mr. Stow- I then took him to a public-house close by, and asked how he came in possession of those sheep; he said he had bought thirty-eight sheep for 30l. of a man in Old-street-road, near the City-road; I asked if he knew the person whom he bought them off - he said No, he never saw the man before in his life, and did not know where he lived; I then sent for a coach, and took him to the office - he said he lived in Long-alley, opposite the Dyers' Arms; I am sure he said he lived there - I went there: the door was shut - I opened the shutters, and found eighteen sheep skins there, and a little room adjoining the shop had every appearance of sheep having been there for I saw wool there - I locked the shop up, returned next day, and took the skins away; there were lodgers in the house - while I was there a person, who I believe to he Mrs. Widget, came with the key of the door, and I took it from her - I fetched away the skins next day, and kept them in my possession at a public-house next door to the office till the Tuesday following, when I delivered seventeen of them to

            . I produce the knives, chopper, saws, and two drover's sticks found at the butcher's-shop; they were in the shop where the skins were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not salesmen in the market use such sticks as those? A. I do not know - I have seen drovers use such.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BARRETT. I live at No. 7, Harding's-buildings, Long-alley, and am a private watchman in that neighbourhood. On a Friday morning in the beginning of March, about five o'clock, I was on duty near Finsbury-market, and met a flock of sheep - two persons were driving them at the time I met them; I firmly believe the prisoner at the bar to be one of those persons, but I cannot swear to him - the sheep were in a very dirty state, and on one or two of them there appeared to be a mark on the rump, but what mark it was I cannot swear - I saw them driven into a house opposite the Dyers' Arms; I cannot say how many there were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said there were between thirty and forty? A. I never named any number to a correct quantity; I might have said there were between thirty and forty, but I cannot swear to the number; Finsbury-market is about two minutes walk from Long-alley - it is not in the direct road from Old-street road to Long-alley; I saw them come down South-street into Long-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Finsbury-market in a direction from Old-street-road to Long-alley? A. No, it is not - it depends on which way you go; Friday is a market-day at Smithfield, and a morning on which cattle are brought to London.</p>

            . I am a drover, and lodge in the prisoner's house in Long-alley - I pay him 1s. 6d. a week for my lodging. On Friday morning, the 4th of March, I was disturbed by some sheep coming into the house, between five and six o'clock, and the noise of people; I did not go down stairs then - I went out between eight and nine that morning, and saw in the yard between forty and fifty sheep, as I should guess; they were smallish sheep -I came home again between four and five o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner was at home, killing the sheep; he was assisted by three persons - they continued killing the sheep till eleven o'clock at night, and next day, when I came home to breakfast, at eight o'clock. I found them killing sheep; they did not cut up any of the carcases - they skinned them; the prisoner had no furniture in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the prisoner did not live there himself? A. No - the place is much like a slaughter-house; one of these sticks is such as salesmen use in the market, to keep sheep together - the other is a drover's stick; it is not mine; another man lodges there, but he is not a droven - I had never seen the prisoner kill sheep there before; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070018"/>only lodged there about six days when this happened, and had just paid him 1s. 6d.; I have not said that I believed there were between thirty and thirty-five sheep - I do not recollect saying before the Justice that it was thirty or forty.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROBSON. I am landlord of the house in Long-alley which the prisoner rents.

            . I am a constable of Lewisham, and am paid for watching on some nights. On Friday morning, the 4th of March, I remember being on duty at Lewisham, and about a quarter before one o'clock, at midnight, I saw a drove of sheep coming along - I consider that there were from forty to fifty of them; only one person was driving them - I believe the prisoner to be the man; he was in quite a different dress to what he is now - I have not any doubt of his being the man; they were small sheep - I know Tyler's field very well; the sheep were being driven in a direct road from Tyler's field towards London - they were driven unusually fast; they seemed very fresh under foot, not at all fatigued - they were about a mile and half or a mile and a quarter from Tyler's field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before the Justice? A. Yes; there is no other Lewisham watchman here that I know of - I have a distinct recollection of what I said before the Justice; I did not say there were four beasts with the drove of sheep - I believe there was another watchman before the Justice, but I did not hear him examined; I am quite certain there was but one person with the sheep I saw at Lewisham - I spoke to the prisoner, but did not stop him; I had a dog with me, which frightened the sheep, and he swore at the dog - I told him the dog would neither hurt him nor the sheep; he bade me good night, and went on - this was a little before one o'clock in the morning, between the White Hart and the Castle, beyond the watch-house; it was higher up the town of Lewisham than the White Hart - I am employed as a night constable and a private watchman as well, occasionally; there is a private subscription for watching at night - he was perhaps three or four minutes passing me; he went along very swiftly, swifter than drovers go in general - I thought he drove them too fast for a regular drover; I had never seen him before with sheep to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you ever seen him before without sheep? A. I have seen him before - I know his face familiarly by seeing him about, but I cannot exactly recollect where.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you ever spoken to him before so as to know his voice? A. No, I heard his voice at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About how near were you to him when you had the conversation about the dog? A. About four yards - it was a star-light night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prisoner stand opposite to you during any of the time? A. I was about four yards from him - I stood still and he was moving on; I swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>JOHN PINKS. I am servant to Mr. Hulme, a meat-salesman, in Leadenhall-market. On Saturday morning, the 5th of March, about five or six o'clock, I found the carcases of seven taggs left at my master's shop for sale, and on the Monday following I spoke to the prisoner about those sheep; I told him they were dressed very bad, and he had better pay a man 1s. to have them dressed as they should be - he said his son did not come home till late at night, and he was in liquor, but he was very well satisfied with the prices he got, thought he got nothing by them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has your master been in the habit of selling sheep for the prisoner before? A. yes, several times before.</p>
               <p>One of the skins found at the prisoner's house, and one found at Mr. Agutter's were handed to the Jury, with the brandmark.</p>
               <p>MR. STOW. The growth of the wool in the sheep would extend the mark - they were marked seven months ago; I have no doubt of the skins being mine - I swear to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the officer took me I told him where the skins and things were, and where I bought them - I bought them in Old-street-road, joining the City-road; I drove them home into Long-alley, killed them. and sent them to market, some to Pinks, and some to another gentleman's - he asked what I gave for them; I told him 30l. - he asked if I knew the man I bought them of; I told him I did not - he asked if I had got any witness: I told him yes, and I believe they will be here - when I got to Worship-street the Magistrate asked me where I bought them; I told him in Old-street-road, and what I gave for them.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I had occasion to leave town - Mrs. Paterson and the family left on the 7th of October; I followed in a few days, and occasionally came backwards and forwards - I had known the prisoner from his birth, and his father and mother before him; I had a most excellent opinion of him, and on leaving town I left the house under his special care - he recommended me a person to be in the house, but I explained to him that I relied on him himself for the safe custody of every thing there; I remained out of town till December - I occasionally came back, and then went to Cadogan-place; the bed-rooms were kept in order for me - I returned to town a few days before Mrs. Paterson, and on her coming to town I discovered a new key in her wardrobe, in the lock of the drawer - it was a strange key; I know the gold chains were missed, but I had not put them away myself.</p>

A good many painters were employed - there were perhaps half a dozen; I do not exactly know the number - they were there some weeks; they had access to the rooms they were to paint - the wardrobe was in the bed-room, which was painted and papered; I cannot say how many were employed in that room, I left that to the master - I have called on the prisoner since he has been in prison; I told him I did not make any proposals to him - I went to induce him to give up my property; I held out no inducement to him - I represented to him his ingratitude in robbing me when he had been born in my father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing of this kind to him, that if the things had been taken by him, if they were conveyed to you secretly, so that by any direction you might not be presumed to know from whence they came, you would do him all the good you could? A. I did not say any thing in those terms, I will tell you what I said - he asked me how he might convey them; I told him I would not tell him how to convey things to my house without it being known from whom they came, but I had no doubt he was cunning enough to know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then the conversation arose from his asking you how he was to convey property to you? A. Certainly, and not from me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not request that your interview with the prisoner should be in secret? A. I did not, at least I do not know that I request it - the governor immediately told one of his men to show me into a private room; I do not know that he said</p>
               <p>"private," but there was no third person present - in fact I had previously asked the Magistrate if I should do wrong in going there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to the prisoner or his wife, that it would be better for him to assign over any property he possessed to you? A. No - she offered it; I only went to the prisoner once in prison - I had only one interview with him on the subject, in the prison or elsewhere; his wife called on me twice - I have never received any property from the prisoner, nor seen any but what will be produced; I have received none from him, nor any body connected with him - I was absent from the 7th of October till the 12th of December.</p>

               <persName id="t18310407-12-person260">Paterson</persName>
            's absence till December; I had no key in my personal care, except the key of the street door, and that I could not lock outside - Mr. Broach had the keys of the several doors of the house, except the street door; he was there frequently doing upholsterer's work and other things - I remember Captain Paterson coming home in December, and I went to find the prisoner, as Captain Paterson wanted him; I searched for him for some time, and called for him, but received no answer to my call - I then went down stairs; I came up again, went to the drawing-room door, and heard a door unlocked - I then went up stairs, and saw the prisoner at the bed-room door, locking the bed-room door: he was coming from Captain Paterson's bed-room, and had a hammer and screw-driver in his hand - I told him I had been calling for him several times; he made no answer to that - while I was looking for him, I had tried the door of Captain Paterson's bed-room to see if he was there, and could not open it - there was a press which used to stand in the nursery bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any morning soon after the day you have spoken of seeing the press in the nursery bed-room? A. Yes - I went in again in the course of that day, and saw the press had been removed about an inch and a half or two inches, and I saw a small piece of calico laying there which had not been there before; I do not know whether the street door has a spring lock - the prisoner could go out without being let out, and used to do so; he could not come in again without knocking - he kept the key of Captain 
               <persName id="t18310407-12-person261">Paterson</persName>
            's bed-room; it was only in my possession when the Captain was in town - when I wanted to make the bed the door was unlocked for me; on all other occasions the prisoner kept the key, and I never had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About how many persons were employed about the house? A. I cannot exactly say the number - there might be seven painters, or there might be more; the painters only had one assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. You called at the door of the bed-room on a particular occasion, is there any small chamber off that bed-room where he might be, not choosing to answer exactly at that moment? A.There is a closet near the bed-room where might be.</p>

            . I am shopman to Bilborough and Co. pawnbrokers, in South Audley-street. I merely produce two duplicates of pledges; on the 16th of October the prisoner pawned a pair of bracelets for 7l.; I am quite sure of his person; I looked at the article carefully before I advanced the money - five or six rows of gold chains composed the bracelets, and it had a snap set with turquoise; each chain was separated from the rest - on the same day I took in from him two gold chains and a pair of ear-rings, for 5l.; on the 22nd of December he redeemed the two gold chains and one pair of ear-rings - I am the person who delivered them out to him, as well as received them, and on the 24th he redeemed the bracelets - (looking at a case of jewellery produced by the prosecutrix) these are so much like the articles, that I should have said they really were the same; that observation applies as well to the bracelets as to the chain - there were two chains.</p>
               <p>MRS. PATERSON. These are the three volumes of Gibbon's Rome, which I left behind, and here is the first volume, which I did not lock up - the articles of jewellery which I have produced are an accurate representation of the bracelets and chain which I lost from my wardrobe; I have procured these from a friend - there is no perceptible difference between them; I could not have distinguished them from my own - I knew my friend had such ornaments, and having lost mine, I applied to her to lend me these.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where your friend bought them? A. They came from India, and so did mine - I never saw any of them but my own and this set- I call the bracelets produced one pair; mine were not under any lock except the lock of the wardrobe in which they were deposited - the property might have been taken part at a time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Besides the articles produced, did you iniss some table-cloths? A. I did; also twenty-three napkins, two gowns, and a shawl - I think the two pairs of bracelets were worth at least 15l.; the two gold chains were given to me and I suppose them to be worth more than 5l.; I consider one pair of bracelets to be worth 10l. and this gold chain I should think a jeweller would charge ten guineas for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Unfortunate as I am in being placed here to answer a very serious charge, I hope I shall not be more unfortunate in having to encounter a prejudice against me, from having been described as a wholesale robber, and my case having been six months on the town, as it is said - I hope you will feel for me; you may consider what is my case to-day may be yours hereafter. My connexion with the prosecutor has been very ancient; my father and mother lived with his father and mother - when my father and mother came to town, they settled in business, and his house was a home for these young gentlemen to come to; they used to come to our house, and stop there waiting for ships to India, though their father and mine were in different situations in life, such is the affection of Scotchmen for each other; when about twelve years old, I went with the captain as midshipman - I was accustomed to see his property in my father's possession, and was accustomed to make free with it for my own use, and I certainly did not consider I was doing wrong in taking the books, which I declare I only took to read, having no copy of my own; on going home I met a person, with whom I stopped; I laid these books down behind my back in the parlour where I sat, and taking the books up, I went home, without noticing the number, and when I got home I found only three volumes; I looked about in the Captain's house to see if I had left one volume there; not finding it, I took them to Taylor to make up the other volume - I never took them to him to sell; it was a rule with him and me that I never left books for sale; I called on him two or three times to know if he had made up the books, as I was anxious the Captain should have his books back perfect. Another fact I apprehend you will notice, I took no money on the books, therefore there was no selling; as for the other things, I know nothing whatever of them. I remember in October a lady who lodged in my house, and who came from India, had run into arrears with my wife, who had expressed her displesure at not having her money; she was separated from her husband; she told me she was short of money, brought out a jewel-case, and asked me to raise her money on it; I took the case - I did not know the contents; she asked me to get about 15l., and I got 12l.; at Queen-square the pawnbroker's man had Woodbery at his elbow, talking to him about the five chains, and all those minute descriptions, and then he could describe accurately about the turquoise, as he had had the description given him; he said, after a little hesitation, he should not like to swear to them if he saw them, and when he was called up, the prosecutor was sitting by the Magistrate, and I believe if it had not been from some secret hint he received, he would have sworn they were the identical things pawned by me; the only thing I remember among them was, there was some chain like a guard chain, from which the lady took a locket, and let me take the chain; but as far as I remember, they were as much like those things as I am like that door; when he was checked, as I believe, for swearing to them, he said he thought the case was not so fiesh; "No, (said the prosecutor,) it was an old case, a semicircular one;" "Yes,(said the witness) with the corners taken off;" but they were juggling, and determined to make the thing pass if they could. I am perfectly innocent. I admit taking the books under the circumstance stated; it is for you to say whether I took them feloniously or not. I left them with a man I was well known to, and did not go out of the way to dispose of them. I knew they were exposed in his shop. I was not afraid of them; and with the things I pawned I gave my own name and address. I am as perfectly innocent of the robbery as any individual Court. As for myself, the result is of little conse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070021"/>quence to me; I am bankrupt in every thing. I have lost my character, and am down. I certainly have a wife, with whom I have lived on very good terms, and it is for her sake, and not my own, that it is of any consequence to me.</p>

               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             DE CHAMPEMONT. I am the wife of Alphouse Joseph Marie Morel de Champemont. In 1824 I and my family had occasion to leave town - we lived at <placeName id="t18310407-13-crimeloc89">No. 17, Edward-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you any doubt of the watch? A.None.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Bilborough, a pawnbroker, in South Audley-street. The gold watch which I produced I received in pawn from the prisoner on the 6th of May, 1829, with two chains, two seals, and a key - I lent 10l. on the whole, and on the 1st of September, 1830, the time for redeeming it having gone by, it was renewed by the prisoner; I am certain of him - I would advance 5l. on the gold watch alone; I might have been induced to have lent 6l. on it - I think it would be worth 10l. to a wearer; I could have sold the watch for 6l. or 7l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There is great caprice in buying things of this kind? A.Things do not always fetch their value - I should not have liked to have sold the watch for 5l.; the maker's name would justify the value - the value depends on the gold and the works.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Suppose that were sent to a pawnbroker's auctioneer to be sold with other condemned pledges, what sum should you have restricted it to be sold at? A. I should not have liked to let it be sold for less than 6l.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PACKER. I am a pawnbroker. I produce a pair of gold handled scissors, which were pawned on the 20th of July last, for 5s., and I believe by the prisoner, in the name of John Broach - I have a doubt about him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WOODBERY. I am an officer of Queen-square. In consequence of information obtained from different prosecutors, I went to the prisoner's house, and found there a small miniature and a pair of steel spring scissors; the prosecutrix was with me - she pointed the scissors out, and claimed them; the miniature might be called a brooch - I found that in the little back parlour on the ground floor; I found the duplicate of the gold watch produced by Neate; when I apprehended the prisoner I asked him to what watch the duplicate belonged; he said it was his father's watch.</p>

            . While the prosecutrix was out of town I was at the house; the prisoner was in the habit of coming there from Mr. Byewater's, and seeing the furniture put up and down, he went into the different rooms without being watched during all the time the family were absent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell what year it was? A.1724 - I have got it down; it was 1804 - no, 1824.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent; I never was near the house during the time this lady says she lost her property - Mr. Byewater, in whose employ I was, never did a single job for her during that time; he was not employed that year - the lady employed another person at that time; when she left the house, the room she says she lost the property from, was left open, for the purpose, as I understood, of having a conservatory added to the end of it, and a number of persons must have been employed there - I never saw that conservatory, except from the next house; there was a very curious circumstance happened about a year before 1824 - a certain gentleman, who lived in that house, had this lady's keys; the witness, who has just left, could have answered to that - the gentleman had access to every thing in the house, I suppose, for he carried a very large bunch of keys about with him, and one night in particular he happened to fall into company with a woman in the street, (it is a matter of newspaper history,) she either robbed him, or he said she robbed him of a gold watch - he made a noise about it in the street, and the watchman took her into custody and requested him to leave his address to answer the charge the next day - the gentleman scribbled out something, but instead of leaving that he gave his real name and address at this lady's house, and next morning, when applied to by the officer, he said he never lost his watch, and had never met a woman that night - the fact is, my house is open to every body, and it is a wonder they did not swear to my chairs and tables.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to the PROSECUTRIX. Q. At the time you went out of town were you married to the present prosecutor? A. Yes.</p>

On the 22nd of February, between ten and eleven o'clock, he came to my shop with another man, who, he said, was a carpenter and undertaker - they both came in together, and Davis said to me, "Have you got any good superfine black cloth?" I said I had - he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070022"/>want nine or ten yards of the best, and as much more of inferior;" I said I was very low of the very best superfine cloth, but what I had I would show him - I took out a piece of fine, which measured six yards, tight measure, and told him I had got another length of the same quality, about two yards and a half - I showed it to him, and told him the price was 22s.; he told me to measure it off - I put it all in at eight yards and a quarter, as it was tight measure, and I told him so - he said he was in a very great hurry, for the carpenter had got a job to finish at some coffins, and I was to make it up as quick as I could - he called the man a carpenter and undertaker; I put the cloth into a paper, and chalked out on the counter "9l. 1s. 6d." - I put my hand on the bundle, and said, "Now, which of you two is going to pay for this cloth?" Davis said, "I will, but I want to look at some single kerseymere; a low one," meaning a cheap one - I told him I had no low single kerseymere, but I had some low double-milled at 8s. a yard, and would cut it to him at 7s. 6d. - I brought three ends of kerseymere forward, one single and two double - I told him the price of all three; he approved of them, and told me to unroll and measure the whole - I did so, and rolled them up again; I made out my bill, and said, "Mr. Davis, if you will wait a moment I will send my girl out for a stamped receipt; the bill amounted to 26l. 8s. - he said,"Oh, you need not mind, you can draw upon me at a month for it."</p>
               <p>Q.What had become of the carpenter? A. When the prisoner said, "Oh, I will (meaning he would) pay for it," the carpenter went away with the first parcel of cloth, and the prisoner said to him, "All the small pieces you get out of the cloth bring them back to me;" he took it away at the time I asked who was to pay me for it; when I said I would send for a stamped receipt the prisoner said, "You may draw upon me at a month or two if you like;" I said"Draw a bill upon you you vagabond, scoundrel - draw a bill upon you, now you have got my property out of the place; I shall send for a Policeman directly for you;" I sent for one directly - he came, but did not think it a case he could interfere in; I told him the prisoner and another had robbed me of 9l. odd worth of cloth - he did not search him; I never intended to part with the goods without the money - I would not have suffered it to go out of my shop- I expected him to pay for it immediately; I never intended to trust him with it at all, nor give him credit for it any way whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. The prisoner has dealt with you for twenty years? A. I have known him twenty years - he may have dealt with me that time for trifling articles, till within these four years; I never gave him a year's credit, but he has taken it - he has not spent 50l. with me all his life; he used to be foreman to a man in Holles-street - he might buy 7l. or 8l. worth of goods of me in a year; I gave him about six months' credit - I never had but one bill of him, and that was the last transaction; I could get nothing but a bill from him - the upmost I gave him credit for was about 3l.</p>
               <p>Q.When the cloth was folded up. you, for the first time, talked about the payment? A.Of course; I had my elbow on it, and if they had mentioned bills then I should have turned it on one side, and told them to walk out - I let the man go out with it because he said Davis wanted to look at other goods; the carpenter took away the parcel with my consent, because the prisoner promised to pay me- he used not to bring a person with him when he dealt with me before; I had my hand on the cloth, and asked who would pay me for it - the prisoner said, "I will," and as he said the man was in a hurry, I let it go; if he had said, "I will give you a bill," I would have thrown it aside, and said, "Walk out of my place;" 13l. is the greatest amount he ever owed me, and I was a year and a half before I got that; it was not likely I would trust him after that - I have never said that he had dealt with me eighteen months ago; he got very bouncing when he found the Policeman would not interfere - he gave me a bill in 1827 for 20l., though he only owed me 13l.; he wanted the balance out of my pocket, but I would not give it him - I did not negotiate the bill; the 13l. was paid me - when I first knew him he was foreman to Mr. Tenpenny, which is a respectable firm; he was with them many years - I never knew him in business for himself; the Magistrate gave him an opportunity of bringing the cloth back, to me, but that was before I found it in pawn; he said he kept a shop in Well-street, and I see there is a shop there, but I was never in it - the Magistrate asked if I wished to prosecute; I said I had no ill will to him, all I wanted was my property.</p>

               <p>DANIEL DUTCH. I am a Police-constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23rd of February; I have a duplicate in the name of Wilson, who is a carpenter, and lives in Homer-street I believe; it was given to me by Wilson's mother.</p>
               <p>HENRY GIBBS. I am shopman to Mr. Jenkins', of Crawford-street, Marylebone, about a mile from the prosecutor's. I produce two pieces of cloth, pawned on the 22nd of February, about one o'clock in the day, by a woman, in the name of Mary Wilson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How far is your shop from Wilson's? A. Not above three or four minutes' walk.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOYD. It was about half-past eleven o'clock when the Policeman was sent for - here are my initials on the paper the cloth is wrapped in; it is the paper I wrapped it in at the time - here is my name on it, and the cloth is mine; it does not appear to have been cut at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner made any endeavour to find Wilson? A. I cannot say - I have endeavoured to find him, but cannot - Dutch and I were looking after him, and find he lived where they gave the pawnbroker his address, but his absconded; I believe the prisoner was apprehended at his own house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have dealt with Mr. Loyd full twenty years, from the commencement of business - I was foreman to the late Mr. Tenpenny, and used to buy all the trimmings; indeed, I carried on the business - I set up in business, and paid him ready money, which I received from my master, for sixteen years, and at times, having a few jobs of my own, he gave me credit, and I paid him when I received my bill, till the last time, when Mr. Tenpenny failed, and owed me 222l.; I came in with the creditors, which made me poor - I was to have received 14s. in the pound, but had only 6s., which made me run rather longer credit with Loyd; he never intimated in the least manner whatever to deny me credit when I asked him - I left off dealing with him, because my son was in the habit of going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070023"/>to Mr. Tenpenny's, who once sent him to Loyd's with half a crown too much - he gave me credit for it, and that was the reason I did not deal with him; this undertaker had been fitting up my place in Well-street for three months, till I was apprehended, since then I have not seen Wilson: Mrs. Wilson says I ordered her to pawn the cloth, but I never saw her in my life - as to Loyd, he will swear any thing; he has been in Clerkenwell three months for buying stolen goods, and would have been sent over the herring pond if he had not had Counsel to plead for him - he learnt so much at Clerkenwell that he said he should treble his way of laying out his money.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOYD. I bought some goods of a man, and got into a hobble with them: I am sorry to say I have had an accident of that kind - I have lived eighteen years where I now do; many traders have fallen into an errer, and I do not deny it, but I was never in Clerkenwell; I was confined twelve months - I never heard the least thing against the prisoner's character.</p>

I had known the prisoner for a fortnight or three weeks before this happened: the money in question was kept in my bed-room, on the second floor- the prisoner did not lodge at my house; he came there on the 2nd of February, and represented himself as the master of a ship; he said he had been drinking with the owner of his ship, he was out late, and could not get to his ship - he wanted a bed, and he went to bed in my house; I saw my money safe at nine o'clock in the morning of the 3rd, when I went into the bed-room - he was at that time up stairs in the room over my bed-room, where he slept, but I did not at that time know he was there; I went into the City immediately, and returned a little before twelve - he had been gone a few minutes, and I heard the money was gone; I went to my bed-room, and missed the money from the drawer, which had been opened by a picklock-key, I think, as the lock seemed to have been prized open by force - I missed ten sovereigns, sixteen half-crowns, twenty shillings, and twenty sixpences; I never saw him again till I found him in custody at the Thames Police, nearly two months afterwards, in consequence of an advertisement in the newspaper; I am quite sure he is the man who had a bed at my house - I gave information to the inspector as soon as I lost the money.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I know the prisoner; I saw him at the house on the 2nd of February, about eleven o'clock at night; he asked for a bed, which my husband allowed him - he slept in the room directly over our bed-room; I did not exactly know what money was in the drawer - I had observed ten sovereigns there the night before, with some silver, but how much I do not know; the prisoner did not stay to breakfast next morning - he paid for his bed over night, which is usual; I saw him leave the house; he asked me what time it was; I told him between eleven and twelve o'clock - my husband had been out, and came home just after the prisoner was gone; I had not then discovered the loss - I examined the drawer after he came home; but before he did, I found the lock injured, and the money gone - I could open the drawer; none of the money was marked - I saw the prisoner at the Thames Police, on the 7th of April - we had no other stranger in the house at the time; the bed-room was shut, but not locked; any body coming down stairs might open it - I found the door open when I went up; I had left the room about half-past eight o'clock - the door was then shut: my husband had gone out before ten - when I went up, I found the door wide open; I knew nobody in the house could go into the room without my knowledge - our front door is kept shut, and nobody goes out but what we let out - I let the prisoner out - we serve no customer till after twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say I am entirely innocent - I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; I have no friends in London.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH LEATHERDALE re-examined. We have a servant girl, who slept in the kitchen, and a servant man up stairs - they are still in my service.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Had the servants access to the room? A. They could not go up stairs without my seeing them - the servant girl was at work with me, providing dinner, all the morning - I was directly opposite the staircase with her all the morning, and saw the prisoner come down; there is no back staircase; the man servant slept in the top garret - he came down stairs before me, and could not have gone up without me, or the female servant seeing him.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you quarrel about? A.She said I had said she was ungrateful - I had told her so before, and she began again about it; she struck me in the face with her hands, and I said, "Mary, you are ungrateful;" she hit me in the face three or four times with her hand - I struck her again when she struck me so many times; I am sure I hit her again - I do not think the Magistrate asked me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you sat down to breakfast, did you? A. No, I put the frying-pan on the fire to fry some meat - this was immediately after we struck each other; we were good friends, and had made it up, not to quarrel any more; I was standing by the fire, and saw her put her hand into her pocket - this was full ten minutes after she had struck me, and we had become good friends.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you good friends? A. I told her as it was Sunday, I did not wish to have any quarrel, and she said, "Well, I will drop it;" she said we should not quarrel any more - I said very well, I was agreeable, and did not wish to quarrel, as it was Sunday; the frying-pan was on the fire when I said this - I was preparing breakfast, and going to give her breakfast; we both became quite reconciled; I was standing by the fire, frying the meat for breakfast, and saw her put her hand into her pocket without saying any thing to me; she then stooped down without saying any thing, put her hand under my clothes, and when it was done, I said, "Mary you have stabbed me!" I said so instantly - I felt that I was stabbed; I felt the blood come from my right thigh - I exclaimed immediately, "Mary, you have stabbed me!" it was done all in a moment; she said, "No I have not, let me look?" I took up my clothes, and let her look - she said, "Let me tie it up - it will be no worse;" the blood flowed very rapidly, and I called for Mrs. King, who lives in the next room - she came in directly, and I said, in the prisoner's presence, that she had stabbed me; she said she had done it, and would do it again, and spit in my face three times - when I called Mrs. King in, she attempted to go out, but I fastened the door and prevented her; she wanted to go away - I stood before the door - I let Mrs. King in at that door; the neighbours came in, a constable was sent for, and a surgeon looked at my wounds; I had three wounds, one on the thigh, one about my knee, and the largest wound was up in my thigh, that wound bled profusely; the surgeon has attended me ever since it happened - he dressed it on Sunday, but has not seen it since - it is very nearly healed now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long have you been the wife of William Foulkes - you are only living with him? A. I have been lawfully married to him these eight years - you did not meet me in Shoe-lane, talking to a man on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not take you and the man you live with, and another man who lives in the court, into the Red Lion, in Plumtree-court, and pay for half a pint of spirits for you? A. She did not; she took me in on Sunday morning before eight o'clock, and paid for some liquor; my husband and another man were with me then - it was a little before eight; I cannot say how much liquor she paid for - I did not drink with her on Saturday night - I did not buy any beef on Saturday night, nor did you sleep in my house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not go into a wine-vaults, at the corner of Bear-alley, and pay for three separate quarterns of spirits, some cheese, and biscuits on Saturday night, for you and the men? A. It is not true, you were not at my house all that night - you slept at my house on Wednesday night, but not afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in custody for robbing different gentlemen, and obliged to fly from England? A. I never was charged with robbing a gentleman - I do not know Mr. Powell; I was never tried, nor in custody, nor before a Magistrate till I was at the office about her - she is capable of swearing any thing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you recollect how much you had drank on the Sunday morning? A. I had two glasses of gin with her, and nothing more; I cannot say what she drank, but she had no more in my company than I had - she was perfectly sober when this happened.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what hour on Sunday morning did I go with you and the tall woman Eliza, into Davies' public-house on Saffron-hill? A. I never saw her till I went into the room - I had not been out of my house till I came in to this woman when she called.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, on Saffron-hill, call me a scaly b -, because I would not pay for more than a quartern of gin, and Eliza put down 6d. to pay for it? A.There is no truth in it - I did not see her till I saw her in the room when Ellen was stabbed.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Sunday morning, the 27th of March, Mrs. King came for me - I went up to Foulkes' room, and found the prisoner and Foulkes there; Foulkes said she had been stabbed - the prisoner denied having stabbed her; this pen-knife (producing it) was taken from her pocket by another constable, in my presence - it was shut at the time; the point was all over blood, which appeared fresh, and after I took her to the station-house I found two more knives on her.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at No. 24, Hatton-garden. On Sunday morning, about half-past eight o'clock, the Policeman came to my house - I saw the prosecutrix about half-past eleven, at the house in New-court; my young man had seen her before, and dressed her wounds - I examined her wounds then; there was a hemorrhage which had returned - the wound was opened out and re-dressed; she had three wounds, but one was the principal - it appeared to have been done with a sharp instrument; the upper wound in the thigh was about two inches long, and about a quarter of an inch deep through the skin and integuments - it was over a dangerous part if it had cut deeper, but being superficial there was no danger in the wound itself; the others had been done by a sharp instrument - they were small wounds just cut through the skin; I have attended her ever since - I dressed it last Sunday, and think it well now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I trust you will take my distressed situation into your merciful consideration, and allow me to state a few facts as they happened in this case - I am entirely innocent of the crime, as I expect mercy from the Almighty, who known the secrets of all hearts. On Saturday night, the 26th of March, I went to the lodgings of the prosecutrix for some duplicates I had left there, intending to release them; the prosecutrix was not at home - the man she lives with told me she was just gone out, for she had no money - I asked him to come out and look for her - I proceeded to the pawnbroker's, desiring William Foulkes to try to find her, and come towards Gray's Inn-lane (that being the way I was going), and that I would meet them after I got my things: on my return I met Foulkes, who told me he could not find her, but he did not doubt of meeting her, as she desired him to come out to her about one o'clock - I then walked down Holborn and Farringdon-street with him in search of her; Foulkes met with a person who told us that Ellen, meaning the prosecutrix, went down Shoe-lane about ten minutes before - we accordingly went that way, and saw her standing with a man at the gate of Mr. Pontifex's manufactory; I then took her,

            , and the man, who told us where to find her, into the Red Lion, in Shoe-lane, and gave them something to drink - I then advised them to go home: the prosecutrix denied doing so, as she must get some money before she went home; I told her I would give her 3s. or 4s. to get what she wanted the next day, as there was nothing else but drunken blackguards about the streets, and that she would only get herself ill-used - I then took them both to a wine-vaults, at the corner of Bear-alley, Farringdon-street, and treated them with several glasses of spirits, some biscuits, and cheese; I then gave Foulkes 3s. 6d. to get some meat for their Sunday's dinner; I took some boiled beef for supper - we all went together to their lodging; when we had been there about an hour three men came and knocked at the window by mistake - the prosecutrix ran out, and abused the men most scandalously, until a neighbour of theirs advised her to go in and not expose herself at that hour in the morning - she then brought the men in with her; I then, by their desire, sent for some beer and spirits, which I did three or four different times - about seven o'clock we all came out together, and went to a wine-vaults, kept by a person of the name of Gurney, in Farringdon-street; they there asked me to lend the other man 1s.; I did so - I then begged of them to go home, as I would not stop any longer about the streets on a Sunday morning; they came part of the way, but would not go any further if I did not give them a drop more, as they termed it - I then paid for more spirits at the end of Field-lane, Holborn; Foulkes and the other man left us. The prosecutrix and myself were going towards her home, but going along Field-lane we met the witness King and another woman - the prosecutrix asked me for 6d. to treat them, saying, with an oath, that many a cold night they had given her a glass - I told her I thought she was making a complete dupe of me, but still I consented to go with them to a house on Saffron hill; I called for a quartern of spirits, which did not suit them; one of them then called for half a pint and paid for it, at the same time calling me scaly, and every other name they could think of - I made them no answer, as I was quite sensible enough to be ashamed of my conduct, being about the streets on a Sunday morning - I begged of the prosecutrix to come home and give me some things of mine, which were at her room, and that I would go to my own room - she came with me, but the moment she got in she began raving like a mad woman, struck me repeatedly, and tore my cap off my head, which I could not bear without retaliating - I told her I was very well served for being a fool. I could not understand any other than that the woman was jealous of me - I came out to look for

             to send him home to pacify her, but could not find him; I went back again, and the man was laying on the bed: the instant I entered the room she screamed out, and accused me of stabbing her, and said she would have her revenge of me now - I was struck with astonishment, and sat down until the two Policemen came in; the witness King stated before the Policeman, and the first time she came before the Magistrate, that she saw me do it, then that I said I had done it, and would do it again: this, if the Policeman speaks the truth, he knows to be false - even the officers at Hatton-garden said on Saturday, when I was committed, that it was a great pity their two former statements had not been taken down, for they never heard stories so widely different - the other Policeman, who is not present, stated before the Magistrate that he took the one particular knife out of my pocket; why did he not take the others? that was taken from me at the station-house - one of those knives I have carried in my pocket these four years, and the other is my husband's: had I been conscious of having done wrong I could have thrown them away, which the Policeman very well knows, while I was going to the station-house. This is all I have to say - I throw myself on your mercy, and trust you will notice the oaths of the prosecutrix and the witness, as they are two of the best known characters in the City, having many times been tried for robberies - there is not an officer or watchman through the City but knows them; the prosecutrix, by the appellation of Yorkshire Ellen, and the witness as Old Suke - there is not a part of England the prosecutrix has not been obliged to run from, in consequence of robbing different men, she was obliged to fly from Manchester, for giving a gentleman drugs to stupify him, while she robbed him of 17l. and his gold watch - the man, who for years has lived on this prostitution and robbery, was taken for it, but as they could not find the woman he was acquitted. These are the characters who are doing their endeavours to swear away the life of your unfortunate petitioner.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was called into Miles' house on the 8th of January, in the evening - he said he suspected the prisoner had a handkerchief and some money of his; she went in with me, and opened her trunk herself - she looked to see if her things were correct, and threw this handkerchief out of her box, saying "This is not mine;" Miles picked it up, and said, "It is mine." and that he knew it by a mark - I found some loose silk run into the edge of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN HEMUS. On the Sunday before the prisoner was taken she came into my mother's - I think it was in December: she told my mother she had no money, and was very poorly off - she drank tea with us, and next day, at one o'clock, when I came home to dinner, she was very much intoxicated, and asked me to go to the play with her- she said she would treat me and my mother, for she had plenty of money; I said I had to go to my work - this was two or three days after the prosecutor lost his money.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, denying the charge, stating that she had left the house in consequence of the prosecutor's ill-temper, and had summoned him afterwards for 1l. 19s. 11d., for things detained.</p>

I went to a house at the corner of Bryanstone and Cumberland-streets, and got very much intoxicated; I went out, and in Edgware-road, going towards home, I met three young men; the prisoner Trigg was one of them: I knew him before well by sight, by his being at a fishmonger's, in Dover-street; Marylebone - I had never been in his company; as I passed them I received a knock on my hat - I turned, and asked what that was for, and they came up towards me; I said, "Trigg, is that you?" he said, "Yes, what are you going to stand to drink?" I said it was late, and there was no house open - they said they knew of a house, and took me to a house in Adam-street, which I believe is the Carpenters' Arms, but I am not certain - we had two half-pints of gin among us; I paid for it - I had my full share - we came out together in about ten minutes, and walked together to the corner of <placeName id="t18310407-19-crimeloc126">Praed-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were very drunk when you met them? A. Yes, but not so much so as afterwards; they were in custody when I received the sovereign - I recollect paying for three pints of ale and a glass of rum and water; I had nothing more to my knowledge till I got with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>MARK HARRIS. I am a Police-constable. On the 16th of March I was on duty in Praed-street, and saw several persons coming behind me; I thought they were in familiar conversation - I heard somebody say, "What do you mean? - Police!" I heard several repeated blows on the crown of a hat - I went to the spot, saw the prisoners Trigg and Fenn running, and saw the prosecutor still running after the others; I saw three persons running, and a fourth following them; the two ran into a shed in Irongate wharf - I kept my eyes on that shed till a serjeant of our division came; we then went in, and found Trigg and Fenn - I was afterwards in the watch-house; Robinson was there - all the prisoners were then in custody; Robinson pointed out Kitchins distinctly to me, and said, "You are the villian that attempted to rob me of my watch, but got my chain and seals, and struck me;" Kitchins denied it -I have received a sovereign from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the prisoners searched? A. Yes, minutely - nothing was found on them.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRUCE. I am a Policeman. I was in Edgware-road, at the corner of Church-street, and heard a cry of Police! and Stop thief! for about ten minutes - I went to the corner of Bell-street, and saw the prisoner Kitchins come through the passage - Robinson was running, as if trying to overtake him, and calling Police! they appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070028"/>to have been running a considerable way - neither of them could speak for a time; they were out of breath - I stopped Kitchins, and Robinson said, "You d - d villain, you have robbed me of my watch;" he then said, "Not my watch, it is my chain;" I searched him at the watch-house, and found five keys on him, of rather a peculiar description.</p>
               <p>Kitchins' Defence. I was walking through White Lion-passage when the Policeman stopped me - the prosecutor was coming behind, hallooing something.</p>

             MORGAN. I am a constable. On the 3rd of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw a waggon standing in the middle of the road, opposite Aldgate church; the prisoner and four or five others were standing about the pavement, opposite the waggon- I passed them, went on a few yards, and saw one of them go behind the waggon, take something out, and give it to the prisoner, who was towards Church-court, and I caught hold of him; the others ran away - I found this cheese on the prisoner; he said, "Let me go; I did not take it."</p>

I drive Mrs. Andrews' waggon - I left the waggon, but was never out of sight; I saw a cheese had been shifted, and stopped to see if I could see any body about - I was going to get into the waggon when the officer called to ask if I had lost any thing; he had the prisoner in custody, with the cheese - I am sure it is one of those cheeses I had in my waggon, as it was marked No. 5, in a diamond.</p>

I am the bearer of bad news, but want to see you privately;" he asked me into his front parlour, and I communicated my suspicions to him - the father looked up at the top of a high cupboard, and said, "They have been bringing hairs here, which they are allowed 2s. in the 1l. for selling," and he reached down from the top of his cupboard the 1 lb. I charge the prisoner with stealing - the prisoner was not present when he first produced it to me; his mother was brought in, and placed two chairs for the two sons to be brought in before me, and I charged the prisoner with stealing it - he said, "It is a pretty thing indeed, that I should be charged with stealing bristles;" I said, "I am certain you have done it;" he looked at the top of the cupboard, and said, "Then I dare say you have seen them;" I said, "I have, and now, Mr. Sheppard, will you bring them down?" he then said he had taken that pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not ask him if he had sold the bristles? A. No - he might say he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070031"/>never stole nor sold any thing; he came frequently to our warehouse, bought bristles to some amount, and usually brought a bag for them, which I generally put them into- he might sometimes put them in himself when he bought a single pound; he bought three or four bundles that day- this bundle was about five yards from him, and behind a counter; I was with him the whole time, but the counter goes up the side of the room - the bristles came from St. Petersburg; I had received 28lbs. of them - they were marked H. by the person we bought them of, but I understand we had every pound that was imported.</p>

I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner for stealing the bristles, at his father's house - I heard the charge made against him; he said nothing to it, and would answer no questions I put to him - I asked his father, in his hearing, how it was that he had not questioned him as to how he had become possessed of them; the father said he had been a most undutiful son, and that he had told him he had them from a friend, and was to receive 2s. in 1l. for selling them - the prisoner made no reply to that.</p>

I cannot speak positively to having seen it since last April, when I took stock, though I have no doubt of its being mine - when the pistol was sent to me I made some inquiry, and the prisoner came two or three times to my place, to explain what he knew of it; he said he bought it in the street for 2s. about three weeks before.</p>

            . I am a gun-maker, and live in Lisle-street, Leicester-square. I bought this pistol of Puddle, for 13s. - I saw a private mark on it, and supposing it was Mr. Lang's, I sent it to him by his errand-boy, when he came on some business; it being an odd one, is not of much value - I sent it to see if Mr. Lang had the fellow; the pair might have been worth 2l. 5s., with the mould and key, but I should have sold this for 1l.</p>

I said I would should it to a person, and on the Sunday following I showed it to Mr. Puddle, who gave me 5s. for it; the prisoner is a helper in that yard - he told me he bought the pistol at the top of the yard.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Robert Plant's near the corner of the Haymarket. On the evening of the 15th of March the officer came to our shop with the prisoner, about eight o'clock, and I missed a pair of drab trousers, which I had seen on a small iron rail within the door, about an hour before - a person going by could reach them by stretching out his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not the Policeman ask you if you had lost any thing? A. Yes, and I said I did not know - he then said he saw them taken from the left side of the shop; I looked, and missed them; he told me the colour of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My friends have been to the prosecutor, and asked if he would take the money for the trousers, as it would be the means of my losing my work; the witness said his master told him if they brought the money he would take it, and my friends took 17s. 6d., and he said he would say the trousers were sold. Witness. Two young women called on the day after the prisoner was taken, and said they would pay for them on condition that I would not appear; I said Mr. Plant was not there, and I could not make any promise, but he would be there the next day; when he came, I told him, and he said they might leave the money if they liked, but I was not to compromise the matter; they then came, brought the money, and a stamped receipt; but I would not wirte any receipt, nor make any promise; I said I would not take the money on a promise not to a appear, but if I was called upon, I must go.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you keep the money? A. It lays in the till now; but I particularly expressed for them not to leave it, unless they pleased; but they wished to leave it, and they wished me not appear at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening in question I was going to my employer's, in Duke-street, to finish some work; as I was going down the Haymarket, a person ran violently against me, and knocked me down; the Policeman then came, took me to this shop, and said what you have heard.</p>

No- I saw you with this jacket; you were placing it under your own jacket, and when you saw me coming you threw it at me - I still pursued till you were taken - I did not say four or five persons came into the shop - I said only two; I saw the jacket go, but I did not see you take it - it has a tear where it was torn from the line it hung to; I was not quick enough to take you when you threw it at me.</p>

I said, "Don't deny it, for I have several witnesses who saw you take them, and if you don't give them up I will give charge of you" - he went up stairs, and brought the basket of tools down; he then dressed himself, and took them back with me to the public-house where he took them from - he set them down, and was detained.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you any witnesses who saw me take them? A. No, I believe not; it was a quarter-past six o'clock when they were lost - we stopped two or three times in going back, and gave him a glass of spirits, and had some ourselves; when I got back to Totteridge two witnesses said you might go, but you must wait till I came in - I stopped some distance behind; I said it was not my wish to prosecute, as I had got my tools - it was a servant at Mr. Paget's who induced me to prosecute.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.How did you come to suspect the prisoner? A. A gentleman's bailiff told us he saw such a person carrying a basket, and we got his address from the overseer and found him in the morning - it is nearly eleven miles from Totteridge to his house; I think he might have disposed of some of them - I think it impossible for another person to have removed the tools and placed them on the road-side, as I went out immediately; nd one had seen the prisoner near the house.</p>

Yes - I had not used my handkerchief while I was out; I used it at home, while I sat at supper - when I saw the three persons together, they were talking about the Duke of Wellington, and other things; the prisoner appears altered now - I observed them for full three quarters of an hour, but I did not see them do any thing but talk to each other, and I was very much surprised how my handkerchief could get from me, as I had a very large cloak on; I saw no action which led me to suppose they took it - I saw it again on the Wednesday afterwards (I believe;)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070036"/>when the Police-officer came to my house, and asked me if my name was Oram; I said Yes - he then asked if I had been robbed, and I said Yes.</p>

I know the prisoner - I had no transaction about silk with him till the 16th of March, when I purchased a duplicate of him; I redeemed the silk from Mr. Harrison. in Tottenham-court-road - I offered it for sale at Mr. Godwin's, and he detained it; I was to give the prisoner 25s. for the duplicate - I gave him 10s. in part; we made the bargain at his house - he had come to my house the day before, and asked my wife if I would buy it; Mr. Godwin's detained the same silk which I got for the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did not you go to Mr. Foot's, and give the name of Simmons? A. I went to Mr. Foot's with Mr. Godwin's servant, and did give the name of Simmons, though I knew I bought it of the prisoner; I went with the Police-officer, and waited for Simmons coming home - we waited at Mr. Brown's, the Turkish Slave, in Brick-lane, till nearly eight o'clock; we went to several other houses, and as we could not find Simmons, the officer looked my up - I had no doubt I bought the duplicate of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did he ever go by any other name than Robertson? A.Not that I know of; I stated I had it of Simmons because they took me in a moment, and I hardly knew what to say - I said that wherever the silk went I would go, as I had actually borrowed the money of my wife's mother; I should not have offered it for sale at Mr. Godwin's, No. 7. Tottenham-court-road, when I had only redeemed it at No. 5, if I had known it was stolen - it is worth 2s. 6d. a yard, and there is nearly sixty yards of it.</p>

            . I live in Little Somerset-street, Aldgate, and am a ginger-beer-maker. On the 6th of March I was going towards Aldgate, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and in my trying to catch him he fell down, and the handkerchief flew from his hand - the officer came, and took him; this was in Middlesex, before you get to the City stone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Coleman threw me down, and he said the handkerchief came out of my hat.</p>
               <p>LUKE COLEMAN. No, I said it was as if it came out of my bat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking home, and saw a man nning along; he dropped this handkerchief from behind him; a lady said, "That gentleman has dropped a handkerchief, pick it up, and take it to him" - I was running on, and this gentleman was crying Stop thief! I did not know it was his, or I would have given it to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it away from the door? A. No; you were walking when I saw you - you did not attempt to escape; you went back quietly; I said I did not wish to give you in charge, but merely that the officer should take you out of the arcade, and turn you about your business - I am sure it was my bag; I identified it at the office - it is not here, because the officer is not here.</p>

On the 28th of March I was taken to the watch-house, and saw this wax, which is now in Court - I believe it to be ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. You do not swear to the wax? A. No, no manufacturer can - we all have it in the same shape as this.</p>
               <p>JOHN HERRING. I am a Police-officer. On the 28th of March I met the two prisoners about nine o'clock at night; Tomkins had this wax when I met them - Bishop said to him, "Come along, come along;" He knew me, though I was in my private dress, but Tomkins did not; I then saw Tomkins give the wax to Bishop - they were then about one hundred yards from the prosecutors' premises; I took them into custody; Bishop had the wax then - in going to the station-house we passed the prosecutors' premises, and Bishop confessed he had stolen it from his masters', and very much wished me to let him call and leave it there - he said things would be all right.</p>

I was drinking with a friend, and got a little in liquor; I went home, and went to bed - I then got up again, and went with two or three more friends down to the Unicorn; Mrs. Duncan came there, and said something to me - she stopped drinking with me till the house was shut up; I then went home to her house, and went out for something more to drink before I was taken; when I came out with her and her sister she gave charge of me - I have her own sister outside, who will swear she took a half-sovereign from me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister-in-law. About three months ago I was going, through Shoreditch, and met the young woman he used to keep company with; she said, "If I could only find out a plan to get that thief out of the country" - I said, "Forget and forgive;" She said she never would, and once within seven years she would do for him - he had a good character, and I was astonished to hear her say so; she said she would not mind taking any one's life away so long as she could live - I never was here before; I could get my character where I have worked for nine years - I swear the prisoner has borne a good character; I heard that he fell into a misfortune about twelve months ago, but I cannot tell where he was tried - I did not speak to the family at that time; the person he lived with is worse than he is.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HURLEY. I have kept company with the prisoner six or eight months - his father, mother, and sister mustered up half a sovereign towards doing him good; I brought it to him, laid it under my pillow, and in the morning it was taken away by Duncan, my own sister, who is far worse than the prisoner is.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The officer knows when I was taken before I was innocent - I was only having a pint of beer in the house where a robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Dodd delivered in a written Defence, stating that she had met the prosecutor, who told her he had been robbed at the house, and would give her the watch to keep till morning, if allowed to accompany her home - that she was in search of him to return it when she was apprehended.</p>

On the 11th of March the prisoner and Moore were there in company with the prosecutor - a young woman came in with them; there was a quarrel, and blows passed between the prisoner and Moore - in the scuffle a square of glass was broken; the prisoner gave me the watch and appendages as security for the payment - I saw him take it off the prosecutor's neck, to which it was suspended by a chain; it was deposited till the damage was paid for - I saw the prisoner and Griffin go away together between six and seven o'clock; I do not know what became of Moore; they were all in liquor - they had drank more than they ought, but were able to take care of themselves - the prisoner came back in about an hour and a half, or two hours, and redeemed the watch; I am sure of his person - he told me the prosecutor was in the tilt guardroom, and had sent him for the watch; he paid me 2s. for the blind which was broken - I gave him up the watch.</p>

            . I am a pay-serjeant of the 4th company of Grenadier Guards. The prisoner belonged to that company - it was his duty to be in barracks, unless he had leave of absence, every night; he was absent from the 11th of March till the 16th - he did not sleep there; on his coming to barracks on the 16th, he was apprehended; I had paid him something on account on the 10th or 11th - it did not exceed 2s.; only 1s. or 2s. was due when he absented himself; Griffin was employed under the quarter-master, to clean the officers things, and wait on them, for which he had extra advantages - I knew he had saved money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was he paid in money or advantages? A. I cannot say; but he received full pay from me - he was quartered out of barracks; I saw him the day after this happened, and he stated that his watch had been obtained, and pawned against his consent - he did not tell me of his being knocked down, but he reported it at the order-room; I was not present.</p>

            . I am the prisoner and prosecutor's comrade. I got into their company about twelve o'clock at noon, at the North Pole, where Griffin was quartered - we went from there in a coach to the Greycoat Boy, with another comrade; there was a dispute there between Griffin, me, and the prisoner - blows passed between us, and a pane of glass was broken; Griffin's watch was left as security; he took it off his neck directly after - I left them in the house between six and seven o'clock, and saw no more; I had not seen any money lent to the prisoner -I was sensible when I left; I went to another public-house, got washed, and went to my barracks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If sensible, you can tell who began to quarrel first? A.Griffin and me - it was between us all three; I began to quarrel with Griffin, and the prisoner took his part - Griffin did not tell me next morning that he had been knocked down, and robbed of five sovereigns.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long Defence, stated that he had been to several public-houses with the prosecutor, and drank a considerable quantity of beer and spirits; that they afterwards went to St. Ann's-lane with Moore and two girls; a scuffle ensued at the Greycoat Boy, and the window and blind were broken - Moore had knocked the prosecutor down, and a gentleman told him (the prisoner) to take care of his watch, which he took off his neck, and gave to the landlord to mind, that they then returned to St. Ann's-lane, when the prosecutor sent him to fetch the watch; he pulled out his purse, and a sovereign and a half fell on the ground, and he gave him 3s. to pay the landlord for the window, telling him to say he was in the tilt guardroom, and could not come himself; that on returning to St. Ann's-lane, he was told the prosecutor had been turned out of the house, and had fallen down in the street, and that he pawned the watch, intending to redeem it as soon as he could.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hamptonwick, which is eight or nine miles from the prosecutor's, On the 18th of March I apprehended the prisoner at Hampton-wick, at work as a carpenter at a gentleman's -I searched his house with Newman, and found a small bit of bacon; we also searched the house of a man, named Cramp, a very little distance from the prisoner's house, and found some dresses in his box - we did not apprehend him - I searched for him afterwards, but he has absconded; I do not know whether he was acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you have been ever since endeavouring to find Cramp? A. I have.</p>

This appears to be part of the bacon I lost; it fits exactly with what was left behind - in our absence my brother had cut off a small rasher, but some part corresponds now; here is a piece I have brought from home, which corresponds with it - the dresses and things found at Cramp's are ours.</p>

About ten minutes to nine o'clock I was under the gateway of the Saracen's Head, and saw the prisoner walk past me very quick, with a box on his left shoulder - I heard a person call Stop thief! turned round, looked towards where he was running, and saw him fling the box off his shoulder; I took it up, took it to the yard, and afterwards to the watch-house, where I saw the prisoner, and was quite sure he was the man who threw it down.</p>

About a quarter-past two o'clock I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in company between King-street and West-street, against the wall - I ordered them away; the man said, "You go your way and I'll go mine," but both went towards Cow-lane, and I saw no more till I called half-past two o'clock - I then saw them in West-street, at the corner of Phoenix-court, in West-street; I passed them - the man had been drinking, but could walk well enough: I said nothing to them then, because they were off my beat, but before I got round to John's-court, my inspector came running, and saying "Where is that woman gone?" I did not see the prosecutor then, not till he got to the watch-house; I found the prisoner in a privy about one hundred yards from Phoenix-court, with the watch in her hand - she asked me where her friend was, and said he had given her the watch; I told her he was near at hand, and took her to the watch-house - she never loosed it out of her hand till she got there, and said again at the watch-house, that he had given it to her for an improper purpose; I do not recollect what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were they together about your beat? A. Why, half an hour or more - she would not give the watch up till it was taken from her; she told me all the way along that he gave it to her, and pointed him out as her friend.</p>

            . I heard Jessee Taylor talking to Herdsfield, and heard him say he was not certain Taylor was the boy who received the cap, as there were three or four boys together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you here? A. I was in company with Taylor - I know Herdsfield was a witness for the prosecution; he was not asked in my hearing if he had seen it taken from any body - he was not asked if the boy had had the cap taken from him; I am a paper-atainer, and live in Long-alley - Taylor's brother called on me today, and I came here with him to bear him company.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for the last twelve months, and for the last few months he slept in my house - my wife was confined about a month before he was taken, and in consequence of that he slept in my room; on Sunday night, the 20th of February, his bed and mine were about half a yard from each other, but he put his clothes on one side of his bed, and I mine on the other side - on the Monday morning I got up about half-past six o'clock, and between eight and nine I examined my trousers pockets, and then found but 14s. 6d. in them - I knew I had 16s. 6d. in them the night before; I had taken 3s. or 4s. that morning, so that I should have had about 1l. in my pocket; in consequence of this, I marked fifteen or sixteen penny-pieces, which I put into a desk in my room below, with some others - there were 4s. worth put up in shilling piles, and five over, all penny-pieces - seventeen of them were marked; four in cash of the shilling piles, and one in the 5d.; I locked my desk, put the key into my pocket, and the next morning, between six and seven o'clock, I went to it again - I found it locked; the key of the room in which the desk was had been in my sister-in-law's possession; the door had been double locked that night - on opening the desk I missed fifteen or sixteen penny-pieces, and five or six of them were those I had marked; the prisoner could not have got to that room in the night, but in the daytime he frequently had his meals there; he could not have got the key of the desk; I never left it unlocked - when I missed the money, I sent for Mr. Wayling, the officer; he searched the prisoner, found some copper money on him, and among the rest three penny-pieces, which I could swear to - he also found some silver, and eight sovereigns on him; I have a stable to my house; I saw the officer find some copper between the joists and the brick-work, and among them two which I could speak to, as I had marked them - the prisoner was almost always in that stable; I allowed him 4s. a week with board and lodging; he could not have saved these eight sovereigns - I suppose I have lost 40l. in all; I have lost form 1s. 6d. to 8s. or 10s. a day; when the prisoner had been with me some months, he purchased a seal of me, for which he was go give me a guinea, and he agreed to pay me 1s. a week; he paid me the first week, and the second week he gave me a sovereign; I asked where he got it, and he said some person had paid him some money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Who kept the key of the room the desk was in? A. My sister-in-law, but I kept the key of the desk; the prisoner used to go out with my horse and cart, and carry out goods - he very rarely paid money for me; I do not know that he ever did - he has received money; my desk has not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070051"/>left open for three or four months, as I had lost so much money - I think no one but the prisoner and myself had access to the stable; it was not locked, but no one could go to it without going through the shop.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-constable. I went with Mr. Cox to his house on the 22nd of February; I took the prisoner into custody - I went into the stable, and there told him to empty his pockets, and produce what he had about him; he pulled out two half-crowns, a sixpence, and six penny-pieces - three of them had a cross on the head, as Cox had described to me before I got to the house; I asked the prisoner how he came by them, and he said he had taken them at different public-houses, but he could not tell where - I then asked if he had any thing else about him; he said No, but I searched, and found a small lump in some black stuff - I found in it eight sovereigns; he said they were what he had saved from his wages - I then searched the stable, and on one of the rafters I found a watch; I asked if that was his - he said Yes, and alongside the watch I found ten penny-pieces: I asked if they were his - he said they were, and two of them were marked as Mr. Cox had described; I asked the prisoner how he got them - he said at different public-houses; I then searched his box, and found plenty of good clothes, another watch, and a new dressing-case, which I am confident cost 30s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did his master claim the dressing-case or the sovereigns? A. No. I found plenty of keys on the prisoner, but none that fitted the desk - I had to hunt to find the penny-pieces; he made no hesitation in producing the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. COX. Q. Did you mark these penny-pieces yourself? A. Yes, in the presence of my sister - they are all marked in the same way, with a cross; they have been in the possession of the officer ever since he took them: I can safely take my oath this is the money I marked - I never paid the prisoner any money that I had marked; I never marked any before - they were all marked on the head side, but I have not had them since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What money did you miss from the desk? A.Sixteen penny-pieces, I think.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was going along the street? A. Yes, and seemed surprised when I found it.</p>

On the night of the 16th of March I was on duty, and saw the prisoner about a quarter-past nine o'clock, in the rear of Lyons-terrace, Knightsbridge; he was coming into Knightsbridge from the fields - this was about fifty yards from where the portmantean was missed; he had nothing with him; but I saw this portmanteau against the wall in the field from which he had come - he was walking when I first saw him - I followed him; I saw a woman named Howard, who directed me in my pursuit, and I took the prisoner on the opposite side of the way, about forty yards from where I first saw him - he tried to get away from me; I laid down the portmanteau, and told Howard to mind it while I secured the prisoner, but it was in my sight all the time.</p>

On the 8th of March the prisoner came to the shop - she asked for black ribbon, and I served her with two yards; she then asked for some wide net, but did not buy any of that - I had shown her the box, in which the lace and net were - she then asked for some lace-caps, and she bought one of them - she then asked for some lace, and bought three yards of that, out of the box I showed her - she paid me 7s. 1 1/2d. for what she bought, and went away; a short time after she was gone another customer came in, who asked for some wide net - I took down the box, and missed a piece of figured net, I think about three yards - it was in the same box as I had previously shown to the prisoner; I had not shown it to any other person - while I was serving that customer the prisoner came in again; I went to her - she said she wanted half a yard more of lace, the same as she had bought of me, as her sister said there was not enough to trim a cap - I cut off half a yard for her, and while I was doing that I saw her take two cards of lace, and put them into her pocket; I went round the counter, took hold of her and said, "You have taken two cards of lace;" she put her hand into her pocket, took out the lace, and said, "Here is your lace, I don't want to steal it;" we sent for the officer, and she was detained -I gave the lace to the officer then - there are nineteen yards of it, it is worth 19s.; they are Mr. Nunn's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Is this a large shop? A. A middle-sized shop; there are three young persons in it besides myself - she had a cloak on; I missed a piece of net from the box, which was the reason I left my customer to go to her - she said she was a widow, and had seven children; she gave it into my hand directly I accused her of taking it - I did not let her go, because we have lost so much - I was behind the counter when I saw her take it; I am quite sure it was in her pocket - she was forced to put her cloak on one side to get it out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How are the cellars separated from the house? A. There are two steps from the kitchen door to the cellar - a noise from the cellar might not be heard in the house; the house is in the square.</p>

             re-examined Q. How far is the place at which Mrs. Phillips states she lives, from where you saw the prisoner? A. About five minutes' walk, and the place I saw him at is about twenty minutes' walk from the prosecutor's - it wanted a little more than a quarter to seven o'clock when I saw him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.What is the depth of the area? A.About six feet, and the rails are about three feet - the door of the cellar was propped open with a very high tub; I think one person might have got these things over one at a time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

            . I live in Rochester-terrace - the prosecutor works with me. On the night of the 28th of March we went to the Jolly Millers public-house, in Millbank-street - we left at near eleven o'clock; he was rather tipsy; not very tipsy - we afterwards went to another public-house in Peter-street; we there had something more - we went to a friend of his in New Peter-street, but had nothing there; he was quite tipsy at the public-house in Peter-street - I saw the prisoner at the Jolly Millers, and she went with us to the public-house in Peter-street - the prosecutor said, in Rochester-row, that he had lost his watch; the prisoner was by, and she said, "The watch is all right;" I afterwards saw it in the constable's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What did she say in answer to his saying he had lost his watch? A. She said he had left it at the public-house for half a pint of gin, and it was all right - she did not offer to go away, but persuaded him to come on, and go home; I did not hear the prisoner advise him to leave his watch at the public-house till morning, as he was tipsy; but I will not swear it did not pass - I was a little elevated, but could take care of myself.</p>

Yes, I will - she did not tell me I had had quite enough to drink, and I had better leave my watch there; I went to Peter-street to see a friend, a distant relation; I had a job for him - Mr. Darling and his son were with me, and this woman would make herself bold to go in, and sit down, which I would not have done for 5s.; I did not go there to borrow 5s. on my watch - I was rather short, and I said, "I wish you would let me have 5s.; on my watch;" but that was only in a bit of a game; he did not let me have it, but if I had been sober, I might have had the money in a moment - I distinctly swear I did not give her the watch to hold; I had seen my watch about half an hour before I missed it - I did not stop as I went along - it was not a frosty night, but I fell down.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I saw the prosecutor in Millbank-street: he and some other persons were having a glass of liquor, and they would make me have a glass - we then went to another public-house in Peter-street; he wanted 5s. on his watch, and the landlord would not let him have any more - he then went to a friend of his, and wanted the money on the watch; the woman would not let him have it; he then went out, fell down, and his friend took his watch, and gave it him - he fell down again, and asked me if I would take him home; I said,"You had better go to your wife;" he gave me his watch; I gave it to his friend, and he gave it to the Policeman - it was not taken from me.</p>

He sometimes came occasionally, and sometimes more regularly - he sometimes came for a day or two, sometimes for a few hours; and when he was out of a situation. I have employed him for a fornight - these pieces of leather are worth about 6d. each; he did not say any thing to me about mending his shoes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you pay him? A. If he worked a day I paid him 5s., and for an hour I paid him 6d.; he was at that time working for another person, and had for a fortnight, but used to work over hours at night for me.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the day in question; he came through my place which is like a thoroughfare - my house is at the corner of an alley, leading to New-court, and the private door is as public as the shop door - you go through a covered way; the stairs are on the left-hand side as you go through - I suppose ten persons had been through there within half an hour of the time the prisoner came; when the prosecutor came in, he first said it was a book, then he runimaged his pocket, and said it was a purse - my daughter found the purse on the stairs; I am quite sure she picked it up, and gave it into the prosecutor's hand - he shook the prisoner, and the prisoner drew himself back, and said he would not be shaken by him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live up stairs? A. No, I keep the ground floor - my daughter is thirteen years of age; I have lived fifteen or sixteen years in London, and am the mother of six children; I never picked up a purse before - I never saw the prisoner or the prosecutor before; I did not cry "halves" - the prosecutor said he thought the prisoner's hand had been in his pocket; there was no other man in the place at that moment - the prisoner was standing by the prosecutor, and the prosecutor took hold of him and shook him; the prosecutor said it was his purse - I did not go before the Magistrate; I was not sent for - the prisoner did not stop in the passage till the prosecutor stopped him; he was going through pretty quick, as all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070058"/>persons do - he said the prosecutor was mistaken, and begged he would let him go about his business, as he was deceived in the person; there was no person on the stairs: a great many people go through - it is not a regular thoroughfare.</p>

            . I am daughter of the last witness. I saw a scuffle on the 1st of March, and my mother called me to get a light to look about the passage, and the stairs - I found he pause, and gave it to the prosecutor, who had hold of the prisoner; I am sure the prisoner did not pick up the purse - I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who threw the purse there? A. I do not know; I was at my tea - my mother went forward first, and then called me to get a light to see if I could find a purse or a book, or any money - I looked on the stairs, and found a long purse with money in it; I could not find it without a light - the prosecutor said it was his purse; I saw the prisoner there - he kneeled down, and prayed for forgiveness.</p>

            . I had information of this; on the evening the prisoner was taken I saw him knock Terry down; I went up to him; he said he would go quietly if he knew what he was taken for; I said it was for stealing a cask of white lead, and he must go to the station - he said if that was the case he must go to the Compter, not to the station, as that was a City job.(Prisoner's Defence, written.) On the 21st day of February last I was in Smithfield, when, from a cart which was passing. I saw a cask fall; I immediately took the cask up, and was about to heave it into the cart again, when the driver of the cart came to me, struck me a violent blow on the back with the butt end of his whip, and at the same time accused me with having stolen the cask; I, being fearful of the consequences of such a charge, certainly did, in my confusion, drop the cask, and make off as fast as I possibly could. About eighteen or twenty days after this, being present at a street quarrel, a constable who was there took me into custody, and the driver of the cart came forward to Hatton-garden Police-office, and preferred this charge against me.</p>

            . On the 5th of March, in the evening, I saw the prisoner take this scale from the front of my shop - he stood outside, and took it; I knew him before - he ran towards his own house; I ran after him, calling Stop thief! and asked a man to stop him - he then threw it at me, and asked me to forgive him; he looked at me when he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not tell Mrs. Higgs that you did not see me take it? A. No - she saw you with it, and called Stop thief!</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THWAITES. I heard the prosecutrix crying Stop thief! saw the prisoner running, and collared him with the scale - he threw it down, and made great resistance; I held him till the Policeman came - he then said he had picked it up, and asked the prosecutrix to forgive him- she said, "I am sorry for you, but you are in the hands of the Police."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you the man had run round the corner? A. When he got to the station he said a man ran round the corner, and he had picked up the scale.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live opposite the prosecutrix - I went out for some candles, and as I crossed the road I saw a man take the scale, and run off - he threw it down, I took it up, and was going to take it to her.</p>

In August, while she was with me, I missed a gold ring; I suppose it was taken from my bed-room, but am not certain where it was - I inquired about it, but could hear nothing of it till the day after she had left; I then had information, and found it in Beer's possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you had an excellent character with her? A. Yes; since I have discovered this, the prisoner informs me another ring was missing, and had been stolen by another servant, but we have since found that.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BEER. I keep a tripe-shop, in Duke's-row, Pimlico. I have known the prisoner two or three years - she gave me this ring last summer, and told me she had just picked it up near Blenheim-steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You knew her well? A. Yes - she bore a good character.</p>
               <p>MARY SMITH. I am the prosecutor's servant. The prisoner was there before me - I have seen this ring on my master's finger; I saw it in the prisoner's hand, on Sunday, the 29th of August; she took it out of the drawer in master's bed-room - she afterwards told me she had given it to Beer, who came to the house to visit her sometimes - my master spoke about the ring on the Sunday evening, before I knew about it - I did not tell him when I saw her with it; I was afraid it would cause words in the house, and I should lose my place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.She tells me you gave her the ring to sell? A.It is false; she said she was going to give it away - I did not tell of it, because I have been in the habit of speaking to the young men in master's shop, and I was afraid she would tell mistress of it, and that would cause words - I have lived there ten months; there had been no words about another ring - I did not take any ring; she mentioned about that, because she knew it was lost.</p>
               <p>MR. CLAPP. I was in the habit of wearing this ring I often put it on the drawers and dressing-table; both the servants would be in the habit of seeing it from day to day- it was the prisoner's duty to make the beds; the other servant is nurse-maid.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you accused Smith with having men into your house? A. No, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was not on Sunday; she came down to me on Wednesday morning, and said, "Charlotte, I have had a ring in my pocket three or four days, and you might sell it for me;" I said, "I dare not, as I might be taken on suspicion," and when I went out I gave it to Beer - she said I went out on Sunday, but I never saw him on Sunday - she took the ring out of the drawer herself.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BEER. She gave it to me in the middle of the week.</p>

I think it was an old gown, and put it between her feet, on the floor - the Policeman said, "What have you got there?" she said, Nothing that belongs to my mistress;" he then took hold of it, opened it, and the two watched and brooch fell out - the man in the room said"No stranger has done this, you must be the person;" the Policemen said they must take her - I begged they would not, but they took her to the watch, she put her things loosely into her box, and went away with the key - a pair of silk stockings, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of under stockings, were found in her box, while she stood there - they were under the bundle the watches were wrapped in; the watches and all the things had been in my son James room, in a drawer - the Policeman came next morning, and asked if I missed any thing, I said, "Yes, a bit of silk," and I thought the paper, it had been in, laid in her bed-room - he fetched her key, and the silk was found at the bottom of her box, under the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. What day of the week was this? A. Tuesday - she was acquitted yesterday of stealing the silk, and I then preferred this indictment; it was the fault of the persons at Hick's-hall that this bill was not found before - I should not have gone up stairs if she had not told me the door was open; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - she once brought me a brooch of my son's which she found; she was going to leave me on the Friday.</p>

            . I live at Wisbeach, in Cambridgeshire. I came to town on Friday, the 18th of March, and about ten o'clock that evening I met Morris in Bishopsgate-street- I looked very earnestly at her; she came back to me, and after some conversation, took me to a house in <placeName id="t18310407-108-crimeloc604">Gun-alley</placeName>

Bank note, and a 5l. Wisbeach note - (none of them have been found;) Morris returned to the room, and laid on the bed a little while - I did not feel her pick my pocket; she called out some name, and Christian came into the room - Morris then jumped up, and ran away; I immediately felt, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070063"/>missed my money and notes - I told 
               <persName id="t18310407-108-person954">Christian</persName>
             I was robbed, she said, "Not you;" I said "I am of 32l." I went out of the house, and saw another woman at an up stair window - she came down; I told her the same - she went up again, and then an old woman came halfway down the passage, and began had using "Murder! he says he is robbed;" a parcel of Jews and people then came up, and I ran away, but when I got to the top of the passage two of them knocked my hat off, and I ran out of the passage; I saw two respectable women standing at the corner, and asked them the name of the place - they said Sandyhill; I wrote that down, and went to the station in Spitalfields - I was directer there; I returned from there with Pillington - we found Christian that might at a chandler's-shop; she was taken into custody, and next day Waters and I went to the house I was robbed at, and found Morris up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You say you were not drunk? A. No; I had breakfasted on the road from Birmingham, and had tea at my aunt's - I had no dinner; I drank nothing on the road - I got to London about two o'clock, and had part of two pints of porter at my cousin's in Houndsdrich; I had no gin before I met them - I went to no gin-shop with them; I drank only two glasses at the house - I know the money was safe when I went on the bed, and directly Morris was gone I missed it; my trousers were not off - they were down, the notes could not have fallen out of my fob - I did not unfold the notes in the room, but I had seen them at Birmingham the day before, and am certain I put the same bundle into my fob in her room - they had before been in a pocket-book in my side pocket; I never said I put them into my great coat - the Policeman took me to a room where there was a woman in bed - he said, "Is this her?" I said I could not tell till she got out of bed, and when she was up I said she was not; I was never in London but twice before - the woman who kept the house was at Worship-street, and asked a few questions; I was about half an hour with the prisoners - Morris had a bonnet on; I remarked her features particularly - I positively swear they are the two- I have not expressed a doubt of it.</p>

            , of Hornchurch. On the 10th of February, I had a load of hay to take to Mr. Nuttman's, in the Borough, and just as I got into Tooley-street, I saw the prisoner look at another carter's note, who was going on before me; he then came to me, took my note out of my hand, and looked at it - he said, "You are going to Mr. Nuttman's - both to one place." I went and delivered my hay at Nuttman's, which is a little further on, and received from him two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, two sixpences, and a shilling - he returned one truss, which was bad; I met the prisoner again as I came back, coming down the new arch of London-bridge- he said, "You have been gone a long while;" I said,"Yes, I had to stop in the yard, as Mr. Nuttman was not ready to unload;" he asked how the load of grass hay un<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070064"/>loaded - the first load was grass hay; I said I did not know, for it was not unloaded when I came away - he asked if his father was at home; I supposed he meant Mr. Nuttman and said Yes he was - he then left me, and I went on; he came to me again as I came over London-bridge, and on the London side he touched me on the arm and said, "My father has paid you for that pay;" I said Yes he had - he said, "I have paid Mr. Gardner for the hay, up in the market before I came away you give me the money, and I will give you a note to Mr. Gardner to take back;" I can not read writing but know figures(looking at a paper) this is the paper he gave me - it has the figures 3l 5. and 6 on it; I had no other paper besides that - Gardner had given me a paper, which I gave Mr. Nuttman; I gave the prisoner 3l. 2s. - I told him I had not got 3l. 5s. as Mr. Nuttman returned one truss; I had no other money - he said, "My father will make it all right with Mr. Gardner next market day;" he asked if his father had given me any thing - I said No. and he gave me 6d. for drink for myself; he went away with the money, and I saw no more of him - I have paid Mrs.

             the money; I was quite sober - it was one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not your mistress believe your story? A. Yes; such a thing never happened to me before; I took the paper to Mr. Gardner, thinking to receive the money from him, but he told me it was lost - I did not ask any body to read the paper before I gave the prisoner the money; I never saw him before - I sometimes bring hay to town once a month, and sometimes not for twelve months; I have been up six or seven times - I am twenty-seven years old; I never parted with any money before; I took so much notice of the prisoner's face, that I am certain of him; I never said I knew him because he was blind with one eye - I knew his face; I did not notice his dress - he had a short coat on, with a cape to it, and a black hat.</p>
               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. You looked at his face? A. Yes; I had seen him twice before he got the money - I am still in Mrs. Tyler's service, and have been so nearly three years - I saw the prisoner again in a fortnight.(Paper read.)</p>
               <p>Pay back to Mr. Nuttman's son the sum of 3l. 5s. 6d., having received the sum of him.</p>

Clare-market - he asked if I knew a person named Thomas, a porter; I said,"Not by name, but most likely I know the person;" I then asked if he wanted any porter's work done, as I should be glad of the job; he said that man had been engaged in moving some goods; I asked what they were; he said some pier-glasses, and other things, which were to be removed from Chancery-lane to Mr. Macklin's, in Clare-street; I said I could undertake the job, and provide blankets and other things, which I knew were wanted; he went with me to my house, and a large basket, a shawl, and three blankets were produced - I put them into the basket, and went immediately with him towards Chancery-lane; as we were going along, he asked if I knew of a good stout lad, which would be a great acquisition, to get the job done quickly - when we got to the end of Bream's-buildings, he took the basket from me, put it on a man's head who stood there, and he said to me, "You wait here, and as this man comes down, you take the things, and pack them up;" I waited there nearly an hour - I then saw the other man; I said to him, "What have you done with our master;" he said,"He turned the corner, and I saw nothing more of him;" but that was the man who had the things when they left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070067"/>me - I met the prisoner in Old-street on the Monday following; I took him by the collar, and held him till I got an officer; he said what could I do with him, that I only lent him the things, and there was no law in that - I gave him in charge.</p>

            . On the 10th of February I was at my own door, No. 102, Saffron-hill; I saw this little boy - a man had hold of his hand, who had a black coat on, very much worn, and the child had an orange in his hand; about twenty-five minutes afterwards I saw the same child in the Policeman's hands; I cannot swear to the man who had the child, but I can to the child - he was crying when I first saw him, and was very well dressed; when I saw him again he had nothing on but his shirt, pinafore, and shoes - I said I knew it was the same child I had seen about two o'clock; my attention was drawn to the child more than to the man.</p>

               <p>JAMES BROWN. I am a Police-officer. I received information, and had been looking for the prisoner - I found him on the 24th of February, in the custody of Mrs. Legrove, in Long-alley: I asked where he lived - he said at Chingford; I asked if he knew any thing about the charge - he said No, that he had been stopped by the woman before, but the little boy could not swear to him (that was the youngest child); I then took him to the back parlour of the public-house adjoining the office, where there were from a dozen to fourteen persons - I sent for little Armstrong, and told him to go and look in the back parlour, and see if he could pick out any person there who took away little Jemmy Legrove; he went into the room, looked all round, fixed his eyes on the prisoner, and said, "This is the man that took little Jemmy up Hill-street," and he said the coat he had on had three marks on it - when I took the prisoner he had this light coloured great coat on, which has three capes to it; and a pair of overalls, buttoned outside down to the legs - I found on him two knives, one of which I have found a witness who can swear to; I have made inquiry, and found the prisoner had taken off this great coat, and left it at a stall, and that he bought an orange at a stall where there were three women sitting.</p>

On Sunday, the 6th of March, I was in a coffee-shop - the prisoner's sister came in there; I went with her home to the prisoner's lodgings, in <placeName id="t18310407-128-crimeloc711">Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me half a crown, about eleven o'clock, to fetch some breakfast things? A. You fetched some half-and-half and steaks.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GRIMSDALE. I was at the coffee-shop with the prosecutor; the prisoner's sister was there - we went home with her, and had some half-and-half and some gin- we were there from eleven o'clock till about three; we had not been in bed the night before - we had been the worse for liquor open night, but we sad got sober in the morning - I did not make the sister any compliment, or take any liberty with her; she asked as to go and have breakfast, and we went - we had only been in one public-house the night before; we staid there till eleven o'clock- we then stopped - a bit about the street, and at four o'clock we went to the coffee-shop. I saw the prosecutor had a sovereign in the purse about ten or half-past ten on the Saturday night - I was sitting by the fire when he accused the prisoner of stealing in purse; he took her by the thrown - I saw no sovereign, but assisted in taking the crown and two sixpences out of her hand.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BROOKS. I live with Mr. Shillitoe, at Tottenham. On the 14th of March I lived at Laytonstone - I came to town that day, and at eleven o'clock at night, I fell in with two women, who asked me for something to drink; I said I had no objection to give something, but I did not like to go to a public-house so late at night - they said I could go to their apartment; I went with them, and sat down, and being very much fatigued, I fell asleep between eleven and twelve o'clock - I then had 1l. 15s. about me, and my watch; I awoke, I should think, a little after twelve o'clock - my watch was gone, and the two women also; this was on Monday night - I walked down stairs, and stood at the door till I saw a constable; I told him what had happened - I had not given the girls any thing; the constable told me to stand at the door while he got a light - we then went up stairs, and found the prisoner in bed in another room, not above six or seven steps from the room I had been in; she appeared to be asleep when we went in, but I believe she was awake - the constable said he never meddled with any bed clothes, but he looked round the room, and saw nothing - she was taken afterwards, but I was not in London then.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was called in by a pawnbroker on the 15th of March, to take the prisoner, who was offering this watch - I asked her who gave it her; she told me her husband; but in less than five minutes she said she had no husband, but that her sister's husband gave it her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GILES. I am a pawnbroker in the Commercial-road. On the 15th of March the prisoner came in with this watch, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock- I looked at her, and asked some question, to which she gave me very unsatisfactory answers; she first said she brought it from one person, and then another; I sent for the officer, and gave her in charge - I advertised the watch twice, and the owner came forward.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of cleaning and doing for this woman, and she told me if I found her door open to lock it and take out the key; I went into the room that night, turned down the bed, and there was the watch; I took it away, and did not hear any thing of it till the next day - my place was not safe to keep such a thing, and I took it to pawn; the gentleman must have been in bed with one of them, or his watch could not have been under the bolster.</p>

            . I am a constable at the London-docks. On the 29th of March I was on duty at the London-dock western gate, and about ten o'clock I received information that Goodchild was coming up with his cart loaded with wool; he came up, and presented me a pass for eight bales of wool, from No. 3 warehouse - I said, "Stop your horses," and he did; I said, "Did you load this cart?" he said Yes - I said, "Did you tie the bales on?" he said Yes; I said, "Have you any thing in the cart more than you ought to have?" he said No, not that he knew of - I then got on the top of the bales of wool, and found this bag of wool thrust down between the two top bales, and covered over with a tilt; I should not have seen it unless<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070071"/>I had searched for it - one of the top bales had been cut, and a quantity of wool had been taken out; I took a sample of the wool in the bag and in the bale, and it corresponds exactly - I said to Goodchild, "You see this bag - what have you to say?" he said he was innocent of it, and it must have been put in while he went to get his pass.</p>

            . Q. Did you go off to give information, leaving these two men in the cart? A. Yes; of course I lost sight of them - the other man might have gone off with the little bag.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBINSON. I am clerk to Messrs. Meyer and Joseph Taueman - they live in Bishopsgate-street, and are general merchants. We employed the two prisoners to get the load from the London-docks - they are in the employ of Vestry and Cobley; I saw the bales, and there was a deficiancy of 13 lbs, in one of them, but there had been a sample taken out, and there was some loose wool in the cart, which might probably have been dropped in plundering; I saw the prisoners at the docks that morning, waiting with the cart - I went to the docks again about eleven o'clock, and then the information was given me; the bale had been cut and tora across, right in the middle - I have had a good deal to do with wool, and I have no doubt that these are both the same wool.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What kind of wool is it? A. German wool; it is not all of this quality - I would not venture to swear to it twenty or thirty miles off.</p>
               <p>Sermon's Defence. I had been speaking to Goodchild, and that is all.</p>
               <p>Goodchild's Defence. I loaded the eight bales, and left my cart to get my pass; when I was driving away the officer came and asked what I had in my cart - I said eight bales of wool; he said, "Any thing else?" I said, "Not to my knowledge;" he said, "I must look:" I said, "You are welcome" - he found this bag, and said, "How did this come in?" I said, "I don't know - it must have been put in by some one while I was getting my pass."</p>

On the 26th of March I went into a public-house, with a basket containing the articles stated - I only called to take my supper beer home to my children; two women followed me into the house, and followed me out - I believe the prisoner was one; I took my beer, went out, and forgot my basket - I went back, and it was gone; I did not hear of it till the Tuesday following, and this was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>MARY HILL. I live in Foster's-buildings. The prisoner's sister lodged with me upwards of two years - the prisoner came backwards and forwards to see her, and sometimes slept there; the prisoner came on the 27th of March, and said her husband had bought a pair of shoes and stockings for her girl, which were too short for her; she asked me to buy them - I said I did not want them, but took them; I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COLLIER. I am a Police-constable. I went to the prisoner's sister on the Tuesday morning - I found the prisoner there, and asked her if she had been at the Plough on Saturday evening - she said she had not; I then asked if she knew any thing of a basket taken from there - she said No, but on searching the room I found this basket hanging on a nail; I showed it to the prosecutor's son, who said it was his father's - I opened it, and found a shoe and a strap; I then asked the prisoner what had become of the other pair of shoes - she said she knew nothing of them, that was all that was in the basket.</p>
               <p>JAMES GLIBBERY. I am a Police-officer. I asked the prisoner how she came by this basket - she said, "I found it outside the door;" I said, "There was some other property;" she said, "No, there was no other property," but after some time she said, "Well, I did take it, and sold the property to Mrs. Hill."</p>

             - we live in Andrew cottage, Hornsey-road. On the 19th of February I put this property into the basket - it was put into a cart to go to Ely-place, Holborn; the boy who drove the cart is not here - it was a square cart, without a tilt, but about three feet deep; I was in the cart, and saw the basket safe about five minutes before it was taken - it could not have fallen out; the tail-board was up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live with my father, who keeps the Five Inkhorns public-house, in Shoreditch; I was returning home, and saw this in the road; I took it up; when the officer took me I said I did not know what I had got; I deny that I whistled, and who dropped it I do not know.</p>

In Great St. Andrew's-street - I saw him running with the boots in his right hand, about forty yards from me; he threw them from him - there were many people pursuing him, but the prisoner threw the boots away; he was a head - it is a crowded part, but he was running alone; I will swear positively I saw him throw away the boots, and I pursued him through tcourt into Queen-street.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

             MORRISON. I am a special constable. On the evening of the 25th of February I called at a public-house, and received some information - I went out with an officer, and saw the two prisoners; I went and looked into the prosecutor's window - one of the prisoners came and looked me in the face; he then went and joined his companion on the other side - I gave notice to the Police-constable; I followed, took Thompson, and in his jacket pocket I found these two books, but nothing on Lawrence - I had seen them both near the prosecutor's shop, but did not see either of them go in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did Thompson say that the other gave him the books? A. He did not, in my hearing.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DRANE. I was with Morrison, but I stood a little back - I saw Thompson look into his face, then go and join his companion on the other side; they then went on to the corner of Norris-street, where they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Thompson in the shop? A. No. nor the other - Thompson did not say that the other gave him the books.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DUTTON. I saw the two prisoners together near the prosecutor's, but did not see either of them go in.</p>
               <p>MR. STOCKDALE. These books are mine - I know I had such on my counter; they were bound to a particular binding for a gentleman that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not this a common sort of binding? A. Yes, but these had been some time in the house, and were a little soiled - we have not sold any of these for some years; they were withdrawn from circulation.</p>
               <p>Thompson received a good character.</p>

               <p>JAMES BOON. I live with Mr. Sadd. I was at home when the wine was brought by the prisoner and two tacklemen - the prisoner took two empty baskets out of the winecellar, and wanted to leave one in, but my young master took it out; he then came up, and told me to go down and mind the men - I went down: the prisoner said, "Put these two baskets up the flap," and I tried to do it, but they would not go up - the prisoner then took an empty basket, went into the wine-cellar with it, put two bottles in, and tied it up: I did not see what he did in the cellar, as the door shut immediately after him - he came out and tied it up; I suspected there was something in it - I went out, and told my master; the prisoner threw it up to be put into the cart, and my young master went and took it - I swear it was an empty basket when he took it into the cellar.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was no straw in the basket? A. Yes, there was a little he put in - I could not possibly swear it was my master's wine; I told the Magistrate the prisoner took the basket into the cellar, but I did not say I saw him put the wine into it - my master had been holding a candle, but he had gone up to the bar, and sent me down.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. SADD. Q. Did you speak to the other two men about the wine that was in the basket? A. I do not recollect that I did - Boon said he saw the prisoner go into the cellar with the basket, and the other two men said they would attend if they were wanted; it was the other men put the basket into the cart from the flap.</p>

I was in the wine-cellar putting away the champaigne - Mr. Sadd was holding the light, and the two men stood alongside the binn where they suppose this wine came from; this hamper was tied because it had no binges, but who tied it I do not know - I never went out of the cellar; the porters handed the baskets out, I never touched them - I valued my situation, where I had worked eleven years, more than to do that; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070075"/>into the cellar as the place was nearly up to our knees in water, and I put the basket against the door that I might see with the light where to get the wood - I came out with two pieces of wood and the basket, which I put down against the cellar-door; the two porters were in the cellar the whole time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it with the intention of robbing him - I went to get some tea and sugar; I got a drop of ale, and fell asleep.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You never saw him till he was in custody? A. No; this is the Fire-office prosecution; I did not send 10l. up in a letter, nor did any body, to my knowledge - none of my ricks or barns have been burnt down yet; they were all safe when I came away.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CRAKANTHORP. I belong to the General Post-office, in London. This letter bears the post-mark of the 10th of March.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHEPHERD. I am a deliverer of letters in the country. This letter came to our office at Bicester, and I delivered it at the house of Mr. Parker on the 11th of March.</p>
               <p>THE REV. HALLIFIELD COSGOYNE O'DONNUGHUE. I am a clergyman. The prisoner was employed by me for about three months, to copy manuscripts; I have had frequent opportunities of seeing him write, and know his hand-writing - to the best of my knowledge and belief, this letter is his hand-writing; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where do you live? A. I am curate of High Wycomb, Bucks. I have not been in any trouble lately - I was discharged under the Insolvent Debtors' Act, about two years ago; the prisoner was not a creditor of mine at any time, except for his labour from time to time - the last time I had employed him was in June or July last year; I had other persons engaged in copying at the same time - when this letter was first put into my hands I had nothing else put into my hands with it, but I had brought a sheet of his writing with me that as there had been a lapse of some months I might compare it, or I do not think I could have spoken to it, at least I could not have spoken decidedly as to my belief -I had had no dispute with the prisoner about payment till just as I was leaving London, and he had not given me credit for some small sums which I had paid him - there was some dispute about those claims, but I paid him previous to leaving London, about June or July; there is nothing now claimed to be due to him, that I have heard of - his wife washed for me, and the two accounts were mixed up together, and rather than have any dispute I settled the whole; I did not think I owed him so much, and I think so still - I have no unfriendly feeling towards him, and if the Court permitted I could show that I have not, by my subsequent conduct; I do not know how they found me out - I received an application from the solicitor of the fire-office, and I attended; if I had not had the opportunity of making the comparison I spoke of I could not have spoken so positively as I now do, to my belief of his hand-writing- when the letter was first shown to me I said it was not the hand in which he wrote for me, but in a more general scrawling hand, as he had taken pains when he wrote for me; I would not have sworn to its being his hand-writing at that distance of time, but for the comparison which I made.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What did you do with it when it was shown to you? A. I hesitated a considerable time about it, not from doubt, but looking at the consequence it might be to the prisoner if I gave a rash or hasty answer; the prisoner was not a sufferer by me, or a creditor on my schedule - I never had any difference with him of any nature, sort, or kind, which would induce me to seek to do him any injury.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have stated that without this comparison you could not have sworn to your belief, but when you saw the paper now produced what was your belief as to the character of the hand-writing? A.Generally speaking I thought it his, but not with the certainty to swear to it - the impression upon my mind when it was produced was, that it was the hand-writing of the prisoner; if I had been asked as to my belief whether it was the hand-writing of the prisoner, or not upon its first production, and none of those important consequences had attached to it which I have spoken of, I should unquestionably have said it was the hand-writing of the prisoner - when I saw the paper now produced I believed it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner, but thinking it a case attended with serious consequences to him I was anxious to compare it with a writing I knew to be his - having now compared them I have no doubt whatever that this paper is the prisoner's writing, and I believe the address to be the same hand-writing as the other part. (Letter read.)</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am a City-officer. In consequence of information I went to the Bell and Crown, Holborn, to wait for a person who was coming for a parcel - it was on a Monday night, and I think the 14th of March; I inquired for the Kidderminster coach - they said it came to the Bull; I went there, but did not see any person that night - I went to the Bull again on the following morning, and from some information there I went to the Bell and Crown again a little before eleven o'clock; I received information, and went into the street - I saw a woman coming out of the office with a brown paper parcel in her hand; she walked down Holborn, and put it into her right-hand pocket - she walked up Farringdon-street till she got to Farringdon-market; she then took it from her pocket opened it, and put it into a basket she had with her, loose, as she had broken it open, and walked through the market to the further end; I and Herdsfield went up to her, and told her we wanted to speak to her - she told us where she lived; Herdstield took her into custody, and I went, in consequence of what she had said, to No. 32, Kingsgate-street; I knocked four times at the door, and the prisoner himself opened it - I told him I wanted to speak to him; we went up stairs together into his room, which he showed me; I found another person, named Cross there, writing a letter - I addressed myself to both of them, and said, "I am come from a person you sent for a parcel;" the prisoner and Cross both said they did not send any one - I said, "She says so, and you must come with me, and prove you have not sent her;" they came with me, and I left the prisoner at the watch-house while I went with Cross to see what had become of the woman - I found Herdsfield and her waiting at the corner, facing Gray's-Inn lane - I then took Cross and the prisoner to Guildhall, and the prisoner's wife went with Herdsfield; I say his wife, because she acknowledged he was her husband at the watch-house, and he said she was his wife - I do not remember the words she used; I believe she said that was her husband, and they also admitted it on the several examinations - on the first examination the case was not thought to reach the prisoner, and he was remanded till the following Friday - he was afterwards examined and committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070077"/>Cross-examined. Q.Did you find the prisoner to be a shoemaker, and to live at the place to which his wife directed you? A. Yes; I think they said he had lived there three or four months - he gave a true answer to all the questions I put to him; I do not recollect Herdsfield observing that he behaved like a man - it was on the 15th that he went to the office; I asked him to write his own name, and to write "Swing," which he did - I asked him where Mr. O'Donnughue lived, and he took me to where he had lived; the prisoner remained in custody on the first day for about an hour and a half, and was then allowed to go where he pleased - he was not called on to find sureties; I do not know that he told me he would come when I wanted him, but I left word on the night before for him to come and meet me, and I met him the next day in Holborn - I believe he was coming to meet me; the prosecutor did not say that he knew Cross - the woman went to Farringdon-market; a person going from the Bell to where the prisoner lived would not go through Farringdon-market - it is quite a different road; the prisoner appeared again on the Friday, and then he was kept in custody - Cross had not been discharged till the prisoner came in the second time; he is now upon bail - the prisoner's wife is now in Newgate; the prisoner appeared as though he was regularly engaged in work as a shoe-maker; he seemed as if he had just got up.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been asked if the prisoner told you what was true - have you any means of judging whether what he told you was true or not? A. No; he said he had not sent for that parcel - I do not think his wife, in his presence, said any thing on that subject; from what I had heard, I asked the prisoner if he knew such a gentleman as Mr. O'Donnughue; he took me to where he had lodged, and the solicitor afterwards found him; we had not the original letter then.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HERDSFIELD. This is the parcel I took from the woman - it is directed "For A. B., to be left at the Bell and Crown, Holborn, London, till called for;" and on the back "Carriage paid."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have heard what was stated by Martin, as to the conduct of the prisoner? A. I was only with him once or twice, but during the opportunities I had of seeing the prisoner, his answers were given readily, voluntarily, and truly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, only that I am quite innocent; every thing that laid in my power, I endeavoured to trace out, for the satisfaction of these gentlemen, and to prove my innocence; according to the witnesses you will find that to be true.</p>

            . I am a sculptor, and live at No. 22, Grafton-street East, Fitzroy-square. I have known the prisoner from two to three years - I have seen him write more than once or twice; I do not believe this letter, or any part of it, to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are a sculptor - what means have you had of knowing his handwriting? A. I have known his wife's family - I have employed her brother, and I have gone to the house where the prisoner resides, and seen him write upwards of two or three times - I cannot tell what he wrote, but I have seen him write, and I have some of his writing in my pocket now; I have seen this letter within the last half-hour - I had heard of this affair, and as I knew the prosecutor and the prisoner, I was solicited to come here and say what I knew - he never was employed by me as a writer but I have seen him in the act of writing at his own lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you believe that to be his hand-writing? A. I do not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that opinion formed on the character of the hand-writing of the prisoner? A. Yes - I think the letters are made differently, particularly the beginning and the ending of the B; I cannot tell whether this is a natural or a disguised hand-writing, but it is a very different hand from what I have seen the prisoner write; not knowing the writer of this letter, I cannot say whether this is the natural undisguised writing of the person who wrote it- I should think it is a natural hand-writing, but that is a mere matter of opinion; I considered I was summoned here to-day, that I might state what I knew of the prisoner's character; I had no intimation that I should be called to speak to his hand-writing - I saw this paper about half an hour ago, for the first time; it appears to me distinct from the prisoner's hand-writing; I should never take it for it - I can trace as little similarity as I can in the features of one person's face and another.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you answer this question fairly and openly; do you trace any similarity, or not? A.Very little - I trace none that would deceive me; there may be a little, but I should not have taken it for his hand-writing - there may be a little similarity, but very remote; I do not trace any.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You have stated you have seen the prisoner write; have you seen his writing so as to form a judgment of his hand-writing? A. Yes, when I have been in his room he has been writing a large portion of time, and I have over-looked it; I have received superscriptions from him, which I have known to he his hand-writing directly I saw it - I distinctly state that I know the hand-writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ALICIA ERNBLOUNT. I live at No. 7, New Turnstile, Holborn - I keep a chandler's shop, and my husband is a tailor. I know the prisoner - he lodged in my house nearly two years; I saw him write several times, a dozen times at least; on one occasion I got him to write a letter for me to a charity in Portman-place - this letter is not at all like what I have seen him write; I do not believe it to be his writing - it is not at all the style in which he wrote letters for me; it is not the make of the letters.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What else did he write for you besides the letter you speak of? A. He wrote bills, and I do not think this to be at all like his hand-writing; I had seen this letter before - a gentleman called on me one Saturday, and showed me this letter and another; I did not tell him this was not at all like his hand-writing- I said I could not say; I did not feel myself obliged to answer.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did that gentleman tell you he came on the part of the prosecution? A. No - I have known the prisoner about three years and a half in all; I have found him a sober, honest, industrious man, and that was the reference I had with him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Can you write yourself? A. Yes; the bills<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070078"/>I spoke of were what he made out in his own business for boots and shoes which I gave him to repair.</p>

            BUBB re-examined. Q.You said you did not come here under any expectation of having your attention called to the prisoner's hand-writing, but to his character; how did it happen that you brought any of his writing with you? A. I have had it in my pocket some time -I happened accidentally to feel my pocket-book, and it is in it; a week ago I heard of this, and I looked for a bit of his writing, and put it into my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it was purely accidental that you had that writing about you, owing to your having this dress on? A. Yes - I work in one dress, and put on another.</p>
               <p>Q. But how came you to bring the pocket-book with that bit of writing to-day, if you had no reason to expect it would be wanted? A. I thought I should like to see the letter, and I thought if there were any doubt on my mind I might compare it - my object in putting it in my pocket-book was certainly to compare it, but to-day I did not know I had it in my pocket till I came; I put it into my pocket first of all with an intention of bringing it, but yesterday I came without it, and to-day I had it - I brought it here intentionally.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A.From two to three years - his character for honesty, quietness, and uprightness of disposition has been as good as I have ever known of any man.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 7, Little Turnstile - the prisoner is a cousin of mine. I have known him these twenty years - he lodged with me three years, and worked for me; he has been strictly honest, industrious, and sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know your cousin's hand-writing? A. I have seen him write a great many times; I should not like to swear to his writing, but I believe I know his hand-writing - I do not believe this to be his hand-writing; this is more formal than his general hand - the letters are bolder than his, and they are not made in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this other to be his hand-writing? A. No, Sir - I am equally certain about this; I think them both alike (looking at another) - I cannot swear to this; I do not believe it is his - his is a scrawling hand-writing, not like this.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to J.G. BUBB. Q. Is this paper the prisoner's hand-writing? A. It is a great deal more like the prisoner's hand-writing than the other - I should rather think it is; it is like his hand-writing more than the other - I should take it to be his hand-writing; (looking at another) I think it very likely to be his handwriting - I should give my opinion in the affirmative; I should say Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MRS. ERNBLOUNT. Q. Do you believe this paper to be the prisoner's hand-writing?

I am servant to Mr. Crease, of West Smithfield, an oil and colourman, On the 22nd of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and chose a butter brush, which came to 6d.; he put a 5s. piece into my hand - I saw that it was a bad one, and I handed it over to Mr. Price, the clerk, who came out of his counting-house - the prisoner was close by at the time; he had been in the shop before - Mr. Price sent for a constable; the prisoner attempted to go out, and I collared him - I had sold a brush the day before to a man who I believe was the prisoner.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Crease- it is the custom for me to receive money; I keep the key of the till. I saw the prisoner on the 21st of February, but before that another person had come in for a brush, and paid a 5s. piece; I put it into the till - in ten minutes the prisoner came, and bought a brush, which came to 4d.; he gave a 5s. piece, which I put into the till, and the following morning I found the two 5s. pieces were both bad, as there was no other crown in the till - I opened the till between seven and eight o'clock; I took the two crown-pieces, and put them by themselves in one of the partitions in the desk; the prisoner came on the 22nd, about the same hour in the evening as on the 21st- he again asked for a brush, which was served him by Nicholls; the prisoner gave him a crown-piece, which he handed to me, and I discovered that it was the same as the other - I sent for an officer - I recollected the prisoner again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said if I could not give a good account of myself, you would give me in charge. Witness. Yes, I did - I forget his answer, but he did not give a good account; I think he said he worked at a baker's - the first brush that was brought came to 6d.; the first the prisoner bought was 4d., and the second he came for was 6d.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q.Were these the only three bad crowns you had? A. Yes, the only three crowns.</p>

            . On the 19th of February I kept the Barley Mow - Lane came there that night about twelve o'clock - the prisoner came in soon after, with another man - Lane stopped there half an hour or three quarters, and was perfectly sober, so was the prisoner and his companion - there were other persons in the house; I believe they were all gone except the prisoner, his companion, and another at the time Lane left - the prisoner and his companion left about the same time as Lane; I wanted to clear the house - I then fastened the door, and heard a person cry out, "Murder! they have robbed me;" I said,"That is Lane, I suppose;" it appeared to be his voice; I opened the door immediately, and saw Lane close by the door - the prisoner and another person were near him; I saw nobody else - if others had been near him I must have seen them; the moment I opened the door and went out, the prisoner struck me a tremendous blow, and he and his companion went off; Lane was then on the ground, I believe - I took him in doors; he complained of being very much hurt, and that they had robbed him of half a crown - I knew the prisoner, as he frequented the house; I understood he lived in the neighbourhood, but did not know his business - he came into my house three or four nights after, and I went down to the Police-office; he left before I returned, but was taken that night - the street was rather dark when this happened; I think he knew me when he struck me - I have been unfortunate, and have come from the debtor's prison - my licence was taken away before the 5th of April, but I was allowed to keep the house open; I think it was on the 5th of April that I went to prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The person who struck you ran away directly? A. I believe he did, but my senses were gone just for the instant; I cannot say whether Lane was on the ground when I opened my door, as it was rather dark, and I was flurried at the moment - I was sober; I had put out the lamp at my door, and it was dark - the house is in a court; there are two or three lamps, but when mine is out it is quite dark - I lost my licence in consequence of such characters as these coming there, and a witness he is now going to bring forward being there; I had frequently fastened them out of my house, and gone to Worship-street to complain of them, but could not keep them out - I generally serve till one o'clock on Saturday nights; I cannot say whether the others went out about the same time as Lane or not - I gave information of this at the Police station on Sunday; the prisoner owes me two or three pounds - I do not know where he lived: he represented himself as having a great many houses, and being very well off - the man with him was Sherring, or some such name, and the prisoner went by the name of Boney and Donkin; he was tried here by that name, for the same sort of concern - I believe he was acquitted; he is a noted body-snatcher.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man is outside who was present at the time - Roberts repeatedly threatened to serve me out for owing him money; this is done out of spite: on the morning it took place I left the house alone, to go home, and in Bunhill-row a child was hurt; I took it to the Police-station, and stopped there half an hour or more, at the same station as Roberts says he went to give information - the greatest part of the Police were there; the inspector knew my house - I was not in Roberts' house till a quarter-past one o'clock that morning; four other persons came and stood at the bar, drinking - Roberts, 1, and Lane had rum, gin, and ale together; if I had committed the robbery, it is not likely I should have gone to the same house - I do not live two hundred yards from it; I went there on the morning I was taken - a Policeman whom I and Roberts knew went there to see the fiddling and dancing - I had a glass of rum, and some tobacco, which I paid for; I had a pot of half-and-half; two Policemen were going by, and I gave it to them; if I was guilty, why did not Roberts give me in charge, instead of sending a woman to watch where I lived?</p>

            . On Sunday morning, the 20th of February, I got up, because my child had the measles, to get a light at Roberts' lamp, about half-past three o'clock in the morning - I live in Gravel-walk, the first court at the side of Roberts' - I knocked at Roberts' door, and he let me in; the lamp over the door was burning - I took a light home, and then went to have half a pint of beer; I saw the prisoner at the back of the bar, talking to Mrs. Roberts about going to dinner on Sunday morning - I heard the prisoner invite her to his house to dinner; I stood close to the bar - I am sure this was at half-past three o'clock, and they had two, three, or four half-pints of gin; there were six of them together - Mr. Lane and all drank; the landlord took a glass, and they gave me a glass - his wife did not drink; Roberts just came out, and said it was too late to draw any more - they went out, and in a few minutes knocked again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to wait when your child was ill? A. Roberts told me to stop; he did not say why - I had taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070081"/>the light home, returned for the beer, and then I had an other half pint; I always get up at five o'clock on Sunday mornings, and did not mean to go to bed again - I sell milk; Roberts and Lane know it was half-past three well- the second time that they were let in, the Policeman came in in his uniform, and drank a glass; this was all between three and four o'clock - the serjeant came in, caught him there, and reprimanded him; the Policeman and serjeant went out together - Roberts persuaded them all to go, it being late, and they all went out; I remained in - Roberts said to his wife, "Give Daddy a glass of gin;" he put his lamp out before they went out - they had not been out five minutes before somebody cried Murder! Mrs. Roberts, said, "It is Mr. Lane," and Roberts went out - I followed, and saw Lane on the ground, and a big stout man was fighting him; I picked him up, and the man made a kick at him, I think on the shins - he said he had lost his hat; I went back - Mr. Roberts and the prisoner were fighting together; I got Roberts in, and shut the door - he wanted to go out to fight again, but I took the key out of the door, and gave to his wife - I was sober; Roberts and Lane were in liquor - Roberts wanted Lane to treat me and him with a quartern of gin; Mrs. Roberts would not draw any more, as Lane had had quite enough.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew the prisoner very well, did not you? A. No, only for about a week before; I went to Worship-street when he was taken, but I met Roberts at the door, and he said it was all settled without me - I did not tell him the prisoner was innocent; I did not want to have any thing to do with it - I went there to see how the prisoner got on, and if I was wanted; Roberts said it was settled without me: I returned with him and Lane, and had a quartern and a half of gin at the Cock - I did not tell them they had made a false charge; I did not know what they had sworn - Roberts told me at the Baker and Basket that he was committed for the robbery - that was immediately after we left the office; I did not tell them he was innocent - I was quite ignorant, and did not know what to do.</p>


               <p>Q. Can you give any reason why you did not go in to the Magistrate, and say you knew it was a false charge? A. I did not - I went home with Roberts and Lane, and had some gin at the Cock; I had seen no robbery committed, and knew he had committed none - I knew if he had he was liable to be hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so base as to drink with people who charge a man with an offence affecting his life, when you knew it was false? A. I did not know it affected his life till yesterday - I did not know it was a highway-robbery he was committed for; I live at No. 4, Blue Anchoralley, Gravel-walk.</p>

In consequence of Lane stating what took place, I thought I was in duty bound to apprehend the prisoner - Barber was in my house that night about the same time as the other party, but I deny that it was three o'clock; I was gone to bed then - I am sure Barber was not sober; I think he was in the tap-room at the time the party were at the bar - he did not come for a light; he was drinking the same as others - he said nothing about a light, nor did I see him take one; I heard no complaint about his child having the measles - he came out of the tap-room after they were gone, and I asked him to wait a bit, as I heard people talking outside; he was rather fresh - I wished him to wait till they were gone; there were no Policemen in my house- I saw Barber at the door of the Police-office, and he told me he did not want to say any thing, for if he spoke the truth it would be all against the prisoner; I drank with him afterwards, and next night a message came to my house, saying they would be the death of Barber if he did not come and speak for Davis - he said he could not for if he spoke the truth it would be against him, and he told me this morning that they had been to him again, and he did not want to come.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM BARBER. Q. Who did you see when you went out of the house? A. The prisoner, brother, and four more - there was nobody but the stout big man engaged near the prosecutor; the prisoner was fighting with Roberts, and the others stood round; what Roberts has said is false - I have not seen him for a week.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Thursday evening, the 17th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I was fetched to Trevillion's bird-shop, and saw Parsons - Trevillion said he had come to sell this fowl there; I took him to the station, and next day I found Green out - Trevillion said Longdale had been there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GREEN. I am positive this is my fowl.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TREVILLION. I deal in birds, and live in Old-street. On Thursday evening, between seven and eight o'clock, Longdale brought this fowl to me; I asked how he came by it - he said it was his own; I said, "I don't like to buy fowls of boys, go about your business;" he went out, Parsons came in and said, "The fowl belongs to me, Sir, I have another at home;" I caught hold of him, and said, "You have stolen it;" Longdale then ran away - he was taken the same night - I am sure he first brought it.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged in my first floor for a week - I have other lodgers, but not in the same room. These articles were kept in the front kitchen, where I sleep - I saw them on Sunday, about nine o'clock, and missed them on Monday, the 6th of March; the drawers they were in were locked, but I cannot say whether the key was left in them - I was present on Wednesday, the 8th, when the prisoner's box was searched in her room; she opened it herself, took the key from her pocket and put it to the key-hole, but whether it was locked or not I do not know - the shawl was the first thing I saw on the box being opened; I knew it to be my wife's - these other things were found in her box; the ring must have been taken off the parlour shelf - I claimed the things in her presence; she gave no account of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not that a brass curtain ring? A. No - it is brass; I do not know whether this is coloured glass in it - no other person lodged in her room; a young woman lodged with her for a few nights - the prisoner came on the 2nd of March; she was very ill, and my wife had to procure her medicine - she was incapable of helping herself; I cannot say whether the other young woman gave notice before she left - she staid but three days, and paid for a week, as she got a situation, and went to it directly; the prisoner complained of losing a sovereign on the Monday - she desired my wife to take her money from the drawer to pay for her medicine - I do not know how much she had; she was not confined to her bed; I do not know that her box was always open; I saw my things safe after the woman left, but cannot tell when - her box was searched in the officer's presence; she did not desire it should be searched; she was in our room - I said her room must be searched first, as she was a stranger; she went up with us, and produced the keys; she had left her service on account of illness; the caps are of trifling value.</p>

I was sent for; Sutherland said, "Now we will have the house searched;" I asked him, in the prisoner's hearing, if he suspected one more than another; he said, "Yes, the prisoner;" we all went up to her room - she opened her box herself, and this shawl laid in it, just by the lock - Sutherland and his wife claimed it; she made no answer; one cap and a collar were found - the other cap and collar were found under a pair of stays, at the foot of the bed - I afterwards overtook her in the New-road, in care of another Policeman - she gave me this cap out of her hand, and said she hoped Mr. Sutherland would forgive her.</p>

On the 31st of March we had been drinking together, and were both a little elated: we had spent the evening together, and came home together about one o'clock in the morning - my servant had given a beer cask to a customer by mistake twelve months before, and the customer had sent a message about it - I spoke to my servant about it, and the prisoner said I should be doing wrong if I deducted it from her wages, which I threatened - I said he had no business to interfere; that affronted him, and he struck me in an indifferent way, and I struck him - I went to the bottom of the stairs, and called to Mrs. Chapman, to know if that conduct was to be tolerated; she was in bed - she dressed partly, and came down; she said, "Bowry, I will not suffer that conduct in my house - you shall go out this instant;" he said he would go - he went up a few stairs, to a little anti-room, where his bed is, and came back with a pistol - I had no idea that it was loaded; he aimed it at me - Mrs. Chapman had found us in combat when she came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no blows or words pass after he came from his room? A. No - he aimed the pistol at me, and fired; I fell back in my chair - I was not wounded, only something struck my eye; I had no idea he would have done such a thing, in consequence of our intimacy, which was of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070083"/>so long standing - we had always been good friends: I have no doubt it was nothing but the moment of irritation- the room is small; I could find no mark of a shot or bullet - a Policeman was sent for, who took him, and he was committed for an assault; I do not believe he intended to do any thing but frighten me, and not to do me any personal harm.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you fall from being drunk? A. I do not know - I had the linen and goods with me; my money was in my right-hand pocket - I did not feel that taken; when I got up it was gone, and the cloth laid on the ground - the prisoners had taken it away two or three times; they were trying to get it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them trying to get it away? A. They were close by me - I slipped down at the door; I was rather in liquor - I do not know whether they gave me a push or not; I had felt them pulling at the cloth two or three times before I got to where I fell - I was going home, and not to any place with them; when I got up, the Policeman came and asked if I had lost any thing - I felt in my pocket, and my purse was gone; the table-cloth and linen laid on the ground.</p>
               <p>Arnold. Q.When you were at the Coach and Horses did not a gentlemen offer to see you home, and you said No, you knew the person you was with, and she would take care of you, and did you not give the cloth into my hand? A. I did not - I gave her no money.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HANCOCK. I am a Policeman. I saw the prosecutor about two doors from the Coach and Horses, Edgware-road, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock - he was alone; I saw the prisoners accost him and ask for drink - he went into the Coach and Horses with them, and came out in about ten minutes; Arnold then had the cloth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070084"/>under her arm, and had hold of one of his arms, and White the other - he was drunk; I followed them about three hundred yards, and called my brother officer to follow me - I did not see the prosecutor fall, but saw him on the ground, and Arnold ran away; I followed, her, pinioned her two arms, and said, "What have you got here?" she said nothing, but I took out of her hand the prosecutor's money bag - she said she had picked it up; there was no money in it then - I took them all three to the station-house, and searched her again; I could tell there was something in her month - I seized her throat; Clark put his finger in, she bit it, and there was there sovereigns and two half-sovereigns - Bingley claimed the bag, and said, "Where are my sovereigns?" I found nothing on White - she remained with the prosecutor when Arnold ran away; I saw them both carrying the cloth at times - it was on the ground when Arnold ran away; White had it when they went down the street - she did not attempt to run away.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 18th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Carter's-rents, about a quarter of a mile from Harris, with this tea-caddy under his arm - I asked how he came by it; he said he was going to take it to his brother John - I said, "That is not the question, where did you bring it from?" he said he fetched it from his father; I knew his father, who lived in Quaker-street, about two hundred yards from Harris' - I detained him, and the prosecutrix claimed it next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAVNE. Q. He had it under his arm? A. Yes, quite careless - it was wrapped in a cloth, but only partly covered; his parents I believe, are not of the best character - I took him before Mr. Broughtonlon the 18th, and he was discharged; but next morning I took him out of bed, as I heard it was stolen.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARRIS. I am quite sure this is my caddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been paid for it? A. His father came to me before I missed it - he asked if I was a mother, and said, "You have got a caddy to sell, what is the price?" I said 18d. - he said, "Will you he satisfied with that? I said Yes; he went out brought 1s. 6d. in about five minutes, - soon after somebody came and said I had done wrong in taking the money, for, I was liable to be prosecuted - I really do not think he took the caddy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

On the evening of the 26th of March I was absent from the workhouse - Mr. Carvill, the assistant overseer, attended during my absence, in consequence of an arrangement between us - I left the workhouse that day about six o'clock, and know nothing of this occurrence myself - I left from 5l. to 10l. in Mr. Carvill's hands to meet these orders.</p>

             to attend to the bell - shortly after it rang Jones brought me this paper; it is not usual to pay such orders as these without some previous inquiry - the overseers generally direct me to inquire into the circumstances if they give orders for 8s. or 10s., but they have power to give money without inquiry - no communication had been made to me on the subject of this order, and the amount excited my suspicion; I went to the gate, and found the prisoner there (who I myself did not then know), and another man - the prisoner was dressed in white trousers, and I think a blue jacket, a sort of sailor's dress; when I asked Jones who gave her the order, she pointed him out as the person, in his presence, and I asked his name - he said John Green; I cannot be mistaken in his person - I know he is the man: I may have known him as a casual pauper, but never relieved him myself - on his saying his name was Green I opened the gate, and told him he must go with me; Mr. Tickner lives in Bride-lane- the workhouse is in Fleet-street, directly opposite to the new avenue at St. Bride's church; I took the prisoner down Fleet-street, towards Bride-lane, in a direction for Mr. Tickner's; I did not tell him where I was going to take him, or for what purpose, and when we got nearly opposite the crossing to Bride-lane, he asked where he was going to, and before I had time to answer he followed it up by saying he should not go to Mr. Tickner's, it was of no use to go there for he would not give him any thing - that immediately strengthened my suspicion, and I said, "Very well then, you must go with me;" I then turned round Black Horse court, where the parish watchouse is situated; that is in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070086"/>a different direction from Bride-lane - as I turned the corner of Black House-court he attempted to resist and to escape; I was obliged to take an additionel hold of him, and forced him down the court; he still resisted - I was obliged to produce a staff, had insisted on his going with me; I looked round when he attempted to escape and then saw the other man was close by, for the first time - I am sure it was the same man; on producing my staff the other man ran away - I took the down Black Horse-court, and he attempted to resist again, but I compelled him to go to the watch-house with me - he used very powerful endeavours, to escape; I had the paper in my possession, and have kept it ever since - this is it; the initials E. T. are on it - they were not on it when I received it; I saw Mr. Tickner do that at the Justice room, where I produced it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever paid any order of that description? A. I very frequently pay orders of precisely the same description signed by the overseer, in that forme we pay upon the signature of one overseer.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever pay the prisoner any money? A. No - it did not strike me as a forgery at the time; I thought the amount was wrong, but on his refusing to go to Mr. Tickner, I thought it must be a forgery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would this paper, written as it is, and spelt as it is have imposed on you? A. I really did not read it particularly as I saw the name of Tickuer - that was sufficient for me; I did not particularly read the writing, nor should I have done so; I did not notice the word bearns till now - the only singular thing in the order was its not having the name of the person to when it was to be paid; the orders do not always specify a name, but they should do so - I should have paid this order without looking further at it, if it had not been for 6s.; if it had been for 1s. I should have paid it instantly, but not 6s. without inquiry, the amount being unusally large.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that order payable without previous inquiry? A. It is payable, and if Mr. Mott had received it he must have paid it, but, I being assistant overseer, knew there had been no previous meury; I am in the habit of receiving a communication from the overseers before an order for that amount is issued; I should not refuse payment in consequence of not having that order, but it being the practice of the overseers to direct an inquiry before they give relief to that amount, and not having been so directed, caused my suspicion - I am in the habit of receiving a communication where more ham 2s. or 3s. are to be paid.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the overseers authority to order that amount? A. Yes - my suspicion was excited by the time of night at which it was given; I considered something particular must have occurred, for an order for 6s. at that time - had it been on a Thursday I should not have questioned it; there is no customary form for these orders - they are written on paper; I never recollect seeing the word overseer added to the signature - either of the overpeers sign orders; they are generally written on such small pieces of paper as this - I am well acquainted with Mr. Tickner's hand-writing, but it did not strike me that it was not his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Mr. Tickner has no right to draw on Mr. Mott, except in his character of overseer? A. No.</p>

            ; ESQ. I was overseer of St. Bride's at the these in question, and am a Common Councilman. I knew the prisoner very well previous to the 25th of March- I very frequently gave him orders for relief; I recollect that I gave him an order on the 14th of March - (looking at the order) this is not signed by me, nor by my authority; I never saw it till it was produced before the Justice.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you been in the habit of signing similar papers to this for relief? A. Tickets a bout the same size - they are more vouchers for payments to paupers, given at the moment on any paper that is at hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence stating, that he had applied for relief to a Mr. Hobbs on Saturday evening, and was referred to Mr. Carvill at the workhouse, where he went, but could not get in at the gate in Shoe-lane - that he met a man at the gate, and asked if he had an order; he said he had one from Mr. Tickner, that they both went round to the Fleet-street entrance, when the man gave the girl the order in question, and on her return asked if she had brought the money - she replied No, that Mr. Carvill would come and speak to him; Mr. Carvill came, asked the man some question, and desired him to go along - that the man ran away, and the prisoner went with Mr. Carvill to the watch-house, it concluded by solemily declaring he had not presented the order, and knew nothing of the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday night, before I was taken into the watch-house, I told Mr. Carvill if he would give me the prisoners, or let me be remanded for a day or two, I would bring forward the man who brought the order; he said, "No, I have got the girl who will swear you are the man; I said I could bring the man forward, but they would not allow me, nor to name where he did live - I am willing to write, to prove I am innocent; I never was guilty of any thing, nor in prison before, but for fourteen days, and that was for begging - I had three witnesses to character, but they are not aware that I was to be brought up to-night.</p>
               <p>The Jury, upon comparing the forged instrument with the record, appeared to doubt whether it was accurately set out.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. If the Jury are not satisfied that is a fast simile, we are very happy to receive the suggestion, and retire from the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he work about that yard? A. I believe he did, as a helper - I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070087"/>not aware whether in our conversation I said "the oats," or "the sack" - he was taken in the same yard two days after.</p>

Stevens. Cowcross-street, and I had mended it at the bottom; I afterwards heard the oats were lost, and on the prisoner being apprehended, I attended at the Magistrate's, saw the sack, and knew it to be the same; there were a few black oats hanging to the flue in the sack - they were of the same quality and description as those I took to Smeeton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had your master a tolerable stock of these oats? A. Yes, and he had fifty sacks marked the same - I had takes on about ten that week, and the same corn in some of them, but this was an empty sack about the place; I was obliged to mend it to take them in - I saw it at Guildhall in about a week - I could not be deceived in the mending; I placed it in a passage leading from the slangliter-house to the yard; it has a door which shuts, but has no fastening - Wheatsheat-yard is a thoroughfare from Farring don-street into Seacoal-lane - a person could not get to the sack without opening the door; any person might carry it away.</p>

On Saturday, the 2nd of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner rapped at the door - I went, and he said he was very sorry, he had dropped half a crown down the area, and would I let him have it; I said certainly - he came in and stood on the mat while I went down stairs to procure a light, and as soon as I got into the area I heard the latch of the street door pull back, but the door did not shut; I looked up, and saw him go out with a great coat on his arm - I ran up the area steps, got over the gate, and ran. but I lost sight of him at the bottom of Argyle-street: I have not seen the great coat since - I saw the prisoner again on the Monday morning following; I was quite sure he was the person I had seen on the Saturday - he was then in custody at Marlborough-street office - I had never seen him before; the great coat had been hanging in the hall - there was a light, and I could clearly see his features.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What sort of a night was it? A. Fine - there were not many people in the street; he remained but a second or two with me - I went down instantly into the area; I had not seen the great coat before - I cannot tell when it had been safe; I was in the area, and had a candle in my hand, but I saw the prisoner distinctly before I went into the area - I could not discern him distinctly in the street, but there had been no other person in the house - I can swear the person went out of the house with the coat; I saw him go out at the door - he got to the bottom of the street while I got over the area.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any body else see the person who came to the house? A. The kitchen-maid did, but she said she should not know him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HANKS. I am butler to Mr. Dottin - he came in between five and six o'clock, with a great coat on; I took it and hung it up in the hall, about five or six yards from the street door - I missed it between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock that night the prisoner knocked at the door of General Turner's, which is next door to Mr. Dottin's, and said he had dropped some silver down the area - Mrs. West went to the door to him; she called me(I was at the time in the house), and I took a candle to show the prisoner down into the area - I am certain he is the man; I had seen him before - when he came down into the area I asked what silver he had dropped; he said he did not know, he had been drinking - I said, "I don't think you have dropped any thing;" he said, "Yes, I have - it is all right;" I said, "I don't think it is all right;" he walked up, and went away.</p>

            . I live in Thomas-buildings, with my mother - I was going up to St. John's - wood-road with some butter, some time ago; I cannot tell what month it was - I saw the prisoner and a boy named Wells going along; Butcher stood up against the shop window, while Wells walked up and down; it was a stay-shop, opposite to a public-house and a butcher's-shop - I saw the prisoner go in on his hands and knees; he fetched out a pair of children's boots and two pairs of stays; he gave them to

            , who ran away with them - Butcher went in again, and fetched out eight pairs more; I saw a Policeman in the street - he was following behind just as he came out; when we got round the corner, the prisoner said, "Halloo, Buckellor," and I said, "Halloo! Butcher;" he said, "Here is a sway I have made;" and he said, "I will give you something if you will come and hold my jacket while I go and pawn them;" I did so; he went to Mr. Griffith, a pawnbroker, and pawned two pairs - we then went to Mr. Tickner, in Church-way, New-road, and one pair was pawned there.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Attenboro, a pawnbroker, of Crown-street. On Saturday, the 12th of February, the prisoner came into our shop, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070090"/>brought with him a pocket Bible and a Prayer-book; I asked whose they were; he said his own, and that he bought them at a bookseller's in Holborn, and had given 10s. 6d. for the Bible and 7s. for the Prayer-book, and he had bought them either five weeks or five months before; he mentioned one of these times at the shop, and the other at the office - he said his name was Sparkes, and he lived in Earl-street, Finsbury; I sent the boy to make inquiry, and then I heard an alarm; the boy had met the prisoner at the door, seized him by the collar, and brought him back - an officer was sent for, and took him; these are the books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Was the boy who seized him the same boy you sent out to make inquiry? A. No; the prisoner had quitted the shop, and turned round the corner a short distance; he had got out of my sight - the boy was at that time at the door; we have boxes in which persons go to make pledges - these were other persons there; the prisoner offered to pawn from the first of the boxes - they are rather dark; I cannot be mistaken in his person - I did not see the prisoner stopped outside.</p>

            . I live in Gracechurch-street, and am in partnership with Joseph Harvey - the prisoner was in our service for about eight years, and was so on the 12th of February. These books I believe to be ours - we have a binder named George Matthews; he binds books of this description - the value of the Bible is about 10s. 6d., and the Prayer-book 7s.; the prisoner bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he has given you money which he has found? A. Yes, and we have entrusted him to take money to the Stamp-office, under 50l.; we are generally in the habit of marking books when they come from the binder's, but they may lay for a day or two - there is a particular person who has the care of Bibles and Prayer-books; his name is Bowler - there are two others who take them in, but they are not here; the care of these books is left to one of these persons, or the whole of them- I very seldom mark the Bibles and Prayer-books; one of these three persons generally mark them with a private-mark, and also the retail mark - there is neither of the marks on these books.</p>

            . I live in Warwick-lane. I have examined these two books - I bound them for Messrs. Darton and Harvey; I know the Bible by the edition, which we do for no other firm - we do not do all the bindings in the same way; theirs is the only house for which we do that edition in this binding - I know my own work - I cannot say when the Bible was bound, but it is since Christmas; the Prayer-book has the prayer for the present King and Queen - that had not been bound five months on the 12th of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you will not undertake to swear it had not been bound five weeks? A. No; I have had no Bibles of this edition, (which is the Oxford common edition) to bind since Christmas; we have them by fifties at a time - this is the edition of 1829 - I perhaps did one hundred of this edition in the course of the last year; I send them to the prosecutor by a boy or a porter - the lettering part of this is remarkable, and the headband; we do not put any marks in the book - I was at the office when an examination of these books took place, but I did not hear the Magistrate desire them to be examined with a magnifying-glass - I was only there the two last days.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. DARTON. Q. Are there any books sold from your shop which have not the private-mark? A. A great many are, but Bibles and Prayer-books generally have it - I do not mark them myself, and would not affirm that my shopmen always do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them in Holborn - I did not attempt to leave the shop; while the boy was gone I was necessitated to go to the door, but I did not move from the door, and the boy ran and seized me - I said I was not going away.</p>
               <p>G. J. MOULTON re-examined. The prisoner went away towards Sun-street - I had not missed him above a minute when he was brought back; I saw him at the next door - the lad who stopped him is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. I cannot be positive that I bound this Prayer-book for the prosecutor - we do them for other houses in the same way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor's shopman swore most positively that he did not believe they belonged to him, and that it was not possible I could get at them.</p>

             afterwards, but I did not receive 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he your clerk or servant? A. I should consider him my servant - there was no specific meation about his receiving money for me, but it was understood generally, and he was in the habit of accounting for what he received; there was nothing said one way or the other about his having any cases to attend on his own account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On what date was the payment made? A. On the 17th of August - here are my initials against it; I presume it was handed over to me on that day, but it might be a day or two afterwards; most likely I put my initials there on a Monday - I had not seen Mrs. Howard myself; the prisoner is a member of the Company of Apothecaries - I presume he had some notion of setting up in business; he told me before I preferred this indictment that he intended to set up at Ealing -I did not like that, of course; I am the only doctor in that village, but there are others in the vicinity - I indicted him as soon as I found any charge against him: I suppose it was four or five days after I heard of his intention of setting up in business - he had left me four days; I desired my friends to get him to sign a bond not to set up in business within several miles of me, and to refund the money; the message brought back was that he refused point blank to sign any such thing - I have always paid the prisoner in money; he has desired me to get him a bottle of brandy, and when I have done so he perhaps has not been able to pay me till his salary was due; his coal-merchant has called on me, and I think a brewer has, but that was to pay in advance, before his salary was due; I do not recollect that any one called when his salary was in arrears - his milkman never called on me; his baker spoke to me once, but I never paid his baker - I think the greatest number of times he ever had brandy of me was twice; it might have been three times; I had a partner in the beginning of 1828, but the accounts have been settled, and he is dead - the prisoner was in our service at the time of the partnership; he informed me that he expected to attend Mrs. Howard - if he had wished to defraud me, he certainly need not have told me of it; he was in custody last Session, on a charge respecting Elizabeth Reed, but she was not then able to attend.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What was the charge at which he was allowed to attend a patient in this case? A.10s. 6d. if paid at the time, but if not it was to be 15s. - I was satisfied with the payment of the 10s. 6d. at that time; I am not aware that persons are in the habit of paying more to the assistant.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You have stated that supposing payment to be made at the time, 10s. 6d. was the regular charge? A. Yes, for my assistant, but 15s. if credit is given - the attendance was on the 2nd of August.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And you were very well satisfied with this young gentleman's attendance? A. Yes, I liked him very well - I was not inclined to make him any compensation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What passed when you paid the prisoner on the 8th of August? A. I gave him the money: I had asked him on the 3rd what was the charge, and he said 15s.; I gave him a sovereign, but he could not give me change, and on the 8th I gave him 15s. in silver - I had never employed him before; I sent for him as Mr. Dickinson's assistant - I met the prisoner walking on Ealinggreen, and asked him to attend me; that was about four days before he attended - I asked him what the charge was, and he said 15s.; the reason I asked him again on the 3rd of August was, because I had had some medicines, and I did not know whether that was in the bill; I paid 4s. 6d. in another bill, for medicine.</p>

A.Assistant generally - I think he did say with respect to Reed, that she had not paid him, and if she had he should not have handed it to me, but that was in the heat of controversy; I discharged him on the 12th of February, and would not pay him his salary till he had handed me a list of his midwifery patients - he threatened to serve me with a writ; I believe the prisoner will not set up in business - I should have no objection to his signing a bond at this instant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You demanded of him a list of his patients? A. Yes - he certainly was not at liberty to attend patients on his own account; I offered through my friends, that if he would sign a bond and pay me, I would take no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070092"/>further proceedings against him, but I found there had been a system of plundering going on for six months - I did not know Reed; I had never seen her as a patient myself, nor Howell either - I never had any dispute with him about his right to attend patients on his own account; he never claimed a right to attend patients - he is married, and that was one of my reasons for not wishing to prosecute him.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You had not seen Reed or Howell? A. No - I think I may have received money from him from persons whom I had not previously known.</p>

            . I am single, and used to live at Ealing. The prisoner attended me on the 8th of November last - I agreed with him to attend me, which he did, and I paid him on the 9th of November, 1l. 1s.; when I first spoke to the prisoner I did not wish Mr. Dickinson to know where I had lived, because if he knew where I had lived he would have known me by sight, as to my name I did not care - I employed the prisoner as Mr. Dickinson's assistant, and I expected the money would go into Mr. Dickinson's hands, but I did not wish him to know where I had lived; I went to Mr. Dickinson's surgery, and his errand-boy has brought me medicines, which were included in the sum of 1l. 1s., that I paid - I do not know what the medicines amounted to; there were two six-ounce bottles and a small phial.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Are we to understand that you did not wish Mr. Dickinson to know who the person was that the prisoner delivered? A. Yes - I should not have employed Mr. Dickinson himself; when I paid the prisoner the 1l. 1s. there was a person present - I told him I was very well satisfied with him, and as long as I was in Ealing I should think of employing no one else but him if I was ill; I had agreed with him for 1l. 1s., I think about six weeks before - I asked him what sum was required for attendance and medicine, and he said 1l. 1s.; there was one phial of medicine sent on the 8th of November, and to the best of my remembrance, one of the six-ounce bottles and I think one of the six-ounce bottles afterwards - when I spoke to the prisoner, I told him I had lived servant at a very respectable house, and as Mr. Dickinson used to go there as doctor, I did not wish him to know that I was the person who had lived there: I knew Mr. Dickinson did not know my name, and I told him he might tell that but not to say where I had lived - Mr. Dickinson knew me by sight, and I did not choose to see him; I desired the prisoner to take care that he was not aware I was that person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not give as a reason for not letting Mr. Dickinson know, that you could not bear the sight of him, he looked so much like a butcher? A. No - I found the prisoner very attentive and skilful.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. Q. You have looked through your book, can you take upon yourself to say there are not payments to the amount of 1l. 1s. to which no name is attributed? A. I think there may be - there are entries of small till accounts for bleeding, tooth-drawing,&amp;c.; here are entries of ready money for medicines without a name - the price of small phial and two six-ounce bottles would be 7s. 6d.; I could not say that in that book there may not be entries to that amount, but this is the book in which he ought to have entered this.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HEED. I am married, and live at Ealing. The prisoner attended me in my confinement on the 8th of February, and on the 9th I paid him 10s.; when I asked him what the charge would be, he told me 18s.; the 3s. were for medicine, but he agreed to come to me for 15s.; I said it was a great deal of money, as I was a poor woman, and he agreed to send me a small draught- he said he was going to leave Mr. Dickinson, and then his own charge would he half a guinea.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you pay the money on Mr. Dickinson's account? A. I thought he would receive the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a nurse of the name of Rose? A. I live in a very bye place, and a poor woman came down for relief; I was in the greatest of trouble, and I sent her for the prisoner - she did attend to me; I did not pay her 5s. for her trouble; I do not know that the prisoner did - she has never been to me for money; I had not seen Mr. Dickinson myself; I had sent my aunt to him - I believe the prisoner's wife lives at Ealing; he was very attentive, kind, and skilful to me.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. Q.Did you come to any settlement of accounts with the prisoner on the 12th of February? A. Not in the morning; I think I then owed him about 15l.; I should say we were on bad terms- I had given him notice to leave me, and the time had expired; I think he had made entries in the other book on the 11th, but this is the book in which this 10s. should have been entered - here is an entry of Mr. Tyrrell, "Paid a guinea," and my initials are against it, to show I have received it; he ought to enter money immediately on its being received - there was an unsettled account between us, in consequence of his refusing to give me up a list of patients he had been engaged to attend, and I refused to pay him his salary, but in the evening he sent his list, and I paid him his salary - this could not be an error in the book, because I asked him what became of the midwifery case which he had; he said, "It is not paid, and if it had been, I should not have handed it to you."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Reed's aunt engaged me to attend her on my own account - I said the fee was 15s.; she sent for me, but before I got there she had been delivered three-quarters of an hour, by Mrs. Rose - I was there about a quarter of an hour; she could not pay me then, but the next day she paid me 10s., and said as Mrs. Rose had had so much trouble, she hoped I would allow her the rest, which I did; she said she hoped I would send her a little medicine, which I also did: she said it was almost too much for her to pay, as she was a very poor woman - I said I was going into business myself, and I would attend her for half a guinea - when I left the prosecutor he sent a gentleman to me to say I was to leave Ealing, and he said I had been attending cases; I said there was one midwifery case, but it was not Mr. Dickinson's; he said if I would leave Ealing, and not set up within so many miles, he would not proceed against me. <rs id="t18310407-185-verdict1005" type="verdictDescription">

             came in, sat down in the settle at the end of the table, and fell asleep; the prisoner got off his seat, walked across the room, at over the table, and sat down by him - he took his hand out of his own pocket, and put it into the prosecutor's right-hand breeches pocket; he then took it out, went back, and sat down; I went to the bar, and told the landlady to let no one out till she had got a Policeman, who came, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were you perfectly sober? A. Yes; I am a helper in a stable - I only help in a morning; I had been at work the day before in Middle Scotland-yard for an hour or two; I never was in any trouble in my life, not in custody - there were six men in our company, mostly stable men; we were strangers to the prisoner - I did not see any money; I and one of my friends got up, walked to the bar, and told the landlady of it in about five minutes - the prosecutor did not appear very drunk; I did not see him drink any thing there - I paid for one pint of ale in that house, and had about two glasses; this was between four and five o'clock in the morng - Ini was not there above an hour - the prisoner did not leave the room; I had not been in bed that night - I left my work about eleven o'clock in the morning of the day before; I had not been all night in public-houses - I was only in two public-houses; we had all six walked round Covent-garden and the Strand.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I live at No. 6, Blenbeim-street, Chelsea. I am a gentleman's servant out of place. I was at the Castle between four and five o'clock in the morning, on the 4th of April; I saw the prisoner there and

             - the prisoner got up, and went across the room to where Dixon was; he sat down by his side, put his hand into his right-hand breeches pocket, and took it out again - he got over the table, and sat down where he was before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to represent that this man, in the presence of five or six of you, got over the table, and put his hand into his pocket? A. Yes - there were some strangers there; our party sat at one side of the room with our drink before us - none of the strangers are here to-day; I had been out of place some time, as I had been ill - I had been out rather later than usual, and was locked out; I walked back again to town from Chelsea, and I met my companions at Charing-cross, I suppose a little before four o'clock in the morning - they were walking along the street when I met them; they said they were locked out, and we walked about. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DIXON. On the 4th of April I went to the Castle public-house, in Bull Inn-court, Strand, between four and five o'clock - I was in liquor - I had walked from Blackheath-hill, and was fatigued; I asked the landlady for a glass of ale - she made it too warm, and I told her to make a pint of it, and give me a pipe of tobacco - I sat down and fell asleep; I had then two half-crowns in my pocket, and three shillings - I changed one of the shillings at the bar before I went to sleep; I got a sixpence and some halfpence; I put the sixpence into my pocket, and I then had two half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence - when I awoke I had nothing in my right-hand breeches pocket in which I had had my money - I know it was all safe when I paid for the pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you drink any of the ale? A. To the best of my recollection I did not, nor smoke the pipe; I had not sat many minutes before I went to sleep - I was not very drunk; the last place I had drank at was Blackheath-hill - I had walked up to town; I think I had about 14s. when I went out; I had not spent any money in town.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Did you take all the money out when you paid for the ale? A. No, only a single shilling.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner there? A.

               <p>COURT. Q.How far must you go out of that room to get to the bar? A. About two yards - the door does not open between the bar and that room; they are by the side of each other; he had to walk across the room, and the persons there must see him - the street-door is about two yards from the bar; in two steps more he might have gone into the street - I gave him 1s. 8 1/2d. in change.</p>

               <p>OWEN CUNNINGHAM. I play the union-pipes, and live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. On Thursday, the 10th of March, I had been in the Haymarket, but I did not see the prisoner till I got to <placeName id="t18310407-187-crimeloc1012">Charles-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you quite sober? A. I was - I had drank part of a pot of porter; I do not know where - I have been in London four or five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070094"/>months, but I should not be able to find the public-house again.</p>
               <p>Q. I recommend you to be very careful how you swear; was it not the Crown and Thistle, in the Haymarket, and did not you go to that very house and ask if you had left your pipes, saying you must have left them there? A. I did not go the same night, I went the next day; I was robbed about eleven o'clock at night - the prisoner came of his own accord to me in two or three days afterwards, brought me the pipes, and said they had been left with him by a man.</p>

             - we did live at No. 3, Charles-street. My husband came home that night, and said Owen was coming - I looked out, saw Owen laying down bleeding, and covered with the dirt of the street, and the prisoner standing over him - I turned round to call my husband, and the prisoner ran away with the pipes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then he was standing quietly for you to see him? A. Yes, at first; but he took his opportunity to run away - I saw him plainly; I knew he lived in the same street, but I could not say the exact house; he came to our house with the same pipes, in two or three days; we had made inquiries in the meantime, and my husband went every where - I never spoke to the prisoner's wife, till the pipes were got: Owen was not tipsy - he was sensible.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner and the pipes at your husband's? A. Yes; a man, named Burke, came first, and then the prisoner - the prisoner received 15s. and Burke 4s. 6d.; the prisoner brought the pipes - we were looking at them to see if they were all in their shape and form, and the prisoner said, "If you don't have them as they are, I will take them away, money and all."</p>

            . On Thursday, the 10th of March, I had been out with my brother, the prosecutor - we had each of us a set of pipes, and we played at a public-house in the Haymarket; we came away together, and went straight home - we got there about a quarter before twelve o'clock; I walked into my house - I met my wife with the candle in her hand; she asked where my brother was - I said he was coming, and to keep the candle there for him; she called me in about three minutes - I saw my brother down, his face bleeding, and his clothes disfigured - on the next Thursday I went to the Sugar Loaf public-house; I saw a man there, named James Burke - I was telling a man, who had pipes there, of my losing my pipes, and that I would not begrudge 1l. to find them - Burke then made a proposal to me; he afterwards came to my house, and after that the prisoner came with the pipes - I gave Burke 19s. 6d.; it was the prisoner brought the pipes - they cost 20l.; I valued them at 7l., but the gentleman valued them at 5l. - they belong to my brother; I had his pipes, and he had mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a man of the name of Barry? A. Not by name - I knew a man of that name in Sligo, but not in London.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A relation came to town on the Wednesday, and on Thursday, the 10th of March, after work, I went to a public-house, and had a pint or two of beer - in coming out a man, named Barry, was opposite; he asked a young man to mind these things till the morning - the young man's mother called him up, and I said,"If you have any thing to leave you can leave them with my wife;" he said, "Yes, and thank you too;" the next morning I told Burke the man had left me a set of bagpipes, and on St. Patrick's day I was drinking; Burke came in, and said, "I know who these pipes belong to, if you will give them to me I will take them home;" I said,"No, I will take them;" the prosecutor only lives three doors from me - I took them there openly; the man was very much obliged to me, and said he was very glad - I said, "If any body took my things I should be much obliged to any one to bring them home."</p>

            . I am the landlord of the Horse Shoe, Titchbourne-street. On a Thursday night in March I saw Owen Cunningham and his brother at my house, at the top of the Haymarket - on the following morning Martin Cunningham called on me, asked for the pipes; he did not complain that his brother had been robbed - I reminded him that he and his brother had gone to another public-house, and he had better go there and look for them.</p>
               <p>JOHN FENNELL. I am in the service of Colonel Burke, of St. Alban's-place, Haymarket. Martin Cunningham came to our stables, and asked me if I knew what he did with his pipes; when he parted from me he and his brother were both intoxicated - one of them fell down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When were you applied to to come here? A. A woman left the summons with me, I think on the 7th- I never saw the prisoner in my life; I was with the prosecutor and his brother at the Crown and Thistle - I cannot tell the day; I left the house with them - I asked them to leave their pipes with me and the landlady till next morning, as they were not capable of taking care of themselves; I went to the top of the Haymarket with them, and they said they were capable of taking care of themselved, which I knew they were not - I lodged at the Crown and Thistle at that time.</p>
               <p>RICHARD ASTLETT. I am a cutler, and live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. On Thursday night, the 10th of March, I was in company with the prisoner at the Bank public-house in King-street - we left about twelve o'clock, or a little after; on coming out a young man asked him if he would be so kind as to take a bundle and mind it for him till the morning - he agreed; the man and I went with him and the bundle to the prisoner's house - I do not know the prosecutors at all, or either of them; I went in with the prisoner, and never left him till the morning - I had been with him from half-past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How many yards is that public-house from his own house? A. I cannot tell, it is not many yards - the back of the public-house comes into Charles-street; his house may be pretty well ten yards from it - I am a travelling cutler, and work in the street; I lodge in Charles-street.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.What is the distance between the prosecutor's and the prisoner's houses? A. It may be twenty or twenty-five yards.</p>

            . I keep the Bank public-house. I remember on the night of the 10th of March the prisoner was at my house till five or ten minutes before twelve o'clock - he had been there, I think, from nine; I was in the house all the time, and had the opportunity of seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070095"/>him every minute - I do not think he could have gone out without my seeing him; he paid for what he had - I have known him twelve months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you take particular notice of your customers? A. I took notice of him; I was sitting a long time in the room where he was, and drank with him - the last witness was with him; two more persons went out with them; there had been others there in the course of the evening, but they did not stay - in going out they passed the bar where I was sitting; I have kept that house twelve months.</p>

The prisoner was in my service - she used to account for what she bought two or three times a week; I found her generally honest, and used to burn the accounts when she gave them to me, and if she had spent any of her own money I paid it her - we paid ready money for every thing but bread; I called on the baker, and said I would pay the bill, meaning the last week's bill - they said there had been a bill ever since the 10th of January, and I had issued money weekly for it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SMOUT. I keep a butcher's-shop, in North-place, Gray's Inn-road. I have been in the habit of supplying the prosecutor, and used to send with the meat a ticket of the weight and price - I never received any money from the master or mistress, but I received of the prisoner 2l. about August last, which is all I received since the 18th of February, 1839; I have now a bill against the prosecutor for 24l. 16s. 2 1/2d. - I recollect on the 17th of February sending in a loin of mutton.</p>
               <p>MAS. GARLAND. I cannot tell what I paid to the prisoner for the butcher's bill - I suppose it might be 12s. or 14s. a week; I used to give her sovereigns and silver for marketing, from 2l. 10s. to 3l. a week - I cannot speak to any particular sum.</p>

On the 26th of March, about nine o'clock, I was coming from Somerset-house, where I had been attending a lady; I met the prisoner and another; an observation passed, which induced me to look at them -I went into my shop, told my young man there were some slippery chaps about, and the window would very likely be cut - I had but just put down my hat, and gone to the fire, when my lad went out, and found the prisoner with his hand in the window; I believe the window had been cut before, though I had not noticed it.</p>
               <p>JAMES TIMSON. I live with the prosecutor. About a quarter or twenty minutes past nine o'clock he came in, and said there were two suspicious looking chaps about the window - I looked, and saw the prisoner with his back to the window; I went into the shop, and saw him draw his hand from the window - I went out after him, and as he was walking away, I went after him, and brought him back - I saw the hole cut in the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was it likely I could see you? A. Yes; you had your head turned, and could see me, or else you would not have walked away at the instant - there was no one else at the window.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is there any case inside? A. Yes, it is inclosed with a glass sliding sash; there is a gas-light close to the window - I have no doubt the prisoner is the person; we missed six combs, and have never found them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at Bow-street that there were two persons at the window, and I ran away.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Goswell-road. I have a saw and a square, pawned at our house on the 28th of February, by the prisoner, in the name of Clarke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. That is in his own name? A. Yes; I have known him five or six years - I did not observe that he was in liquor; I would not say he was not - this was within three doors of the public-house.</p>

               <p>MR. BALDWIN. This is my property - I know it by having it in my possession for twelve years; the prisoner was drinking there all the morning; I saw him there with his companions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How many people had been in that skittle-ground? A. I did not observe any but him- I believe his father died deranged, and when he gets a little liquor he is nearly in the same way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the public-house about ten o'clock that morning, and remained drinking all day; a man called me out, and asked me to take the property to pawn, as I lived in the neighbourhood; when the prosecutor came in, and inquired about his tools I was so overcome with liquor, that I did not tell him.</p>

               <p>GEORGE KEMP. I am a Police-constable. On the 17th of March I saw the prisoners at the prosecutor's house - I watched them; they passed the shop two or three times, and at last they came away with two brushes in their possession - I cannot say where they took them from, but they had been about the house some time; I took them about fifty yards off - I found these brushes on Brown, but they had both been together, and I saw them examining the brushes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MATTHEWS. I am a Police-constable. On the 21st of October, about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another lad near the prosecutor's window, in <placeName id="t18310407-200-crimeloc1079">Bethnal-green-road</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down the road - I heard the Policeman cry Stop thief! I turned, and he took me to the shop; the people said they had lost two hats, but they did not say I took them from there - he then took me to the watch-house, and as we were going he asked if I had any money; he said if I would give him a few shillings I should not be hurt, he would make it all right.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MATTHEWS. I never lost sight of him; I saw him drop the hats close to his heels - I stopped to pick them up, and he gained ground on me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

            . I am errand-boy to the prosecutor. On the 17th of March, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I had to come down stairs - I saw a light in the shop, which rather alarmed me, but I looked through the kitchen window, and saw it was the prisoner; he had a candle close to my master's desk - I wondered how he got there, as the doors were locked; I tried them, and they were fast - he must have got up through a trap-door behind the counter; I went to tell my mistress, and when I came back he was gone, and the light also.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRENDERGRASS. I am an officer. I took the prisoner in his master's house on the 17th of March - I searched him, and found 3s. 4d. in his jacket pocket; I then asked him if he had any more money - he said No, but on further search I found three half-crowns and three shillings in his coat pocket; I questioned him further, and he said he had been out for two hours.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of turning off the gas, and that night I smelt it very strong - I pulled up the flap, and went down into the cellar; I found a vacancy- I went to try the burners; they were all right, and I went to bed again - I went out in the morning, and when I returned I was taken.</p>

On the 27th of March, about half-past ten o'clock, I was standing at my door; the prisoner came by - he was a perfect stranger; he addressed me first, and asked if he might be allowed to walk in - I said he might if he liked, but I had an old lady, her daughter, and son there; he said he did not mind, we would have something to drink altogether, and he would send for something - he came in, and sent my servant with 1s. 6d. for some brandy and gin, which was brought; he and the old lady drank the brandy, and we drank the gin - while my servant was gone he said he would give me four half-crowns to be with me that night, which I accepted; he gave me the four half-crowns, and I put them into my purse - he then sent another 1s. 6d. for more brandy and gin, and he gave 1s. for some cheese; my purse had 2s. 6 1/2d. in it before I put the four half-crowns in - the halfpenny had five holes in it; I had some loose silver and copper in my pocket, but could not say how much - we went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock; I took off my pocket, which had the purse in it, wrapped it in my stays, and put them on the drawers - I was awoke about three or four o'clock by my servant, who said she did not think all was right; I then saw the prisoner dressed, and standing near the drawers - he had been undressed when he went to bed; he heard my servant say she did not think all was right, as she had heard him about the room for half an hour - she said I had better get up and see that all was right; I got up, looked into my pocket, and said I had not got a farthing - I accused him of having my money; he said, "No, I have not;" my servant went for an officer by my desire - he was searched in my presence, and my purse was taken from him - he had denied having it, and said most likely my servant had it; when the Policeman came he again denied having it, but it was found inside the lining of his trousers, near the calf of his leg - the Policeman also found about him two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d.; I can swear to the purse, and the halfpenny with five holes was in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Were you perfectly sober? A. Yes, with the exception of the share of the liquor I had at your expence, which was very little - some of the gin was left in the bottle; I had my perfect recollection - there were six chairs in my sitting-room.</p>
               <p>SARAH ADAMS. I am servant to the prosecutrix - when I first lived with her she was under the care of a gentleman who has gone to sea. On the night stated I was sent out by the prisoner, who was with my mistress, for brandy and gin; I had never seen him there before - he and the elderly lady drank the brandy; her daughter, son, my mistress, and I drank the gin - the prisoner took none of that; I went out a second time for 1s. 6d. worth more liquor, which was disposed of in the same way - I then fetched - lb. of cheese, for which the prisoner gave me 1s. and I paid 7 1/2d. for it; the prisoner went to bed with my mistress - he awoke me by walking about the room, but I cannot say the time; I slept in the adjoining room - I called, and asked if he wanted to go out; he said No - I laid down again; I heard him rustling about again for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070100"/>about half an hour - I again asked if he wanted to go out; he said Yes - I said, "I will get you a light;" I got on my gown and shawl, and said,"I will let you down," but I first awoke my mistress, and asked if all was right - I then went down for a light; when I came up my mistress was standing with her pocket in her hand, empty, and she said, "Adams, I have not a farthing in the world;" I said, "Perhaps you have put your money somewhere;" she said, "No, I am certain I put it into my pocket, and rolled the pocket up in my stays;" I looked about every where I thought it could be - she then accused the prisoner, and said, "You must have my purse and money;" she said, "Give me the purse, and I will forgive you all, for my friend gave it me, and I would not lose it for the world;" he denied it, and said he had not got it, she might search him, and she did put her hand inside his pockets-I said to him, "You must have it;" he said, "It is more likely you have got it a great deal;" my mistress then cried, and said, "Do give it me, there is a good man;" he still denied having it - she then said, "I will not lose my purse," and she desired me to get an officer; when the officer came the prisoner still denied it, but the officer found the purse within the lining of his trousers, near the calf of his leg - he had denied over and over again having the purse or money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you tell the number of persons who were sitting in the room? A. Yes, there were five besides myself - I did not state at Worship-street that there were seven; I did not say, "Have you fleeced him?" she is not a person of that character.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLAY. I am a Police-constable. I was called to that house between three and four o'clock on the Sunday morning; I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in the bed-room - he was dressed; the servant had come for me; the prosecutrix was partly dressed - she accused the prisoner of stealing a purse, containing 12s. 6 1/2d.; he denied any knowledge of it till I found it in the lining of his trousers, just below the knee - this is the purse; there is 12s. 6 1/2d. in it - the halfpenny has five holes in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I deny having any money in my pocket independent of that purse? A. No - I found on you two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d.; it was taken from you at the station, but the inspector returned it to you next morning.</p>
               <p>S.E. BOTTLEY. This is my purse, and the money in it; here is the halfpenny with five holes in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You will find in the deposition that she stated she had four shillings loose in her pocket, and there were not four shillings found - her servant said to her,"Mrs. Jones, is all right, have you fleeced him?" the truth is, she was in such a disgusting state of intoxication that I got up, and said I would not stay with her - when she got to the watch-house, and found I had more money about me, she wanted to make a further charge; I am a clerk in the City.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLAY. The prosecutrix was perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>HONOR CULLIS. I slept in the next room to the prosecutor, who is apprenticed to my husband - it is usual for the lodger who last left the room to bring the key into our room; the prisoner brought it between eight and nine o'clock on the 7th of March - I put it on the shelf for about six hours; when I went to make the bed, I found a bed-screw under the quilt - the box appeared to have been broken open with that.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS. On the 31st of March I apprehended the prisoner and another boy who lodged in this room - they were discharged; Blease came to my house next morning, when I was out; he came a second time, and said he had come about the clothes - I said, "I thought you had done with that;" he said he came to tell me where they were, that he was the party who stole them, and said he did not confess at the office as he did not wish to implicate an innocent young man, and he would take me to where they were pawned, in the name of Smith - I went with him, and there we found them; he has got a bad father, but I believe bears a good character himself.</p>

On Saturday night, the 12th of February, I was coming to the shop, No. 1. - I was in a dark passage, and saw the prisoner and Gibson coming towards me; they came to my shop, held their coats over a piece of beef, and brought it away between them under their coats; Gibson had the beef at first, and gave it to the prisoner - I stopped them, and said, "What have you there?" they turned round, said nothing, but threw the beef down between them - I hallooed out, and a man picked it up; the prisoner was taken on Good Friday, which was six weeks after - I knew him before; I had a warrant to search his house, but he had left it - Gibson has been tried.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you did not see him till Good Friday? A. I saw him once, but was too far off to get him; he laughed at me, and ran away out of Wylie's house - I had nobody to mind my shop while I followed him; I cannot swear I have not seen him three times at night in another dress - I might not know him - I saw him but once by day-light; I have known him four years; I very likely may have quarrelled with him - he was a witness for me here once, and said he could not swear to the man, though he had known him six years; this was about three years ago, when my shop was broken open - he has been impudent to me in the street.</p>

               <p>GEORGE KETTERES. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. This coat and handkerchief were delivered to the prosecutor on the 10th - it was pawned by the prisoner on the 8th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning; he said it was his own - that he worked at the docks; I talked to him for some time, and knew him.</p>

               <p>JAMES CHAMBERS. I am a Policeman. On the Friday Davy came to the station-house, and said he had found this property over night - I went to his house, and brought it from there; he is since deceased - his body was found on Saturday, previous to the Grand Jury sitting, and an inquest have returned a verdict of wilful murder against some persons unknown.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SCOTCHMER. I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of March; he said he knew what it was about, for he had heard about it, and that the night before he was coming from the doctor's, and met a man, who asked if he knew where Davy lived - that he took him there, and told him he had brought the man who owned the turpentine, but that he had had nothing more to do with it.</p>

               <p>CHARLES SCOTCHMER. I am a Policeman. Attfield called me to assist in securing the prisoners - the lead was then in the chimney-sweeper's house; we tied one of each of their hands together - one of them tried to untie it; he said,"What are you going to do with us? you can do nothing; where is the prosecutor? where is the man that owns it?" the lead was in two parcels, and weighs 105lbs. - I saw it applied to the roof; it completely fitted the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Reeves put in a written Defence, stating that he was desired by an inmate at the asylum, who he did not know, to take the lead out for him; that he met Jay, and got him to assist.</p>

On the 19th of February, I saw Mr. Hornby near the London Apprentice- I saw the prisoner in company with another boy, lay hold of Mr. Hornby's coat pocket; I was in plain clothes - he turned round, saw me, and I suppose knew me, for he let go of it; I crossed over to the other side, saw him following Mr. Hornby, watched him, and near the City-road, I saw the prisoner put his hand into the pocket, take the handkerchief out, and give it to the other, who ran away with it directly - I informed Mr. Hornby, and fetched the prisoner back, without losing sight of him; I had seen him before - I think I should know the other lad.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What took you to the spot? A. I was going on an errand - I live with my father, and sell fruit about the street; I was not acquainted with Batcheler - I know all the prisoners perfectly well; I did not see the cap taken.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 24th of February, at near eight o'clock at night, I heard the call of Police, and took Batcheler and Stanford - Burk secured two more; the whole five were together - I charged them with stealing the cap, having seen Mrs. McMahon; I saw one of them throw what appeared to me to be a cap into the road, but I could not secure it - I took Batcheler, Stanford, and Kelly to the station-house; I afterwards went and took he other two from Batcheler's information, as he said, as we went along, "If you won't hurt me I will tell you who stole the cap, and where it is;" I took the others to the station, and went back with him - he showed me where they had thrown the cap, and I found on Griffiths a knife, which the cap had been cut with; the cap had been cut, for the peak, which has been found, has part of the leather fastened to it - I only found the peak where Batcheler took me; it was thrown down an area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take on yourself to say that Griffiths cut the cap? A. No, but he is the only one who had the knife - when I took Batcheler he had Kelly's old cap on; I found his own cap next morning in a field- Batcheler did not say he had taken the cap himself.</p>
               <p>MRS. McMAHON. I swear this is the peak of my boy's cap; it is leather - I know it, because I beat him severely for breaking it at school; this is broken in two places, the same as his was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That accident might happen to any other cap? A. I know this is the peak - my husband made it himself, and there are a great many more holes in it than necessary, as he did not understand the mode of putting it on.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BATCHELER. I am nearly fourteen years old. I was in company with the prisoners on the 24th of February, and saw Mrs. McMahon's son outside the door Griffiths said to him, "I have lost a halfpenny down here, and if you like to find it you may keep it for yourself;" he stooped to look for it, and Griffiths snatched off his cap and put his own on the boy's head - he then took his own off his head again, and ran away; the boy's cap looked like a new one - the other three prisoners were with him at the time; he gave his cap to Kelly, who said, "I am d - d if I don't wear this cap;" I said, "Kelly, mine is a poor old cap, you may as well give me yours;" I saw all this done.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say? A. They were going up higher to steal a till - they had a leg of mutton, and a batter pudding the night before; I told him to give the cap back to the boy, but he would not - I was taken in a quarter of an hour, and told of this directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go and tell Mrs. McMahon? A. They all ran away, and I with them - Griffiths cut the peak off the cap with an iron handled knife, he chucked it down an area, and then put it on Kelly's head; I have known the prisoners about three months, but did not keep company with them - I live with my parents; my father sells watercresses, and I go about with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went about every day with water-cresses? A. Except being in the House of Correction for a month with Stanford, when they took him, and me for being with him - he has been there sixteen times; I was never there but once - I did not keep up an acquaintance with him: I was going out to call my brother to tea this day, and I met him - we had not been out of prison two hours then - they made me go with them, for Griffiths snatched off my cap to make me come, and said he was going to get a batter pudding; it was not my cap that was put on the boy's head - I meant to tell the first officer I met of it; I was always brought up honest - Griffiths only threw the peak into the area; he threw the cap into an old iron-shop - I took the officer to the shop in half an hour, but he could not find it; I got my cap back in the morning.</p>
               <p>Stanford's Defence. I deny all Batcheler has said - he did not go to find the cap till the morning.</p>
               <p>Kelly's Defence. He said he would go and nick the cap, and we ran on; when he went home he asked Griffiths to lend him his knife, and he cut the peak off - he knocked my cap off, then picked it up, and said my cap was on his head.</p>
               <p>Gander's Defence. Batcheler said, "Here is a half-penny for you," and when the boy stopped, he knocked off his hat, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Griffiths, Gander, and Kelly received a good character.</p>

            . I am a servant, and live in Leonard-street. On the 29th of March, about five o'clock, I overtook the prisoners in Newgate-street - they were quite strangers to me; I only saw the male prisoner at first; they were not walking together - he was stooping when I overtook him, and said he had picked something up; he went on, stopped, and I overtook him again three or four yards further; then he showed me some earrings; he went on to the corner of Newgate-street - he had not walked above a dozen yards altogether when he showed a parcel to me; he said he had picked them up, and was never so lucky in his life before as to pick any thing up of any value - I said, "Have you?" he then crossed over to the New Post-office, and near the Bull and Mouth, St. Martin's-le-grand, I saw him again on the same side of the way as I was on; he showed me an ear-ring and ring - I had seen the ring before; he asked me to read the bill for him; they were tied in paper; I read it - the amount was 5l. 18s. 6d., it was for a pair of ear rings and two gold rings - we gave it to the Magistrate at Guildhall, and it has not been returned- he asked if I would buy them, and said I should have them for 1l.; that he was in distress, and a little money would be more useful to him than the parcel - (I did not see the female prisoner till the man was taken into custody;) I said I could not, and then he said I should have them for 15s.; I gave him 14s. 6d. for them - he then left me, and I did not see him any more till he was taken into custody - I took the ear-rings and rings; the officer, who had been watching, came up, and asked if I had bought any thing; I delivered them to him - he took both the prisoners into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not at first deny to the officer that you had bought any thing? A. Yes; I then walked on five or six yards; the officer spoke to me again - I told him, and delivered them to him; I did not suppose I had done wrong; the prisoner stopped and spoke to me first.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I am an officer of the Post-office. On the 29th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners in company, going backward and forward in Newgate-street, which excited my suspicion I saw the man follow the prosecutrix down Newgate-street, and show her something in a paper; he followed her to the end of Jewin-street, and suddenly parted from her - the female who was in his company kept on the opposite side; I told the street-keeper to call the prosecutrix back, and just at that moment the male prisoner crossed over, gave something to the female, and said,"Here is 14s. 6d.;" I took hold of them, pushed them into a house, and took the 14s. 6d. out of the female's hand - I am certain they were in company; she was very reluctant to give up the 14s. 6d., and dropped a ring out of her hand; it appeared a wedding-ring - I searched the male prisoner, and found in his waistcoat pocket a strip of paper, on which was written "Two pairs of gold ear-rings, two gold keys," amounting to 5l. 18s. 6d.; I gave that paper to the Magistrate, and it was lost - the street-keeper came back to me, and said the prosecutrix had bought nothing; I sent him back again; he brought her back, and said she had bought the ear-rings - I found a key in the male prisoner's pocket; I searched his lodgings in Green-street, Commercial-road, and on his shelf found another paper, with the same words on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say they were together - had you your eyes on them the whole time? A. I cannot say that I had; I saw them for four or five minutes before he addressed the prosecutrix, and saw him speak to several young women, which excited my suspicion - he was standing when the prosecutrix passed him; he then went in front of her.</p>
               <p>MARIA ANN COPELAND. I am matron of Giltspur-street Compter. When the female prisoner was brought in the officer requested me to search her - I took her into an adjoining room, and saw her put her hand to her bonnet I felt her bonnet, and said, "What have you here?" she said, "Nothing but curl-papers;" I said, "I insist on searching, for there is something more;" she was going to strike me - I turned to call the officer, and when I returned with him, she approached towards me, and said, "You may now search me," and I picked a paper off the ground, containing four rings.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAWK RIGGE. I am a street-keeper. Tyrrell beckoned to me about the middle of Aldersgate-street - I followed the prosecutrix, and asked her to return with me, and if she had bought any thing - she said No, at first; she afterwards gave me the ear-rings and a mourning-ring- I have also those picked up in the prison, and have had them ever since.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the Tuesday before the 5th of March, I was in Hopkin-street, St. James; I saw the prisoner carry something under his arm, into an old iron-shop - I followed him, and saw he had this pair of boots and this chaise rug; he asked if they bought such things - the girl saw me behind him, and said they did not; I asked what he had got - he said an old rug which his master had given him to cut for horse-cloths - I went to inquire at a place he sent me to, and it was denied - I said to him the next morning, "It was useless for you to give me so much trouble last night;" he said, "I will not give you any more trouble; I took the rug from Howard's livery-stable, in Jermyn-street;" the boots, he said, were his own, and he was in distress - his wife and children appeared to be so.</p>

             COX. I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 4th of April I was in St. John-street - I saw the prisoner and another come out of the <placeName id="t18310407-244-crimeloc1308">Pewter Platter-yard</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He took you to the yard where he said he found the harness? A. Yes, but I had seen him come out there - this was about half-past twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Samuel Ewins, a bookbinder, who lives in Duke-street, Smithfield - he has a coach-house in Pewter Platter-yard. On the afternoon of the 4th of April I fastened the door of the coach-house, leaving this harness inside it - I found the door broken open, and the padlock broken; this is his harness.</p>

               <p>Mr. Turner will thank the landlord of the Bell and Crown to let the bearer have the box left by the Hoxton carrier - I consider him very neglectful in not leaving it at my house yesterday, as the young man told me it would be delivered by one o'clock yesterday.</p>
               <p>Bath-street, March 24, 1831.</p>
               <p>Directed to Mr. Walker, Bell and Crown, Kingsland-road. I said I thought it very strange, as two persons had been for it before, I would go and get the carrier - I went and got an officer, and when I came back the prisoner was gone; I saw him again in company with the officer - I let him have the trunk, and charged him 5s. 3d. for it; he said he was going to take it to the corner of the mad-house, but he wished us to go with him - I went on with him and the officer: as we were going on I said to the prisoner,"Suppose you don't meet the person you expect at the corner of the mad-house, where are you going to take the trunk?" he said, "I shall take it to No. 22, Bath-street, and ask for 1s.:" there was no man at the corner, and we went to No. 22, Bath-street - they said they knew nothing of the trunk nor the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He never varied in his account of the transaction? A. No - he said the man had given him 5s. 6d. to pay for the trunk; it was a half-crown and three shillings, and I gave him 3d. change; the trunk came on the Thursday; I had two persons apply for it on Friday - the prisoner came on Saturday; it should have been left at Hoxton before it arrived at my house - the prisoner did not state to me, on leaving my house, that he was going to get a bit of steak to have it dressed at the house; he did not return till he was brought back by the officer - I had told the officer a man had come for the box, and I told him to go and take care of it; I understood when the officer went there the prisoner went out, and he went after him - he found him about one hundred yards from the house; I saw him find him - he had no meat with him; I suppose I was about five minutes gone for the officer - I did not leave any one to take care of the prisoner; I said I was going for the carrier - the box was in the house at the time, but I believe the prisoner did not see it; it was before the box had been delivered to him, that I went for the officer - I then delivered him the box, for the purpose of seeing where he would take it; he then said he would not take it unless some one went with him.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the Thursday before the 17th of March I was on duty at the bottom of St. James'-street; I saw the prisoner, and watched him some time; he went up against gentlemen's pockets, and when he got thicker into the crowd, I saw him with the handkerchief in his hand, just behind a gentleman; I seized him, and pulled his hand out of his pocket, with the handkerchief in it - there were three other handkerchiefs found on him in going to the station-house, and a snuff-box; I said to him, "How came an old man like you to do this?" he said, "What is a poor fellow to do?"</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What reply did I make when you said to the other man, "I thought if I did not know him you would?" A. I never heard it said by myself or any one else; when I took hold of you I threw you into a clear place, and the only word I said to you was, "An old man like you, how came you to do it," and your reply was, "What is a poor fellow to do?" your right-hand pocket was ripped open, so that what was put into it might go down; the man you took it from might be rather stouter than you, and between thirty and forty he had a close body coat on; I cannot say what colour; I do not suppose he was more than two yards off you; no sooner had I seized you, than the swell mob came round to try to get you away, and we were surrounded by the Policemen: there were four handkerchiefs produced before the Magistrate - you were very likely committed to Tothill-fields, I do not know; the charge was for picking pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not the means of procuring the document from the Police-office, and it appears now that your Lordship has only the second depositions; the depositions taken on the 10th of March were to the effect, solely that these men arrested me on suspicion, and found the handkerchiefs and snuff-box on my person - all the documents ought to be before your Lordship; and if a legal process takes place, and a man is put into prison, and brought before a superior tribunal, surely you will not hesitate to send for this first document; there it is in black and white, "Receive into your custody so and so, on suspicion of feloniously taking," &amp;c.; cases of this nature are so common and notorious, that they have been scouted from Westminster-hall, and therefore it is that they have come here - these men have scouted the charge of suspicion, and now bring the charge of felony; and why or wherefore? because they found I was poor and friendless, or I should have discovered that the other was nothing but a common hireling, ready to come on any occasion; the difference to them is the difference of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070115"/>going to prison, and the money they will get for coming here a second time and charging a felony; but will your Lordship upheld the doctrine, and countenance the practice that a man sworn to execute the law should one day apprehend a prisoner, and swear to one fact, and then a week afterwards swear to a contrary fact? Can two contrary facts both be true? one of them must necessarily be false-will your Lordship condescend to send for the depositions taken on the 10th of March, and also for the original warrant of commitment to Tothill-fields.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Was the charge on suspicion of felony? A. Yes; I charged him with picking the pocket of a gentleman unknown - the Magistrate has sent all the depositions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Surely your Lordship must wish to administer justice, and surely the delay of half an hour cannot be of importance. There is the document in the office, and here are twelve gentlemen come to swear that they will return a true verdict. If the Magistrate had done his duty, you would have had the depositions taken on 10th of March.</p>
               <p>COURT. We have now got your commitment, and it is precisely in the form of the present charge, for stealing a handkerchief from a man unknown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is the reason why I asked if the whole four handkerchiefs were produced before the Magistrate, and I was charged on suspicion of them all - only a mere bailable charge; and you can have that evidence before you in half an hour; and surely, however depressed I may be, I have a right to justice. I hope your Lordship will send an officer for it, who is not interested in suppressing it.</p>

            . Q. How long have you known Dorrell? A. Very likely twelve months - I have seen him, but not to speak to him, before that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to GEORGE DORRELL. Q. How long was it after you saw this taken that you seized me? A. Directly, and I prevented it from going to the bottom of your pocket-I do not know that I unbuttoned your pocket;I might pull your hand away from it - I did not feel your pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If this doctrine is held forth that a witness may come one day and swear one fact, and another day a directly contrary fact, what individual could he safe? The witness charges me one day on suspicion of felony -I suspect he stole it" - and a week after he comes and days,"I charge him with stealing it; I saw him steal it." In the first instance more than half the truth was kept back, or in the second more than the truth was stated. I was passing the Green-park, saw a person look around him, and place something at the root of a tree; I pretended not to observe him; but when he went away, I went and found the handkerchiefs and a snuff-box - I went on, and was obstructed by the crowd; a hand pressed on my thigh, and a voice exclaimes, "John, here is one of them," the same person unbuttoned my pocket, and took out tow handkerchiefs, which I had put into that pocket, and I had two in the other pocket - I was then taken to the office, and there these men stated they arrested me on suspicion - the Magisrate asked if they had seen me take any thing; they said No. I do not know whether it was the same magistrate that I saw on the 17th, but if so, he had forgotten it, and I did not think it my business to put him in mind of it - they had in the interim found that I was poor and friendless, and they said, "Let us change the ground, and make a direct theft of it, and have a day or two's lounge-City fare is pretty good," and here they are, from the first day to the last or the last but one, and can any man be astonished that a man should come here to swear for 30s.or 40s, when it is well known that there are hundreds and thousands who will swear for half a crown.</p>

               <p>MR.

               <p>March 7,1831. Miss BREWER.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this I gave the prisoner the goods as near the order as possible - I had not seven yards of silk, so I sent a remnant of ten yards and a half; I had sent two yards and a half of black silk, and three-quarters of a yard of crimson on the Saturday - the ten and a half I sent was black, as that is a more general article; I also sent four skeins of sewing silk, and I think two sheets of wadding and three yards of black ribbon, half an inch wide, as ordered; I did that, believing the signature to be genuine, and the hand-writing of the lady who was governess in Mr. Wyat's family - I have many times before acted upon a written order from that lady; Mr. Wyat soner is the person who had the things.</p>

            . I the service of Mr. Cordwell, a pawnbroker, in Exmouth-street, on the 12th of March the prisoner brought this plane to out shop - he pawned it for 6d, in the name of John Davies, for his father; he came twice to the shop with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not on the first occasion doubt whether this was the person?</p>
               <p>A. I did not recognize him in the first instance, but that was on a different charge; his brother was brought up, and while he was gone for his brother another person asked if I knew him, and I said No - there is a brotherly likeness between them; I believe he is older, but not so tall- I did not express a doubt whether the prisoner was the person who pawned the plane; I did not entertain any doubt about that.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 5th of April I saw some sashes behind a caravan, in the road near the Small Pox-hospital - Souter was standing by them; I afterwards saw the prisoner and Minifi, who were in conversation, but I could not tell what they said; I went up, and took the prisoner and Souter - the prisoner said he had bought the sashes on the 4th of April, at a sale over the water, but he could not tell the place, or the auctioneer's name - he gave me his address, which I found correct; the people said he had lived there eight months, but they did not know how he got his living.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. It is not an uncommon thing to have sales over the water? A. No; I did not see the sashes in any cart.</p>

            . I am porter, and lodge in King-street, Borough. On the 4th of April I was standing to be hired at London-bridge; the prisoner came and engaged me to carry some sash-frames to Battle-bridge the next morning, and the next morning, at half-past five, or a quarter before six o'clock, he took me to Joiner-street, Tooley-street - there were gates and a yard there; the bar was down - the prisoner opened the gates; I saw these sashframes there, on a tank, and the prisoner helped them on my knot - I carried them; I asked him whether I should go over London-bridge, as that was the nearest way, but he said he wanted to go to the Borough-market - I went on, he with me, and when we got to a joiner's shop, I pitched them down, and untied them - he went to a man named Minifi; the Policeman came, and took me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Then you were taken as well as the prisoner? A. Yes; I said he took them out of the yard, and so he did - I was not afraid I should be tried; I am a jobbing porter - I hand known the prisoner before; he had not paid me - I often do jobs without knowing what I shall have for them: the sashes were all tied up when he opened the gates, and he took them.</p>

I have seen these ten sashes - they are my masters; I cannot tell what they are worth - they had been kept in the first floor warehouse near the counting - house; there was a considerable quantity of goods there, and these were behind the other things I went about ten o'clock in the morning of the 5th of April, and missed them; there was a lock on the back gate adjoining Joiner-street, and that had been forced, and then they must have crossed the premises; I should not have known how the gate could have been opened after the lock was off, till the Policeman showed me how the chain could be slipped over the bar; I had no suspicion of the sashes being lost till the policeman came - they would have been in the loft for twelve months; there was nothing removed on the Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were they new sashes? A. No, old ones, purchased at the old buildings in a street adjoining Tolley-street, some months ago - I do not know when; I had seen them in the loft very likely a month before - there were three blank panes in one of them- I have seen the prisoner at the premises - he came and said he was doing business for this gentleman, and that gentleman; he came there under pretence of buying, and laid out perhaps a few pence - I took his money, but it was very little.</p>

On the 6th of March I went to a public-house in Wentworth-street - I had a pint or two of beer; I asked for a bed, and they could not let me have one, but recommended me to a private house just by - I went there, and went to bed; I counted what money I had before I went to bed; I had two crowns and three half-crowns, and I put them into my trousers pocket - there was a candle in the room; when I had been in bed about twenty minutes, I saw a woman come into the room with nothing on her but her shift - she came to my bed-side; I asked what she wanted - she said to come to bed to me; I had placed my trousers, with my money in them, under my head, but when I looked round I saw them on the floor, near to the prisoner - I got out of bed, examined my trousers pockets, and missed the three half-crowns and one of the 5s. pieces; I accused the prisoner of robbing me - she could not speak, on account of having something in her mouth; I seized her, and in the scuffle the candle went out - I called the people of the house, and sent for a Policeman; when he was coming up the stairs the prisoner put a crown-piece and a half-crown into my hand, and said she would make it all up before the Policeman came - I said I would not till she gave me the other two half-crowns; I saw she had something in her mouth - I seized her throat, and grappled with her, but I have never seen the other two half-crowns since; I detained her till the officer came in- I had had a pint or two of beer, just to refresh myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in bed when he came into the house; he asked if there was any woman in the house - he heard me cough, and said, "That is a woman's voice." Witness. No, I did not; I did not get out of bed and let her in in her shift.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How came you to go there for a bed? A. I had been to some friends, then went to the public-house, and as I felt myself fatigued I thought I would get a bed there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say, "If you think I have any money, where have I got to put it?" and then you asked the woman to send for an officer; I did not offer to go away - I did not put this money into your hand. Witness. Yes, you put the money in my hand in the dark.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.What hour was it? A. A quarter before eight o'clock - I had never seen the prisoner before, and did not know she was in the house till she came to my bed-side; I suspected it was a house of ill-fame when I got into it, and that made me count my money - I never was in the house before; I am not married.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the night of the 6th of March I was in Wentworth-street; I was called, and went to the house, where I found the prisoner and the prosecutor on the second floor - the prosecutor was standing in his shirt, and the prisoner in her shift; I took a light with me - there was no light in the room; the prosecutor said she had robbed him of 12s. 6d. - he held out his hands, and said, "Here is what she has given me back," holding a crown-piece in one of his hands, and a half-crown in the other - I took the prisoner to the station-house, but found nothing on her; the prosecutor appeared sensible of what was going on - there was a partition between the room his bed was in and the other; that house makes up from seventy to eighty beds- they are all in narrow slips; the partitions only go up about six or seven feet high - it is more like a rabbit-warren than any thing else; any person might throw any thing over the partition; I have had several charges from that house.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in New-way, Westminster. On the night of Tuesday, the 5th, or rather on Wednesday morning, the 6th of April, I saw the prisoner being taken to the watch-house - I followed him, and saw him put his hand up as if he was going to put it into his waistcoat pocket; I then saw his hand drop, and saw this paper laying twisted up on the ground - I went up to the watch-house, and heard the charge - the prisoner was then set at liberty; I was going back, and the prisoner came to near the same place where I had seen the paper lay - he seemed to be looking about for something, or I should not have thought of looking; I then looked, and found this paper, with half a crown in it - this was in about seven or eight minutes after I first saw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taken to the watch-house, and this man followed - what money I had about me, which was some copper, was returned to me; I stripped, dressed again, and as I was going away this man stooped down, and said, "I have picked up half a crown;" I was then taken back - the Policeman gave her a half-crown, and it fell through a hole in her pocket - it was a French pocket, in front of her apron; Bartholomew swore he saw me put my hand into my pocket.</p>

On the 31st of March I was coming from the back part of the shop, and saw the prisoner in front of the counter - he took up a parcel; I asked him what he wanted, and he told me a gentleman had sent that parcel from Holborn - I said No, it was one I had put on the counter; his breast looked bulky, and I stepped to the door to look for an officer - I turned round, and saw the prisoner placing these bottles and this chandelier knob on the counter, but I did not see from what part of his person he produced them; the constable came in in about half an hour, and I gave the prisoner into custody - these are the bottles and the knob; they are Mr. Simmons' property - there were some odd drops, as patterns in the parcel which he took up; I had received it a short time before, from an out-door workman - these bottles had been on a shelf above the counter, and the knob on a shelf by the side of the counter.</p>

On the night of the 29th of March I stopped the prisoner in Maiden-lane, Islington, at half-past nine o'clock - I saw her before I stopped her, in company with a young man, who had this bundle under his arm; he gave it to the prisoner, and they separated - she came on, and he staid in the road; they had not seen me or Harris, who was with me - the prisoner then came on, and as soon as she got sight of me, she dropped the bundle; the young man ran across the fields - this is the bundle, it contains the articles stated; they were wet when I took them.</p>
