               <p>May it please your lordship, and you, gentlemen of the jury, the prisoner at the bar, William Patmore, stands charged with the wilful murder of his wife; murdered, if true, in a most cruel and deliberate way. Gentlemen, you have heard the charge stated to you by the officer, that by confinement and for want of food, he has been the death of his nearest and dearest relation. Gentlemen, it becomes my duty, though a very painful one, indeed, to state a case of his kind to you, to charge a man with wilful murder, for which this prosecution is taken up by the officers of the parish, who think it their duty whenever a death happens by violence, or any suspicion lights upon any person that has been the occasion of this death, to bring the case before a court and jury; having no wish but that justice should take place, and that you should judge in publick of the prisoner how far he is guilty of this charge; a more serious one cannot come before a court of justice. But, gentlemen. the more serious the charge is, the stricter evidence you will require. If you are perfectly satisfied that he is guilty of murder, I am sure you will pronounce him so by your verdict. Gentlemen, the prisoner was a <rs id="t17890225-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">staymaker</rs>

She then was conveyed from the lodging where she lived, in a hackney coach, to the house of the prisoner; she was unable to walk, and was therefore carried up into the back garrat of the prisoner's house; he cohabiting at the same time with another woman, in the same house; in this back garrat there was no fire-place, and only one chair; and the only thing she had to lay upon was some garden mats; the only thing to cover her was some sackcloth: in that situation, with child, and lame, there it was she was confined and unable to stir. Before he brought her home, and after he had brought her home, he declared that she should have no other assistance and support but the rind of rusty pieces of bacon, rotten potatoes, cold turnips, and now and then a dry herring. From the month of November till the month of January she continued in that state; but she was so weak and so ill at the time, that when he tried the experiments of putting the miserable food which he brought her at a distance and out of her reach, she was unable to get at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250004"/>it. At another time he lost the window and the door open; but she was unable to shut either, because she was weak and seeble. On the third of January she was delivered of a child, which child soon died. She continued alive till the 25th of January, and then departed this life. Her death, and the declaration the prisoner had frequently made, not only that he would dispose of the child by selling it, but likewise of his deceased wife, created an alarm in the neighbourhood; the officers of the parish went there, and found this woman in a most miserable situation: surgeons attended the coroner, but not knowing any thing of the treatment she had met with, observed on her person no particular marks, or any thing to which they could, from outward appearance, say was the cause of her death; there was a mortification on her back, but that might be owing to her laying hard, and receiving injury from the coldness of the weather, which was remarkably cold, and having no bed. However, some time after, two surgeons were sent for, and the body was opened: on opening the body, they found in the stomach but a very small quantity (about a tea cup full) of fluid; the intestines were entirely empty; in short, by the appearance of the inside, they had little doubt but that this woman got her death by being deprived of natural food. Gentlemen, that circumstance alone, independant of any other, would certainly not be sufficient to induce you to find any one guilty of starving a person to death; because the emptiness of the stomach, the emptiness of the intestines, may be from natural causes; from illness, from a desire of not taking food, from inability of digestion: you will therefore not argue merely on that circumstance, but couple together the circumstances of the treatment she met with from him, with the examination of the body, and the observation of the surgeons; and taking both together you will consider whether they do not convince you, that this woman met with her death by the hard usuage, and by the want of food which she experienced at the time; upon this you are to judge, first, whether she met with her death from the want of necessary food, which she ought to have received; the next consideration is, whether that man, who is her husband, in whose care and custody this woman was, whether it was not his duty to have supported her, by giving her that food which nature required. Gentlemen, this case which I have opened, I am sure you all shudder at; but at the same time I am sure you will hear it with coolness and impartiality; you will not let the action, cruel as it is, influence your minds against the prisoner; but you will judge on the evidence coolly and dispationately; and if that evidence convinces you that he has been the wicked instrument of depriving that woman of life, it become your duty to pronounce him guilty: if, on the other hand, a doubt should remain on your minds much better, he should be acquitted. Gentlemen, among the rest of the testimony which I have to lay before you, is the testimony of one, which I feel it my duty to state to you, though I state it with reluctance. I have among the list of my witnesses, a daughter of this man, who was the daughter of the deceased; and perhaps I shall find myself bound to call her before you. It is a painful talk upon me to call a child against a parent; it is what nature shudders at; but in a crime like that, where a man has deprived of life the tenderest and nearest relation, I do not know whether I am justified in keeping back any witness whatever. She is a girl of 12 years old; you will see her, and you will judge; and from you I wish to receive my instructions, whether I ought or ought not to call her; she shall be produced; but I will not stain your minds by opening a single circumstance that that child can prove; if it is to come, I would rather it should come from her mouth than from mine. Gentlemen, I will now call the witnesses; and if the facts are proved clearly, that none of you have a doubt, it will then become your painful duty to pronounce him guilty. If, on the other hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250005"/>either my witnesses should fail in proving it or he, by producing witnesses, can prove to your satisfaction that he has not been the instrument of her death, I, for one, shall rejoice in your verdict of acquittal.</p>

I have done every thing in my power to bring the offender to justice.</p>

I went again; I believe then she had been ten or eleven weeks in that situation; this was the third time; I think I can recollect the time, for William Patmore came to me on the 10th, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250006"/>was there the Sunday before; and he gave me a receipt for 18 s. it is dated on the 10th of January. I was at his house on the Sunday before; he dated it for Saturday, saying it would not stand good on Sunday. When I was there, I asked him if he would let me go up, and let her write to a gentleman she knew, one Mr. Austens, and I would try to get her two or three guineas, to get her into the hospital or workhouse: I made that an excuse to go up stairs; and after that, with a long persuasion, he let me go up stairs. He did not know I had any thing in my pocket. I found her in the same back garret, and it was very wet then, but I did not see any wet the other time. The first word she said then, she told me she was very dry; then I gave her a bottle of beer that I had under my arm; and I opened a handkerchief full of victuals; and I told her to keep her spirits up, and I would try to get her out of that situation. I had apples, and onions, and bread and cheese in my handkerchief; she was very fond of onions and bread and cheese; I had halt a quartern loaf, and in my pocket I had some beef steak pudding, which I gave her. She was sitting on the mat; there was no bed, nor do I know that there was any fire-place; she had nothing but the mat, and a piece of wood to put under her head: there was no chair, nor stool, nor nothing. Then I came down stairs, and found he was blowing the fire, to make a good fire against I came down. I told him it was a shocking thing for her to be in that situation, and she had better go to the parish.

I said I should tell the parish officers; and he said no parish officers should come there. I have told you the heads of it. He said she should not go, she should stay there, and I should never see her any more.</p>

The first time you came to my house, Mrs. Butter, did not you come rather forward in liquor, or apparently very full of talk, and abusive; and did not you send my little girl out for a quartern of rum, and go up stairs and give that woman some rum; and did not I say we were not used to such liquors in our house, we cannot afford it. The first time she came to my house, I believe, to the best of my knowledge, was on a Sunday evening? - It was the middle of the week; he was at his stay work.</p>
               <p>Did not you send for a quartern of rum to treat she and yourself? - I sent for a quartern of rum, and desired Mr. Patmore to let her have half a glass; and he said she should have no such indulgence; I paid sixpence for it; I sent for it really and solely for this poor creature to have half a glass of it; I did not send for it for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she half a glass of it? - Yes, she had, I know she had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you give it to her yourself? - No, you would not suffer me to go up.</p>
               <p>Court. Then how do you know she had it? - He said he would send her up half a glass; and I said directly, I am an unbelieving Jew; unless you let me take it up myself, I shall not believe she has it; and my child, a little girl of eleven years old, carried it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I ever refuse your going up stairs to see her till the last time, on account of disturbance; and did not I tell you she had plenty of victuals, more than you had? - No, you said potatoes and rinds of bacon, and that was sufficient.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say she had plenty of food? - Yes, he said she had plenty; and what was she more than a felon?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not the deceased say that she was particularly fond of rinds of bacon, being with child? - She has dined with me several times, and I never heard her mention such a word.</p>
               <p>Did she say so then? - No.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250007"/>Did she say so at any time? - I never heard her mention it.</p>
               <p>Did not she say that she could eat half a dozen herrings at a meal, if she could get them, with a sufficiency of potatoes: when you asked her what she had had for her dinner, and she said tatoes, and you said, poor creature, had you nothing else; says she, a red herring; and did not she say to you, poor souls, they cannot afford to give me more? - She said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish you to recollect, as accurately as you can, when the first time was that you saw the deceased? - I cannot tell; but I am sure, by this receipt, the last time was the 4th of January.</p>
               <p>Was she at that time with child, or brought to bed? - She was with child both times.</p>
               <p>Was she brought to bed on the 4th of January? - No.</p>
               <p>The first time you saw her, in what condition did you find her, as to bodily strength and infirmities? - She seemed very weak and low.</p>
               <p>Was she able to walk? - No; she was not able to stand.</p>
               <p>I am speaking of the first time that you went up to her? - She was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Did she attempt to stand? - No. She told me how her legs were swelled; I saw her legs, and her knee.</p>
               <p>You never saw her after she was brought to-bed? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - Only the beginning of last summer some time.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know how long he has lived there? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first happen to know the wife? - I believe about three years ago; she came to me to take a room; I then lived in Coleman Street parish, in a place called Floyd's yard, London Wall; I had a lower room to let; there was a bill up.</p>
               <p>What did she come for? - She took the lower room for a school.</p>
               <p>Did she come and live there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did she live there? - I can't tell rightly; she paid the rent weekly.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell whether a week, or a month, or one year, or two years? - No, Sir; it was not two years; it was not above one year, if it was that.</p>
               <p>What rent did you let the room at? - Two shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Did she pay the rent? - She went away in my debt, but she worked it out afterwards by plain work.</p>
               <p>Did she keep a school? - She had but two or three scholars, there were so many school about.</p>
               <p>Did her husband ever come there? - No, Sir; I never saw him till last summer.</p>
               <p>What name did she go by? - Patmore; I never knew her by any other.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know that she had a husband till last summer? - Yes, Sir, I heard so.</p>
               <p>You do not know when they came together again? - I do not know any further, than I saw him last summer.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, in any of these conversations that you had with him, make any complaint about his wife? - I never heard him make any.</p>
               <p>Did you know, by any means, how long she had been absent from her husband? - I cannot say; only her father and mother they came to and fro' and were there every day.</p>
               <p>You say the conversation about potatoes was the first time you went? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not see the woman then? - No.</p>
               <p>You say now, that the conversation passed about the bacon and potatoes before you had seen the woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In your deposition, you say,</p>
               <p>"this deponent hearing that she was there unwell, went for the purpose of seeng her, and did see her in a back garret; and that he gave her rinds of bacon and rotten potatoes." And then you say, that you spoke to him about it, and he said he would keep her in that manner as long as she lived; so that the conversation about bacon and potatoes happened at the time when you saw her.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250008"/>Now, when you saw her, did you think her in a dangerous state? - I thought she was starving, she looked so.</p>
               <p>Then, did you or not give any information to the parish officers? - I went to the next door, and to a chandler's shop opposite; I told the neighbours; I did not understand about going to the parish officers.</p>
               <p>Did you understand what time the prisoner and the deceased had lived separate from each other? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How came you first of all to go to this house? - I went to where she had lodged last; she went from me to be with her father and mother, because the school did not answer, and staid there till her mother died. Her husband did not live with her then. After that she came to my house to know if I had ever a room, and for me to tell her what to do for the best. She was in a deal of trouble; her mother was just dead, and she wanted to move; and I got her a lodging at the next door to me; it was only a shilling a week; her husband came to and fro' the last summer; that was the way I knew him.</p>
               <p>How long did she live there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where did she go to from that place? - The prisoner fetched her away in a hackney coach, as I was told; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the prisoner say whether he fetched her away or not? - I cannot say; the prisoner was at my house the beginning of last summer, that was the first time that ever I saw him; I cannot recollect the month; I first saw the prisoner at my own door, he was enquiring after the deceased; he had his daughter with him.</p>
               <p>How old was that daughter? - I have heard her mother say she was thirteen years old, when she was living; I believe she is near fourteen.</p>
               <p>Then, at that time when you saw the prisoner enquiring for her, he did not know where she was? - No, I believe not; he was enquiring after her.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him where she lodged? - He had been at my house, and the next house, where she lodged, but she was not at home; I did not know who he was.</p>
               <p>What name did he enquire for? - He enquired for one Harwood; he described her, and I said there was a person that went by the name of Patmore. He asked me if I knew where she was gone.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any time when the prisoner and the deceased met together? - Yes; I was there one day when they were at dinner, in her apartment, at the next door; they had buttock of beef for dinner. I never saw him but once at her lodging, but I have seen him down in the yard, I believe, three or four times; three times I am sure.</p>
               <p>How long was you there at the time when they were at dinner? - I dare say I staid three quarters of an hour; I sat down, and talked.</p>
               <p>During the time you sat there, did any conversation pass between them importing that he was her husband? - I did not know who he was; he passed for her brother; they were talking about the country.</p>
               <p>How came you to make any application to the prisoner? - I heard, Sir, the situation she was in.</p>
               <p>When you did make applications to him, what were they? - Only begging him to let her go to the parish, or hospital.</p>
               <p>Did you make your applications to him as the husband of the deceased? - Yes; I knew then that he was her husband.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I said, you had better let Mrs. Patmore, your wife, go away.</p>
               <p>Did you say, you had better let her, or Mrs. Patmore? - I never called her any thing but Mrs. Patmore. She never owned to any thing but Patmore. I always called her to him by the name of Patmore.</p>
               <p>What was his answer? - He always said that she should be there, in that situation, as long as she lived.</p>

             was going out; the daughter came up and said to me - she said - will you be so good as to let us in when we come back; our door is not fit to be left; it is not safe. I said I would. At the same time my husband was bad; I was very ill myself. I went to bed, and desired my husband to let them in. They knocked at the door between light and dark; I said to my husband, there is somebody at the door; he went down and let them in; and when he came up again, I heard something moan twice. This was five weeks after I went there. We heard her once more, and I said to my husband, I hear something moan. He shut the door, and came to bed, for we had very little candle or coals, and were much distressed. I went up into the garret about two or three days after, to see a place that wanted mending; my husband is a plaisterer. I heard the moaning. I see the back garret a-jar, and I looks, and I saw the deceased sit up in a corner, upon a mat; she had got the hood of an old red cloak over her head, and she sat wrapped up in it; and as she sat, she see, sawed. Mrs. Walters says, How are you: she says, It's cold: and then she (Mrs. Walters) said to her, I'm going to get your dinner directly; and down stairs we went; and I saw no more of her till after she was dead. I did not go up any more; I had no time; my husband being so bad, and the children so heavy upon me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not your children go up to see her when they pleased? - Yes, a child of nine or ten years of age has been up; and another of seven went up three or four times with Mrs. Walters.</p>
               <p>Did not a girl of fifteen go up? - Yes, at the time your wife's cloaths were cut off Judy went up.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you have a child fifteen or sixteen years old that went up on the Sunday with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had she ever gone up by herself? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did the other children ever go up by themselves before she died? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you know, in point of fact, whether there was, from time to time, victuals carried up by Mrs. Walters, or any body else, and whom? - I have sworn to it. I have seen it go up many a time; potatoes, I have seen plenty of potatoes, about a pound, or a pound and a half, when boiled, and a red herring, several times.</p>
               <p>Can you tell who carried them? - I have seen Rachel Walters carry it, and I have seen the daughter likewise.</p>
               <p>Living in the same house, can you inform the court whether her meals were regularly carried up to her? - I did not always see them go regular; but I could hear a step go past my door; what I did not see, oftentimes my children have come in and told me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when it was she lay in? - I think it was, to the best of my knowledge, the 3d of January, the Saturday after New Year's Day.</p>
               <p>Are you pretty positive as to that? - Yes, I do think I could swear to it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the circumstance of her lying-in? - I was there at the time when she was brought to bed. I was there about one at noon.</p>
               <p>You knew she was with child at the time? - Only by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Were there any provisions, such as candle, or any thing of that sort, made for her before, or at the time when she was brought to bed? - When I came in, about one the same day, she was brought to bed. Mr. Patmore opened his room door at the same time that I opened the street door:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250010"/>neighbour, says he, I have got a young bantling. Have you, says I, I went in to see the child, and I asked to look at it; when I went in it was laid on the girl's feather-bed, below stairs, and covered over; it was brought down stairs to be dressed; I looked at the child, and said, it is a pretty baby; poor thing, it was a pretty featured child. I looked at it, and saw a blanket hang at the chimney line, a roller, and a cap: and

I said I would lend her a shirt; I went up stairs, and brought one down, and a girl's cap. Mr. Patmore came in at the same time, with a quilt and a child's shirt; and she wanted to give me my shirt again; but I told her no, it would want another. I never saw the child any more till the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Was this child a full grown child? - No, it was a small child.</p>
               <p>Was it at its full time? - I do think it was; it looked likely to live.</p>
               <p>Was there any provision, or proper preparation made for her, at the same time, that she was to take, proper for persons in her condition? - I smelt the spice boiling, and I saw the saucepan on the fire; it appeared to me to be caudle. I only smelt spice, but I saw no liquors.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time smell the smell of caudle? - No, I cannot say I ever did after that time.</p>
               <p>How long did you happen to know the deceased before you went to live there? - I never saw her in my life, nor Mr. Patmore but once, before I went to live there.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know in what way he lived? - I knew he was a staymaker; but my family was too large for me to be in his room.</p>
               <p>Was the sort of food that went up to the deceased, the sort of food that the prisoner had at his table? - I do not know what sort of food the prisoner had at his table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You remember the size of my poor child's bed; the bed laid on the lid of a sea chest, very small, no larger than a bolster? - It was a child's bed, on a chest, no bigger than this board is; there was no bedstead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat, prisoner's counsel. My lord, I have this moment received my brief. You was a lodger in the same house with the prisoner? - Yes, in the one pair, over his head.</p>
               <p>Was he in the habit of calling this woman his wife; or did he say, the woman, and the woman? - He used to say, her.</p>
               <p>Did he say, my wife? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who was this large girl by; by this woman, or some other? - By the deceased, I understood.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner and his supposed wife live in the same room together? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Did it happen to you to hear their conversation at any time? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect at any time the deceased sending the child for provisions to her husband? - No; I have seen her carry it up stairs.</p>
               <p>How long was that before her death? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Was you called in to her assistance? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she refused her provisions through illness? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe any ill treatment from the prisoner to any person, or cruelty, or ill-humour? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Did he conduct himself in a good-humoured quiet manner? - It was a very quiet house, while I was in it, till this affair.</p>

The prisoner came to my house about 11 o'clock, in the day time of the third of January; he told me Mrs. Haynsworth told him to come over to me, and desired me to come. Mrs. Haynsworth lives next door to him, and sells milk. He said there was a poor creature in great extremity, and great distress, in the back room; he said she had had goods, but she was obliged to part with them to pay her rent; he had gave her house-room to shelter her from the weather; and he was come into a great deal of trouble. I asked him why he did not put her into the workhouse; he said the parish officers would have nothing to do with her; because he took her in, they would oblige him to take care of her. He asked me if I would be so good as to go over; I said I would, and I went with him to his house. He told me to go up stairs, his wife was above. I went up two pair of stairs; I met Mrs. Haynsworth coming down. She said, neighbour Taylor, I am glad you are come, for I never saw such a scene in my life. When I got up the third pair of stairs,

Rachel said the deceased was in labour. I asked her if she had sent for the midwife; she said no, they did not know where one lived. I told her where one lived, and then the deceased spoke; she said there was no cause for a midwife, the child was in the world, if I would be so good as to take it. I told her I would, but I had much rather they would have somebody else, and to send for a midwife. I told them if I did take it, I must have something to wrop it up in. Rachel called down to the prisoner to bring up a coarse apron and a needle full of thread. I parted the child, and wropt it up in the coarse apron, and gave it to Rachel. The deceased told me all was ready for me. I said that she ought to have something warm, for the place was so wet it was enough to perish her, and if she had a little dry straw under her, it would be better than lying so. Rachel told her she should have something warm as fast as possible. We came down stairs, and the prisoner was standing there in the entry; and Rachel says, Patmore, step one side a minute; which he did; then he came into the front room below stairs, and told me if I had a mind to see her (the deceased's) husband, I might; he lived in Church Row, Aldgate; his name was Hayward, or Harewood, an ivory-turner; but, he says, I am the first. Why, says I, if her husband lives in Church Row, and you are the first - I thought this had been your wife? So she is, says he; so Rachel replies, so I am his wife, and she had been married to him eleven years last October, she told me. I told him I thought it was a comical sort of mess of marrying; but nevertheless the woman above must have something to cover her. There was a pot of beer standing on the table, and some oatmeal, and some spice; I put some on, and boiled some caudle, about a pint, and I put some gin in it, and I would have carried it up, but Rachel would not let me; she sent the daughter. The girl came down, and said the deceased wanted a piece of bread toasted. I toasted a piece, and the girl took that up. The prisoner went out, and when he came back he brought in an old quilt and a truss of straw; be carried it up stairs into the front garret; he came down stairs again, and said he had made her up a very good bed; I told him I could not move her myself, and he helped me to move her out of the back garret into the fore garret, and when we laid her down there, I asked her how she did, she said she was pure comfortable, and thanked me for making the caudle; I asked her if she drank it, she told me she did; the prisoner said to her, you shall want for nothing till your month is up; if you do not go from me then, I will put you to Bridewell; she asked him to shake hands and to forgive her; he told her he would not touch such a wretch as she was, for she had been his utter destruction; she replied to him again, you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250012"/>committed faults as well as I have committed faults; the deceased told him that he had been married to this Rachel so long.</p>
               <p>How long? - Eleven years; and he told her she had been married to Hayward, I think Harewood, but I am not certain which, longer than he had been to Rachel; that discourse passed several times over and over; so interfering, with that, I asked her whose child that was; then she pointed to the prisoner, and said it was his; he said it was not; she said it was; so then, says he, I suppose it is the paper bag man's; I must go and get a paper bag to put it in; then she made no more reply at all, and we came down stairs; then, when we came down stairs, both Rachel and he said she should want for nothing, and said she should have every thing that was necessary as fast as they could get it; then I dressed the child: he brought in three quarters of flannel, which he brought in for a blanket, a shirt, cap and roller; they then said she should want for nothing till her month was up, when, he said, he would put her to Bridewell; he should insist on doing it then. Then I went over to a neighbour's house to inform them of the situation she was in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Describe the garret you found her in? - It was very wet; there was neither bed, bedstead, chair, stool, or any thing in it; she was laying on two garden mats. I saw one, they said there were two: she had an old black crape gown, an old petticoat, and a piece of an old light-coloured cloak, a smallish cloak, a piece of sacking about three quarters of a yard long, or a yard at furthest; there were a few bits of nasty dirty rags; the child was nearly at its full time, it was a small child, it had its nails, its hair on its head, and every thing proportionable.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular in the child that struck you at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was that the first time you ever saw the deceased? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know how long she had been in the garret? - No; he signified to me, it was a person he had sheltered from the weather for a night or two.</p>
               <p>What was in the front garret? - Nothing at all, only some broken cieling laying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know how she had been lodged before that moment that you saw her? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>In the course of the altercation between the deceased and the prisoner, he said repeatedly that she was married to this Hayward? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She did not deny it? - No, nor she did not deny it any further than telling him he was married first.</p>
               <p>Did she complain of any ill-treatment in your presence? - She did not, for I never was alone by myself; they would not let me go up by myself.</p>
               <p>Was the bed as comfortable as it could be made of such materials? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the woman appear totally strong for a woman in her condition? - She spoke very hearty, considering how she had lain in the wet.</p>
               <p>But you do not know how long she had been in that room? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you see this woman afterwards? - I never saw her afterwards; I went over on the Sunday morning, she was brought to bed on the Saturday; I went over the Sunday, which was the 4th, about 11; I saw Rachel standing at the door; I did not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long did the deceased live afterwards? - She lived to the 25th of January; I never was at the house at all till she was dead, because I was called out on Tuesday, to nurse a woman.</p>
               <p>Then you know nothing of the care that was taken of her between the 3d and 25th? - No, I did not see her; I was not there.</p>
               <p>You tell us there was a considerable number of words between the deceased and this woman, saying that the prisoner had been married to Rachel Walters eleven years; likewise saying, as I understood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250013"/>you, that she and the prisoner had been married together; did the prisoner deny that? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner did not deny his having been married to the deceased; if I understand you right the prisoner taxed her with having been married to a man of the name of Harwood, or Haywood; did she admit that, or deny it? - She replied that the prisoner was married to Rachel before she was married to Harwood.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you when she was married to Harwood? - In the month of June.</p>
               <p>What year? - Why take eleven from - 1789, the wife was married in June to Harwood, and the prisoner in October to Rachel.</p>
               <p>Now from their conversation, did it at all appear where the deceased had lived? - By what passed between them, it appeared, that she had lived along with Harwood, and had had eleven children by him.</p>
               <p>How long was this conversation? - It might be the space of a quarter of an hour, for it was spoke as fast as I could speak.</p>
               <p>Now then will you recollect, whether it appeared how lately the deceased had lived with Harwood? - She had been away from him about two years, as they said in their discourse; I know no further; and that that Harwood was married to another woman.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner passed for the husband of this

             made answer, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250014"/>water was very scarce, and the deceased said, you may easily get as much as I shall drink; I came down stairs, I went to my business, I cannot recollect when I saw the prisoner again; I saw him the night she died.</p>
               <p>Did you see him before she died? - Upon my word I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner at any time previous to her death? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him after her death? - No more than he said he was glad she was dead; that was on the Sunday morning after she died; on the Saturday night I went up to my room, and I heard a sad groaning, dismal for any body to hear, and I went to see her as she was dying, and she seemed to lay in great extremity, and had each hand up to the side of her hair fighting with death: I told Patmore, the prisoner, it was very proper somebody should pray by her; he said she is past hearing or feeling, and praying; I offered to go and read prayers by her, he said it was of no signification, and he went down stairs; she died on that night; I heard him and Rachel go up again, and they came down together very shortly. In an hour after that I heard him come up to my door, but he did not go up to her any more; the deceased ceased groaning about half past two on Sunday morning, at which time we supposed she had died, she was by herself; and the body remained there till Wednesday, when in the morning, as I was going to work, I asked him if he was going to bury the poor woman; he said, neighbour, I shall get shut of her to day; he said he had got two fellows that would do any thing for a trifle of money; that he was going to give each of them a shilling a piece, and three quarterns of gin, to take her body away in a sack, and throw her in the Thames at night, or any where, so long as he got shut of her out of his house; and I made answer and said, this poor woman never will go into a sack; and I dont know what answer he made me; I then went about my business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never changed three words with you in my life? - It is a great falsity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I say that I would sell my own bed, or least ways Rachel's bed, to get a coffin for her, to get her buried? - I never heard any such words mentioned, he never talked about a coffin; he talked of making away with her otherwise, but the surgeons would not have her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are you that man's wife that lodged in my back chamber on the second floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not your husband say that there was always a sufficiency of victuals? - I did not mind any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Did not you go up stairs with me, and I said, the Lord have mercy upon you, the Lord have mercy upon you, says I, Mary, do you know me? - I did not go up with you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It was on the Sunday morning, I think, you say that you heard groans? - About half after two she ceased groaning.</p>
               <p>There were other persons in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many hours was it before you heard the groaning that you saw the deceased? - I had not seen her from the Thursday till the Saturday night that she died, I saw her on Saturday night between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Did she complain on the Thursday for the want of any kind of food? - Not when I was by.</p>
               <p>Did she charge any body with neglect or cruelty? - No Sir, not when I was present, she did not mention a word about it.</p>
               <p>Did she on Saturday complain of any species of cruelty? - She was speechless then.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time hear any thing like violence in the room where she lay? - I was only at home in the evening.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing in the prisoner's behaviour to her that was cruel or unmanly? - I heard the prisoner speak<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250015"/>monsterously against her, but I did not perceive any thing in his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Court. You took your lodging of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I believe, Sir, you are a pupil student with Mr. Young, who is of eminence in the surgery line, in Coleman-street? - Yes. I recollect the prisoner's face, having seen him twice before; I saw him once at Mr. Young's house, and once at his own house.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the day when he first applied to you? - I believe it was on the 29th of January; the day before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you see him? - He came and enquired for Mr. Young, who was not at home; therefore the servant called me to him; he wished to dispose of the dead body of a lodger, who died at his house; he said it was a female; she had been with him eleven or twelve weeks; that he had incurred considerable expence in keeping her all that time: and that now she was dead, and the parish officers had refused to bury her; he thought it but right, that he should get something for her body, as he could not afford to bury her himself: this was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon; I waited to inform Mr. Young, but as he did not come home, I went without his knowledge, about six or seven, and saw the body, but I did not take it. I never saw him before that; that is the only transaction respecting the woman; at the same time, I had another transaction with him; he then told me that the woman had been brought to bed about two weeks; that the child was dead, and he was unable to bury it; and wanted me to take the child: he had previous to this, shewn me a certificate from a searcher, who had searched the body of the woman, but not of the child; he brought the child, for which I paid him four shillings. I saw the corps, but I refused it; it lay on straw, in a very horrid situation; I made no further observation; I immediately came out again.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250018"/>Prisoner. Every thing is not put into the brief that should have been, because we had not time. Young man, did not I say to you, it was a pity; it could help what the mother had done; and that I would endeavour to keep it longer, and bury it? - No, my friend, you said no such thing to me.</p>
               <p>Dr. - DENNISON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 30th I saw the corps; it was in a most wretched condition, as to filth and vermin. I examined it only externally, when I found no marks of violence. A report, I found, had been circulated, that attempts had been made to consume the body by fire. I attended, therefore, particularly to that circumstance, and I am persuaded that no such attempts had been made; for what were supposed to have been the effects of fire, were nothing more than the effects of mortification: the lower extremities, the legs and thighs, were exceedingly swelled; a circumstance which, I believe, may very well be explained, in consequence of her situation as a lying-in woman. The upper part of her body appeared in a very ematiated state, as the face, the arms, and the trunk; that was all I observed.</p>
               <p>At that time she was neither opened by you nor Mr. Young, who was with you? - She was not; therefore I only speak of the outward appearance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Is a slice of bread and butter in the morning and afternoon sufficient food to keep a person alive that is in a weakly state of body? - I cannot answer that question; that depends upon circumstances: it depends, perhaps, on the mode of life the woman had been accustomed to before. If she had been accustomed to live tolerably well before, and had eaten animal food, I should then say it was not.</p>
               <p>I do not ask you whether it was sufficient sustenance, but whether it was sufficient to keep any person alive? - In the early stage of her lying-in, what we call the puerperal state, I should esteem it proper.</p>
               <p>I do not ask you whether it was proper food for a woman in that condition, but whether the food she did receive was sufficient to keep a person alive? - That depends on the quantity; if the quantity is excessively small, I would then say, it is not.</p>
               <p>With the addition of some potatoes, and a herring, sometimes meat, these things taken together, are they not sufficient to keep a subject alive, and free from the effects of hunger and starving? - I should imagine they are.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say you saw this corps just seven days after she had died? - I could not exactly learn when she did die.</p>
               <p>Could you, at all, judge, at the distance of five days, whether the deceased died for want of assistance? - If I was to speak from the appearance of the upper part of the body, from the ematiated stare, I might be led to think so; but it would be speaking very uncertainly.</p>
               <p>I believe, Sir, you told us there was a mortification? - There was.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you that she might die of that mortification? - I think she might.</p>
               <p>What, in your judgment, did you suppose that mortification might proceed from? - From an impoverished state, and the consequence of laying in that sort of condition; that, I think, will sufficiently explain the cause of the mortification.</p>
               <p>The swelling of the inferior extremities, that you were speaking of, that is a circumstance that is every now and then found in newly delivered women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But can you decide, from what you saw, any cause of her death? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>You would not venture to swear, that she died either from one cause or another? - By no means.</p>
               <p>Mr. YOUNG.</p>
               <p>I beg your lordship's patience, while I speak for a few minutes. I dare say your lordship will be very glad to hear any thing that may have a tendency to throw light on this subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250019"/>Court. I shall be very glad, Sir, to hear any thing that tends to explain this matter, because justice is as much due to the publick, that this man, if guilty, should suffer, as that he should be acquitted, if innocent.</p>
               <p>Sworn.</p>
               <p>My lord, what I have to say relates alone to the appearances after death.</p>
               <p>Court. How long, Sir, have you been a surgeon? - I have been of the Company of surgeons near fifteen years, and in the practice of surgery many years more. I saw the dead body at the same time with Dr. Dennison. There were, as he says, no external marks of violence. The upper parts of the body were, as he says also, greatly ematiated; but not more, I believe I can say truly, not so much as I have seen repeatedly in dead bodies, who during life had received every possible mark of attention and kindness; but the mortification of which you have heard was very large and deep.</p>
               <p>How deep? - There was a slough, as we call it, at one part, nearly a quarter of an inch thick, and almost to the bone. I will take upon me to say, that what whatever cause produced the mortification, was sufficient, in conjunction with that, as an effect, to have been the immediate cause of her death. I add this, because it has respect to an inference that might have been drawn for the want of stating these facts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What caused the mortification, I suppose, it is impossible to say? - I cannot take upon me absolutely to say. In all probability, hardships of various kinds, and pressure from hard laying. There is no question but poor living would dispose to it; whether from incapacity by illness, or any other cause, she was prevented from taking the accustomed, or necessary quantity of nourishment; or from refusal of it by those who ought to have administered it. A number of concurring circumstances, producing weakness and bad health, would dispose to it; and pressure from hard laying might immediately produce it.</p>
               <p>Court. In what part was the mortification? - On the posteriors. It has been suggested, that the mortification was produced by the application of fire. I did not, at the time I examined the body, suspect this; but I will not take upon me to say that it was not produced by fire.</p>
               <p>(Cross Examination.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Dr. Young, subjects in that state, I believe, generally require less food to sustain life, than those in health? - If that question should be entered into critically, the contrary may also be said to be true.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to enter into it critically, I want an affirmative or negative to the question? - Neither a negative nor an affirmative can be given to the question because it is too general.</p>
               <p>Well then, Sir, to be more particular, is not a single potatoe administered in twenty four hours sufficient to keep a subject alive for a fortnight? - Scarcely you or me I believe, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you think it would be sufficient if it was two or three? - If you speak of possibility, a person might live, under some circumstances, so long, without any thing; such instances are recorded.</p>
               <p>In your judgment, would you pronounce such a subject, fed as I have stated, died for want of food? - I might be of opinion that such an one died for want of sufficient food.</p>
               <p>But if we add bread and butter twice a day, and a red herring, and sometimes meat, would you say so? - As far as I can judge, from such a general statement, where precise quantity is not ascertained; but the expressions used, are, a bason of tea, and a slice of bread and butter, in the morning; a plate of potatoes and red herring, or sometimes meat, for dinner; and another bason of tea, and slice of bread and butter, in the afternoon. I should think so long as that was continued there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250020"/>could not be a just charge of want, that would amount to the idea of starving.</p>
               <p>Not an absolute want? - No.</p>
               <p>I think you say, Sir, that it is possible for a person to live fourteen or fifteen days, without any food at all? - I did, but think it is requisite they should be well lined.</p>
               <p>Aye, aye, aye! I believe there have been instances of persons living for years, upon a single egg a day? - Perhaps there may.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon, I have been in the practice of surgery, twenty years; I opened the deceased's dead body, on Tuesday, the third of February.</p>
               <p>What were the appearances, first of all of the stomach? - Nearly empty.</p>
               <p>What was in it? - A fluid, which a tea cup might contain.</p>
               <p>Did you open the intestines? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you examine them? - I did.</p>
               <p>In what state were they? - They appeared nearly empty.</p>
               <p>What conclusion do you draw from the appearance of the body, in the opening of it? - I should not have opened the body, but at the request of the parish officers, for I did not apprehend I could gain any information from that; when I saw the mortification, I was satisfied, in my own mind, that was the cause of her death; there are no symptoms which usually attend in a mortification; but I expected to find the stomach and bowels empty, or nearly so.</p>
               <p>From the appearance of the body, and from the evidence you have heard, what do you, as a medical man, say, you believe to be the cause of the death of that poor woman? - The mortification.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us what was the cause of that mortification? - An impoverished state of the blood and juices; occasioned by what I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>How were the upper parts; the trunk, and arms, and face? - Very much ematiated.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear what Mr. Young said, with respect to this ematiation, for he said that it was no more than he might possibly have expected to see in bodies that had not been starved; - Certainly, my lord.</p>
               <p>Then you concluded nothing from that ematiation? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Is not it possible for a person who dies, having had every humane assistance, every indulgence, and article of food and convenience. Is not it possible for them to have the ematiated state you speak of? - It certainly is possible.</p>
               <p>Is it not usual? - It is not so probable; I have met with instances of the kind.</p>
               <p>Though the body may be ever so clean, it may be ematiated? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Can you say, Sir, by opening a subject a fortnight or three weeks after the death, at all, whether they died for want of food, or no? - I do not pretend to do it.</p>

               <p>May not a person be in that impoverished state of the blood, and yet have every necessary of life? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>I believe it not only happens so now and then, but very frequently, that persons in affluence, and having every convenience of life, and every species of luxury and affluence, that their blood is in an impoverished state? - I have not often met with it; it has not frequently happened in my practice.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the evidence of the child? - I did.</p>
               <p>You know the quantity of food she mentioned? - Yes; I should suppose it would rather increase and tend to impoverish, than add, from the quality of it.</p>
               <p>The poor man at the bar is not a doctor; would that quantity of food in weight and measure, be sufficient to keep a person alive? - It is opposite to the course of diet I should have recommended.</p>
               <p>But was the quantity sufficient in weight and measure? - I wondered, when I heard the stomach was in that weak state, that it should receive it.</p>
               <p>Rather than supposing want of food? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. From what you have heard of the mode of feeding this poor woman, the manner in which she was attended, and the season of the year, and altogether, was it likely to occasion a mortification? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Mr. Young Give me leave to ask you the same question, Sir; would that quantity of food in weight and measure, be sufficient to keep a person alive? - If the question is confined simply to the food, no doubt of that, during the time it was given; I speak of the idea of one slice of bread and butter morning and evening, and a plate of potatoes and a red herring in the middle of the day; I collect a general idea of quantity, but I cannot say exactly what that quantity was. According to my idea of the quantity, I should think it competent to support life during the time it was continued.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I have done.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner at the bar; you have heard the witnesses that have been examined in support of the prosecution; what have you to say in your defence.</p>

               <p>This here deceased woman, my lord, laid a matter of eleven days before she was opened; and for all the time almost I had her she had a violent oozing upon her, as she called it, which occasioned a deal of wet to be in the room; and her own child knows the same, and cannot deny it, if you ask the child; and she frequently used to spill her chamber pot about the room, which occasioned so much wet; so that the child was tired of waiting upon her, she said she was so nasty: she said that her father and mother both died of the dropsy; and she looked upon it she should die of the same; and the lodgers of the house said that her legs would burst a day or two after she died, if not before, with the dropsy; and about eight days before she died, she desired nothing but gruels, and no kind of meat. Rachel Walters asked her if she would have some wine in her gruel, and she replied no; she would have it the same as her poor mother had it, with a little salt and butter in it, she could taste nothing else, and her teeth were set for death. Walters said, why do you speak so, your speech is altered. She said, no, my mouth is clammed up; at the same time it was death that took hold of her, I believe; so that she never could eat any more. Then that, and being so long after death. I do not wonder, with that and the oozing I have described, that her body might be empty enough, notwithstanding she had the same food as I; and I being lame with a broken wrist, was not able to afford much; and many times, my child knows it, we have had but two red herrings between us, and two pound of potatoes, and have given her one herring and one pound of potatoes out of it; my child knows it.</p>

               <p>My husband is a staymaker; I live in the Borough, just by St. George's church. I know the prisoner. The deceased I saw twice as she lay; I believe it might be a month before her death. I dined there, and saw what was sent up to her; that was about a month, as near as I can recollect; we had pickled pork, and turnips and potatoes; and there was a slice of bread, the length of a quartern loaf, cur near an inch thick; it was sent from the table, and there was large plate of pickled pork, potatoes, and turnips sent up, and a slice of bread near an inch thick, the whole length of a quartern loaf. The second day I dined before I went; I cannot tell what was sent then. The prisoner was reckoned, in general, a very humane man. I saw the woman.</p>
               <p>Did she complain to you of ill treatment? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Did she complain for want of food? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you go up to see her? - I did; I was desired to go up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250024"/>Who desired you to go up? - The second wife desired me. When I came up I found her laying on the ground, with some things under her; I cannot tell no further than this, I saw a piece of matting, but what was a-top of it I know not, for the woman was so lame she could not move.</p>
               <p>What month was this in? - In November, or December.</p>

             go with you up stairs? - I do not know Walters.</p>
               <p>Why the second wife, as you call her? - Oh, yes, she went up stairs with me.</p>

               <p>What time of the day was it? - It might be about two.</p>
               <p>Was it before, or after dinner? - After dinner.</p>
               <p>Who carried up the dinner? - The daughter.</p>
               <p>What piece of pork was it? - The belly part of pickled pork; there was a large plateful went up; she was lame at that time, but very hearty seemingly, though so lame she could not move: she said she was with child, but I did not perceive it as she lay; she had a white swelling on her knee. There was more victuals sent up than I could eat; twice as much.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to Mr. Patmore, that it was wrong to let a poor woman, who had a white swelling on her knee, lay so hard? - I knew he could not help it; he had never a bed for her.</p>
               <p>But she might have gone to the workhouse? - To be sure that would have been the proper place for her; I have said that, and I went to the workhouse to see to get her in, when she was in labour; the prisoner came to me to the Borough, when she was in labour, and desired me to be kind enough to go the parish officers, for them to take her in, to lay in.</p>
               <p>What parish officer? - Mile End, New Town.</p>
               <p>What influence had you over the parish officers? - I had no influence over them, only to tell them there was a poor woman in labour, and begged them to fetch her. I live by the Swan Inn, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>So this man came from Mile End, New Town, to desire them to take his wife in, because she was in labour? - He did.</p>
               <p>Why, did not you make an observation, that it was very odd he should come to you into the Borough, when his wife was in labour, when it was much easier for him to have gone himself? - Very true, Sir, so it was. I cannot tell the name of the street where the parish officer lived.</p>
               <p>How near to the street where Mr. Patmore lived? - It was in the dark, and it was in bitter frosty weather; but as near as I can guess, it was about a quarter of a mile to the first; but to me it was three or four miles. I have known the prisoner nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a lame hand? - Yes, I do; the board slipped as he was at work, and he fell off it, and broke his wrist, or strained it so that he was very bad for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>When was this? - [Prisoner. That was five years this winter.] - I remember it exceedingly well; but the term and the time I cannot; but I know it must be years.</p>
               <p>Was it within these six months? - Oh dear, no; I dare say five or six years ago.</p>
               <p>Has he been able to work within these six months? - Yes, I believe he has.</p>
               <p>What did he work at? - At staymaking.</p>
               <p>Was he a poor man? - He was a poor man; he was a journeyman to my husband.</p>
               <p>Was he very poor? - He was very poor.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lived a neighbour to me, about four months; and while he lived and laboured with me, he behaved in a humane manner; there, was a poor man that was very ill, and his goods were seized; he was the one that went along with me gathering for him; we gathered about 17 s. and gave it to his wife; the prisoner behaved in a very friendly humane manner.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Young. You have heard from one of the witnesses, that has been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250025"/>examined on the part of the prisoner; that the deceased had a white swelling in her knee; I should be very glad to know from you, as a gentleman of the faculty, what consequence that might have on her frame and habit? - There is no disease, with which the human body can be afflicted, that so much wears out the body, and takes so much time to do it in; the pain the patient suffers, if it is that species of white swelling, which is the painful one, and I believe her's was, for I recollect the knee was swelled; the continuance of pain, exhausts the strength in various ways; first, in itself as pain; we all know, that pain indisposes the stomach for receiving food, and for digesting what it does take; and by depriving the patients of their natural rest, greatly emaciates them, and generally in length of time, if nothing intervenes, proves fatal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young to Jury. You recollect, gentlemen, that the woman was carried up stairs when she was brought in. I perfectly recollect her knee being swelled; I think I can go so far, as to say it was her right knee.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was the right knee.</p>
               <p>Court. I would ask you whether or no, a disorder painful as that is, for of course you must know, might not occasion the groans we have heard mentioned? - Undoubtedly they would.</p>
               <p>And it would account for that emaciation, which has been mentioned of in court? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Would not the mere act of laying in one position so long, contribute greatly to produce a mortification? - It often does in itself alone, considering long confinement to a bed, even to a feather bed, is productive of mortification; in this instance, it was sufficiently connected with the idea of that which produced the mortification; that was my evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I offered this Mrs. Riley, 2 s. or a weeks lodging in my second floor, if she would endeavour to procure a letter to get the deceased into the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Riley. Did the prisoner offer you any thing? - He said if I would get him a letter for the London Infirmary to get her in, he would give me 2 s. for my trouble, and I tried, but could not get a letter; this was about five weeks before she died, for he said he did not know where to get one; he did not know any of the subscribers.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Riley. Do you know of any attempt that the prisoner made to get the deceased in the hospital? - Yes, two days I was employed to collect a little money to get linen, and to get her into some Hospital; I was employed by Patmore and Rachel, to gather money to get her linen and clean things, to get her to the Hospital; three days we were collecting money; the two days, I was paid sixpence a day by the prisoner; the last day I was not paid any thing.</p>
               <p>Is he a very poor man? - He was then poor to appearance, because trade was dead.</p>
               <p>Was he disabled do you know from doing his work? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not capable of working as a journeyman, being lame and my sight bad, so that I am obliged to do a little at home as a master.</p>
               <p>The learned judge summed up the evidence to the jury, who immediately returned their verdict,</p>

               <p>Whose child is that? - The father of the child lives in Quakers Buildings by Smithfield Bars, the mother is dead, and I am paid a guinea a month for it; there was a black silk bonnet of my own, the child's white frock, and a pinning cloth; I missed nothing else; all that I lost of my own was the silk bonnet.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the child's clothes? - The father of the child finds her in every thing; I had put the sash quite close down, but had not fastened it any farther, I saw nobody in the house; I went to see what it was o'clock, I am sure it was about seven; I had the candle in my hand, the child wanted to go to bed at that time; I shut my shutters at six in the evening, and this happened at seven.</p>
               <p>Were the lamps lighted when you went out to put to the shutters? - No, I had a candle with me up stairs, the runners from the public office brought all the things mentioned, to me the next morning, how they got them I know not; the runners names are Shakeshaft, Armstrong, and another whose name I do not know.</p>

            , standing at a public house, the Red Lyon, he asked me to drink, I went in, we had two pints of beer, I believe we might stay about half an hour; there I saw the prisoner Robley, he was in the house then, I believe he and the others had been drinking together; Robley said to me that they were going across Moorfields, we went together, they did not say what they were going to do; we went across Moorfields till we came to Grub-street, then we went into the Crispin and had a quartern of gin, we did not stay there; and when we came out we consulted to go to see for some place to rob; I proposed going to Barbican; and Avery said he knew a place in Little Archer-street, where he said he had looked at a house several times before; accordingly we went there, the house was fronting a passage, Avery went to the house and pulled open the window shutter, they were shut to, whether they were fastened or not I cannot really say, there was a fire in the room, but no candle; Avery shoved up the window, and shoved open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250033"/>the blinds, Avery in shoving up the window made a noise, and I heard somebody coming down stairs; then Avery reached himself into the window, and took out the articles here mentioned; part of his body was in the window, I think these are the same things, I know the hat and bonnet, but I did not know what the other things were, they were laying very near the window, but I cannot positively say, he could reach them without going in entirely; Robley was at the distance of about twenty paces, I could just discern him: he was standing by, watching; Avery gave all the things to me, and Robley afterwards took the things from me, except the bonnet, he took them from me underneath the passage; when we got into Golden-lane, Avery told Robley and me to go to a place in Golden-lane to sell the goods, and going into the house we were apprehended by the officer.</p>

               <p>Who laid hold of you? - Armstrong; I had the bonnet, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Who laid hold of Robley? - Armstrong laid hold of him at the same time, and I let the bonnet fall; Mr. Shakeshaft came to his assistance, and brought us out, and another person came up of the name of Harper, then they handcuffed us, and took us to the justice; I did not observe what they took from Robley.</p>
               <p>Is all this true? - To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>What became of Avery? - I cannot tell indeed, he stood at a distance off.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I happened to be at the Red Lion, Holywell-lane, when this Buckingham came in, he goes by two names, and we were talking together about going over Moor-fields, he said he had a friend in Grub-street that he wanted to see, and we all agreed to go together, he, Avery and me; when we came to Grub-street, he was not there, we had some gin, and went out towards Barbican; and when we came in this street where the robbery was committed, we were all together, I walking before them, I missed them; I being before them a great way I turned back to see for them, and as I came back again, Buckingham gave me the hat and some of the things, and I did not know where he got them from, I had not the presence of mind to ask him, I was a hundred yards from the place where they were taken, I did not know they were stolen, and when we came into Playhouse-yard, we were stopped by Mr. Harper and Armstrong, and the things were taken from us; I thought they had belonged to Buckingham; I have a person here that I have lodged with since I have been in London.</p>

I saw him after he was taken, but I took to my load. I cannot say that the man that was taken was the same man that took my load, I was too much flurried.

Well, says I, there it goes; and I shewed it him; so we pursued him up Cateaton-street, and the prisoner let the load fall in Cateaton-street; Mr. Cooper took the load up, and I pursued the man; he went about ten yards, then turned about, and came a few yards before I took hold of him; I delivered him to Mr.

               <p>How was you conducted down the first steps? - By a violent force, keeping my feet; he laid hold of the side of my cloak, and the bundle, and pulled the string of my cloak quite off; when I came to the bottom of the first five steps I strove to keep my property; then he dragged me down the rest of the steps, by holding my bundle and my cloak, he had hold as well as I;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250037"/>I did not tumble down, he pulled me down, he dragged me by all fours down the remainder, he dragged me down the last steps with my head foremost, on my knees; I kept my hand on the bundle before me; when he got me to the bottom of the other steps, there is a lamp, and he run off with my bundle; I went immediately back up the steps to the butcher's, and I told them, the butcher went home with me, which is about twenty minutes walk.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before this time? - I saw him, and two with him, pass the shop while I was in it; I had not seen him before, I did not know either of the other two; the two that surrounded me were the same that were with him; I never saw them either before or since to my knowledge; it was not in all above a minute and a half, or two minutes, from the time of his taking me down the steps to his running away with my bundle; that place is a thoroughfare, but it is dark of nights; it was not my way home; the bundle contained two white shirts, three white aprons, a pair of men's ribbed cotton stockings, a damask napkin, and a common napkin, all tied up in a silk handkerchief; they were my husband's property; I had been for them from the washer woman's; the butcher's shop was in my way home; the prisoner did not take the chops, but they were dropped; they were on a skewer; the next night I saw the prisoner in the White-hart public-house, Ratcliffe-highway; the officer and me took him there; I was with the officer; I knew I should know him again if I saw him.</p>
               <p>What induced you who was a perfect stranger to the prisoner to go to the White-hart? - The next day I told Mr. Orange the officer, and he took me to the White-hart, and to another public-house.</p>
               <p>Did you give Orange any description of the person of the man? - No, I did not, I told him how I had been robbed, and that if I saw the man I should know him; the same evening I went to the White-hart; I saw nobody I knew there; then I went to the White-hart, and he was in the taproom, on his feet among a great many people.</p>
               <p>Before you told Orange that was the the man, had any body pointed him out to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor given you any suspicion that he was the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Neither Orange, nor any body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Had Orange, or any body else, told you who was likely to be the man, or mentioned his name? - No, I knew him as soon as I went in, and I signalised him out.</p>
               <p>What dress was he in when he robbed you? - It was, I believe, a kind of a brown or dark-coloured jacked, with a kind of white button; his hat, I believe, was a round one, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot be certain whether you had a perfect view of his face? - I had a perfect view of his face when he was passing by, and at the bottom of the steps there is a lamp, and then I looked at him when he dragged me down, and I saw it was the same man that passed by the butcher's shop.</p>
               <p>Was he laid hold of in the room at the publick-house? - Yes; and taken into a back room, and Orange searched him in my presence; I told him I believed that was my handkerchief about his neck, which was taken off by Orange. I just had a glimpse of it, and knew it to be my own; it was a silk handkerchief, nothing else was taken on him, no other part of my property has been found since. We went before the justice the same night, there the handkerchief was produced; then I had an opportunity of examining it to know it; I was able to know it to be my husband's.</p>
               <p>Court. There was no other force used than the dragging you mentioned, no instrument? - None, no conversation passed between us, but I said, do not take my bundle; it was as near as I can tell about half past nine.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250038"/>How came you to take notice of the prisoner passing by? - Nothing led me to any suspicion, only I was looking as he and the other men passed by.</p>
               <p>Did you take such notice of him when he passed by, that if this had not happened you should have known him? - I do not know that I should if I had not seen him the second time.</p>
               <p>And the only light you had to see him by afterwards was the lamp at the bottom of the steps? - Yes, I knew he was the same by that lamp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. What time was this? - About half past nine at night.</p>
               <p>I should guess that a young woman like you was very much frightened? - Sometimes a fright will bring me more to my senses.</p>
               <p>Then you have a very particular constitution, but you was under some alarm, was you not? - Certainly I was under a little alarm.</p>
               <p>You say there was a man came out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You gave no description to the man that came up? - I just said, God bless you, run after him, he has got my bundle.</p>

               <p>Did you wait till that man came back again? - No, he did not go.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Orange before this? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How came you to find him out? - I was going along the highway, and was told that he was one.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him, did you call at his house? - No, I did not, I was told that that was an officer.</p>
               <p>This young man had the handkerchief openly about his neck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You, without examining, claimed it? - Yes, I did not mean to examine it any more.</p>
               <p>Were you talking with the butcher? - No, I was not, I said I wanted a pound of mutton chops; it is a place I always deal at.</p>
               <p>Did you make any application to the butcher to come here as a witness for you? - I never applied to him, nor ever asked him.</p>
               <p>There are houses on both side the steps, and a double wall at the turning? - I cannot tell you the place rightly, because I do not frequent it.</p>
               <p>This lamp is at the bottom of the steps? The lamp stands in the middle of the steps, over the bottom of the steps. I am not sure whether his hat was on or not when he got to the bottom of the steps, when he passed by the butcher's he had a hat on then, but I cannot say what kind of hat it was.</p>
               <p>Did you take so much notice of him at the lamp as to say whether he had a hat on or not? - I cannot say.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of this month application was made to me by Mrs. Bell, between seven and eight, to the best of my knowledge, in the evening, at the White Lion in Shadwell Market; she told me she was robbed by three men.</p>
               <p>Did she describe the particulars where it happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she describe any of those men to you? - She told me one had a jacket on with white buttons; accordingly I went with her to the White Lion. She said one was a lowish lad, and the other two taller, but she could not know them.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where she was robbed? - Yes, she said at the bottom of the steps going into Farmer-street.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you how she got down to the bottom of the steps? - Yes, she told she was dragged down to the bottom of the steps by one of the people who had snatched away the bundle from her. I went with her in search of him to the White Hart, to see if she knew any body there. I desired her to look about to see if she knew any body in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the room? There were men and women; and after looking round the room she signalized the prisoner at the bar out to me; she then gave me charge of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250039"/>Had she spoke to the prisoner before she did this? - No, she had not; I then took him into custody, and took him into the back room; I searched him, and while I was searching him, she directed me to take the handkerchief off his neck; she verily believed it was hers; I then took the handkerchief off his neck, and put it into my pocket; I did not shew it to her then; I then secured him, and took him to the publick office, Shadwell, there I produced the handkerchief, which she swore to; it is here (produced); I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had you been at the White Lion? - I am there all day long, waiting for business; that is a house that we frequent.</p>
               <p>Who came with the young woman? - Her husband.</p>
               <p>That was the first time they applied to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was not in the street then, when they saw you first? - No.</p>
               <p>The young woman's husband went with you, at the time all this took place? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>He was there all the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>He is the next witness to be examined? - No, he knows nothing of the business.</p>
               <p>Are you a constable? - I am.</p>
               <p>Of what parish? - I am sworn in for the county; I am an officer besides; I am sworn in as a constable, from sessions to sessions, at the Public-office, by two magistrates; at the Public-office for the county.</p>
               <p>The handkerchief was on his neck in the room, that any body might see it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>There is no particular pattern in the handkerchief? - I have no business to describe the handkerchief, the woman will describe it; certainly there is patterns, and some more remarkable patterns than others.</p>
               <p>Is not that a very common pattern? - Certainly it is. Mr. Forrester knows no more; he was with me when I received the information.</p>

            . Look at that handkerchief; do you know that handkerchief? - I do, perfectly.</p>
               <p>Is that the handkerchief you saw at the office? - It is.</p>
               <p>Whose property is it? - My husband's.</p>
               <p>How do you know it? - The hem is worn off, part of it of each side.</p>
               <p>Is it a silk handkerchief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whose hemming is it, do you know? - It is my own.</p>
               <p>Is it lettered? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you observed this hemming worn off part of it, before this thing happened? - I knew the handkerchief; I lost it; I knew it was the same, when I saw it on his neck.</p>
               <p>How did you know it? - By the remarkable fineness, and two or three little holes in the corner, which I had observed before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, with all the caution that ought to be put to you, upon such a charge as this, do you undertake to swear, that that is the handkerchief which contained the bundle you was robbed of? - Yes, my Lord, I do with a safe conscience.</p>
               <p>How long had you the handkerchief in your possession, before you lost it? - I had taken it off my own neck before I went out, and I put a white one on, and I clapped this into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Whas it a handkerchief you yourself generally wore? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Is not that as common a pattern of a silk handkerchief, as any that is worn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The wearing will happen to any body that wears a silk handkerchief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at it again, and tell me whether you can speak to your work on the hemning, so as to know it? - I think I can; I can tell I hemmed it, because I hemmed it in a great hurry, and in a very dark place.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was it you that first applied to Orange, or did Orange come to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250040"/>you, before you saw him at the ale-house? - I saw him in the high-way, but I did not speak to him then.</p>
               <p>Before Orange had made any application to you about this supposed robbery; had you been to him? - I went to him.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Orange, before he had ever called at your house? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Are you sure of that; did not he first call now at seven in the morning at your house, before you went to him at the White Lion? - No, that I swear he did not; I was not out of bed.</p>
               <p>Did he at any other time in the morning, before you called on him? - No.</p>

               <p>About two hours before Mr. Orange took me, I was going up the highway, and there was a woman singing a song; and there was a man standing by with this handkerchief, and wanted to sell this handkerchief; and I asked him what he would have for it, and he said 2 s. and I told him I would give him one shilling, and the handkerchief I had round my neck, and he let me have it; I have a great many gentlemen in court for my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called fourteen witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

I immediately let go the prisoner Cook, whom I had got hold of, and ran after the prisoner Porter, and he was stopped in the Church-yard, Islington; the handkerchief and slipper were found on Porter; I found them in his pockets; the constable happened to be at hand, and I called him, and took him to our house, and he was searched, and taken to the justice.</p>

               <p>I am brother to the last witness; I am fifteen years of age; I went to the door to give the boy the pots, about ten minutes or a quarter past five; I saw the two prisoners come down the lane together; I see them go as far as the watch-box, and then they parted; Cook went on the other side of the way, and Porter walked backwards and forwards on our side of the way, near our house; and I went to get some assistance, for fear of their breaking the window, but I could not; and when I returned, I saw the prisoners meet again; they went through the Churchyard to Cross-street; I went into the shop, and looked through a shawl that hung in the window, to watch them; Porter went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250043"/>past the window, and looked in at both the windows; then he passed again, and looked in at that window which he broke; then he stopt about a quarter of a minute, and I saw him pull something out of his pocket, and cut the putty of the window, and shove in a large piece of glass; then he pulled out the slipper and handkerchiefs; and just as he had got to the end of the handkerchiefs, a piece of glass fell; it was his hand he put in; he immediately put the things in his pocket, and went towards Cook; I see all this distinctly, for I looked at them all the while they were there: two shawls hung up, and I looked between these two shawls; there was a light in the shop, on the side he broke, but on the other side that I looked through, I had put the light away; it was a projecting window I looked through; there was no light on the outside but a lamp; the window was full of goods; the light on the counter was very strong: I am sure as to both of the prisoners; I knew Porter before; he lived in Islington; I heard Cook making a hallooing the same night, at the corner of Cross-street; they had been hallooing all the evening together, to one another: the shop is a about twenty yards from the corner of Cross-street; I did not see Cook at the time the window was broke; I saw him when he went through the churchyard, not afterwards; I ran out immediately, and Porter had got the property, but I could not see where he run to; I saw Cook on the Terrace, which is about forty yards distance from our house.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you see him at forty yards distance when you run out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Six.</p>
               <p>That is dark in January? - Yes, but there are a good many lamps on the Terrace which shew a great light; he was hallooing at the top of the Terrace, and the prisoner ran towards him.</p>
               <p>When you first ran out at the door, did you see either of them? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>When you first saw Cook on the Terrace, what was he doing? - He was making a hallooing just before I got to the Terrace, the corner of Cross-street; I met my brother at the top of Cross-street, and told him they had got the property; my brother laid hold of Cook, and coming back I saw Porter run from behind the watch-box, or somewhere about there, as hard as ever he could; I told my brother that Cook was not the man that robbed the window, but that it was him who ran from behind the watch-box; he ran after him, and left Cook on the Terrace; he was not taken up till the next day, after we went to Mr. Blackborough's.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; about six o'clock on the 9th of this month, the prosecutor came to me, and said he was robbed of his watch and half-a-guinea, and some silver; I asked him if he knew the person? he said, yes; she had robbed him in the Red Lion stable; I got up immediately, and he went to the Red Lion, and I followed him to the yard, I then took him with me to the Bell at Hounslow, and asked a carman, whom I met, if he had seen such a person as the prisoner? He said, yes, he saw her a little beyond the Black Dog at Belfound; I advised him to go back, and get his horse, and I got another, and we pursued; we heard of her all the way on the road; we went on to Windsor, and took her nearly within about half a mile from the Bells at Hoseley, near Datchet; I told her she had done a robbery; she said she had not; I desired her to give me the watch she had taken from the gentleman's servant; she said she had no watch, and that she had not robbed any body; I said I would search her; she then gave me the watch, and afterwards I searched her, and found in her pocket only one good shilling, and one bad one, and two linen handkerchiefs, one about her head, and another in her pocket; I put her on my mare, and carried her before Justice Lane, at Belfound, and he committed her; I believe we took her about half past nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw the prosecutor was he perfectly sober? - I did not perceive him to be in liquor; I can't pretend to say.</p>
               <p>How far from Hounslow was it where you took her? - I never was that road much, I only know by information.</p>
               <p>What account did she give of the watch? - She denied it at first, and then she gave it to me on my threatening to search her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that the servant had given me the watch? - No, my Lord, she said he had given her a shilling, but did not mention a thing about his giving her the watch.</p>
               <p>To Culbert. Look at the watch? - It is my watch, I had it at that time, there is no number to it, but I am sure it is my watch; I know the handkerchiefs, my name is on one.</p>
               <p>Court. You will not swear to her taking your money? - No, it might have fell out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>What money had you? - Half-a-guinea, and some silver, I don't know how much.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250046"/>Might not your watch have fell out of your pocket also? - Yes, it might.</p>

               <p>I had been to see my child; I have a child about three months old; I was coming home to Brentford, and I met the gentleman's servant; he asked me to go back, and he would get a bed, and give me something to drink; I went with him, and the house was shut up; we went into the yard, and he put his horse in a stable, and then pulled me in, and locked me in, and left me for half an hour; he then came back, and was to give me half-a-crown; when he felt in his pocket he had but one shilling, and he gave me his watch to keep 'till he got change in the morning; he gave me a handkerchief to tie round my head, and the other I took up in the stable; I was afraid to stay there too late in the morning for fear the people should get up, and see me there.</p>

This box which contains a liquid, I found in his waistcoat pocket, in it were some matches which appeared to have been used, and some not used, one we tried at the moment it was blown and produced a light, (lights a match with it) it is is in the same state now as it was when we found it; I don't recollect now whether it was in his waistcoat or breeches pocket, I put my name on it, and the name of the other officer</p>

At the time we were in the room, Mrs. Almet says, I have lost a prayer-book, she said it was almost a new one, and that she should know it again; for where she had teached the children their catechise, there were the marks of her thumbs, she see the book when she came before the magistrate; the woman was discharged at the request of the prisoners; Houghton said she only came to nurse the child.</p>
               <p>Court. Did one of the crows match to some of the marks, and others to the other marks; or did they all match to one mark? - One of the drawers that is here matches exactly, and several of them I tried there; there is the picked point where they put in the crow. I examined the door of Mrs. Allmet, there appeared marks of violence, as if by some instrument, but these crows did not match.</p>

               <p>On Monday about one o'clock, the prisoner came into Mr. Griffiths's shop, and while I was busied with a lady, he drew back the sash, and took out a piece of lace; I did not see him do it, but I heard the noise of the sash, and when I came there I missed the lace; I went up to the prisoner, and asked him what he wanted, and I discovered the card of lace under his coat; I took him by the collar, there was another that came in with him, but he made off; I suppose the prisoner to be the man that took the lace, for the other was on the other side of the shop.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to buy a pair of stockings; I heard something knock against the window, and I went out, and there I picked up the lace, and I brought it in, and came to the compter, and he took me by the collar.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. Is that true? - Somebody did knock against the window, but the prisoner never went out.</p>
               <p>(The lace deposed to by Griffiths and Johnson.)</p>
               <p>Johnson. When Mr. Griffiths came up into the shop, the prisoner went on his knees, and offered to give him all the money he had if he would let him go free.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I was going up Holborn on Tuesday, the night before last, the 18th, the prisoner asked me to give her a glass of gin, it was near Dean-street; I did, there was another young woman with her, we went to the public-house at the corner, I had never seen them before; then they induced me to go home with them, we went home then to <placeName id="t17890225-23-crimeloc113">Cross-street, Newtoners-lane</placeName>

I missed no other property; I felt my watch drawn out; I told him I was going to No. 11, New Peter-street; he pointed his hand, that is the way, up Great Peter-street; no more passed at that time; he left me, and I went home, I don't know which way he went; I afterwards missed half-a-crown and a shilling, directly after I parted with him, before I got home; the next day I was very bad, I did not go out at all; it was on a Saturday I was robbed; on Monday I went out, and I went round among the pawnbrokers; I found my ring at Mr. Brown's, pawnbroker, in Strutton-ground, Westminster; then I went and got a warrant against the woman that I understood had pawned it; he gave me her name, which he said was Cornwall; I went to the house where I was directed for her, with an officer, to No. 3, Duck-yard; when we went there, we found a woman of the same name, but it was not the prisoner; she went with us to the pawnbroker's; the pawnbroker said, that was not the woman; the woman said, it was one Williams, who had lived there but was gone; this woman said, she would meet us at six o'clock at night to go to some houses, where she thought we might find her, but before night I called, about two o'clock, at the constable's; I had not been in there above five minutes before I received a message; we went both together; I stood at the door, and the constable brought them both out; they were taken before the Justice, and examined; they were searched; I knew the man prisoner again, when he robbed me I observed he had a regimental waistcoat and breeches, but he had a brown great-coat on, he had a flapped hat on, the breeches and things were white, such as they commonly wear; when I saw him again he had on a red jacket, I saw him by the light of the lamp; I have seen the prisoner several times before; and I remembered that night to have seen him before; I had seen him on the Parade, and met him several times, but never had any acquaintance with him; I remembered that night to have seen such a face before on the Parade; I never was in his company, nor did I know where he lived, nor any thing about him; I never heard any thing of my watch.</p>

               <p>So as to lose your senses for a moment? - For a moment I might.</p>
               <p>You live in the neighbourhood of the Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does it happen to you to know, that when complaints are made against soldiers to the officer, they are mustered on the Parade? - I have heard it talked of, but have never been present.</p>
               <p>You did not take any steps to find out the prisoner? - No, I did not, because I did not know where to find him; I should have applied, if I had not found them in such a short time.</p>
               <p>How much of the Monday did you employ in going to the pawnbrokers? - It might be an hour; I was so ill on the Monday that I did not get out of bed till ten.</p>
               <p>Did you swear to him positively on the 19th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you even swear positively to him on the 22d? Do not you know that at last he was only committed on suspicion, and is so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250066"/>now; did you observe any thing else about this man at the time he robbed you? - When I looked up in his face I took notice of his eyes, he had very full eyes, rather a cast in his eyes.</p>
               <p>The Jury will judge of that observation; it is just the reverse, Do you remember the cast in his eyes? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did not it occur to you, Mr. Christie, as a man with a squint is an uncommon thing in a troop, that it would be mighty easy to find that man out on the Parade? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing else remarkable either about the man or his dress? - No, I did not, but very heavy eye-brows; I thought at the moment I saw him come out of the pawnbroker's, I could have positively sworn to him; the magistrate asked me, if I could swear that that was the man that knocked me down; I told him I could not; I told him it was the man that came to my assistance, and helped me up, and took off my ring; I have frequently seen the soldiers on the Parade, and seen the prisoner in a grenadier's cap.</p>
               <p>The time, as nigh as you can fix it, was twenty minutes past nine. - It was.</p>
               <p>Do you know, whether the man that took your ring had on any gaters on? - I cannot say I observed any.</p>
               <p>Did the man who helped you up come in front of you, or behind? - No, he came in front, I saw no other person near me; I did not look behind; I could not see where he came from, he was standing close by me.</p>

               <p>Court. What made you tell her so? - Because I knew a girl of that name there, and I knew she was not the same; she gave me no other name that night: on Monday morning the 19th, about eight o'clock, Mr. Christie came to my house, and asked, if I had seen such things, which he said he had lost; he mentioned a watch, a gold seal, and a mourning ring with the name upon it; I shewed him the ring, and gave him directions where to go to find the woman, where she said she lived; they did not find here there; about two o'clock the same day (Monday) the two prisoners came to my shop, and she asked me for the ring, very well says I, what is this the man that belongs to it? He made answer, yes; he said he found it on the Parade; I had information in the morning, and I sent for a constable; I know no more; the constable and the prosecutor came directly: the ring was brought to me in the condition it now is, which made me think there was some force used to it.</p>

               <p>When did he go centinel? - At ten o'clock that same evening at St. James's; he answered the roll-call at nine that night, I called it myself, it was in the guard-room, Cleveland-row; I saw him under arms a quarter before ten; it is usual to inspect the grenadiers before they go, I did so a quarter before ten, I saw him him dressed in every particular proper to go centinel.</p>
               <p>Explain the difference of a grenadier in the guards, from the other soldiers? - He had a cap on, and his hair platted behind, turned up under the cap, and a large braid very well powdered, it was powdered in the morning, he was in a proper dress to go on his duty, he had white gaters on.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing him in the guard-room at any time between nine and the three quarters? - I might be about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250068"/>eight minutes calling the roll, which consists of one hundred men; no man departs, or is suffered to go out before the roll is called over.</p>
               <p>If the prisoner had been seen in any particular situation in the dress you saw him at the three quarters, do you think it would have escaped the observation of any body; particularly that braid? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What is the distance from the guardroom to St. Ann's-lane? - I think, to the best of my calculation, it is a full English mile.</p>
               <p>Supposing the prisoner to have undressed himself, and to have dressed himself again, so as to be under arms when you saw him, how long would that take him? - He could not put on his white gaters in less than ten minutes, they are very full of buttons, and very hard to put on; or to put on his cap and coat, it would have taken him a quarter of an hour, he can put on his cap himself, and clasp it behind; but it would take some time in doing it.</p>
               <p>Now at the time you inspected, was he in any particular flurry, or did he appear to have run any considerable distance, or to be at all disordered in any manner? - He was not so much disordered as I am now.</p>
               <p>From ten o'clock how long did he continue centinel? - Two hours.</p>
               <p>He could not go off that? - No, he dare not.</p>
               <p>Now do you think, that speaking on your oath, and speaking from caution, it was possible for the prisoner, from twenty minutes past nine, to have come from St. Ann's-lane, and to have equipped himself ready for his duty, in the condition you saw him by a quarter before ten? - I do not think that he could.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as you was in the same regiment for six years, what has been his character as a soldier and a man? - I never knew or heard any thing against him, but being a clean soldier, and always punctual to his duty.</p>
               <p>Did he bear the character of an honest man? - Very honest for any thing I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>Who is his lieutenant-colonel? - Lord Cathcart, he came on the King's guard this morning, or I am very sure he would have appeared.</p>

               <p>I work at Mr. Cotesworth's livery stables, the Dun Horse in the Borough; about a fortnight ago, or better, I purchased a bridle of the prisoner at his lodgings, I cannot say the day of the month; it might be about a fortnight ago; Mr. Cowling's servant employed me to endeavour to buy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250071"/>a bridle of the prisoner; I went to him to a public-house near his lodgings, and I sent for him, he came to me: I asked him, and he said he would let me know in a day or two; he promised to meet me at the City of Bristol, Mint-street, on the Monday following; I went at the time, about seven or half after seven, and he was gone; I saw him on the Thursday following at his lodgings, No. 28. Joiner-street, the back of St. Thomas's hospital; I asked him what bridles he had to dispose of, and he shewed me one plated snaffle bridle; I told him my master had bought a young horse, and we wanted to try him, and we had not a snaffle bridle fit for him, and I wanted one; I went away, and the next night I went to his lodgings again, and agreed with him for the same bridle, I did not buy it; he said the price which he was to have was 3 s. 6 d. he said that he had it of a gentleman's servant who owed him 2 s. that he had given him 6 d. which made it half a crown, and that he only wanted a shilling profit; we agreed; and he helped me to fold it up, and put it in my left hand pocket; I took it immediately, and gave it to the prosecutor's servant; I did not pay him for it that night; we had something to drink. I know the bridle by a particular mark I can swear to.</p>

            . He said he took this bridle to Mr. Cowling, but he said he took it over into the Borough to return it again, he said he took it to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Randall. This is the bridle I agreed for with the prisoner; I marked it, here is the mark; I cut it with the edge of my knife at justice Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether you are sure that that bridle which you had in your hand, is the bridle that the prisoner offered to you? - Yes, I am very sensible of it.</p>
               <p>How do you know that is the bridle? - By a mark I took notice of in the bit, as soon as ever I took it out of the prisoner's hand; there is the letter M under the bit; I took notice of nothing else then, till I marked it at the justices.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the court.)</p>
               <p>Jury. There may be the letter M, on a thousand bridles similar to that? - I put a mark on it before I went to the justices,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250072"/>the same evening that I had it in my own possession; it is the inside of the rein, I marked it with the point of my knife; I made this mark the same day I went to the Justice, the same evening I received it of the prisoner, I made it at a public house.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by saying just now, you made a mark at the Justices? - Not the same day I went to the Justices, I dug a little bit out with the point of my knife.</p>
               <p>Did you make that mark before you delivered it to Mr. Cowling's servant? - Yes, at the time I took it out of my pocket I made it at a public house, before I went to Cowling's servant; I cannot say what house.</p>
               <p>Where was the house? - I cannot say the street, where I was waiting for the ostler, his wife lives there; I believe it was in Princes-street.</p>
               <p>Was it a public house, or a private house? - I cannot particularly say what house it was; one of Mr. Cowling's servants was with me, I believe he is not here.</p>
               <p>What made you go into that house in particular? - On purpose to shew Mr. Cowling's servants the bridle, I was with one of Mr. Cowling's servants, and we went into a house to ask him if he knew it; Mr. Cowling's servant had the bridle, and I took an opportunity of putting the private mark on the bridle.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that man here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - I do not know; he passed for Mr. Cowling's head ostler; they call him John.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was that the man that sent you into the Borough? - The man that applied to me in the Borough, Mr. Cowlings's head ostler, came to me twice, he saw me put the mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boad. This is my bridle; there is a bit of the silver plate rubbed off of one of the cheeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At what place did you mark the bridle? - At a private house, before I shewed it to Mr. Cowling's servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I saw him draw out his knife, and mark that rein of the bridle, at Justice Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Butt. I saw the witness mark the bridle on some part of it in the parlour, next Mr. Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>That was when you attended? - Yes, the bridle had been brought from Mr. Cowling; Mr. Cowling gave it to me at Union Hall.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, where did you mark that bridle? - In the right hand rein.</p>
               <p>But in what place was you when you marked it? - I first marked it in a room in Mr. Wilmot's office; and afterwards I did not think it was sufficient for me to know it, and I marked it again.</p>
               <p>What, after you took it to Mr. Wilmot's office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how did you dare to tell the court just now, that you marked it on the night the prisoner shewed it to you? - It was not visible; here is a scratch across it, and I made it plainer.</p>
               <p>But you shewed the gentleman that mark, and said you put it on there, and no where else; how did you dare to say that.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are perfectly satisfied.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough; on the 11th of this month a gentleman who keeps a linen draper's shop in East Smithfield, had been robbed of a quantity of silk handkerchiefs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250077"/>I searched the prisoner's house the 11th of February, I found all the tools that are here in court. (produced and respectively deposed to.) Some I found up stairs in a room which adjoins the prisoner's bedchamber, that looked like a warehouse-room; there was some hemp and some cotton, and some other articles, it was not furnished as I could see, and some in a closet up stairs; the closet door was shut, not locked; I found the rest in that room and in a closet, and some below stairs in a back-room which adjoins his kitchen; it had been a drinking room.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it an open room? - Yes, it is at the back of the kitchen, the things were laying about the back-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You went alone to execute this search warrant? - I did not, one Bear and another man went with me, who had the search warrant; the things have been safe ever since.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a headborough, I attend the Public-office in East Smithfield, and I am an officer of the four counties beside; some of the things were in a closet up stairs, and there were more in a chest, they were all loose about the floor; this man keeps a public-house on Saltpetre-bank; it was the 11th of February, the man made no objection to any searching of the house, he behaved very well to me; the man was admitted to bail at first, there was a quarrel between the other officer and Bear before he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the room below stairs, in which some of these things were found, was next the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the kitchen a place where the people used to sit and drink in? - No, there is a very large tap-room; the kitchen and the other room in which some of the articles were, is at the back of the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Was it a private room, or such a room as people might go to drink in occasionally? - Such a room as people might go into occasionally.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in that room were these goods found? - There are two cupboards in that room, but they were open, some of the things were in them, and some laying on the floor.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was servant to the prisoner at the time this happened, I lived with him three months; there was a man that boarded and and lodged in the house for a fortnight, he passed for a ship's carpenter, his name was Davis, and he left some of the things there, and there were more people came with him in company, and they left some things; he got into my master's debt to the value of five or six and twenty shillings, and he left them there till they should be called for.</p>
               <p>Did any of the other persons owe your master any money? - They owed some money for some beer, and they left these things and were to call for them.</p>
               <p>Do you know at what time any of those were left? - About three weeks or a month before Christmas; what Davis and the other man left was not at the same time, but at other times, all before Christmas.</p>
               <p>In what part of the house used these things to be kept? - My master desired me to put them in the kitchen, they were publicly open there, they were not concealed from any body; I did not continue with him till the officer came, I cannot tell how long they were there; my master never could find or hear any thing of Davis since he went away in his debt.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you live with your master? - Three months; Davis brought some tools.</p>
               <p>Which of them did he bring? - The things that were produced.</p>
               <p>You say that Davis, about three weeks, or a month before Christmas, brought some things to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - It was wrapped up in a basket, I never opened the basket, I was in the tap-room when he brought them in;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250078"/>he did not open the basket, nor I did not open the basket.</p>
               <p>What became of the basket? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How do you know what was in it? - Because he said they were tools, and to take care of them; I did not see the basket open, I do not know what was in it, only he said they were his tools; the basket was left at my master's.</p>
               <p>Is the basket there now? - It was a basket like this, I cannot say what became of the basket, I cannot say what became of the tools, only they were put by; there were people in company with Davis at other times; and the next week after that somebody else brought tools, they were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>In another basket? - Yes, and bags too, and the people came in to drink with Davis.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay? - Till six in the afternoon, I cannot say what time they came in, it was about twelve I believe.</p>
               <p>Did they come any more? - No, I never saw them afterwards, I did not hear their names, I was busy about the house.</p>
               <p>How came they to leave their tools? - They said they would call for them again, I staid with my master after that two months.</p>
               <p>Did you stay with your master till he was taken up? - No, I was away, I have left my master three weeks to-day; they never called for their things afterwards; they owed my master for some beer, I cannot tell how much; the man brought them into the tap-room, and I brought them into the kitchen; my master desired me to take and put them backwards into the kitchen, till he had time to put them by; he put them by when he had time, some of them the next day, I did not see him put them by; they were put by at different times; I cannot tell how my master put them by, I did not see my master take them out, I never took them out, he put them in a great chest as he said; I did not see him, I saw them there; he said if any body called for them they were there; he put them altogether in a great chest, that great chest stood in a drinking-room; he told me if he was out of the way they were there.</p>
               <p>How came he to take different people's property out of their bags and boxes, and put them altogether in one chest? - I did not see him doing it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that you saw them in the chest? - Yes, I went there for some other things, there were some other things with them in the chest.</p>
               <p>What other things? - I do not know; jackets and coats, and things, the chest never was locked, they were all together; the workmen appeared like carpenters, Davis called himself a carpenter shipwright; I cannot tell where he lived.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me whether any of these people called for their tools since? - Not that I know of, I have seen none of them since.</p>
               <p>You staid staid two months afterwards? - Yes; Davis kept them above three weeks, a month before Christmas, the day of the month I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to any one of the prosecutors. Is not it a common thing for carpenters to leave their tools at a public house? - It is a common thing.</p>
               <p>The publicans have no difficulty in taking them until called for? - Not in the least; I have done it myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it a common thing to leave such a number of tools as these for drink, from six to twelve, and not call for them for two months? - No, not such a quantity.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who all gave him a very good character, one of whom is a publican, and deposes that he had frequently had tools left with him for a month, sometimes for a fortnight or three weeks, and that he has had eighteen planes at a time left with him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What is there remarkable in that nut not being able to come off easily, in the nut of an axle-tree being rusty, where is it different from any other axle-tree that has a nut that is got rusty, and will not come off? - I do not say it is, it might be in another as well as in mine.</p>
               <p>You that use carts, and use iron axle-trees, know it is a very common thing for them to rust on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know it by that at all? - I do not know it particularly.</p>
               <p>Have you any mark at all on that axle-tree, is it not like any other? - Yes, undoubtedly it is.</p>
               <p>You did not make it yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>You bought it, I suppose, second-hand? - I did so.</p>
               <p>Is the person here whom you bought it of? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all that you know is, that you had an axle-tree that was fixed to a wheel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On which there was nothing particular? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. I think you pointed out a crack in the bed of the axle-tree? - Yes, here it is.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing remarkable in that crack? - The remarkableness is such, that I can swear to it; I will not take upon myself to say, but what another might possibly be made to fit it, but it is almost a miracle:</p>
               <p>Do not the beds of these kind of things frequently crack? - I have never another that is so, nor ever had; I think I could be positive to that to swear to it among a thousand.</p>
               <p>Could the wheel have been got off without the nut being taken off? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt but that is your own axle-tree? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you made any observations on that axle-tree to enable you to swear now that it is yours? - Yes, I have, when I bought it I made that remark of the crack on the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you made that remark of the crack when you bought it, and before it was stolen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you remarked before it was stolen, what you have mentioned respecting the nut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you tried to get the nut off? - Yes, and could not.</p>
               <p>What, before it was stolen? - Yes, in the day-time on the 23d.</p>
               <p>How long have you had it? - I cannot say positively, I believe about four months.</p>

               <p>Did you go the strait way to your master? - Why, I might have gone a nearer way to be sure; I put it down in the warehouse; when I came to my master's, my master was up; he came backwards, and just saw the axle-tree, and said he would have nothing at all to do with it, and he ordered it off his premises, and was rather angry with me fetching it; I do not know whether it was Mr. Fleming, or my master, or both, I cannot say, ordered me to take the axle-tree on the ruins, I cannot recollect by which it was; I put it upon the ruins.</p>
               <p>What became of the tire? - I do not know, I went to work; I did not put the tire on the ruins, but only the axle-tree.</p>
               <p>Should you know the axle-tree? - I cannot swear to it; I did not observe any particular mark.</p>

               <p>Jury. What was your reason for carrying that large weight a further way about than you might have done? - By the order of Mr. Fleming, to go up New Pye-street.</p>
               <p>Was that more out of the way of any body's observation than any other road? - Not a great deal.</p>
               <p>Is it more concealed or private than the other? - It is rather more out of the way than if I had gone along the street.</p>

               <p>I am a clergyman, a doctor in divinity, I live adjoining to the house where this lad works, I have known him between three or four years, he is a parish apprentice, put out to a master who could not employ him in his business; there was no care taken of the boy of any sort or kind, the boy was forced to run of errands, I have entrusted him often, my servants did the same, he was often in my house, in the kitchen, among my servants, where he might have stolen many things, if he had been so disposed; he was remarkable for activity and the best of tempers, as far as I know of him, he was always honest; the boy did not ask me to come, I thought it my duty, I always had a good opinion of him; the boy is of a remarkable sweet temper and good behaviour.</p>
               <p>Court. What parish did he come from? - I believe St. George's parish.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. ROSE sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known him about three years, I am enabled to give him the best of characters, and so far enabled that I have commissioned him with money which he has carried to considerable distances, and has fetched money from a considerable distance, and has always been honest, punctual and upright.</p>
               <p>- MUNDAY, Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I am no business, I live on my fortune, I have known the boy four or five years; I always found him very honest and sober, I have entrusted him with several pieces of money; if he is acquitted I will willingly take him into my service.</p>

               <p>The Rev. Mr. Rose. My lord, provided this boy is acquitted, there are more than one, two, or three that would take him into their service.</p>
               <p>Court. Have any of you, gentlemen, any employ for this lad; he has been found guilty, but if you can find any way of employing him, that is likely to prevent him from falling into these courses again, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250089"/>can not withstanding that verdict put it into your power to do so.</p>

               <p>I was intoxicated in liquor the 23d of January; returning to my lodgings about half past nine, which is at the White Bear in Princes-street, Red Lion-square, I was accosted by a woman, I never saw her before; she is not here, I believe it was in Newtoner's-street in Holborn, I went with her to her lodgings, the prisoner at the bar was at the room that she took me to; they then asked me for something to drink, which I gave them; I gave the money to the woman that carried me there.</p>
               <p>Court. What money? - As much as paid for two or three glasses of gin, about three pence I believe; as soon as they had drunk it, I found it was rather late to go to my lodging; the woman that I went with asked me what I would give to sleep there; I told them I was a <rs id="t17890225-69-deflabel318" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Did you search the floor for the guinea? - I sought for it some little time, but I did not give myself much trouble about it.</p>
               <p>Why might not the things you lost be on the floor as well as the others? - Very possibly they might; I think it was impossible the other woman could take them, I am sure the prisoner is the person I was with; she denied knowing any thing of it.</p>

               <p>I live near the last witness; on Friday the 20th of February, I was going up Howland-street. I met the last witness; she was crying, and appeared in great agitation; she told me she had lost the things in the indictment, and described the person of the prisoner; I pursued her, and had information from a publick-house boy, which way she went; I pursued her down Charlotte-street, and she was running; when she perceived I had got ground of her, she stopt and began crying; I asked her what could induce her to rob such a poor woman; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250092"/>cried, Oh, Sir! Oh, Sir! I then wanted to take the things out of her lap, which she refused; I took her by the arm, and led her to Mrs. Segary's; I then took some of the things out of her lap and shewed to Mrs. Segary, and she said it was her property; and she told me, that the prisoner was the person that she saw in the kitchen before, she said so in the hearing of the prisoner; the constable took her to the watch-house, and searched her pockets, and there he found two nails, which appeared very bright, one turned up like a pick-lock, it appeared very much used.</p>

               <p>What state was the door in? - The door of a night is generally on the spring, we have a spring and a catch.</p>
               <p>Then the door was shut to without being catched? - I will not say whether it was catched or not; I believe the spring was not let loose that night; it was shut to.</p>
               <p>Had the door any fastening at all? - There is a catch and a spring, when the spring goes it will not open without somebody comes to open it for them.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your own knowledge, whether it was catched or no? - I cannot say whether it was catched or not; but I know if anybody goes out of the shop the door will catch.</p>
               <p>How came you to watch in the shop? - Because we had lost so many things, and we set the glass there to catch the thief.</p>
               <p>Then, if the spring had not been let go they could come in to take the glass? - I suppose it was the mistake of the porter not shutting the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you know that the porter had committed that mistake then? - Yes, I knew that the door was left in that manner to see if any body would come in.</p>
               <p>Then it was not the mistake of the porter; now, perhaps, you thought it more likely that somebody would come if the door was shut and not latched? - I believe it was latched, because if any body goes out, it will catch, but I cannot say whether any body had gone out, or whether it was latched.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250095"/>What do you mean? - I was going from No. 4 in the Cloisters, moving my lodging; I was going to No. 5, Red Lion-court, Catherine-street, in the Strand; I had the trunk under one arm, and the child in the other; the prisoner overtook me a little beyond St. Andrew's Church, Holborn; he said I must be very much tired, and desired me to let him carry the trunk a little way; I said I would not deliver my trunk to any body, that I did not know, there were such accidents happened in London; he walked with me to Middle-row, Holborn; and I went through Staple's-inn, I was going to call at my brother's; when I came to the Inn, I says, Sir, I will thank you, if you will give me my box; he then said, I was not afraid to trust the child with him, and he took the child from me by force; I told him I did not like to let the child go; then he carried the child a little way, and I suppose he must pinch the child, I will not swear that; the child cried violently; I took the child from him, and then he took the box from me by force.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the trunk to carry when you took the child from him? - No I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes; when I come to the passage that leads to my brother's at No. 5, in Bell-yard, I desired him to give me my box; he said he would not before I got something to drink; he said I must be in want of something to drink; says I, Sir if you want any thing to drink, you can get it at this inn, I believe; he said no, we will go to the public-house a little way below here; I really do not know the name of the inn, it is in <placeName id="t17890225-77-crimeloc354">Chancery-lane</placeName>

               <p>Where had you put the trunk when he took it up? - In side the public-house, just by the door in the tap-room; all this was in the tap-room, there are witnesses to prove it.</p>
               <p>What public-house was this you went into? - I think it is the Mitre in Chancery-lane, I did not know the public-house, I never went into a public-house with a strange man before in my life; I went out with the glass in my hand, and said O Lord! O Lord! my box is gone; I went as hard as I could run, and called out stop thief, as loud as I could, and he was stopped by the patrol at the bottom of Chancery-lane, near Fleet-street; I have spoke nothing but the truth, he had the trunk when he was stopped by the patrol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mrs. Russell, you had not been acquainted with the man before, he was quite a stranger to you? - Quite a stranger, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>And you was going from St. Andrew's Church to Middle-row? - I was going from No. 4 in the Cloysters, Newgate-street, to No. 5 in Red Lion-court, Catherine-street, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>You went into the house with the man who was quite a stranger to you? - I went in to follow my trunk.</p>
               <p>Then when he had paid for the liquor, he took up the trunk, in the presence of all the people, and went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were several people there? - Yes, I do not know how many, I was quite ashamed.</p>
               <p>Do you know any woman of the name of Ewitt or Ewen? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you do not? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>How long has your name been Russell? - About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>You have been married as long as that; where was you married? - I am not come to swear that.</p>

            's own in the trunk? - There was a shirt and neck handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I ask you the plain question; upon your oath, is not your own name Ewitt, or Ewen? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>How long has your name been Ewitt or Ewen? - It never was.</p>
               <p>What was your maiden-name? - Elizabeth Gurnsey.</p>
               <p>That was your maiden-name? - Yes, I never went by the name of Ewitt or Ewen, I never went by that name in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - I do.</p>
               <p>Where was you married? I do not ask you whether you are married.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was you married? - If the Judge requires me to say it I will.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes. That is not an improper question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What church or chapel was you married in, I fancy the child could answer it as well as you? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you mean you have forgot it? - The prisoner said he would be d - d if he did not make my husband fly the country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If it is understood that is all I mean: do you remember saying before the Lord Mayor, that you had never been in that house with the prisoner at all? - No, I never said it, I spoke before the Alderman as I speak here.</p>
               <p>You are positive you never said so? - Yes, I can swear that.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the magistrate that you did not know he was the man? - The prisoner's brother came, and drew out two of my brothers, I swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Did you say before the magistrate, that you did not know that this was the man? - I never did; after I swore, and kissed the book.</p>
               <p>Did you before you kissed, say that you did not know whether this was the man or not, at any time or at any place? - I am not come to answer that.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time or at any place say, that you did not know whether this was the man or not? - I swear to the man, and I swear the truth.</p>
               <p>Nay, more, did not you say he was not the man? - I said at first as the prisoner's brother ordered me, and I swore to the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever say he was not the man to any body? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Never to any body? - I said before I swore, but I swore to the truth.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you ever say that he was not the man? - I never said that he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Court. You never said to any body that he was not the man; you are sure of that? - I cannot say whether I did say so at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>What magistrate was it that you was examined before? - It was that Alderman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect his name; the Alderman is in this house, now at this time; upon your oath, did not you say distinctly, before the Alderman, that this was not the man that had the trunk? - No, I did not say that.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I said I rested the box at the door, and that with the fright the man run away with it; I did say that I could not swear rightly to the man, but then there were evidence that could speak the truth, and they made me kiss the bible.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the magistrate that this was not the man? - I am not to answer, I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, before you was sworn before the magistrate, that this was not the man? - I said I could not swear to the man, but after I took my oath I spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Then you did say before the magistrate that you could not tell which was the man? - They made me say it.</p>
               <p>What was the price that made you say that? - I never took any thing myself.</p>
               <p>Who did; who was your trustee on this occasion? - My husband got into a public-house, and they made him drunk; they offered seven guineas, he took three; and afterwards he offered it back, and they would not take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250097"/>Was you present then? - No, they said it afterward, I was not present.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that; was not you in the room when he took it? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Nor in the house? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell told you he had got three guineas? - That I should not speak the truth till I was made to be put to my oath.</p>
               <p>So you took three guineas to tell a lye, resolving at the same time to tell the truth; the prisoner was in custody, I take it for granted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not that since you was before the magistrate? - No, it was before I went to the Justice; it was the Sunday following after the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you tell the Justice, that you had not been into any public-house at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that positively? - Yes, I will swear that positively, I will indeed, not after I had taken my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you before you took the oath? - I said I was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the Justice that you had drank no liquor with him, and had not been into any public-house? - I did not say those words; I am not able to stand.</p>
               <p>Well then let her sit down; do you mean to swear that you did not tell the Justice, that you had not been in any house? - I told the Justice at first that I had rested my box at the door, and there was a man took the box, but I could not swear to the man, that I called out stop thief, but could not swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Did you say distinctly upon being asked the question by the Court? - I was not asked that question by the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Nor by any body else? - I was not asked that question by any body else; I said nothing before the witnesses was sworn.</p>
               <p>Before or after, or at any other time, did you or not say, that you had not been into any other house? - I did not say it.</p>
               <p>How far is this Mitre ale-house from the bottom of Chancery-lane, Fleet-street? - It is by Serjeant's-inn, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Next door to a very convenient house, where there is a lamp in the window? - I never was with a strange man in a public-house.</p>
               <p>Is not it opposite Serjeant's-inn coffee-house? - I cannot say, I never was in the public-house before, it was in the evening before dark.</p>
               <p>You did not go to your brother before you went to the ale-house? - He would not let me have my box, I was obliged to go.</p>
               <p>Why did not you complain when you went into the public-house, and tell them that this man had robbed you; you chose gin, did not you Mrs. Russell? - I did not Sir.</p>
               <p>Was not gin ordered by your own desire; was not it the liquor of your own chusing? - I cannot say but it was; I must have my box.</p>
               <p>Do you remember saying before the magistrate that you did not believe the man, whoever he was, intended to take your box away, but that you was in a flurry, and cried out stop thief? - I am quite sure I never said that.</p>

               <p>On Saturday evening between six and seven, I was at the Mitre in Chancery-lane, and while I was drinking part of a pint of beer, the woman and the prisoner came in there, and he asked the woman what she wished to drink; she said gin; he desired the landlord to give him the best gin, the landlord gave it him, and he drank the first glass; while the woman was drinking the second glass, he took up the trunk, and out of the door he went; the woman went after him.</p>
               <p>Who brought in the trunk? - The woman, I am sure of that; she went after him as soon as ever she could turn herself round with the child, and called out stop thief; and I likewise called out stop thief; he was taken at the bottom of Chancery-lane with the trunk upon him, I was not nigh enough to see him; I saw him with the trunk afterwards, the trunk was left in a butcher's shop, and he was brought to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250098"/>the publick-house where he took it out of; he said his name was Mendoza.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This publick-house is very near the end of Chancery-lane? - I believe it is opposite Serjeants' Inn Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>The woman came in pretty freely? - The woman came in first with the trunk, and the child and he after her as soon as he could; I was before the magistrate, I cannot remember what she said there.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear her say before the magistrate, that she did not know the man that took her trunk? - That she would not swear to the man?</p>
               <p>Did not she say that she did not know him? - I cannot rightly say that.</p>
               <p>Try, try? - I cannot indeed.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not? - I cannot rightly say that.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not, Sir, in your hearing? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Look across and try, pray Mr. Fitch, what are you? - Sir, what am I; a poor man.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in, look at those gentlemen now, and speak out, take your own time to consider what way of life you are, and then give us an answer. - She told the Alderman.</p>
               <p>She did not tell the Alderman what way of life you was in, that is my present question; what way of life are you in? - I get my bread going on board of ships, or waiting on the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>How do you mean? - On board the Indiamen, and since then I have got into the India-house.</p>
               <p>Which of the warehouses are you in? - I am down at Botolph-wharf now at present.</p>
               <p>At that time you was what they call a cadee out of work? - I was not quite out of work.</p>
               <p>Did not she say distinctly in your hearing, in the presence of the magistrate, that she did not know the man that took her trunk? - She said she would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Did not she say she did not know him? Try your hand, now, Mr. Fitch. - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Did not she say, that she stood at the door, and did not go into the publick-house with her trunk? - I cannot recollect, indeed.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that she did not in your hearing say so? - I will not swear that, because I am sure if I was to swear it I should swear a falsity.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Mr. Russell made the bargain for three guineas? - I was not.</p>
               <p>You have not had any? - I have not, nor ever desired any.</p>
               <p>You are to have part of that, I take it for granted.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that you are a porter in one of the East India warehouses at this time? - I am down at Botolph's wharf; I have 12 s. a week.</p>
               <p>That manner of answering will not do, you must answer it directly? - I am at the compting-house down at Botolph's wharf, and I have 12 s. a week.</p>
               <p>I ask you a direct plain question, to which I will have a direct plain answer. - I am at the compting-house down at Botolph's wharf; there is no warehouse there, I go at six in the morning, and I light a fire for the clerks, and I stay there all day for Mr. Dominicas.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in his employ? - Last Saturday was a week.</p>
               <p>What was you before that? - I used to go on board ship to wait on the gentlemen, as I had been in the Company's employ, and have lost my leg.</p>
               <p>Why were you so shy of telling what your way of life was at first? - I did not understand the gentleman's meaning.</p>

               <p>Was it about the time you generally light candles? - We were forced to light candles, because I was writing, but it was sufficiently light enough for me to see him run across the Bury.</p>
               <p>Was not it about the time that you usually shut up shop? - It was rather before, because our servant had shut up without our attending to it.</p>

               <p>A man came to me, and asked me the way to the Golden-Cross, Charing-Cross, while I was telling him, I saw my master come out of the warehouse, and on the other side of the way I saw a man cross, and somebody said at that very time, run for it, and he ran a few yards, and then I saw him drop the goods; I was in Milk-street, just about five yards off I picked up the goods.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him so as to know him again? - Yes, I was close to him when he dropped the goods, it was a wet night.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the person that was afterwards taken was the same person that dropped the goods? - Yes, I am sure of it, the very same person was brought to our warehouse.</p>
               <p>(The goods produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowling. These are our goods, one piece was bought from a neighbour to make up an order, we were in a hurry; I know those goods were on the compter, they were part of some returned from the country; I have no doubt at all but they were the goods taken out of our warehouse; there was another lad, who lives with Mr. Allen, in Love-lane, but he had not been running, there was nobody running across Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say after you had laid hold of him, and brought him back? - I thought he had been a stouter person than I found he was; he was wrapped up in a great-coat; I struck him twice, he made no complaint at all of ill usage, he said nothing to the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called five witnesses, who gave gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Dowling. Do you recollect how the prisoner was dressed the night you took him up? - He was dressed much like what thieves are in general, with a brown great coat on, and a red handkerchief about his neck.</p>
               <p>Had you taken notice of his dress at all when you saw him go off from the shop? - I saw a short person, with a hat on, and a great coat.</p>
               <p>Had you taken notice of the colour of his great-coat before he dropped the goods? It was in the warehouse, which is rather darker than in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250104"/>But when you saw him in the street, at the time he dropped the goods, did you see how he was dressed? - I did not remark how he was dressed.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Did you take notice how the prisoner was dressed when you saw him drop the goods? - He had a silk handkerchief round his neck, and a brown greatcoat.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the lad Lloyd dressed? - In the same dress he is now.</p>
               <p>Without a great coat? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; coming from Stepney I saw the prisoner and two more by Alderman Shakespeare's Causeway, about fifty yards up the causeway, I saw them come out of Brook-street and run; they were all dressed alike.</p>
               <p>How far is Brook-street from Whitecross-street? - I look upon it where I took the prisoner was about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house; it was between nine and ten on Friday the 13th of September; I saw them all divide themselves, and the prisoner walked up first, I did not hear them converse together, I was too far off from them, they were all together; as they turned up the street, after one turned up the street, another made a sham to stop; and as the prisoner walked past me, I thought he had something under his coat, and I took hold of him; he said he had been of an errand for his mother, but he could not tell where; I found this bundle just as it is now wrapped up in this apron; the apron was not tied round him; they appeared to me to be all gentlemen's sons at first, I took them to be all brothers, being dressed so genteel; he had the bundle under his great coat, the property was sealed up, and I left it in the prosecutor's possession, that they might not be rumpled; I sealed it, and left it till I went to the magistrate's, then I put my seal on, and gave them to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hurley. I brought it here.</p>
               <p>Forrester. This is the seal I put upon it; (produced and deposed to) he said they were his mother's in the street; I took him to the public-house and tied his hands; the other two flew like lightning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach, Prisoner's Counsel. At the time you found the property, did it appear as if it had been in the dirt? - There is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250105"/>one of them appears to have a little dirt; it was not a dry morning, he told me afterwards that he found them on a dunghill; I do not know there is any reward in this case; Mr. Berry, the clerk of the indictments examined the gentlewoman whether her door was fast; and she said yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hurley. Did you see the door fast yourself? - Yes, I saw it fastened when I went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Who opened the door in the morning? - The apprentice; I did not see him open it, I came down a little before nine, and went into the shop.</p>
               <p>How did you find the door when you came down a little before nine? - I found the door shut.</p>
               <p>Did you go out at that time? - I went out about five minutes into the kitchen, and I left the door fast, and when I came in again I found the door was open, and I missed the things.</p>
               <p>Did you see the apprentice fasten it? - No; if the door had not been shut, I must have seen it was open.</p>
               <p>It is possible that it might be very near shut? - I am sensible it was shut.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you observed it so, as to know it was shut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you made this observation upon it, was it before you went down into the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not try it? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was you in the kitchen? - I imagine it might be five minutes, it might be more, but I do not think it was; when I returned I found the door was wide open, and the things were gone; when I came back it was after nine, nothing was broke.</p>
               <p>Have you any of your servants here, or that apprentice, to speak about the state of the house? - No; I can speak with certainty to all the cloaks to be mine; one of them I took the lace off myself, and some of them have our marks; some is not marked, but I am very sure they are our property; I did not know directly the number I had missed at that time.</p>
               <p>Have you at any time examined your shop? - I thought I missed about eight or nine, but I did not know I had lost ten; I was not sure to the number.</p>
               <p>The things deposed to above the value of 40 s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I was coming with my daughter to London on the 27th of January; I had a trunk before the chaise, and having been cautioned about the possibility of its being cut off the chaise, both me and my daughter looked frequently to see if the trunk was on; the last time we saw it on we went into the next street by the Seven Dials; there we missed the trunk, the postilion-endeavoured to see whether it was dropped, it was not dropped there; I think that was near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250107"/>six o'clock; I then recollected the Rotation-office at Litchfield-street; I went there and gave information of my loss; I was called back by some of the people belonging to the office, saying that a trunk was secured at the watch-house, and that a man was brought in; the trunk I verily believe to be my property, but it has been used for my daughter's things; and as to the contents, they were principally my daughter's; she can give an account of them; I waited at Litchfield-street till they brought the trunk and the man; there was then an immediate examination, the trunk was in the possession of one Furneau.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long was it from the time you saw the trunk yourself, till you was told they had seen the trunk? - I should suppose it was twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>

               <p>What did you say? - I said, you are the thief; then I might be about five or six yards below the watch-house, and he threw down the trunk; I ran after him, calling out stop thief; he ran as far as Frith-street, where, by the assistance of a shoemaker, he tumbled down; the shoemaker and myself collared him; then my master and me went home; about six o'clock, the watch-house keeper sent for us, they took the prisoner to the Justice; we went to the watch-house, and carried the trunk to the Justice; we took the trunk home again to my master's house, where it has been ever since; the trunk is here.</p>

               <p>Are you very sure that that man you saw at the watch house, was the man you saw with the trunk on his shoulders? - Yes, I saw him once at the Rotation-office; I knew him again then, that is the man that I saw with the trunk; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The first thing that you observed, was a man as you thought entangled in the wheel of the chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then somebody else told you they would do you a mischief: How long was the man when you saw him in your view? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>He was leaning on the perch? - Yes, he went away with the trunk, he went the same way that I was going.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him before in your life? - Never.</p>
               <p>When you went to the watch-house, you had been told that the man was found with the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore you expected to see the right man at the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you came to the watch-house then you saw this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, how is it, that you come to swear positively to a man whom you saw the first time in your life, for three minutes leaning on a carriage, and running with a trunk? - Because, when he came from under the coach, it was almost the turn of a street, and he came as near to me as I am to you, and he was going quickly, and I saw his face by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>What time of the evening was it when you first saw the man? - Between five and six, the 27th of January.</p>
               <p>You did not see his face while he was under the carriage? - I did not, I saw him when he came from the carriage, and came on the pavement.</p>
               <p>How near was the other man at the time? - He was standing almost abreast of me; my attention was a little taken up with him after the prisoner was gone by me.</p>
               <p>Had not the prisoner an iron on at the watch-house? - I did not see it, I heard that the man was taken, and as I was going to the watch-house I expected to see the same man I saw before.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer in the East India Company's service, under Mr. Corbert; I picked up a piece of muslin handkerchief on Friday the 13th of February by the prisoner at the bar; I know nothing of his taking it; he was standing on one side clear of the other man, close to the loop-hole, which is the place where the goods are taken in by the crane; he is a servant, he was standing in the warehouse; the muslins are kept about three or four yards from where he was.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else standing where the prisoner was? - There were several other people standing by him, but not nearer than a yard; I took the piece of muslin, and carried it to the elder, Mr. Oakley; I did not mark it, but I should know it; the mark upon it is 2413, Ry signifies the Rodney; this I am sure is the piece; the prisoner is a labourer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Which of you have been the longest in the warehouse? - I have been there four years, and the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, six or seven months; he was put in by the late Mr. Mickie, as I understand.</p>
               <p>You are very properly there set to watch each other; I think very often a piece is missing, is not there? - Sometimes there are.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250113"/>There is a certain black board that he puts you down on; is not there? - Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>How near was this man from that bale out of which this was taken? - Twenty yards or more; he was in that warehouse where this was deposited.</p>
               <p>Was there a number of people to see the goods? - Yes, there were a number of people, and it was at the conclusion of the sale; there were a great number of persons at the sale.</p>
               <p>Any ladies in the warehouse at that time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had you never had any quarrel with this man? - Never, he was a good-natured well-behaved man, for what I know; I never till that day passed three words with him; I had not had three words with him that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Have the labourers any thing to do with these muslins? - Yes, he was employed that day in carrying them about; we have counters in the warehouse, and the lots may be where you are; we carry the lots backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer in the East-India warehouse, on the 13th of February in the warehouse in Leadenhall-street; at two o'clock we were at the door thinking to go out as usual, to our homes; the door was fastened, the goods had been shewn and were replaced; all that we shewed, Mr. Oakley had given orders that none should go out till the piece was found; we went back into the room, and some went searching about to find these things; there was John Way in an alley, between two rows of bales; he was looking at a lot; Nash was near us; I went away, and he gave me a hint; after we were all ordered to be stript and searched, the prisoner moved from the place where he stood, to another part of the room, and I seeing him go forward, followed him close up, and I saw him go to the end of one of our long tables, and I saw him pull out a piece of white goods from his right side, and as soon as I saw him pull out those goods, I told Way he had dropt it; I did not see him drop it; we went round and picked it up.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that at the time you speak of, all the goods were put in their places? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did you ever come away till all the goods were in their places? - Yes, sometimes we leave them on the floor uncovered, and sometimes covered.</p>
               <p>Court to Way. When you packed up this piece of goods, was it a place where the goods were usually laid? - No.</p>
               <p>Oakley produced the piece of goods given to him by Way, marked No. 2413, Ry.</p>

               <p>I live in Little Moorfields; I had ordered some goods to be removed to Sugar Loaf Court; there was a fire on the 15th of last January, which fire consumed a great many things; I was then possessed of some iron stove-grates; I did not know where they were removed to; that house was for the purpose of making a sale in, I was not insured, the fire was at that house; I lost a number of articles, I recollect two stoves in particular; I heard they were somewhere, and I applied to the sitting Alderman for a search warrant, it was granted me, the officer went with me to search the premises of the prisoner; I begged the officer to stop at the public-house 'till I went to see whether I could get my property of Morris; I went to his house, he was not there; some conversation passed between Mrs. Morris and me respecting the stoves, in consequence of which I saw Mr. Morris, either the morning following or the morning after it; on Thursday the 5th of January the fire was; this was either the Friday or Saturday after, I was on the ruins seeing what I could find; between the ruins and Mr. Morris's house, I saw him standing, when I came off the ruins, I then missed the two stoves in particular; I was saying to Morris what a cruelty it was of people robbing at that particular time; I asked him, whether he saw any body take any of the things away? he said, no, he did not, nor he knew nothing at all about them; that passed on; about a week after, when I had information that some of my property was in Mr. Morris's possession, my having spoke to him before, I thought it most prudent to apply to the magistrate for a search warrant, which was granted me; but before the constable executed it, I begged of him to wait at a publick-house 'till I went to Mr. Morris's; Mr. Morris was not at home, then I came back for the officer, and went with him, I think it was the 26th of January; in the one pair of stairs I saw one of my Bath stoves with a fire in it; we came down stairs, and in the yard we saw Mr. Morris, he then was come: I told him then our business; that we had a search warrant, and what we had found; I begged of him to be generous enough to tell me where the rest were; he flew into a very great passion, and used very indecent language; I told him that would not do, we would go on on; we did so, and under a heap of dung, in one of his yards, we found concealed another Bath stove, that was covered over with dung, I suppose there was a foot of dung laid over it; we searched there by information, the stoves were brought forwards opposite to Mr. Morris's door, which is close to Ludgate; Mr. Teag was standing at the door; and Mr. Morris said, that he borrowed the stove which had the fire in it of Mr. Teag; I immediately replied, what! Mr. Teag, did you lend that stove to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250115"/>Morris? His answer was, no: I lend the stove! that I did not; the prisoner was taken before the magistrate, I cannot recollect whether what was said was taken down in writing; he begged the favour of Mr. Teag to accompany us, which he did, he was there during the whole examination; Mr. Morris there said, that he thought the stove was his own; the Alderman asked him, when he saw it, did he know it was not his own; he said, yes, he did, but he thought it was his partner's, Mr. Cole; the Alderman asked him, whether he had inquired of Mr. Cole, whether it was his property or not; he said he did; that Mr. Cole's answer was, it was not his. I have seen both the stoves, they are my property, to the best of my knowledge; I have not the least doubt about it; my people are perfectly satisfied they are mine, and they know better than I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. What way of life are you in? - A sworn broker.</p>

            , of Dove-Court? - I am his son.</p>
               <p>Now I want to get a little acquainted with the geography of those premises; there was a wheeler's shop near the premises of the defendant? - There was adjoining.</p>
               <p>Upon that wheeler's shop you had a distress, and brought those goods to make a sale? - I had made a distress, and I brought in other goods to make a sale there, by permission.</p>
               <p>How long before that intended sale was this fire? - The things were hardly taken in, the sale was advertised for the next day; I believe the fire broke out on my premises; I have no other reason but to suppose so; I mean to confine myself strictly to truth.</p>
               <p>I believe you was not the only sufferer by that fire? - I cannot say, I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Do not you know you was not? - No, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Why, upon your oath, do not you know that the prisoner was obliged to move his family, his wife who had lately lain in, and all his children, into the prison of Ludgate? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he was obliged to remove his goods? - I believe his goods were removed.</p>
               <p>Were any part of his premises burnt? - I believe there was a loft burnt, I do not know he lost any thing.</p>
               <p>In the first place, Sir, are you the prosecutor of this indictment? - I am.</p>
               <p>You carry on this prosecution? - I do.</p>

             any premises there? - Upon my life I cannot tell that, I was quite a stranger there; I understand since that Mr. Cole is a partner of Mr. Morris's, I do not know Mr. Cole, nor I do not know Mr. Morris.</p>
               <p>Does Cole's house adjoin to the prison of Ludgate? - Morris's house is joining; the premises where the fire broke out is directly opposite Morris's.</p>

               <p>Did you attend at the premises at the time of the fire? - I did, indeed.</p>
               <p>Were any of your goods carried into the prison of Ludgate? - A great many.</p>
               <p>I believe you stood at the gate to mark them with the letter D? - Some I did, I could not mark them all in the confusion.</p>
               <p>It is probable a number of them might not be marked? - Upon my oath I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you marked those two stoves? - I am sure I could not; the large one that was in the fire we found on the dunghill, that I am sure I could not.</p>
               <p>Do recollect marking the others? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Do you think you did? - In the confusion it is impossible to swear.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Dias, you have told me that information had been given you before you went to Mr. Morris's? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Who gave you that information? - I believe I had it from Mr. Teag, and from the apprentice of Mr. Jarman, his name is

            , and from Mrs. Jarman.</p>
               <p>Now, what had Mr. Teag told you before you got your search warrant? - Why, that my property was there, it is impossible for me to say what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250116"/>Cannot you say what Mr. Teag said about your property? - That there was a Bath stove of mine there.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you how it came there? - No, upon my oath, he did not.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you about it? - He said that my stove was there, and to the best of my recollection nothing else.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that he said nothing else? - I do swear it.</p>
               <p>Then Teag did not tell you that the prisoner at the bar had borrowed a stove of him, which they both supposed was Mr. Cole's? - Upon my oath he did not at that time.</p>
               <p>When did he say so to you? - He never said so to me.</p>
               <p>Was this stove concealed in the prisoner's apartments? - No, it was in the chimney-place, and had a fire in it.</p>
               <p>Any body that went into the room might see it? - They might certainly, it could not be covered over.</p>
               <p>Now, had you any acquaintance with the prisoner at all? - No, Sir, none.</p>
               <p>It did not occur to you to go to him when you went with the search warrant? - Upon my oath I went for the purpose of getting them before I went with the search warrant.</p>
               <p>After Teag told you the things were there, did you ever go to ask this man if he had got them, before you got the search warrant? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to know how long the prisoner had lived in that neighbourhood. - I understood a great many years.</p>
               <p>A great many more years than you have lived any where? - I do not know, I live in a great deal of credit, and I hope I shall continue to do so.</p>
               <p>What family has he? - Upon my oath I do not know, he keeps a woman as I understand.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I am told so.</p>
               <p>Who told you, upon your oath, that that man keeps a woman that he is not married to? now name me any one man or woman that ever said so; because I have the Court full of this man's neighbours, and I will not suffer his credit to be whispered away by such a fellow as you; I will have an answer? - That is rather a delicate point, I understood so, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who ever told you so, man, woman, or child? now dare to name to me any more falsehoods, because I know this is an infamous falsehood? - It is a delicate point.</p>
               <p>Court. You see your delicacy is rather late? - Please to excuse me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now look to these Gentlemen, and tell me, name me a child of six years old that cannot come and convict you of perjury, and I will be satisfied; look at the Jury, if you can? - I do look at them; why, then, Mrs. Jarman hinted to me.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Jarman say to you?</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I may ask what she said.</p>
               <p>Court. I think not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who was present when she said so? - I do not know that any body was, she and I had a deal of conversation; I cannot tell when it was, she said this woman was not his wife, she hinted it so; she hinted the woman was not his wife.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you cannot carry it further than this; you may call Mrs. Jarman to deny it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now tell me of any one expression she ever used; tell me what she said? - She alluded that she was not his wife, I say she hinted it, she hinted that she was not his wife; I can say no more.</p>
               <p>Can't you tell me what she said, what expression she used? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>I believe the defendant was admitted to bail by the magistrate? - He certainly was.</p>
               <p>And has surrendered himself here on your charge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said, you found this other stove under a dunghill? - Yes, I did, concealed in the dung.</p>
               <p>Who was present when it was found? - Why, there were two or three.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250117"/>Upon your oath, did not these people that were present tell you it had lain for several days, sometimes covered, and sometime uncovered? - Upon my oath I never heard any thing of that sort.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I am an apprentice to Mr. Jarman, a pipemaker, near to Mr. Morris's; I live the corner of his court.</p>
               <p>What do you know about these stoves? - I was at the fire assisting Mr. Morris; I assisted him in pulling down the grates.</p>
               <p>Had he any stoves? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I admit it is not the prisoner's own; the fire overtook them, and they were not removed out of the room. - There are but two rooms, they are in a stable-yard, they are supported by beams, they are up one pair of stairs; the two grates of Mr. Morris's were left in the room; they were grates with bright fronts, not Bath stoves; I saw Mr. Morris assist in taking one stove out from the second yard in Ludgate, I mean a Bath stove; we were looking for Mr. Morris's partner's back of his stove, it was after the fire, Mr. Morris was removing his things from gaol after the fire; I saw the other Bath stove covered with dung the Sunday morning afterwards, it was covered over with burnt mats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The stove was laying on the dunghill, and these burnt mats were a part of the rubbish of the fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Morris meddling with that which was in the dung? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light when he moved the other? - Yes, they were all in confusion, we were looking for a Bath stove.</p>
               <p>He did not do this secretly like a fellow stealing a stove? - No, it was done in publick.</p>
               <p>How many persons were there present? - I cannot say, there were a score.</p>
               <p>How long had you known this impudent thief, this Mr. Morris? - Ever since I have been in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Had he been used to be such an impudent thief as this? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>He lived in a wooden building in the yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The fire began at the broker's? - Yes, the prisoner's hay-loft was on fire.</p>
               <p>What became of his wife and children? - They were taken into Ludgate.</p>
               <p>How many children has he? - Three.</p>
               <p>The poor woman had not long lain in? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morris had a dungheap, and Mr. Cole had a dungheap? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You would not have put a pewter spoon there that you had stole, would you? - Not I.</p>
               <p>What character does Mr. Morris bear in his neighbourhood? - I never heard any particular character, he never affronted me.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a yard is it? - An open yard, the dunghill was in Cole's yard, which had gates in it.</p>

I bought them for two gentlemen at Edgeware; they were marked I.

               <p>Against your inclination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you resist? - Yes, and he dragged me into the tap-room; he pulled me into the house, and I ran through into a passage which led into the bar; I got from him into the bar; there was a gentlewoman that seemed not to be well, and I told her, and she sent the maid to see if there was anybody at the door; I ran out of this entry, and two young men followed me, one of which was the prisoner, and the young man that pulled me into the house, that followed me out again, shoved me down, and stopped my mouth; the prisoner ran away with my bundle out of my basket; I had the basket on my arm with more things in it; when I went into the publick-house I took my basket off my head, they only took the bundle which had the crewets; that was the prisoner; I directly called out stop thief, and I ran immediately into the sheep's head shop for assistance; and a little girl, that was standing by, said his name was

               <p>Be cautions, this is a capital offence, you ought to be certain, look at the prisoner, and see if you can say with certainty he is the man? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>How came Messrs. Blakeway and Hodsdon to have any thing to do with them? - They were bought of them, and had not been delivered; the other man was never taken.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was the person that hauled you in? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I had a long blue coat on, and a ragged pair of trowsers? - I never said so; I always said you had a blue jacket on.</p>

            ; I know the boy that gave evidence just now; he has been my errand-boy a month or five weeks; he is a servant in the house; I had a good character with him; he has behaved exceedingly well since he has been with me; he is a very honest boy as ever I had in my life, I have not the least fault to find with him: these crewets were put into the basket by my partner, I did not see him put them in, he is not here, I never saw them in his basket, I gave orders about his carrying them; I was at the finishing and cleaning of them, and when they were done the orders were given for Mr. Hodsdon to put them up, and send them to Mr. Makepeace, a silversmith, in Searle-street; I live at No. 71, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Was Long-lane in the boy's way there? - The boy had a message to deliver at No. 1, Jewin-court, Jewin-street; I gave him the message in the fore part of the day, to a workman that does gold work for us: Long-lane was as near a way I look upon it as he could go; the boy came back the same evening with a lad out of Long-lane, that keeps a sheep's head shop; we scolded the lad, and thought it was carelessness.</p>
               <p>What did the lad say to you about it? - He said, that he was lugg'd into the Jack of Newbury by two men; one man had hold of his arm, and the mistress at the bar asked him, what he wanted there? and he said, that the man lugged him in, and he was afraid they were going to rob him; says she, I'll care of that, I'll see the door cleared, or to that effect; with that she or the maid saw him out, and said, you may go safe enough; he had not been out of the door ten minutes before he was met by two men, who shoved him down; one put mud into his mouth, and the other, he said, took a parcel out of his basket: that is all the boy said about it.</p>
               <p>Did he say he should know either of them again? - Yes; the next morning we had information that the patrols had taken two persons into custody; they were taken to the Castle, the corner of Cateaton-street; I went with the boy when he went to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250124"/>them; we desired him to go in himself the first time, and see if he should know any body; he went in, and pointed to this prisoner exactly; the patrol and me went in with him, and he shewed us the same person again.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I kept the Jack of Newberry when this transaction happened; I have very little to say about it, though I was in the taproom when it happened; I saw a man have the boy by the arm in the middle of the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know that man? - Yes I do, if I was to see him; I only knew him by sight, I asked the boy what brought him there with selling his pies, and making a bustle in the tap-room; the boy immediately said his nose bled; I believe this young woman that lived with me at that time, though I have discharged her, made him go into the bar; he went into the bar to Mrs. Jones, and she sent this young woman to see if the place was clear; she said it was clear, and the boy went out from the bar, and the next news that I heard was, that the boy was robbed.</p>
               <p>Where was you sitting after the boy went out from the bar? - I was in the tap-room, there is no passage but the tap-room and the bar; the one is a gin-shop, and the other the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Which stands nearest Long-lane? - They are two houses, they both stand equally near; there are two doors, one goes into the bar, and the other into the tap-room; there is a communication round the chimney place from one to the other.</p>
               <p>If you was in the tap-room, you could not see what passed in the bar? - I could not; when the little boy went out of the bar, I was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Who followed him out of the bar you do not know? - Nobody could follow him out of the bar, we never admit any body thro' the bar.</p>
               <p>Why, is not there a door opens from the bar into the street? - There is, but there is no communication between.</p>
               <p>Was that door locked up? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how is it possible for you to say that persons might not have gone out at that door? - They could not, because there is no one admitted, except it is a person that is known well.</p>
               <p>Was not the boy let out at the bar door? - Yes; but as soon as the boy went out at the bar-door, at least as soon as he went out of the bar, there was a bustle and disturbance by the tap-room door, and I took them and put them all out and shut the door, and said I would not have such disturbances in my house.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear positively that nobody followed the boy out at the bar-door? - Yes, I could venture to swear that, except it was some of my own family.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear, that all the people in the confusion, that went out of the house, went out at the tap-room door? They none of them went out at the bar-door.</p>
               <p>You was in the tap-room? - I was in the tap-room, when the boy was in the bar.</p>
               <p>After the boy went from the bar, did you see the prisoner in the tap-room? - I cannot say that the prisoner was in the taproom at the time the boy was in the taproom; for the prisoner went out at the tap-room door.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner in the tap-room after the boy went out of the bar? - I cannot say with propriety; the boy went out of the bar-door; if you come in at the tap-room door, you go round to come out at the bar-door; the boy went into the bar, and he was let out at the bar door into the street; and the prisoner and all the rest of them went out at the street-door; I saw the prisoner go out at the street-door, not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250126"/>many minutes after; it might be some few minutes.</p>
               <p>You being in the tap-room, could you see the people that went out of the bar-door? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that all the fourteen people went out at the tap-room door? - I could take a safe oath that there is nobody admitted to go through the bar-door.</p>
               <p>The boy undoubtedly went out at the bar-door? - I cannot take my oath with propriety, because I was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner go out of the tap-room door? - At the tap-room door he did go out, I am sure of it, there were a great many of them at the door.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty that you saw the prisoner go out of the tap-room door? - At the tap-room door I am positive.</p>
               <p>How soon was it after the boy was turned out at the bar door that the prisoner went out of the tap-room door? - I cannot rightly say, I shut the door after them and bolted it, and went into the bar, and the boy was gone; my mistress was very poorly, and says she, you had better let the boy out at the bar, and you had better open the other door, I unbolted it; the tap-room door is the door they go in at to drink porter, the other is for spirituous liquors; I bolted the tap-room door after the mob was got from the door, and the boy was gone.</p>
               <p>Did you bolt those people in or out? - I did not turn them out; when the boy was in the bar, as near as I can guess, there was a mob arose before the door, and my customers all pushed out; there were ten or a dozen in the house at the time the prisoner was; the prisoner was sitting, it might be five or ten minutes after the boy was turned out at the bar-door, before the prisoner and the others were turned out at the tap-room door.</p>
               <p>Court to the Boy. I understand that you was pulled into this public-house by a person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You then said that you resisted, and ran through the passage which led to the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which door was you pulled in at? - At the tap-room door.</p>
               <p>When you went out, which door did you go out at? - At the bar door.</p>
               <p>Did the men that followed you, follow you out the bar-door or at the tap-room door? - They did not follow me till I had got into the street, I did not see them coming after me.</p>
               <p>How soon after you was in the street did they follow you? - Directly, I was not in the street above two minutes.</p>
               <p>How far might you be then from this public-house? - I do not know, it was a good step from this public-house, about nine or ten houses off.</p>
               <p>When you were in the public-house was any thing the matter with your face? - No, I called out that my nose bled to get from them.</p>
               <p>Did your nose bleed? - Yes, I believe it did.</p>
               <p>How came it to bleed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did the lad who pulled you into the house hurt your face? - No, not then; I was frightened, I did not know what to do, I believe my nose did bleed a little; I do not know how it came to bleed.</p>
               <p>Which door did you go out at? - At the bar-door.</p>
               <p>Who shewed you out at the bar-door? The maid servant, the mistress told her to see if the place was clear.</p>

               <p>JOHN HILLS, Esq sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Lower John-street, about seventy yards from where the robbery was committed; on the 29th of November, a little before twelve at night, going through  , opposite the center lamp, on the west side of the square, I was looking towards the rails, and saw two men run from the rails towards me, and they ran so as to divide, and to get both before and behind me; I walked two or three paces, I turned my back towards the extremity of the rails, from the entrance of Mr. Willock the auctioneer, and his lamp which affords the most brilliant light in the square, was about four feet above me on the right hand; a sailor, not the prisoner at the bar, ran with great violence towards me, and pushed the muzzle of a pistol towards my breast, that if I had not been against the rails I should have reeled; he said, your money or your life; I forgot to mention, that when they set off running, the one took a north, and the other an east direction; he raised the pistol to my eye, and the unfortunate man at the bar came up with a pistol, and put it to my right temple, and desired me to make haste; I was very cool and collected, and had drank no more than one half pint of wine in the course of the day; I took out five shillings, which was all the money that I had at the time, and three keys, two of which I have now in my possession, I addressed them thus:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I beg you will not use me ill, this is all the money I have, (presenting the 5 s. and the keys at the time) I am very sorry it is no more; here are three keys that can be of no service to you, and you will oblige me by returning them." The prisoner did return me two keys which I have now in my hand, the other he retained in his fright; for I believe he was much more frightened than myself, and trembled.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was the man that gave you back the keys? - Yes; they told me to walk on, and if I attempted to look back they would fire at me; one of them told me, but which I cannot say, to walk on; I did walk on to the fourth extremity of the square before I looked back, I saw nothing of the men, but heard them running on the other side of the square; I got to my own house about twenty yards from the square, and got a neighbour to go with me in pursuit of the prisoners; I did not find them, but on my return I went to the watch-house, and one of the witnesses, together with the beadle, went round with me about to all the night houses in St. James's parish, but we did not find them that night; nor till the morning of their apprehension, which was the 2d of February last.</p>
               <p>You saw no more of them from the 29th of November till the 2d of February? - No, I was out later than usual, I went home to my house, and I could not get admission; I knocked and could not make them hear; it occurred to me that I would go and look after the prisoner; I went to a night-house called the Red-lion, in Piccadilly; there might be thirty persons in the room, I got into a box, and seated myself as well as I could; after being there about half an hour, I observed the prisoner among the others.</p>
               <p>Court. What number of people? - There might be about thirty; he was quarrelling with a very stout man whom he was going to fight; some of his acquaintance desired him sit down, which he complied with; he sat facing me, and I looked at him, I suppose, for half an hour.</p>
               <p>Quarrelling had drawn your attention to him first? - Yes; but I knew him immediately when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>He sat down facing you? Yes, in an opposite box, I looked at him for a considerable time; I put a question to myself thus:</p>
               <p>"John Hills, is that the man that robbed you?" the more I looked at him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250128"/>the more I was convinced he was the person; I went from the house to St. James's watch-house, and having got the beadle and the beadle's assistant, I took him myself.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor nobody in your presence? - No, he said before Justice Read that he was not the man, for at that time he was in Newgate for robbing a post-boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you not two men taken up for this robbery before? - The night I was robbed I spoke to a watchman and the beadle's assistant, and described the man that robbed me, and they took up two persons who answered that description; that was an hour and a half after, the same morning they were brought to the watch-house and they were discharged.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes, for there is a person I know, who resembles him so much, that I have said to fifty persons, that I should have supposed, if the prisoner had been lame, that it had been him; he is a waiter at the ship in Palace-yard; he is lame and could not run, so that it could not be him.</p>
               <p>There was a resemblance that struck you very forcibly between this man and the man that you took? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So much that you could not help to have suspected that man if he could run? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you have no doubt but this is the man that robbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>This transaction did not take up long time? - Not above a minute and a half or two minutes.</p>
               <p>Did this man look at you at all? - I had a side view of him.</p>
               <p>You are satisfied that he is the man? - Yes, he is dressed now as he was at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These two men were in custody some time, while Mr. Hills was in Wales? - There was a man in custody while I was in Wales, but I never saw him, he was discharged before I came to town.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged with me at the time of the robbery, I knew him from a boy; he was a parish boy, and apprenticed in St. James's parish; his wife was a cook in a nobleman's family; the prisoner has been; a widower about two years, and is now; and is a very honest man for aught I know I am obliged to let my lodgings to women, not to men, I assure you, my lord; but I offered him a bed, which he was ready to accept of, and to give me a shilling a week. On Saturday the 29th of November, when the robbery was committed, I am positive he was at home, he was not well, he had been ill a month before, I had company that day.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner confined to his bed? - He was occasionally now and then; he was up three or four hours in the day.</p>
               <p>He never walked out at that time? - I never saw him go out.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember this day of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250129"/>the month? - I consider a false oath as a very bad thing: whether Mr. Hills does or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>You think that was the day of the month? - The 22d was his birth-day, and he invited some friends, and begged the use of my apartment; he told me it was his birth-day two or three days before.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Norfolk-street in the Borough.</p>
               <p>How came you here as a witness? - He asked me to come, because he told me this, that he heard Mr. Hills would stick as close to him as he could; I took some victuals to Newgate two or three days, says he, Mrs. Toosey, I find he is very rigid.</p>
               <p>He told you the day of the month, did he? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he ask you, if you did not remember where he was at the time of the robbery? - No, he told me, I knew he was innocent.</p>
               <p>In what way did he tell you now, he was innocent, did he not tell you it was on the 29th of November? - I read in the paper by accident.</p>
               <p>In what paper? - The Daily Advertiser.</p>
               <p>When did you read that? - I believe it might about three weeks ago, or near a month.</p>
               <p>What was in the paper? - That the man was taken up for robbing of Mr. Hills of five shillings and a key.</p>
               <p>Do you remember what it said? - I cannot say whether his name was mentioned or not.</p>
               <p>How can you tell you got your information by the newspapers, when you cannot tell what was in the papers? - That

               <p>You need have a better memory, for you told me just now that you learnt the night from the newspaper? - By all account the robbery was committed three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>But how came you then to know the robbery was the 29th of November? - I was informed it was.</p>
               <p>I want to know who informed you? - Butcher told me it was committed on the 29th of November, when it was committed he was at home.</p>
               <p>He informed you that? - Yes.</p>

            , the sister of Lord Carlisle: it happened the aunt of her ladyship, in her life time, knew something of the mother of the defendant now at the bar; I dare say her attention to that woman arose from the poverty of her circumstances, and therefore it was that her ladyship condescended to have dealings of an insignificant kind with her; but her ladyship being a person in the most eligible pecuniary circumstances, and being exact in all her dealings, could never let any debt accrue to such a woman as the mother of the defendant; there might be, perhaps, a pound, or two, or three, or even five pounds owing to her, but there could not be more. Gentlemen, Lady Mary died 1787; soon after her death it entered the mind of the mother of the defendant and herself conjoined with her mother, to bring a charge on Lady Juliana, the present prosecutrix, as the executrix of Lady Mary: when this account was first made known to her, of course she enquired into the circumstances, as the improbability of any debt being due, struck her mind, and all those who knew her; they conceived therefore, that if it was of ever so trifling a kind, it must be an imposition; but when I tell you the debt was one hundred and ninety pounds; and when you know the situation of the parties, you will be ready to conceive there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250133"/>was too much ground for such a supposition: Gentlemen, Lady Juliana communicated this demand to her friends, and as they were assured it was an imposition, of course there was a denial of payment; every possible enquiry was made into the affair of all the confidential servants of Lady Mary, many of whom knew the prisoner's mother, and her situation in life, together with every transaction; and upon the result, her ladyship was advised to resist this demand. In consequence of that it was, that they first began with a suit at law against Lady Juliana, as the executrix of her aunt; to this action there was a plea put in, and it was regularly defended, and it was as regularly tried; and the young woman now at the bar was brought forward on that occasion, to sustain the account given in by her mother, and I believe she was the only witness at that trial. What particularly passed at that trial I shall not trouble you with at present, but it is sufficient to say that, with very little hesitation, indeed, the Jury found a verdict for the defendant Lady Juliana; and the effect was that there was an end of that claim upon this lady, as executrix of her aunt. Gentlemen you would naturally conceive Lady Juliana thought she had now got rid of these people; but she was bitterly disappointed, for they came to her house, and made disturbances there of the most alarming kind; and she found there was something yet to be done, before she could totally be freed from this inconvenience. Then it was, that as in consequence of the verdict, a certain sum of money for costs might be recovered; it was suggested to her, who knew herself very little of this matter, I dare say, that if the mother was taken up for those costs, they would feel it in such a way, as to cause them to desist in future from such an interruption as I have mentioned, and on this account alone such a measure was adopted by the advice of her attorney, and it was hoped there would be an end of this business. The mother was confined, her situation was that of object povery, she not being able to discharge those costs. Gentlemen, then arose that evil of which we complain; the human mind, as is but too common, growing more and more wicked by degrees, they thought of that, which astonishes me when I think of it, and which I dare swear will astonish you when you hear it; for these people having had the audacity to put their first iniquity into force, I am surprised that according to any common degree of understanding which they possessed, they should have hit on this mode of proceeding: the idea of pursuing Lady Juliana, as executrix, was dropped; and the demand was then set up as a charge of debt to the mother from Lady Juliana herself: this could not have been verified without some application to some gentleman of the law, and I am happy that I am provided here with that testimony from those gentlemen themselves, because, it appears to me, that they should be heard, and heard in order to give that apology which their conduct seems to require; for upon an application from a woman like this, charging such a lady as that with such a debt, which was almost of the same amount as the former, and the issuing a legal process certainly demands some apology; and you will hear that she went to an attorney, and told her tale, that the attorney believed her; and then came about that evil which almost makes one shudder when one thinks of it: the attorney was persuaded to issue a writ, and bailiff's officers were employed, and Lady Juliana was arrested, and arrested under circumstances, that upon my honor I can hardly keep my temper while I am describing it, she living at her brother-in-law's Mr. Delme, in Grosvenor-square, coming out of her house, and going into her chair, she was attacked by two of those ruffians, who told her ladyship, forsooth, that they had a writ against her, and that she must go to a spunging-house; such was the state of Lady Juliana! and what was the state of her feelings you must<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250134"/>judge, in forming an idea of a young lady of fashion in the hands of these ruffians, about to tear her away to a spunging-house; she desired to go to her brother's, which she did; but when there she was subject to the insults of those fellows; her brother infinitely composed thought of going to Mr. Gregg, her ladyship's attorney, away he went to Mr. Gregg: Mr. Gregg came and found Lady Juliana in a spunging-house; what her situation was I will not call your attention to any more, I am sure it must have made an impression upon you similar to what it has made upon me; after what I have told told you there can no longer remain a doubt on your minds, that this second attempt to gain property from Lady Juliana, was in consequence of the failure of the first; no pretence had ever before taken place of Lady Juliana being indebted a farthing to this woman, not a syllable; every person in the world from whom inquiry was made, put an end to the first demand; but the second is an instance of such an extraordinary iniquity, which if it had not happened I should hardly have thought it possible. This makes the foundation of the present charge, that of the young woman going before the proper officer, in order to make an affidavit of this debt; the circumstances therefore it will be proper to trouble you with, will be those a little antecedent to this time; in order that you may collect a little what the probability of this case was; with respect to the case, I trust, when you have not heard half, there will be very little doubt: - with respect to the prosecutions for perjury, in common cases of perjury, it happens that the perjury is to be proved by more than one person, the law saying, which pays no respect to ranks, God be praised! that when one person is on oath, and another upon oath, without some reason assigned, there shall be no preponderation; therefore Lady Juliana stands in that situation which the law has placed her in, there is oath against oath with respect to the action that was brought in consequence of the arrest, they have never had the audacity to proceed; that action is at rest, and it is at rest, in that way that furnishes me with a proper testimony to prosecute: Mr. Gregg, her ladyship's attorney, did every thing that became him by his vigilance and activity, and he has obtained a non-pros. The suit is at at end; if it had not, Lady Juliana, could not have prosecuted for this offence; but as it is, there is an end of all the charge set up by this young woman against her ladyship, although it is true, that the law has placed them in that situation, that oath is to have its avail against oath, yet there is another deposit which the law has placed in your bosom; you have the account which is given by the young woman as to the debt; you will now hear her ladyship upon oath; you will determine what degree of credit her ladyship's oath will deserve from you, from the necessary circumstances of her testimony; with respect to the single circumstance alone of debt, or no debt, there is oath against oath; the circumstances in the present case will be many, but they will be such as I trust will, in your minds, bring about even a more pleasant effect than if the testimony was to come from witnesses; because from the circumstances attending the nature of things, we are enabled to conclude of the certainty of truth being in our possession more frequently than from witnesses themselves, because as we cannot dive into the hearts of witnesses, we do not always know whether they are speaking truth or not; and, therefore, circumstances themselves form a better basis and reliance for our conviction. The first thing necessary will be to prove that the woman went before this officer, and made this affidavit; that will not admit of a moment's doubt: after that you will hear her ladyship's testimony, and it would be impertinent in me to anticipate what that will be; then also, there are several other circumstances, particularly that at which I rejoice inasmuch as it affords an occasion for a man, who was, I verily believe, imposed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250135"/>on by that young woman, to tell you what passed, why he permitted such a thing as a writ to escape from him. At present you shall hear the witnesses, I will not at all attempt to impress your minds with any improper bias; as this is a misdemeanor I shall be intitled as an advocate for Lady Juliana to a reply; I have always thought that particularly in a cause for perjury, the advocate for the prosecution ought to be extremely delicate in the management of that which is put into his hands; therefore, do promise my learned friend, the prisoner's advocate, that I shall in the sequel of this business which is intrusted to me, take no unfair advantage I hope of that liberty. Gentlemen, you are possessed of the outline of this business, we shall now proceed to call the witnesses, and I trust the event will be, that with very little hesitation you will be disposed to find a verdict for her ladyship.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is to prove, that she herself, at the time of the arrest pointed out Lady Juliana.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. It is certainly admissible evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And it may in this light be also material; for it may be material each way to shew the intention and knowledge of this party who swore to the debt; it is certainly admissible evidence; it certainly will inform the Jury that nothing in the circumstance of that arrest is to make any effect on their verdict, nothing improper in the conduct of the officer, nor even in the defendant herself, only just as it tends to shew the treatment of her ladyship. In what manner was your ladyship arrested? - I was coming out of Mr. Delme's house in Grosvenor-square, my chair carried me to Berkley-square; the officers there caused my chairmen to set me down, and there they told me they had a warrant against me; that was on the 16th of May in the evening, near nine o'clock; I came home to Grosvenor-square, and the bailiffs followed me up stairs, and after waiting some time, insisted on my going to the spunging-house; Mr. Delme was at home at the time; he went to Mr. Gregg's, and left me with the officers.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Lady J. M. Howard.</p>
               <p>How long did your ladyship continue there with them, before they insisted on taking you to the spunging-house? - I believe about half an hour.</p>
               <p>They took you to a spunging-house, Madam? - They did; Mr. Gregg and Mr. Delme came to the spunging-house, and of course I was discharged.</p>
               <p>How long might your ladyship be in custody? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>I take the liberty, for form's sake, my lady, to ask you once more, whether you ever had, in the course of your life, any dealings with the prisoner or her mother, from which any possible debt could arise? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did it happen to you, Madam, to see this woman, the defendant, at the time you was arrested? - She was at the door with the bailiffs.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted your ladyship had no conversation with her? - None at all.</p>
               <p>I do not ask of your ladyship particulars, which would be extremely disagreeable, but you were treated roughly enough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There was a debt claimed then of your ladyship, as executrix of your aunt? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>One hundred and ninety-nine pounds I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That sum has never been paid yet? - No.</p>
               <p>There had been some dealings, my lady, then, between the mother of this woman and Lady Mary? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>That business had never been settled Madam? - They never received any money from me.</p>

            , the mother, was in prison at your ladyship's suit for the costs? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Any of these instances, which my learned friend wishes, we will admit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There were some memorandums in a book of memorandums, a short time before her death, of sums paid, but not of sums due; there were a good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250139"/>many articles? - Yes, I do not know what they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It has been asked my lady whether there were any account of Lady Mary's in which she made herself debtor to

            ? - There was an account of different sums paid her.</p>
               <p>Had your ladyship the smallest occasion to believe that there was a shilling due to that woman at the time of the death of Lady Mary? - Not the least, and on my own account, not a shilling.</p>
               <p>I believe, Lady Juliana, it was understood that Lady Mary was very exact in the accounts of her money? - Yes, there was not ten pounds in the whole left that I know of.</p>

               <p>I am an attorney, I was agent for Mr. Gregg at the time of Lady Howard's death, I recollect the action that was brought in the Common Pleas, against Lady Juliana, as executrix of her ladyship's aunt.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the time of the trial of that action? - Yes, I was.</p>

            , beginning April 1784, and going down to December, 1786; she was examined very fully in that case.</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether any other paper was exhibited on the part of the plaintiff? - Yes, there were two other papers exhibited to prove something out of a book, which I believe now the Counsel has before him.</p>
               <p>Court. What any of the witnesses said in that case, in the presence of the witness, is evidence.</p>
               <p>Lavine. The witnesses were examined apart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who was called first? - She was examined herself, and she endeavoured to sustain the demand of the mother against the present prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Did she at that time say any one syllable of any demand; that the mother had any demand from Lady

             to her mother.</p>
               <p>That cause ended in a verdict for the plaintiff? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember this being said by witnesses in the presence of the present defendant, and proved to her satisfaction in her presence, that no debt whatever was due from Lady Mary?</p>
               <p>Court. The verdict tells that.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this I believe the plaintiff in that action was committed for the costs? - Why Sir, in consequence of their very much molesting us and Lady Juliana, we recommended it as the only means of quieting them, as they were almost always together; and some time in the middle of December we issued a writ against her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250140"/>Lady Juliana at first did not think it necessary to take this miserable old woman for the costs, but she did it as a means to get rid of the nuisance? - We recommended it to her, I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner after the arrest? - I know nothing of the arrest; she came to the office frequently, and all times she has claimed a debt due to her from Lady Juliana as executrix; and after this arrest another action was brought in the name of the mother against Lady Juliana as executrix; I believe that gentleman, Mr. Redhead, was the attorney in that action for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I understand from you, that this poor woman being troublesome, she was sent to gaol for the costs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And this woman being troublesome, she was indicted for the perjury? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>That is the history of the business, I believe? - Compassion might have induced Lady Juliana if she had not been troublesome.</p>
               <p>You never understood she had any other demand? - She always pretended that the judgment Lady Howard had recovered against her was for want of assets; therefore she must continue that demand against her executrix.</p>
               <p>Do you look upon her as a mad-woman? - I do not know; her conduct was certainly curious to be sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She has often insisted on her former demand, but she thought her defeat arose from want of assets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>My learned friend says, that because that woman was troublesome she was committed; it was in the power of Lady Juliana to have committed her for the costs as soon as those costs were taxed? - Yes, clearly.</p>
               <p>Out of compassion to a miserable old wretch she refrained? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But at last, because they were so troublesome a writ was issued? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And this prisoner was indicted because she had perjured herself and arrested Lady Juliana in consequence? - We told Lady Juliana, that our idea was, that she ought in justice to be arrested, but we could not do it till the action was non-prossed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose you know nothing of this, but what was told you in your character of attorney to this woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Does your Lordship think that whatever is said to an attorney under such a character, that he shall be at liberty to disclose it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, there is no man in the profession, I trust, who would be more ready to anticipate an objection of this sort, in any case where it was fair and sit to take place, than I am; and I have anticipated the question, and I think I am perfectly equal to the task of obviating all reasonable doubts in your Lordship's mind. I agree, that any thing that is a fair communication in consequence of the situation of attorney and client is not afterwards to be divulged, with the exception, however, where the interest of the publick and criminal justice is concerned; because all that I ask of Mr. Roberts, and all that I wish to ask of another Gentleman, are facts, not secrets, committed to the confidence of an attorney; and would it be endured, that a person about to commit a crime should shelter himself by going to those who are, in many circumstances within the seal of confidence and secrecy; and that, therefore, those who in other relations do stand with their mouths closed, should not be witnesses for the Publick, and for the administration of the justice of the country? suppose a man intends to commit a forgery, or high treason; and I choose the last case for my argument; suppose he should go to some Gentlemen at the Bar, to whom the secresy applies equally as strong, and should state to him, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250141"/>had it in his contemplation to do some flagrant act of high treason, and that he desired to know how he might do it with safety; if it became a question afterwards on an indictment for treason, whether that man had done such a fact, should it be permitted, that any technical rule of the confidence between an attorney and client should sacrifice the whole interest of the community. My Lord, I ask no secrets of Mr. Roberts; but I ask him, Did not she ask of you to arrest a Mrs.

            ? and I ask, what secret there is in that? and I say, that this woman communicates in artful and disingenuous terms her case to Mr. Roberts; and I desire to know what fact she desired to be done; whether she desired the arrest to be made; whether she desired his clerk to go with her to swear the affidavit; and whether she pointed out Lady Juliana to the bailiffs. Is not it common to see a man, of the character of my friend Mr. Gregg, called upon to prove the hand-writing of his client; for in many other cases, what other way could a man possibly have in proving a hand-writing? If, therefore, I am asking facts of Mr. Roberts, not within that seal of confidence, I am intitled to have them answered.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you prepared with any authority, that any line of distinction has been drawn, and that it has been dispensed with in any case, except the one you mean, high-treason.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Undoubtedly I am not; and if I have succeeded, I do not want it; I seriously complain that my learned friend has not condescended to state to me the grounds of his objections; I agree there is nothing short of high-treason, that admits an attorney to disclose the secrets of his client; but I say I am not asking those secrets.</p>
               <p>Court. Though Mr. Silvester has not stated the grounds of his objection, I will state shortly the reasons on which I conceive the objection is a good one, and then what I conceive to be the line; for it by no means follows, that because Mr. Roberts happened to be the attorney of the party, that there is no question which you may be permitted to put; I perceive that the privilege in question is not the privilege of the attorney, but of the client; and that the attorney, if inclined, has not a right, nor ought to be permitted by a Court of Justice, to make that attempt; for it is for the sake of leaving the course of law, both civil and criminal, open to all the King's subjects, that they are permitted to consult and advise with those who prosess the business of the law, with freedom and with confidence, and that they may collect their real opinion, and be properly as well as honestly informed, that they shall be at liberty to make a full disclosure without the hazard of any privilege in their civil rights, or subjecting themselves to criminal prosecution: the privilege can never extend to a suppression of that evidence which would have existed without it; because it does not shut the mouth of the attorney as to any facts which came to his knowledge, prior to that connection, or exclusive of that connection; so that it never can have the effect of obstructing publick justice; because it is the evidence, which arises from such communication alone, that is to suppressed; then I am not aware of any case, except that of high-treason, which authorises, I will not say impels, an attorney to disclose in a Court of Justice, the communications made to him by his client in the course of any professional employ, or any professional consultation, to the prejudice of the life, fortune, or liberty of that client; the law forbids all mankind to be the repository of the secret of treason, and the fact of reception, and concealing of the secret, is without reserve a crime in all who do it; I conceive in all other cases the law to be clear, that you are not at liberty to ask an attorney to any conversation that passed, in the course of his employ as an attorney, between him and his client, nor to any fact disclosed to him, in the way of instructions for his legal proceedings; you are certainly at liberty to call him to prove a handwriting,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250142"/>to prove the fact of an arrest, because these are things that make no part of his instructions, nor of the confidence, under which he is employed, but beyond that, you are certainly not permitted to examine him in that capacity; and, therefore, the objection being in some degree conceded to by yourself, and in my opinion in part, a good objection, I think the objection will depend on every question you ask.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Roberts. I believe I had got the length of asking you, whether you knew the prisoner at the bar? - I do.</p>
               <p>When did you first become acquainted with her? - Some time in the month of May, the same day that the affidavit was sworn, I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Did you prepare the affidavit yourself? - I drew it, and my clerk copied it; I did not attend the defendant to swear it; I did not issue the writ, I did not deliver it to the officer; my clerk took the whole of it from me to the officer.</p>
               <p>Now I will ask you a negative question, to which I think there can be no great objection: Did the defendant apprise you of the situation and rank of the person to be arrested? - She did not.</p>
               <p>She did not tell you where that person lived? - She did not mention where she lived, only the square, not at any person's house.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to believe, previous to the arrest, that the person who was to be the subject of that action, was of the rank that you afterwards found? - I had not.</p>

               <p>Is she the person that went with you to the Filacer's?</p>

               <p>Did you attend her to deliver the writ to the officer? - I do not know whether she went with me or no; I carried the writ to the officer, I believe she might, I do not recollect every person that goes with me.</p>
               <p>I will have an answer, that is no secret of your client's? - I believe she might go with me; I do not know for certain whether she did or not.</p>

               <p>Do not you know that she went with the officer to accomplish that arrest? - I do not, the action she told me going to the Filacer's was against a Mrs. Howard, who lived with a Mr. Delme.</p>

               <p>She brought a warrant to you, I take it for granted? - Yes.</p>

             go out of Court.</p>
               <p>State upon your oath what the prisoner told you was the condition of the person you was to arrest, and where she lived? - I have told you.</p>
               <p>I will make you tell me further, I repeat my question; who did the prisoner tell you, you was to arrest? where she lived? and what was her condition? - She shewed me the house, and we staid in the square two hours; I did not know the lady.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came to Armstrong's office, who did she tell you, you was to arrest? - I had not the pleasure of seeing her at first; she told me to go up with her into Portman-square, and there to arrest the lady; I do not recollect what she said.</p>
               <p>In what situation of life did she describe the person to live that you were to arrest? - She informed me she lived there with a gentleman; I cannot say what she said, there was very little passed between her and me.</p>
               <p>Court. You shall answer the question, do not shuffle and prevaricate? - I can tell no more than I heard.</p>
               <p>In what condition of life did the woman at the bar describe the lady to live that you were to arrest? - She said she believed it was a lady that was kept by some gentleman.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, Sir, that she said she believed she was kept by some gentleman? - I cannot say any more; I am not clear in just the expression that she made use of, she signified that she was a lady of easy virtue.</p>
               <p>When was you to find this lady of easy virtue, and under what circumstances? - We were to wait 'till such time as she came out of doors.</p>
               <p>What, from her gentleman? - Yes, I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Well, you went to the square? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you wait there? - About two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>And at last this lady of easy virtue came out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In her chair, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far did you attend her chair? - We attended it down as far as Berkeley-square.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner with you at the time you made your caption? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say when she pointed out your prey to you? - She said, that was the lady, and she desired me to arrest her.</p>
               <p>Where did you make your caption? - I spoke to the chairman, we were as polite as we could be.</p>
               <p>You did not overturn the chair, I suppose; you were as civil as your natures would admit of; then you took the lady back to her keeper's house? - We desired the chairmen to take her back to her house.</p>
               <p>How long did the lady continue in your custody? - About two hours, or an hour and a half; she came down to Mr. Armstrong's in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>What, it was the lady's choice to go to this spunging-house? - I believe the gentleman and she concluded to go.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that now? Did you not take her there? - To be sure I went in the chariot with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is the first time and the last you ever had such company.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, I wish to ask you, how you came to take the lady from Mr. Delme's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250144"/>to Mr. Armstrong's? - For the better convenience of settling the business, because we would not disturb the lady to keep her there so long.</p>
               <p>Do you fancy I can take that for a true answer, that you took the lady to the spunging-house for her convenience; how dare you give me such an answer? - I do not know it was so.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that? think before you do? - It was to shorten the business, while the servant went to Mr. Gregg's; we went to Carey-street.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that, or do you not? - I cannot say exactly the words I made use of at that time.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, why did you take her to the spunging-house? - I had not the pleasure of knowing who the lady was.</p>
               <p>Had not you before that time known who the lady was from her servants? - There was not a servant that I had any conference with.</p>
               <p>Were you in such a house without making any enquiry where you were, and who was your prisoner? - We went up stairs, and I never saw any other person, but the gentleman that was with her.</p>
               <p>Are you a Sheriff's officer now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what office? - In Carey-street.</p>

               <p>Did you hear the directions given for the arrest that was to be made? - She was there more than once, and made a great many words that we could not arrest the lady; she said, we did not pay attention to it as we ought to do, and on that day she came and went with us to the place, and we went and waited till my lady came out in her chair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Does your lordship think I am called upon in this state of the business, in a case proved singly, to say any thing on behalf of the defendant; I do not mean to throw any imputation on the prosecution, and I am very sorry likewise that this case has happened, but we must go by the rules of the law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There can be no objection in your pointing out to me what you conceive to be the circumstances from which it appears, independent of Lady Juliana's evidence, the credit of which I shall never leave to a Jury, that there was no debt due to this woman from Lady Juliana. My Lord, the fact to be made out to the Jury is, that the allegation of the defendant was untrue; I feel extremely reluctant to do that which the right of my learned friend, and the justice of the Court calls me to do; I am put into this situation to prove it by piecemeal, I am not justified in going to observations as by way of reply; I am called on now to sum up that evidence which has been given; if I am right in asserting that, all that is incumbent on me to prove, is, that no debt was due at the time of this affidavit from Lady

             to the mother; I have not the smallest doubt in stating on what grounds I ask, nay I demand, the verdict of the Jury; I have testimony out of her own mouth, I have her own acts, in addition to that testimony which you have said does not require any confirmation, I am content to take that case, as if the prosecutrix was the most obscure, the least known, and the least honourable of her sex.</p>
               <p>Court. We must take it so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am content so to take it; I have the positive oath of the prosecutrix; I have in addition to that a chain of circumstances under the hand and the oath of the defendant herself, by which I expect a verdict; I mention those circumstances but slightly; it is proved by Lady Juliana first, that no debt is due; next, that no transaction has passed between her and the defendant, or the defendant's mother; next, I have the defendant, on oath, I have her examination in the Court of Common Pleas, where she attended as a witness of her mother, in an action brought by that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250145"/>mother, not against the present prosecutrix, as a debt due from her, but proceeding on the idea, that is due as the executrix of Lady Mary; she is cross-examined, she proceeds to the full length of disclosing all she knew on that subject, she does not intimate an opinion, she does not intimate a suggestion that Lady Juliana owes a shilling; what have we more? we have her laying by during six months application at the office of the attorney for Lady Juliana in that action, pressing for something from Lady Juliana, never pretending that any thing was due but as executrix; and she has put in a miserable plea of want of assets: - It is proved by the testimony of Mr. Lavine, that from the time of that application down to the time of this arrest, this woman never made any demand on Lady Juliana in her own character; if I want additional testimony I have it from Mr. Roberts; I knew him elsewhere; I respect him as much as his character deserves; and I do not mean to say I respect him slightly; he has not had a single question put to him about the conduct of this woman, whether she did not, the first moment she came there, say Lady Juliana has defeated me as far as she is executrix of Lady Mary, but I have a debt of her own which no plea can defeat, I will arrest her, and hold her to bail; was not that the language of a woman that had a real demand? but was that her language? My Lord, if I were addressing myself now to the Jury, I should have no sort of difficulty on the result of the verdict; if I want addition to all this, not addition to the credit of Lady Juliana; but that addition which the law requires in a case of perjury to counterbalance the oath that is made by the defendant, which is contradicted only by the oath of Lady Juliana, I might receive additional confirmation even from that miserable witness the Sheriff's officer; for is there a man of the Jury that can doubt, first that there was no debt due from Lady Mary; and next, that there was no debt due from Lady Juliana, but I have no other burden upon me than proving there was nothing due at the time this affidavit was made; and I think I have done that very sufficiently, and need not even to mention the great uncertainty that there is of any man among us, even of high condition, being arrested going home to night, if persons are to be arrested upon such affidavits; though I know that in such a case an indictment for a conspiracy would prevail, and the parties be convicted; if my learned friend can make out a debt due from Lady Juliana, let him, let him disgrace her in the face of her country; and then the Jury will attend to it, and will pay no more respect to the oath of Lady Juliana, than to the oath of the prisoner; but if he cannot prove such a debt due, it seems to me, with great deferance to your Lordship, to hold out, as it mere, an incitment to perjury, unless the case is permitted to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Roberts. Do you remember any application being made to you on the part of Lady Juliana, for an account of the demand of your client? - I do not recollect any requisition to me for a demand; Mr. Lavine and me had some conversation about her, and I had at that time-given up the business.</p>
               <p>Was you ever furnished by the defendent with any particulars of the demand against Juliana? - I was furnished with the particulars of a demand as against her, but when I saw it, I did not conceive it to be a demand against Lady Juliana.</p>
               <p>Was it, in point of fact, a demand against her? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Lavine. State to me the steps that were taken to non pros. the action? - There was a non pros. signed for want of declaration.</p>
               <p>In consequence of any previous notice given? - We put in bail, I attended the very next morning upon Mr. Roberts, and told him what had happened.</p>
               <p>Court. My only doubt is whether I ought to leave this evidence to the Jury or not; in point of law I have no doubt at all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250146"/>of the general proposition stated by the Counsel for the prosecution, being a true one, which is, that perjury may be proved by circumstances as well as by positive testimony; and in my opinion the rule of law is not critically stated, when it states that it requires two or more witnesses to convict of perjury; if there is but one called, that the defendant cannot be convicted is certain; but that it requires two or more witnesses to the fact, I conceive to be different; I conceive that no person shall be convicted of perjury on the evidence of one witness only, of what description soever; the credit of the witness never comes into the contemplation of the law or the Court, when this point is under consideration, the addition of circumstances to that testimony, and if circumstances proved by other witnesses, may be evidence to be left to a Jury; my doubt is, whether we can pick out in this case circumstances proved by other witnesses, that seem sufficiently to go to the non-existence of the debt from Lady Juliana to the defendant, to be left to the Jury as an additional legal supply of the defect of evidence, not as the supply of the defect of the credit of the evidence, but as a defect of evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Was the bill that was delivered you by your client, after she employed you as attorney in the action, with a view of instructing you in this action? - With a view of giving me instructions for the declaration.</p>
               <p>Court. Then unless the prisoner's Counsel desires it, I cannot permit you to answer that question; the circumstances that appear to me, Mr. Garrow, are, first, that the action was not proceeded in; that alone I do not think would be sufficient to go to the Jury; because if it would, it would follow, that this would apply in all cases where an action was discontinued for any reason: here are circumstances to shew that there was no account of the demand ever given, though there was an opportunity of giving it; and there are circumstances enough to shew that the prisoner acted certainly (if that were the question) upon malicious motives; but the only doubt I have is, whether there are circumstances proved by other witnesses that go farther than that the action was not proceeded in; however in this case, if it pressed, I will leave it to the Jury, giving the prisoner the advantage of saving the point, whether it ought to have been, in point of law, left to the Jury or not; whether there are, exclusive of the evidence of Lady Juliana, circumstances of the non-existence of the debt sufficient to be left to the Jury?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am perfectly satisfied there are; I wish it to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, to favour me on the part of the defendant at your bar: Far be it from me to throw any imputation on so respectable a lady; far be it from me to justify the brutal conduct of the officer who arrested her: I do not stand here either to justify the one, or to accuse the other; but I stand here as Counsel for that woman, who is intitled to your verdict; I say intitled to it, because unless she is convicted by direct and legal evidence, though her situation is that of a poor, ignorant, frantic Jewess, and the prosecutrix a lady of large estate; yet the law extends to one as well as the other. Gentlemen, the crime imputed to her is the crime of perjury; that crime is stated to be that she swore a debt due to her from this lady: when oath comes to be weighed against oath, you cannot say which it is that has sworn false; when I say this, I do not mean any imputation on that lady; I mean it merely as an abstract proposition of law, that when it is oath against oath, the law will not permit that person to be convicted of the crime of perjury; but that oath, it is said, may be confirmed by a number of circumstances. We have had it confirmed in this Court, by circumstances corroborated the oath of the person, and proved that what the other swore was absolutely false; if the bill had been delivered with the dates to it, and the lady could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250147"/>have proved either that she was out of the country, or that the person who charged her was not in the country at the time, that would have been a strong circumstance to have proved the perjury. Gentlemen it is told you by the learned Counsel, that gentlemen may be arrested going from here: there are instances where men have been convicted of illegal arrests. The Counsel who conducted this prosecution, said it was the strongest instance of criminal audacity, and that he would not raise your indignation, though he endeavoured all in his power to raise that indignation at the treatment the lady had met with from the officers; but Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar, whatever her crimes or faults may be, is not to answer for the misconduct of others; what they have done they are answerable for; and faults of this kind should come clear before you, and women of the description of the prisoner are not to be oppressed. It is not the high rank of the prosecutrix, it is not the abilities of the Counsel that will make you swerve from what is right; because what is law for her to-day, is law for yourselves to-morrow. You will consider your own situations; if that woman could be convicted on this indictment for perjury, how could you arrest any of your customers for goods delivered by yourselves; perhaps you make the affidavit, and the moment your customer proves that, he is to indict you, and bring you to that bar. Gentlemen, the fact for you to try is, whether in truth and in fact any debt was due from Lady Juliana to to Lear Elias; it is for you to determine whether an oath taken even by the most respectable person in this country, is sufficient to convict any one of perjury, because if it is, it is the power of any man, let him be ever so bad, to be a witness against one of you; you may stand at that bar, because you cannot object to his competency, though you may to his credit; you may be first of all swindled out of your goods; then when you arrest the man, he may stand up here as a prosecutor against you; he has a right to be believed, if it is once laid down in this or any other Court, that the single testimony of any witness, if competent, you are to give credit to the question; how much credit, is another point, but the law makes no distinction.</p>


               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have taken the liberty of stopping my worthy friend, in consequence of the orders I have received from my client; Lady Juliana has attended to what has passed here to-day, and she has found it necessary to prosecute the present defendant, of whose conduct my learned friend has not even attempted a justification, and whilst I say, that there are no terms in the English language sufficient to express every honest man's detestation of the crime of perjury; and that my client, therefore, thought it necessary to prefer the present indictment, that society should not suffer from attempts to pick her pocket of a sum of money, to prevail against her, so as to become an example for others; but she instructs me to say, that she would be more favoured than any body, if a verdict should be obtained on evidence of her own, on which there could be the slightest doubt in the minds of lawyers, that it was not confirmed according to all possible technical rules; it is not in consequence of any judgment of my own, whatever respect I may have for the Court, I still hope I should be intitled to a verdict on the result of this inquiry; but in consequence of the desire of my client, I am to desire the Jury may find the defendant, Not Guilty; it is fit the prisoner should understand that she owes it to the clemency and goodness of Lady Juliana; she has no obligations to me; I should have found it my duty to have superceded that request, not only for the lady but for the public.</p>
               <p>Court. I think it right to explain the reasons upon which I have not resisted the very humane desire expressed by the prosecutrix; for under some circumstances I have thought it my duty not to give way as desired, but to put it to the Jury, to find a verdict according to the evidence, for by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250148"/>no means in general is it consistent with justice, that a defendant should be acquitted even though it is the desire of those who are most honourably prosecutors, because the public is infinitely more interested in this prosecution than the individual that brings it forward; nothing certainly can have been more honourable than the whole conduct of this prosecution, from the commencement of it, to the desire that now calls upon me to express my sentiments; therefore I wish the ground upon which I give way to that desire to be fully understood: if the matter stood in such a situation, that consistent with the general rules of law established for the protection of innocence, and which have no sort of relation to the rank, character, or situation of parties, how high or how low soever; if it were clearly consistent with these rules, that this case should go to the Jury upon the credit of Lady Juliana's evidence, I am pretty confident there could not be a moment's hesitation in any man's mind in Court, if that were the question; but the rule of law is precise, and fixed, that upon the single testimony of any witness whatever, not confirmed either by other direct and positive evidence, or by strong circumstantial evidence, a person shall be convicted of this particular offence, and the law makes no distinction, whether that witness shall be the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the lady who has now given testimony, two characters equally intitled to belief I am sure, or whether it shall be the meanest and most profligate character that comes with proper competency into a Court of Justice; in turning this in my mind I should have found some difficulty in picking out the circumstances that were to go to your consideration, to shew that the oath that was taken by the prisoner was false, and within our own knowledge false; both which are necessary; and even if there had been circumstances to shew that the oath was literally false; that is, that there was no debt due from Lady

             to the prisoner in her own right; still I am of opinion, that would not have been sufficient to find the prisoner guilty on this indictment; because it is necessary in the crime of perjury, not only that the oath should be false, but that it should be known by the party to be so at the time. Now it appears from the evidence for the prosecution, particularly from Mr. Lavine's evidence, for every part of it is given, with the utmost fairness, it appears that before the time of this arrest, that before the verdict in the Common Pleas, and before any idea of that verdict, this misguided, and worse than misguided woman, had been making repeated demands, and pressing and teazing, but always demanding as a debt due from Lady Mary, and making her demands against Lady Juliana as executrix; - now there is no positive proof whatever on this trial, and it would be difficult, perhaps, to produce it, unless we were to go into the secret communications with her attorney, that this woman knew a point of law, which many people, not of the profession, in this Court probably may not know at this moment; which is, that a person cannot be sued in their own right for a debt due by the person to whom they are executor; it is a proposition perfectly clear in point of law, but there is no evidence before us, that the prisoner knew that distinction; before, therefore, she could be convicted on this indictment, we must have evidence to prove, not only that there was no debt due from Lady Juliana in her own right, but that there was no debt due from Lady Mary; because this woman might have conceived that she had a right of action against Lady Juliana, and not distinguishing as a lawyer could do, might have brought that action wrong. Now, that there was no such debt due from Lady Mary to her mother, there is strong proof from the verdict in the former case to believe, but it does not necessarily follow, that that witness knew that she had produced an account on the trial of the former cause, which I see contains an inventory of the delivery of a great many things; now, those things may or may not be all that was delivered to Lady Mary, some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250149"/>them unquestionably were, for there are entries in Lady Mary's memorandums of payments, but the prisoner might not have known what money her mother might have received of Lady Mary, for that knowledge has not been brought home in evidence to her to day; I think I can say without any danger to the prisoner, and without any offence to public justice, that if this prosecution had been carried on with a very vindictive spirit, much stronger evidence might have been produced against the prisoner, but on the evidence to-day I do not think that I am bound in duty to prevent your complying with the humane desire expressed by the prosecutrix; at the same time I should have found an uneasiness in leaving the point to your verdict from the evidence, for this reason, because independent of the fact of the perjury supposed to be committed in the affidavit, the conduct of this woman has been so attrocious, so brutal, so malignant, and so contrary to every thing that renders a person fit for society, that there would have been some difficulty to divest your minds of all prejudice, and though that conduct does not directly go to substantiate this charge, I mean the brutal behaviour of the prisoner, and those employed by her in the arrest, in the manner in which it was conducted, and still more in the instructions given by the defendant for that arrest, as far as the law can reach, that it seems to be due to public justice, to punish that offence, and I am sure it would be wise, if certain other methods were pursued still to punish this woman, but I do not think there is any thing against publick justice on the evidence now before you in your acquitting the prisoner of this charge.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You owe it in part to the clemency of your prosecutrix, and in part to the very strict and rigid rules of law which must govern in these cases, that you have escaped to day that punishment which there is very strong reason to believe you have most richly deserved; it will depend on the future humanity of Lady Juliana, whether you will escape from all punishment, because there is a part of your conduct from which the acquittal of this Jury will not protect you, and which certainly subjects you to punishment, and to punishment of severity. If you escape further prosecution, I hope her ladyship's lenity will not be abused, as it hither to has been, and that you will be conscious of your own guilt, and behave accordingly.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the excise, I was stationed at Lare Delahoy, near Colchester; on the 22d of December last I went on the look-out at Beldon, to the Rose public-house, which is by the sea-coast, about half a mile from Mersey Island; when I was at the Rose public-house, I observed a number of horses and asses going towards the island, they were going by the house which is close by the road side, I observed the prisoner at the bar to be one of the party, I knew him before, he was upon an ass; upon this I informed my brother officers; when I saw them it was about four in the afternoon, I went to Colchester for some assistance, and I brought back with me Drawbridge, Eddy and Storer; one of them is the Collector's clerk, the other two are officers; we returned back some time between eight and ten, then we went to a place called <placeName id="t17890225-104-crimeloc468">Manwood</placeName>

               <p>I am an officer of the Excise; I went in company with the last witness, and two others, to Manwood; when we got into the middle, we heard some men and horses coming; the men were talking; we went aside, and Eddy and Storer were behind us; as soon as the smugglers came opposite to us we went out, and I asked, what they had got? they said, what is that to you? there appeared to be eight or nine of them; I told them we were King's officers, and must see what they had got; there were two men on horses, one a dun, and the other a brown; they had five tubs on each, with sling cords; Rowe was further on than me; the two men alighted, and went towards Rowe, and one of them struck at him, it appeared to me to be with a large bludgeon, or whip; when I saw them dismount, before they went to Rowe, I called out to my brother officers not to hurt any one unless they resisted; I went up, and seized the dun horse; and, in a minute or two after that, I heard Eddy cry out, Drawbridge! Drawbridge! come to my assistance, for I am down; he was about four rods from me; I went, and found him closed with one of the smugglers in the bushes; they were down, and he told me, the smuggler would not let him go; Eddy was uppermost; I desired the smuggler to let him go; if he did not, I must strike him; I had a drawn cutlass in my hand; he would not let Eddy go, and I struck the smuggler; and he let him go, and I desired Eddy not to close with any of them any more; I then went back, and took hold of the horse; two or three of the smugglers came and struck the horse to make him go away, but I held him fast; one of the smugglers then came up, and with a long stick about four feet and a half long, which he held in both his hands, and struck me on the back of the head; I had an iron cap on, but notwithstanding I was stunned; and while I was staggering, I heard a voice say, damn you, Dawbridge, now we have you we will do you, and I fell; and three or four of the smugglers were beating of me with large bludgeons; while I was down, I called out to Rowe to come to my assistance, or I should be murdered; I got up, and staggered to the road, where I fell again; and the smugglers came up and laid on me again; then Rowe came to my assistance, and beat them off, and I got up again: we got the two horses with ten casks, which we tasted at Colchester, and I found it to be geneva and brandy; me and the three officers took them to Colchester, and Rowe followed us; I am sure the defendant is one that struck me; I struck him again; three times with the cutlass, I struck him on the head; I am positive he is the man.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon in Colchester; I dressed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250152"/>the prisoner on the night of the 22d of December, about two miles from Manwood, at a house between Mersey Island and Manwood; I believe there were six of them all wounded; the general tenor of their conversation was, that they had had an affray with the Excise officers in Manwood, and that they were all wounded; the prisoner was one of them; I dressed them all; he had three long cuts on the forehead, and a blow on the skull; that I took several pieces of bone out of his skull; he appeared from his wounds to be almost in a stupid state; he had a most terrible cut on the wrist, about three quarters through the bone, so that I was obliged to get a board sawed, to lay his arm on and bind round to keep it together; I expressed my surprize at seeing men in that state, and in liquor; at the time I dressed the prisoner I did not think he would recover from the state of the wound in the skull.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys addressed the Jury on the behalf of the prisoner, and called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250154"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>A new Edition of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND, which is a sufficient Instructor of itself, is just reprinted, Price Eighteen pence; also his Publication, entitled,</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System of Short-Hand;</p>
               <p>"to which are added, a Comparative Table of Short-Hand Alphabets, and</p>
               <p>"two Extracts by way of Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price 2 s. 6 d. Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Bell, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No. 35, Chancery-Lane, will receive immediate Answers, and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law and others, immediately attended to: Addressed to Mr. Hodgson, at his House, No. 13, White Lyon Row, Islington, or left for him, at No. 35, Chancery-Lane.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on Mr. Hodgson's Plan, wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing: Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice, (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last sixteen Years, which he will dispose of; or any person wishing to see any particular Trial may have an Inspection of the same, or take a Copy of it, at the usual Prices.</p>
