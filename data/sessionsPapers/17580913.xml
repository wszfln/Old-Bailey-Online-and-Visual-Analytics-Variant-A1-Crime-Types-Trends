I searched the house where she lodg'd in Worcester-street, Old-Gravel-lane; we took her before justice Scott, she would not own any thing there, but afterwards going to the Watch-house, she owned to the taking it. She said she would bring us to the house where she had left it, for a small trifle of money. We went to that house, but could not find the woman of the house; the back door was open, and the print of a woman's feet going out at it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you convicted for stealing the seventy two cups and seventy two saucers, laid in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Wyman. I was, and some coffee-cups, the coffee-cups were in the basket unknown to me; I had no intention of stealing them; this was on the 13th of July.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened after this?</p>
               <p>Wyman. My master missed a blue china dish out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of seventy two china cups, and seventy two saucers?</p>

               <p>Wyman. Yes, them I bought of a sailor's wife, I think she was.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Wyman. About the 9th or 10th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy them?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I met her in the street in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they cost you?</p>
               <p>Wyman. Some cost me 3 s. 6 d. and some 4 s. a half dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy them all at one time?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I bought them at two different times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you buy the first time?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I bought seven half dozens at one time, and five at the other.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy the first parcel?</p>
               <p>Wyman. On the 9th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy the other?</p>
               <p>Wyman. The next day but one after.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for the first parcel?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I gave 3 s. 6 d. per half dozen for part of each parcel. They on the 9th of July cost me 25 s. the other cost me 16 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy both parcels of one woman?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you buy the first parcel?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I bought them in the afternoon about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you buy the second parcel?</p>
               <p>Wyman. In the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going at the time you met this woman?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I was going on some business for my master into the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which way you was going?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I was going down Cheapside when I met her the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was you going the second time?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I was going along Fleet-street, and met her without Temple-bar in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appoint her to meet you?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I did not, I met her both times by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any thing of her before?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I never did?</p>
               <p>Q. Did she offer these cups and saucers to you, or did you ask her?</p>
               <p>Wyman. She offered them to me; she saw I had a china-basket on my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she carry her china?</p>
               <p>Wyman. She had it in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the very same cups and saucers that you was indicted for this sessions?</p>
               <p>Wyman. They were the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them after you bought them?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I went and sold them to the prisoner,

               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Wyman. He lived in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business ?</p>
               <p>Wyman. He keeps an earthen-ware shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you sell them to him?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I sold one parcel the 12th day, and told him I would get him some more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the first parcel for?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I sold the first seven sets, but we had not agreed, some he was to give 3 s. 6 d. and some 3 s. 9 d. per set. I received a guinea of him in part, we were to agree on that the next time we met. I was in a hurry, and could not stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever deal with him before?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to deliver them without making an absolute bargain ?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I took them with me, it being in my way, and I could not stay, so he gave me a guinea then in part.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same day that you bought them?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, it was the day after but one; I bought them the 9th, and sold them the 12th.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them between the 9th and the 12th.</p>
               <p>Wyman. I locked them up in my box, in the room where I lay.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130005"/>Q. Did you shew them to any body?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I did not, but carried them directly to my box.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you sell the rest?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I sold them a day or two afterwards; I cannot truly say which day that was he bought the five sets.</p>
               <p>Q. For how much did you sell them?</p>
               <p>Wyman. Mr. Briner was not within when I carried them, and I left them with his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any word with her when you left them?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I did not, but told her I would call again when he was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I did not, so I never had any thing for them.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prisoner. Did Mr. Briner ever receive of you any cups or saucers, knowing them to have been stolen?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, never, he had no reason to suspect I stole any.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Did you steal any of them?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, I did not, I never wronged my master of any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known him?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I have known him this two years or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before you lived with Mr. Vere?</p>
               <p>Wyman. I lived with a silversmith before near Temple-bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that you lived with Mr. Vere at the time he bought these things of you?</p>
               <p>Wyman. He did know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any questions when he bought the first parcel of you?</p>
               <p>Wyman. No, he only asked me who I bought them of; and I said of a sailor's wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vere. This evidence confess'd the taking these cups and saucers, and owned they were my property, after he was detected, before abundance of witnesses, that I could produce.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge about it, besides his confession of the prisoner's receiving the goods, knowing them to have been stolen?</p>
               <p>Vere. The cups and saucers were found in the prisoner's house. We had a constable and a search warrant to search his house, from justice Fielding. The evidence, Wyman, went along with us, and took down the china from the different shelves in th e shop, and said it was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the constable's name?</p>

            . I had a warrant to search the house of the prisoner, in Clare-market; he was not at home, we found those cups and saucers on different shelves in the shop; (producing the China mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. Who found them ?</p>
               <p>Smith. The evidence Wyman went to the shelves and took them down, and said they were Mr. Vere's property.</p>
               <p>Vere. These are of the same patterns and kinds that I have a great number of; I cannot swear to the identity of them, for any other of the trade may have of the same patterns; I have nothing to go by, but the confession of Wyman.</p>
               <p>Court. A confession out of court will not go beyond what he swears in court.</p>
               <p>Vere. The prisoner own'd he had bought several sets of china of my servant, and that those he bought of him, and he gave him a guinea for the first seven sets; that the five sets were brought afterwards, which he had not paid him for. Before justice Sydenham he said he did not know that Wyman was my servant, but that he knew he lived with a china-man, but did not know with whom; he afterwards said otherwise, he said he thought by the price that they could not be honestly come by, and he had an intention of coming to me, to acquaint me with it. The second time of examination he said he did not know how he came by the five sets, that he found them in his shop. I asked him what day, he said he believed the Friday or Saturday; this was over night, when examined the next morning, he said he found them on the Friday morning on a bulk.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those seven sets of cups and saucers?</p>
               <p>Vear. They cost me on an average about 4 s. 6 d. a set.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the affair; I bought them, but I did not know them to be stolen; I gave him a guinea in part for the first parcel; I was not at home when he brought the others.</p>

               <p>Longden. He said he wanted to dye a pair of stockings blue. I took him before Mr. alderman Chitty, there he confessed he took it. I have enquired since, and find he bears a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell who rob'd you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. The prisoner lived with me above twelve months, and some of the things were found upon him; the things that were in my pocket on the Saturday night, were in his pocket on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed on Saturday night ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. At 12 o'clock; and arose at 7 in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of your house broke open?</p>
               <p>Taylor. My maid got up first; and came and told me that my cellar door, that was bolted with two bolts, was open; she told me she found my keys thrown about the cellar, and she brought them up to me. I told her I had put them into the till of my table, by my bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you put them there?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I am certain I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to those several places that those keys lock'd?</p>
               <p>Taylor. These were the keys of my cupboards, and places where I kept my liquors.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the key where your money was kept?</p>

               <p>Taylor. It was in the bureau where I left my money. I double lock'd the bureau, and left the key in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your bureau ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130007"/>Taylor. It was at my bed's feet, in the room where I lie. When I came to look there, I found my lock spoiled and all my money gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all this money mentioned in the indictment, in that bureau?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was. I had put some in when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been forced open?</p>
               <p>Taylor. By pulling, the wood was forced, so that I was obliged to have the smith to mend it. My shoe buckles were in my shoes, and the teaspoons in my pocket at my bed's foot, and my ear-ring and little knife.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed all this money, what did you do ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I had some friends came in and desired me to advertise my loss. After it was advertised, there came a man out of Rosemary-lane, and said that this man at the bar came into his shop, and had a great deal of gold in his pocket; and he had bought all new cloaths, and changed his old ones, he did not name the prisoner, only described him; he had bought a shirt, and stockings, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. This was on the Monday morning about 10 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been gone from your service?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He had been gone about fourteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you guess it to be the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Taylor. A neighbour stood by, and said it is your Jack that liv'd with you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Taylor. The man said, I have got a knife and an ear-ring, which were in his pocket, I will fetch them, may be you may know them; he brought them to me, I knew them to be mine, and in my pocket on the Saturday night. Then my neighbours set out to see for the prisoner, they took him and carried him before justice Fielding; they searched him where they took him, on Saffron-hill, as they told me. They brought 22 l. and some half-pence, which they said they found upon him. I was at justice Fielding's with him, he said he found this money in the Fleet-market. I ask'd him where he found my buckles, he said along with it. He owned he changed the buckles and three tea-spoons, to buy a pair of buckles for himself. He said he was not in my house on the Saturday night after he went out at 9 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in your house on Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did. He would not confess at the justice's.</p>

            . I live at the crooked-billet, Rosemary-lane. I am a stocking-maker by trade; but I keep a little shop, and sell linen and other things. The prisoner at the bar came to my house to buy a shirt, and he bought also a pair of stockings, and a stock, on the 13th of last month about 9 or 10 o'clock; he had bought a hat of Mr. Boyce, and changed a three pound twelve to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Linstead. Both the prisoner and Mr. Boyce told me so; and the prisoner owned the same before justice Fielding. He had bought a suit of cloaths of Mr. Johnson in Rosemary-lane; he had the cloaths on his back before the justice. Johnson is not here. After he had bought these cloaths he came to my house, and he went to be shaved, and left all his new cloaths in my house. He returned and shifted himself in my house; he went backwards and pulled out silver spoons, and a handful of broad pieces of gold, in the sight of a woman, who told me of it, the moment he went out. He said I have been five hours in this lane laying out money; I have received 40 l. and have taken 10 shillings in half-pence. Next morning I read the advertisement of Mrs. Taylor's losing 130 l. in St. Mary Ax; I went to her, and acquainted her with what I had observed. I describ'd the prisoner, and mentioning spoons, she said there were some spoons gone with the rest of the things. She and the servants said, sure it is not Jack, or

He had put a pair of square silver buckles into his shoes; and when he was before justice Fielding he had a pair of round ones on.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Taylor. What sort of buckles were yours ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. They were square ones.</p>
               <p>Linstead. I told the prisoner before the justice, they were not the buckles that he put in his shoes at my house; he said they were, a good while; but at last he owned that he had changed them and the spoons away to a silversmith, for a pair of new buckles.

            . I am sixteen years of age next January. I am servant to the prosecutrix, the prisoner came in, and called for a penny-worth of beer on Saturday night about nine o'clock. I drew it, he followed me down the stairs, he went down one pair of stairs, and I another. Some time afterwards I went to draw some more beer, he was left below. I called to him thro' the door to know if he would have a candle; he staid there I believe ten minutes; he made an excuse to go to the little-house. He came up and drank his beer, and went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards ?</p>
               <p>King. No, I did not. The next morning I told her he had been down in the cellar. There was a neighbour called to me, and said, Tom how came you to leave your cellar window open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it open?</p>
               <p>King. No, I did not. It was shut on Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Was there any lock to that cellar door?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There were two large bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it bolted when you went to bed over night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to King. Is this the cellar window that the prisoner went into?</p>
               <p>King. It is.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix, Mrs. Taylor; on the 13th of August, a Sunday morning, it was just half an hour after six o'clock in the morning, when I came down by the dial. I went down into the cellar; one has the necessary, the other the beer. Going to step into the necessary, I kicked something before me; I found it to be keys; I groped about being dark, I picked up some large and some small ones; I knew them to be my mistress's keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window bolted?</p>
               <p>Draper. I am sure it was bolted on the Saturday; it is never opened but when the brewers come. As I was coming up out of the cellar, a neighbour called, and said your cellar window is open. I was afraid my mistress was murdered, and dared not go up for some time. I called her once or twice before she answered me. I went to the side on her bed, and told her I found her keys off the ring, and the cellar door open. She got up and missed her gold and things, and said I have lost all I had in the world. I put her things on, she was in such a flutter. I missed he buckles out of her shoes; after she was gone down she said she had some money in her pocket at the foot of the bed. I went up for it, and it was all gone. She had not a half-penny left in the house, neither gold, silver, or brass. On the Monday morning about 10 o'clock Mr. Linstead came, and asked my mistress if she had any suspicion of any body committing the robbery; he described the prisoner at the bar, we all said it was

            , Wine-merchant. On Tuesday we had intelligence that the prisoner had been seen on Saffron-hill, on Sunday and Monday. We got a warrant of justice Fielding. I and two other neighbours agreed to go. We took him about 11 o'clock. I searched him, and found nineteen guineas, four half-guineas, six pence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130009"/> and three pence in half-pence, and a watch; (producing it.) I found several bills in his pocket, where he had been laying out money, to the amount of about 20 l. more, for household goods; I asked him how he came by the money, he said he could give a very good account of it before the justice; his mistress asked him how he could serve her so, who had been so good to him; he turned round and said, you cannot say I have hurt you. On the Thursday before the justice, when I asked him what he had done with the money; he said there was not above 70 l. part of which you have got, and part I laid out for the goods. I told him that did not amount to 70 l. he said he had spent some little, and some he had given to the girl that was with him.</p>

I had hung her on the palisade, and in about a quarter of an hour, coming by that place, I saw her again held by the hand of a young man, whom I was informed was the prisoner at the bar, it was so dark I did not observe him so as to know him again; there were two other persons disputing with him, one said the other had no business with her, the other said he had good reason to ask him, being a stranger, what business he had with her, or to that purport; the young man held her while I mounted, and I rode on 2 or 300 yards to another patient; I ride with a double bridle, there I buckled the long rein to a rail. I have a buckle for that purpose about the middle of that rein. I staid in that house about ten or fifteen minutes; when I came out the mare was gone again, and no bridle remaining on the rail. Some time after I found her in the possession of my servant and a gentleman, who had got the prisoner with them; then I sent for an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130010"/> officer, and next day took him before justice Fielding, where he said he was in liquor, and knew little or nothing about the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the rein of the bridle?</p>
               <p>Davis. The rein was cut.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Davis, I was sent to see for the mare, by my master, when she was lost; I came home again and could not find her. I was sent out with some medicines, and going along the road, I found the prisoner on the back of her.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was this from the place where your master missed her?</p>
               <p>Pettit. It was about half a mile distance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. She was lost from Mare-street Hackney, opposite Mr. Batcheldor's house.</p>
               <p>Pettit. That is about half a mile distance from the place where I found her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner going towards London or the country?</p>
               <p>Pettit. He was going towards the country, Essex or Hertfordshire; the bridle was cut and hung down. I told him I thought he rode in danger, as his bridle was under the horse's feet. I then did not know it was my master's mare. I went near to him, he said he would satisfy me if I would get him somebody to mend it; when I discovered the mare, I kept him in discourse till I got him to a publick house; there I got a person to assist me, and brought him and the mare to my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Pettit. This was very near 10 o'clock at night, my master had been at home then about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Pettit. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What time was it when you missed the mare the last time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I apprehend it was more than nine o'clock when I missed her. It was not more than half an hour till she was brought to me, with the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Pettit. When I got the prisoner to that publick house, and charged him with taking my master's mare; he gave the bridle a snatch and wanted to get away, and then he pretended to be very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>Pettit. I really think he was not so much in liquor as he pretended to be; before Mr. Fielding he said he did not know how he came by the mare.</p>

            . I was going home the second Monday in August, I saw a man leading Mr. Davis's mare, I call'd to him to know what he was going to do with her; said he, I am leading her about. She having been taken from my door but the Saturday before, made me the more inquisitive about her. He led her from the foot way towards the road. I said to one Simpson that was with me, I fancy that man is going away with her. I ran after him, then he came back with the mare, and began to swear; and was very angry with me for troubling myself about it. Mr. Davis came out, and he held the mare while Mr. Davis mounted; and rode on, and the man followed him. Then I imagined he had come to call Mr. Davis to some patient.

            . I was going home at that time with Mr. Covey, when we came to Church-road at Hackney, about nine at night or half an hour after, we saw the prisoner at the bar walking Mr. Davis's horse down the road. Covey desired me to stop a little, and said that mare was stole from his door the Saturday before, he call'd to the prisoner, he returned again with the mare; as he pass'd by me, I said I believe I know the man, he served part of his time with a smith. He walk'd her into Church-road, there the prisoner began to abuse Mr. Covey. Mr. Davis soon came out, and mounted, and rode away. Then I told Mr. Covey, I knew that was the same person, which is the prisoner at the bar.</p>

I was not willing to charge the prisoner with them till I was sure. She said, Mistress, do you think that I have got them. I pulled her apron back, and saw the corner of one; then I said I believe you have got them; upon which she took them from out of her apron, and flung them at me, and d - d, and called me names; (the handkerchiefs produced in the court and deposed to.)</p>

Mrs. Graham had called to her husband, who was above; she took up the handkerchiefs, and laid them on the compter; the prisoner ran out of the shop, but was soon taken, and brought in again: then she went on her knees, and said it was the first fault she ever did.</p>

Some time after, my maid came and told me the sawyers were gone from work, and that the watch was missing. I went home, and found it as she said; they came again just at dark; I asked them where they had been, they said to see the soldiers muster; (the two sawyers are <rs id="t17580913-20-deflabel97" type="occupation">soldiers</rs>

I took them before justice Keeling, but could not make any thing of them. On the, Thursday following my maid missed a silver milk-pot, then I took them both before justice Fielding; I found Evans, the evidence, had got a silver stock-buckle, and a better coat than he had before, from which I strongly suspected that they had the things. Before the justice, Evans confessed the watch was pawn'd on Snow-hill for a guinea, to one Mr. Brown, and that they knocked the milk-pot to pieces, and sold it to a Jew.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Haines. This was about a month ago, on a Saturday; my master was not at home, we did not go to work; we went to go out of the yard, and when in the entry, the maid asked us who was there; we said the sawyers; we took the watch from off the nail by the fire-side in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door open or shut when the prisoner took the watch?</p>
               <p>Haines. It was open; that door used to stand open, and we had seen the watch several times before. After we had taken the watch, we went and pawn'd it on Snow-hill for a guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. Who pawn'd it?</p>

               <p>Q. Where does the Jew live?</p>
               <p>Haines. I do not know, I never saw him before, neither do I know where we found him; we went from Snow-hill to him, it was in an open place near Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Jew's name?</p>
               <p>Haines. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Captain Wilson. The prisoner belongs to my company; I have known him about two years, he has behaved remarkably well; I never heand him suspected, he bears as good a character as any in the company.</p>

On the Thursday morning I found the desk open, and missed the money; I observed the desk to be cut with a knife, I borrowed the prisoner's knife, and found it to fit the place; then I sent my brother and another person to search his lodging; they went, and soon returned with the money; after that, we sent for an officer and charged him. He said, he found the gates open that go into our work-house, and came in, and so to the counting-house, between 11 and 12 at night: he tried to cut a hole, but, in trying, found it loose; so he thought it was easier to break the lock, than cut a hole; so he broke it open, and took the money, and carried it to his lodgings, and went to bed, and the next morning he came to work.</p>

               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Holmes. The very last day of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she your servant?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Her husband had turn'd her out of doors, and my wife took her in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you deliver the cloth to her?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I delivered it the 31st of July; there was 7 yards of it, and she left me but two; she was gone also; and when I came home from my work, she had taken away the key, I was forced to break the door open; I have but one room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife?</p>
               <p>Holmes. My wife had been abroad, three weeks before; she was at her sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your wife to go out, and leave this woman with you?</p>
               <p>Holmes. By her transgression, in pawning my tools.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds have you got?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We have no more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner lie?</p>
               <p>Holmes. She did not lie with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How then?</p>
               <p>Holmes. She sat up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been with you?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sit up in your room the whole three weeks?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes. I was two days after her before I could find her; she had pawn'd the cloth to two different pawn-brokers, one lives in Silver-street, the other near Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send her to pawn the cloaths?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she never pawn things for you by your direction?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you send the cloth to your wife, for her to make your shirts?</p>
               <p>Holmes. She would not make them. When the prisoner was before the Justice, she said, she intended to have brought the cloth again; but she pawned one part one day, and the other another day, which was no good sign of returning them.</p>

(The prosecutor produced the two pieces, and deposed to them both as his property.)</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this cloth to be yours?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The two pawn-brokers told me it was the same that the prisoner pawned to them; and if so, it is the same that I delivered to her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Stowers. I sell silver buckles and other things. The prisoner came to my shop, to sell some melted silver in a lump; I asked him where he lived? he said with the duke of Bedford; I asked him, how he came by this silver? he said, he was one of the watchmen, and he found it in sifting the cinders: I asked him, why he did not acquaint the steward with it? he said he told the men in the garden of it, but they did not know of such a thing: I bid him leave it till the afternoon, and then I would let him know the value of it; he came accordingly, I gave him 7 s. for it: he proposed to bring me more, saying, he believed there was more in the dirt. On the Tuesday following he brought two ounces more; I desired him to leave it, and I would weigh it; I bid him call again in the afternoon. When he was gone, I went to justice Welch, and we went to the duke of Bedford's; the steward said, he did not know such a man. The prisoner came the next morning to my shop, and then we stopt him I search'd his pocket, and found a letter in it directed to him at Mr. Cafe's, in Gutter-lane: he deliver'd me the key of his box, and said it was at the brown bear; there I went, and found 8 ounces more. There is in the whole 12 ounces 4 penny weight of it. (The silver produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Dowds. In taking care of my wife, she was taken very ill of the cholick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for her ?</p>
               <p>Dowds. No, I did not; she came in by chance.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any day that she came to your house in the month of June?</p>
               <p>Dowds. She might come in the month of June, but I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she dine with you?</p>
               <p>Dowds. Suppose I had nothing to eat myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell whether she dined with you or not ?</p>
               <p>Dowds. She had nothing all day.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell any other particular day, on which she paid you a visit ?</p>
               <p>Dowds. I have no occasion to say any other day than the day you ask me. I have no more to say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. But I have something more to say to you. Name some day when she did dine with you.</p>
               <p>Dowds. She dined with me on Easter Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What for dinner ?</p>
               <p>Dowds. She came about ten in the morning, and brought a good leg of mutton with her to make herself welcome; and staid till about ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any other time?</p>
               <p>Dowds. To make the thing particular, she took a Patrick's pot with me on St. Patrick's day. I have no more to say, these two days are so remarkable, I could not forget them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember the first of July particularly ?</p>
               <p>Dowds. I paid the king's tax that morning, and I took care to remember the day of the month on that account, I think I had a very good reason to remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that receipt, have you it here?</p>
               <p>Dowds. No, I have not; if I thought I should be asked about it, I would have brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you was not desired by any person to remember that Saturday to distinguish it from all other days?</p>
               <p>Dowds. No, I was not; no one asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the prisoner desired you to remember where you was that day?</p>
               <p>Dowds. No, she never did.</p>
               <p>[His wife having been put out of court while he was examined; was now brought in and sworn.]</p>

On the 20th of February last the prisoner came into our shop, to buy a pair of gloves, he fix'd upon a pair at a shilling price; then he flung down a guinea, and desired me to give him change; I gave him half a guinea, and laid down 18 s. in silver on the counter, and was telling out his proper change; he took up some silver, and then flung down my half guinea and part of the silver, and took up his own guinea, and away he went, and said he would send for the gloves. When I came to tell my silver over, I found but 15 shillings; so I am certain he took away 3 s. with him. He was taken up for defrauding a young man, and as they brought him by my door I knew him again.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, the prisoner came to my house yesterday was sen'night and asked me if I would buy a tankard, she producing it in this condition. I asked her how she came by it; she told me her sister found it at the fire in White-chapel. (He produced a tankard that had been in a fire, and part of the lid melted.) I looked over the goldsmith's-hall bills, and found by the descriptions on the tankard, that it belong'd to Mr. Manning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Manning. Look at that tankard?</p>
               <p>Manning. ( Takes it in his hand.) This is my property; here is my name and arms upon it. I have not had it above three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. to Abrahams. How long ago is it since the fire in White-chapel?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. It is about a year ago; I shew'd the prisoner the bill and told her the tankard belong'd to a person in petticoat-lane, said she, pray send for Mr. Manning, naming his name, before I mentioned it. I charged a constable with her and went to Mr. Manning; she insisted upon it, another woman gave it her, and she was to have a shilling for selling it, she would not confess she took it from Mr. Manning's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went down by St. Mary-ax to see for my husband, and then to Duke's-place; a woman met me and said to me will you go into that watchmaker's shop, and ask him if he buys plate; I went in and asked, and he said he did, I went out and told her; she said she should be obliged to me if I would go in and sell this tankard for her, and she would hold my child for me the while. I carried it in, and said the woman asked 4 s. an ounce, or to leave it to his own option to give her what he would; then he sent for a constable, I said pray do not charge me, I'll carry you to the woman that owns it, the people said they saw the woman ran away.</p>

               <p>Robert Gibson. I live in Leather-lane Holborn, I have a house a repairing, we do not live in it, but make use of it as a warehouse; I lost an iron scale-beam out of it, worth 3 l. between the 23d and 24th of August. I advertised it a guinea reward; the prisoner at the bar came and asked me if I did not lose such a scale-beam, I told him I had, he told me if I would give him fifteen shillings I should have it again. I agreed to give him that money, I went along with him, I asked him which way he came by it; he told me a man brought it to him; but he could not tell me who he was, nor where he lived, but said he look'd like a countryman, in his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention in your advertisement, that the man should not be prosecuted?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, I did not. I took him before the justice to have him examined, he would not own any thing; but said he believed he could find the man.</p>

This day three weeks, I was coming down Chick-lane, between 5 and 6 o'clock, the prisoner call'd after me, and said he would give me a pint; he and I, and his wife, drank a pint together: he told me he had a jobb for me to do, and he would call me in the morning to do it; he did, I got up, he took me in Leather-lane with him, and stoped at a house, and said I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130024"/> bought a scale-beam here, and if you will get up I will tell you where it is; he lifted me up to a window and shewed me where to give it him out; I gave it him: he asked me if I could not give him out any thing else? I said, there was nothing but a glue-pot, a carpenter's ax, and a bag, which I gave him; he took the beam and the rest of the things to his own house, and told me to come to his house at night, and he would pay me for my trouble; I went, he gave me 5 s. and 6 d. I gave him a pint of beer, and he would be a pint with me; then I call'd for another, and I paid the 4 d. halfpeny.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live facing Mr. Webb's, at Stoke-Newington; I was sitting at my door on Wednesday or Thursday, I believe, the 16th of August, about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar bring a mug out of Mr. Webb's house, in her hand; when she had got about half way over the road, she covered it with her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of mug was it?</p>
               <p>Guinnet. It was like this mug here produced; she went in at a chandler's shop facing the house where she was servant; that was the last time I saw her, till she was taken. On the Wednesday following we took her up; I first heard of her in Leather-lane, then in Cold-bath-fields, but I found her at last in Cloth-fair; I took her to the baker-and-basket, and then charged an officer with her, and sent for Mr. Webb; as soon as he came she confessed to have taken the mug, and that she had pawned it in Goodman's-fields.</p>

            . I live at Stoke-Newington, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Webb's house with this or such a mug in her hand; she held it cross-ways, not upright, and covered it, and carried it into a chandler's shop: I went to the last witness and said, I am surpriz'd Mr. Webb lets his mugs go out in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Jer. Miller. I live in Goodman's-fields; this is the mug ( taking it into his hand) that I took in pledge of the prisoner at the bar, on the 16th of August; I asked her, if it was her own property? she said it was; and that it was left her by her friends in the country, and some little money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend her upon it?</p>
               <p>Miller. I lent her 3 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Miller. I knew her very well; she had been servant to our vestry-clerk, in Aylif-street, for some months, and did bear a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>The mug is my own right and property; I had that, and 30 l. and this mourning which I have now on, left me by an aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Webb. Are there any marks on the mug, by which you know it?</p>
               <p>Webb. Here are the initial letters of my own and wife's name on it, and a very particular cypher on the body of it. she is a young girl, out of place, and I hope the court will be as favourable to her as possible.</p>

               <p>Pates. I told a soldier that was there of it and we took hold of the prisoner; a brother that was along with him, snatched it out of his coat pocket and ran away with it. The soldier ran after him and caught him, we carried them both to justice Welch, he asked the prisoner how he came by the mug, he would give no account of it. It was advertised, then Mr. Thornton came and owned it.</p>
               <p>Thornton. The prisoner said he found it near the half-way house in digging in a clay-pit.</p>
               <p>Pates. That was all he would say.</p>
               <p>Thornton. The bottom of the mug is knock'd out, and cut into small square pieces, we have them here. ( The mug and pieces produced in court and deposed to.) Here is W. M. S. on the handle of it. I advertised it, describing it by these letters on the 19th of Ju ne.</p>

I asked them the way to St. John's-street; she directed me through an alley, which I have heard since is called <placeName id="t17580913-37-crimeloc195">Thatch'd-alley</placeName>

I had 2 s. 6 d. in one pocket, and 3 d. in half-pence, in another; I did not feel them take the half-pence, though I missed them afterwards, the silver they did not take. When she had her hand in my coat pocket, I cried out murder, and was going to call murder again, and Spencer clapt his hand upon my mouth, and almost strangled me.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish their faces?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light ?</p>
               <p>Hart. It was not moon light, but I had seen the woman in Chick lane before I went into the alley; I had hold of her hand when she had the watch in her hand: she said you bloody thief, let my hand go; I had given myself over, and did not expect I should live another minute, then the old woman, that is my witness, was coming by she saw the whole thing; she got a light, and came with it, then they made off; I am certain they were the two prisoners that are now at the bar. I was left all over of a gone blood. (He produced two handkerchief's, one he had about his neck at the time, and the other he whiped himself with, both very bloody.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Hart. No, I never did; they were both taken up the next day, and carried before Mr. Alderman Bethell, who committed them both to the Compter, she would not own that she took the watch from me, but said that one

               <p>Hart. She tried, and I believe felt my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hart. This was as I was striving to go back; she damn'd my eyes and limbs, and began to pull me about; she was endeavouring to take my watch from me, while it was in my breeches pocket, and she had hold of me when he came up; some had hold of my hands, and some my cloaths; there were four concerned, two men and two women; I could not describe the other man and woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to distinguish the man at the bar?</p>
               <p>Hart. There was a lamp in the place, just by Chick-lane, by which I could see him, as he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part did he strike you?</p>
               <p>Hart. He struck me over the head.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. I go out a washing and scowering; as I was coming along Mary Bulger and this young man were together, (meaning the prosecutor) she said d - n your eyes stand up, presently came Richard Spencer, and said you bloody thief what do you do here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Bulger before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did very well, she liv'd just opposite me; Spencer with his stick knocked the young man down, that was the first thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Spencer before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did, when I lived near Clerkenwell-green, he used to come by with droves.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. I am, I saw his face very well, by the light of the lamp, which was as light as a candle.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he speak these words to?</p>

            . Spencer is my own brother, I saw him on that Saturday evening, being the 29th of July, I was writing a letter to my husband on board the Tartar man of war, I gave it to the bellman while he was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Seargood. I live in great Ormond-yard, near Queen's-square, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was this?</p>
               <p>Seargood. It was a quarter before nine o'clock, he came before the bellman came, and the bell-man generally comes by nine, or at half an hour after nine the second time, he comes twice. I carried my letter down to the bellman, and paid fourpence for the letter, and a penny for the bell-man; I left him in the room while I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain as to the time ?</p>
               <p>Seargood. I am sure it could not be ten o'clock, because the bellman always comes twice before ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go away?</p>
               <p>Seargood. When I returned from the bellman he was in my room, and I fetched him a pot of beer, and got him some bread and cheese, and he staid in my room all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie alone, or with any body?</p>
               <p>Seargood. He laid with my two children, and I lay below with my landlady; he has laid so many a night at my house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your box lock'd?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I left it lock ed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find it when you missed your things?</p>

               <p>Q. Was the lock broken?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I cannot say that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your things last?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. The Sunday before; I came to the box, to take out a pair of horse scisars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners lodge in that house?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. They did; but I had never seen them till after I had lost the things. I asked Mrs. Harrison about the things, she had no body that she could suspect but the two prisoners; they were gone. I applied to justice Fielding, and had them advertised; but they returned again, and were taken before the advertisement took place. I took them before justice Fielding, and upon their examination Barnaby confessed the things were in pawn at one Mr. Graygoose's, in Holloway-street; Mr. Fielding sent a man with me, and we found this coat, waistcoat, shirt, and a pair of stockings, ( producing them,) my property, and some other things were found at another pawn-broker's.</p>
               <p>Q. What things?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. A pair of stockings, a handkerchief, and a night-cap.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Heron say about the things?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. He said nothing at all in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I am an ostler; this hat was on Heron's head, when he was taken before justice Fielding; the justice ordered it me, it is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things before you missed them ?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. They were with the other things in my box.</p>

            . The two prisoners had lodg'd with me about a fortnight when these things were lost; the prosecutor had got a place, and had left my room, and put his box in a closet by the side of the room where the two prisoners lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two prisoners lodge together?</p>
               <p>Harrison. Barnaby took the lodgings for himself and a partner, and they both lay together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been gone when they returned again ?</p>
               <p>Harrison. They had been gone two nights away. They went away on the Wednesday morning, and came again on Friday night; then we took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with them before the justice?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I was; but I really do not know what they said there; the pawn-broker brought the things, and they could not deny but that they were the things that they had pawn'd; I think Barnaby said, he designed to bring them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other of them say who took them ?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I did not hear any of them say that: I believe they both knew of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe so?</p>
               <p>Harrison. They said, they shared the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both of them say that?</p>
               <p>Harrison. No, Barnaby said that; he said they had the money betwixt them; they both of them said, it was the first fault, and were very sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of a hat?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I saw this hat taken from off Heron's head.</p>
               <p>Q. from Heron. Whether I made any confession before justice Fielding?</p>
               <p>Harrison. He acknowledged it to be his first fault, and beat upon his breast, and cry'd terribly.</p>
               <p>Heron. I said, it was the first time I was in disgrace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Heron say it was the first time he was in disgrace, or that it was his first fault?</p>
               <p>Harrison. He said, it was his first fault.</p>

               <p>Brooks. He came alone, and in order to make it appear they were his own, he took this coat and waistcoat from off his back, and brought others to put on, under his arm. The shirt and stockings were taken in on the 30th of August by a servant that is not here.</p>

            . I am constable, I was charged with the two prisoners at the bar, on Friday night last, between 10 and 11 o'clock; they were taken before the justice, there I heard Barnaby confess that he had taken the prosecutor's right and property. I took this hat from off Heron's head.</p>
               <p>Heron's defence.</p>
               <p>A little house, one story high, a chandler's-shop, opposite to Hanover square, two windows in front, in the same line was a door that came out of a large closet, in an even line with these two windows; whither those left open till 10 or 11 at night, and when we have come home the door has been open; other people might come in and take them; we never lock'd our door; once a man that lodged there came into our room, and took a play-book of mine; consequently that man was as liable to be suspected as myself. My hat was an extreme good one. Barnaby being flush with money, he desired to change his hat for mine and gave me a little money to boot; he has since pledged mine, so I have lost a good hat by it.</p>
               <p>Barnaby's defence.</p>
               <p>We lodged together, and we were together when we found these things in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen the things last?</p>
               <p>Jones. On Monday morning, the 4th of September, then I put some money out of my pocket into one of the drawers, I think it was two guineas and a half, and there was just a guinea and a half more in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention the goods you lost?</p>
               <p>Jones. Five gold-rings, a pinchbeck snuff-box, a silver watch, a great many small pieces of silver, a silver cup, that will hold about three quarters of a pint, a punch-ladle, a silver boat, seven silver tea-spoons, three table-spoons, a pair of studds, and a button or two; these were in the upper drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer lock'd?</p>
               <p>Jones. I lock'd it after I had put the money in on Monday morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, and I had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss these things?</p>
               <p>Jones. I missed them on the Tuesday, being the next day, a person came to me for change for a guinea, and I went to unlock the drawer as usual, and found the bolt did not move readily; then I found it had been broke open; there were a great many writings, leases, notes of hand, and agreements, to the amount of 150 l. were all taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130033"/>Q. What marks did you observe upon the drawer?</p>
               <p>Jones. The were four drawers broke, and upon one of the little drawers there appeared the mark as if done with a knife, and one of them is split very much by wrenching of it. Mr. Goodchild and Mr. Rowlls tried the prisoner's knife to the mark of the drawer, and they seemed to agree; the mark was just by the lock, where a knife had been put in to force the bolt down, so that it had made a dent in the upper part of the drawer, the dent was very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body lie near that room?</p>
               <p>Jones. My maid and my little girl lie in a room on the same floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. I came to London, to Mr. Fielding, to have the things advertised, and when I returned my writings and papers were found, as they told me, under ground in the prisoner's garden, in a canister; then I got a search-warrant from Mr. Rowlls, and went with the constable to search the prisoner's house, the first we found were the silver cup and spoons, and some small pieces of silver, the punch-ladle, watch, pap-boat, five gold rings concealed under ground close by the pales in the prisoner's garden. (Produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prisoner keep any lodgers?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, he does not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a garden is the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Jones. It is a very small garden, all grown over with weeds, it has not been dug up for a year for what I know; but the ground where the things were found appeared to have been fresh dug up.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep in the ground were they?</p>
               <p>Jones. They were not very deep. Upon seeing ing the ground broke was the reason we dug for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an inclosed or an open garden?</p>
               <p>Jones. One side of the garden is but very indifferent for fence, they are pales and some broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. What does it lie too.</p>
               <p>Jones. I think Mr. Dalton's garden and that lie close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it bounded by other gardens?</p>
               <p>Jones. There are little houses with little gardens that lie backwards of the houses, and at the back of the prisoner's garden is a meadow.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any gate that opens out of the garden into the meadow?</p>
               <p>Jones. I think there is, but I am not sure; I never was in it before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that garden from your house?</p>
               <p>Jones. It is about 140 yards, or thereabouts; I got a warrant and took the prisoner up; the justices met at my house, and he was examined there, he denied the fact, and said he knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to come to your house?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, he frequently came, as much as any of the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in your house on Monday the 4th of September?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was in the evening drinking with one Pearson betwixt 6 and 7 o'clock, he was drinking also with Mr. Gill and Mr. Newman, but he went out, and was gone about twenty minutes or half an hour, and came again.</p>
               <p>Q. What room were they drinking in?</p>
               <p>Jones. They were in the public room, the fore room on the ground floor, he staid but a little time before he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay after he returned again?</p>
               <p>Jones. He staid but a little time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the stair-case from where he was drinking?</p>
               <p>Jones. It is just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body up stairs at the time he was gone?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, not as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he, during the time he was absent, have gone up stairs and have taken the things out without any body seeing of him?</p>
               <p>Jones. I imagine he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your people at this time?</p>
               <p>Jones. Some in the back kitchen, and some in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he when he left the company go away with a candle in his hand?</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot say whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people had you in the room at that time?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was drinking with three people, and there were people coming in backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many might come in the time he was drinking in that room?</p>
               <p>Jones. Not a great many.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130034"/>Q. Do you imagine the prisoner knew the situation of the room up stairs?</p>
               <p>Jones. Without doubt, he knew all my rooms.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he ever up in that room where you kept these things?</p>
               <p>Jones. On the Sunday before he came to our house, pretending he wanted a button to be put on his collar, and wanted the maid to do it; he went into the back-kitchen where my maid was, and said nothing to her about it, but ran up stairs into my back-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, but my little boy did, and told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, when before the justice, say any thing about going up that Sunday?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, he said he went to see for the maid, to put a button on his shirt, and owned he went into my room, where the things were taken from, to see for her; there is the prisoner's knife, it was taken out of his pocket by the constable, this fitted the mark of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at the finding the things besides you?</p>
               <p>Jones. the constable was.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you say the garden is a little open on one side.</p>
               <p>Jones. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not a person come out of the meadow into the prisoner's garden?</p>
               <p>Jones. I believe they might; but they could not get into the meadow without coming over the Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not people come into that garden through Mr. Dalton's garden?</p>
               <p>Jones. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they not also come into the prisoner's garden through Mr. Pyke's garden?</p>
               <p>Jones. I believe they might.</p>

            . On Tuesday morning, the 5th of Sept. a little before 6 o'clock, I was in my master Mr. Pyke's garden, the sence joyns to the prisoner's garden, the sence is about breast high; I saw the prisoner come out of his garden and he went down in the meadow, about 20 yards distance to an elder-bush, and take from thence a white bundle and conceal it under his coat, and then return to his own garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him?</p>
               <p>Yernel. I did, I gave him the time of the morning, and he the same to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing in his own garden?</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of bundle was it?</p>
               <p>Yernel. I thought it was about the bulk of 4 or 5 shirts tied together, I had but a glimpse of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it?</p>
               <p>Yernel. About 14 or 16 inches long; he clap'd it under his frock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing?</p>
               <p>Yernel. I was at digging up things for my master, there was this white pillowbear ( taking one in his hand) found in the ground, wrapp'd about the plate.</p>

Dalton, that is on one side, has liberty to go to the pump and vault; and the other on the other side the same: and at the bottom of the garden there used to be a fence, and a gate; but now there is an open place, that a cart may drive through, where barge-men may come in from out of the meadow; I am subpenaed on both sides.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner a great while, he applied to me in the year 1751 for a loan of some money, he wanted 200 l. I knew he was one, amongst the many others, that were permitted to discount the pensions for the pensioners at Chelsea hospital; I let him have 200 l. upon giving me his bond, and indorsing to me such a number of the Chelsea pension orders to the paymaster, or his deputy, rather more than the sum lent; and when they became due at the college, he applied to me for them, to receive the money, and deposited a fresh number in my hands in the room of them; he applied to me several times, I lent him 160 l. at another time to the amount of 690 l. in the whole.</p>
               <p>Court. Look on this order. (He takes one in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Emson. I used to deliver the orders to Mr. Rayment Pain, for him to deliver them to the prisoner, and to take others of equal value of him; this is one that I received of Mr. Pain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any mark upon it?</p>
               <p>Emson. Here is J. E. on it, which I put there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever applied to any body, to see if it was a good order?</p>
               <p>Emson. No, I did not, till there was an act of parliament made to put it out of the power of those people to proceed as before? and when the prisoner was arrested by Mr. Murry, then I thought to see whether my security was good or not, and I found this with others were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you shew it?</p>
               <p>Emson. I shewed it at the office, and then applied to my attorney, he fought other security of the prisoner for me, which was a mortgage of a place he had purchased of 150 l. a year; but this appeared to be no manner of advantage at all, (I suppose it to be of the same kind) so I left it to my attorney to do as he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend the money on the security of his bond, or on the credit and security of these notes?</p>
               <p>Emson. I would not have lent him 5 l. on his bond; I had a bond, as is customary, but it was on the security of these notes that I lent him the money.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you bring an action on this account ?</p>
               <p>Emson. I do not know what action was brought, my attorney charged him with a declaration.</p>
               <p>Rayment Pain. I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years, I have been frequently intrusted by Mr. Emson to deliver the Chelsea pensioner's orders to the prisoner, and to receive others in the room of them; I received some from the prisoner in the year 1755, about July, to deliver to Mr. Emson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive this now in question of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pain. (He takes it in his hand) I really cannot tell in particular, because he delivered a whole bundle to me. I know I delivered them all to Mr. Emson, which he delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver any papers to any other people at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130036"/>Pain. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you other people's papers in your custody?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, none but my own; I lent the prisoner money as well as Mr. Emson.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you deliver these papers to Mr. Emson?</p>
               <p>Pain. I delivered them to him about July 1755.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Emson. When did Mr. Pain deliver to you these papers?</p>
               <p>Emson. It was in the year 1755, I am sure this is one of them, it was not above five minutes distance in his receiving them of Mr. Shaw, and bringing them up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make this mark upon it?</p>
               <p>Emson. I believe I made it about three or four days after, it is usual for me so to do.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the till left open?</p>
               <p>Westcome. I was never lock'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure all these things were in your house when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Westcome. I am positive they were, which was after 12 being on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Westcome. She had a lodging in White-cross-street, and she was very well acquainted with the house, for she was brought up in it, I did not in the least suspect her, but my neighbours told me they saw her with some of my things, and her brother's daughter charged her with some of them on her back. When I took her up I found an apron of mine upon her; (produced in court and deposed to,) she owned before justice Keeling that this was one of my aprons, but said it was brought to her after my house was broke open. Mr. Parrot has some things here, that were in my box, which he found in her room; (produced in court,) two pieces of binding, some fine thread, and two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your window fastened?</p>
               <p>Westcome. I fastened it with an iron bolt and key, and I found the sash open, and the shutter hanging by one hinge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine the prisoner has strength sufficient to break it in that manner ?</p>
               <p>Westcome. It needed not a great deal of strength, but I believe she could not possibly do it herself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parrot. The prisoner rented a room of me in White-cross-street, on the 26th of July, in the morning; I had word that she was going away, I went and seized upon the things that were left; while I was taking an inventory of them, the prisoner's brother, and her niece, and the prosecutrix came into the room; the prisoner, upon seeing the prosecutrix coming into the room, made a frivolous excuse to go down, and then went away; the things mentioned by the prosecutrix I found in the prisoner's room, and the prosecutrix claimed them as her own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was with Mrs. Westcome with a person that was ill, that person made me a present of the apron, and some caps, because I was so tender of her; I know nothing of the house being broke open; as to the tapes, I deal in needle-work, and buy my tapes at the best hand.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Did she nurse a person at your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She did; it was a relation of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before your house was broke open?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I believe two months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these caps and things were in your house the night before your house was broke open?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am positive they were.</p>

            . I ask'd him how he came up without a candle? he made but very little answer; I told him he came of no good design; he went away, and pretended to go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who it was ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I did by his tongue, it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with him before?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I was but little acquainted with him; the next morning I got up and missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him go down stairs?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I cannot say I did; he seemed to attempt to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your room-door fastened?</p>
               <p>Tompson. No, I was oblig'd to leave it open on account of the boy that was not come to bed, that lay in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your watch when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I hung it on a nail by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Tompson. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you before you fell asleep after you spoke to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I do not know; I am a dray-man, and our business is very laborious, so that we soon fall asleep after we get to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I awak'd about 8 o'clock, then I missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the alehouse boy lie in the same bed with you?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He lay in the same room, but not in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Which got up first, the boy or you?</p>
               <p>Tompson. The boy did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I had a mistrust of the prisoner, because there had been a watch lost in the next room to where I lie, and he was suspected of having that. I got a warrant of Mr. Fielding, and went and took him in his lodgings in Eagle-street, Piccadilly. I took him by the collar, and charg'd him with taking my watch, and he own'd directly he had it, it was in his bed, he took it out, and delivered it to me, (produced in court and deposed to.) I asked him how he came by it, he said he gave a guinea for it; I asked him who he bought it of, he said of a man, his name was Davey.</p>

               <p>Mee. That is, he is a man from Barbadoes.</p>

               <p>Mee. At the Bishop's-head in Ratcliff highway, he asked to be trusted for a pint of beer, and brought this tea-chest under his arm; said he I have got this to put my money in, I am to go on board a ship with a shipmate of mine, and if you will let me leave this chest here, I will call again for it in half an hour's time, so he left it.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade are you?</p>
               <p>Mee. I am a baker by trade, but I am a gravedigger at present; when I came to look into it. I found four silver tea-spoons in it, they were marked E. R. When he came again I found he knew nothing of the spoons, they were in a private drawer. I charged him with stealing it, and he confessed that he and another man were going along, that the other man went in and took it out, and he received it at the door. He took us to the house where he had it, which was the prosecutor's house.</p>

             came in, she had been out, (she is a lodger in the same house) we entered the deceased's room both at one instant, I found the prisoner with her left-knee on the right side of the bed, the deceased lying on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed or undressed?</p>
               <p>Higgins. His cloaths were off, and he was in bed, she had her cloaths on, her left hand was upon his neck or wind-pipe as he lay, to hold him down, she had the iron pin of the window in her right hand, held by the little end; (he produced an iron pin or bolt, with a knob at one end, and a key hole at the other, about fourteen inches long) the deceased had hold of the great end with both his hands, endeavouring, I believe, to pull it away from her, and she seemed to endeavour to get it away from him. I ran immediately and took it out of both their hands, and took her away from him. As soon as I had so done, she flew at him again, and catched hold of his right arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the bed was she on?</p>
               <p>Higgins. She was on the right side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to be in a passion ?</p>
               <p>Higgins. She did, I pulled her away again, and asked him if they had had any falling out, he said none at all, and that he had no sleep all night, and he believed he was then in a slumber, and she had taken the advantage of him. I asked her afterwards if she had struck him, he told me she had struck him two blows with the pin before I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her strike him?</p>
               <p>Higgins. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where she had struck him?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He said she had struck him on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any wound?</p>
               <p>Higgins. No, I did not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she by at the time he said this ?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say in answer to it?</p>

               <p>Higgins. She said nothing at all, I asked her several times her reason for doing of it, but she made me no answer at all; he begged of us to go to Mr. Welch for a warrant for her, we went, he granted one, and we took her before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased go?</p>
               <p>Higgins. No, he was not able to go; the justice examined her, but she said nothing, neither one way nor the other; he committed her, we came immediately home from the justice's, that is I and

               <p>Q. How long had you been gone from the deceased?</p>
               <p>Higgins. It was not above two hours at most.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130043"/>Higgins. We found him in his bed; he had sent for an apothecary in the mean time; the apothecary's man was there when we returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I did, and saw it dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many wound were there?</p>
               <p>Higgins. There was one wound.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep was it?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I cannot say as to the depth of it, he was so spent with his disease, that I believe he had no blood to bleed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his disease?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He was in a deep consumption, which he had laboured under for years.</p>
               <p>Q. If this accident had not happened, do you think he would have liv'd much longer then he did?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I cannot say that, he was in a weak and low condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this?</p>
               <p>Higgins. The next time I saw him was the day before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He died that day sennight.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear that day?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I could see very plainly that he was dying.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was dying of the consumption?</p>
               <p>Higgins. It is what I can scarcely pretend to resolve</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then any discourse with him?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I asked him what he would have done with his wife; he told me as well as he could, that he would have her kept in goal; I told him I saw he was a dying man, and recommended to him to send for a clergyman, he said no more, only signed with his hands for me to say no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not in my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in or out of her senses?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use to be out of her senses ?</p>
               <p>Higgins. There was such talk, but some of the house was of opinion that it was artificial, some otherwise, but that I cannot pretend to determine.</p>

               <p>May. He said his wife had been striking him over the head with the pin of the window, and desired me to shew him the pin.</p>
               <p>Q. What pin was it?</p>

               <p>Q. Was that all she said?</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see the deceased next?</p>
               <p>May. I saw him again that afternoon, after the prisoner was committed, he had been in bed, and I helped him to get up.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether he did not drop down in a sit on the Monday before?</p>
               <p>May. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. What might her disorder be owing to?</p>
               <p>Jesterman. It was said she was given to drinking, and I believe she was, and that brought the disorder.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say so?</p>
               <p>Coombs. He did, he said his wife was worse again, that he believed her brain was turned, for she told him the lodgers had carried the beds and goods out of the rooms, where they lodged, and brought old ones in the room of them, when the things were standing as they did.</p>

               <p>Beaton. It was for me to settle the prisoner's and my accounts; I waited on the attorney, and told him how it was.</p>
               <p>Court. The right way would have been to have brought in a bill in chancery, to have settled accounts; and if he had produc'd these bills there. (if forg'd) the court would have ordered a prosecution.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Clapham. My husband lives in Yorkshire, if he is alive.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear from him?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I have not heard from him this three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to think he is dead?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he on a journey there?</p>
               <p>Clapham. No, he is settled there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what business?</p>
               <p>Clapham. He keeps a farm there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you live with him?</p>
               <p>Clapham. No, we are parted.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been parted?</p>
               <p>Clapham. We have been parted five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I live in Holborn, by the bars.</p>
               <p>Q. What things have you lost ?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I lost as many things as come to about 3 l.</p>

               <p>Q. Name them?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I lost a shift that I bought at an old cloaths shop</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I had wore it a little, it cost me 5 s. I never had it on above three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you lose ?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I lost a pair of stuff shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Clapham. They were worth about 9 d. I wore them in a morning before I put on my better things; I lost also a swivel and a brush.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Clapham. They were not in my possession, because I was in Wood-street compter, at the time they were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your employment?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I was bar-keeper to Mr Hall, and when I was in the compter, the woman at the bar and a man, were put into the house instead of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hall put you in the compter?</p>
               <p>Clapham. No, he did not, but it was thro' him that I was put there.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain that?</p>
               <p>Clapham. They called me Mr. Hall's wife, and they took me instead of him; his house was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Clapham. For a disorderly house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again?</p>
               <p>Clapham. Yes, I did, the prisoner had my shift and shoes on, and my swivel hanging by her side with three or four keys on it?</p>
               <p>Q. What pretence had Hall to put them into the house?</p>
               <p>Clapham. The house was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for Hall's wife?</p>
               <p>Clapham. People used to call me Hall, and I could not tell every body what my real name was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever advise Mr. Hall to remove his goods?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130049"/>Q. Did you advise him to employ Bottle and his wife in so doing?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I really can't say.</p>

I did not see her for a week after. When I came into that chandler's shop, there she sat, said I you are a slut; she called me old rogue, and son of a bitch; I called her again; I drank my beer and went out about my business. By the time I got home and up stairs (I live behind Cripplegate church,) the clock struck ten. I went to work the next morning; at last came a man and said I had rob'd and stripp'd the woman; that afternoon she and two thief-catchers laid hold of me; there they made me spend my money, and then took me to New-prison please to enquire into the woman's character, she is drunk every day: I had many of the best of Cripplegate parish to give me 2 character, but it being late they are gone.</p>

               <p>Q. In what quantity were they put up?</p>
               <p>Lambert. They were put up in three different parcels; there were 15, and one for a wrapper, in one parcel; and the same number in another; and six and one, in another parcel. (This is the parcel that was missing.)</p>

I drove the Sunbury waggon, and brought these goods safe to London; when I came to White-chapel, there I unloaded some other things, I saw these parcels all safe then fastened in the waggon; that parcel which was taken away lay behind at the tail of the waggon, fastened in with a new rope, but when I came to the spread eagle in Grace-church-street, I found the rope was cut, and the parcel was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him cast?</p>

               <p>Foster. I had conversation with this man that is call'd John Brown, in New-prison, about his being convicted of a felony; I told him there, that I was taking up a copy of a record against him, for stealing goods out of the dwelling-house of Trasana Hayden; he told me, he could not help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he was the man?</p>
               <p>Foster. No he did not, neither did he confess it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he meant he could not help stealing the goods, or could not help your taking out the copy of the record?</p>

             the prisoner; he came in order for us to go and look out in that unhappy way of life, we staid in my house till about 10 or 11 o'clock; we went out into Church-row, Whitechapel, there stood a waggon at the end of Church-row, we went very near the arse of it, I was first; Smith called after me, and swore, here is a rum chance.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of that?</p>
               <p>Brown. That signifies something good; the meaning of rum in that dialect is Beru. I was anxious to go to a publick house; then we were going to the rose and crown to see a girl that liv'd with me, which a fellow had beat. I said to Smith it is only packs of veal that they bring out of the country, then he swore, d - n me, I will try; he took his knife and cut it, and put his finger in and said, it is all cloth; then I was as ready as he to take it away. He cut several cords with his knife behind the waggon that were put cross, and the pack fell naturally on his shoulder, I held it up behind, and we immediately struck through that alley again, and from thence into Gravel-lane, and through that to a court next Devonshire square, which is called Pump-court, there we knock'd up one Sanders. a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night might this be?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130052"/>Brown. This was about 11 o'clock, it being their Sunday; that is, on the Friday night; he had a lamp burning, he took it in, then we opened the pack to see what was in it: there were six pieces of that stuff they call says, and one piece which wrapp'd up all the other six, which was but about half the bulk of the other, and there was a wrapper besides; then we immediately began to make a bargain for it; but we could not agree for the price.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he bid you for it?</p>
               <p>Brown. He bid us but 3 d. a yard for it, we thought that too little; and Smith said, never mind him, I will take a bit of it and call upon Buckland, and I will call again, this lies in his way, he may make linings and other things of it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what business was Buckland?</p>
               <p>Brown. <rs id="t17580913-59-deflabel296" type="occupation">He keeps a cloth-shop in Long-lane, Smithfield</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17580913-59-defend531 t17580913-59-deflabel296"/>; while we were making a bargain with Sanders, some body knock'd at the door, we imagined we had been pursued, having been there but a little time; we were sadly affrighted with guilty consciences; with our scuffling we put the Jew's light out, but we soon found the person that rapt at the door was only a drunken man; then the light being out, we could not look at the stuff any more; then he said, come when my sabbath is over then perhaps we may agree. I went away; Smith came to me on the Saturday morning as he had appointed, and said Buckland had bid him 6 d. per yard for it at the first word.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the cloth?</p>
               <p>Brown. We left it with Sanders all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any ticket describing the cloth, when you open'd it?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, I did not; we went to Sanders on Saturday about noon, we told him how much Buckland bid, then Sanders bid us the other penny a yard, we did not agree with him then, he bid us come and fetch it away that evening, when it was dark we went to fetch it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it in the same condition as you left it the night before?</p>
               <p>Brown. We did, it was too heavy to be carried in one pack, so we divided it, we went into Duke's place and there pick'd up a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>
               <p>Brown. I can't tell that; the porter went to Sander's, and brought four pieces of it in a sack, and the remainder of it was to be fetch'd another time; I staid for the porter in Hounsditch, then I desired Smith to take that and carry it to Buckland's and said I'd go and bring the rest. The porter put it down on a bulk, and Smith, and a little porter named Alexander or Sanders, took it and carried it to Buckland's, and the port er went back to Sanders's for the rest; he soon returned to me with the second parcel, then we went with it to within about forty yards of Buckland's house, to a bulk at the end of Long-lane, Aldersgate-street; there Smith met me, and began to swear at me for staying so long, he said give it me, it is all bank.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of that?</p>
               <p>Brown. That is, it is all safe, he said Buckland don't care to be concerned with too many people, he is a learning chap; I'll go and I'll do for myself and you too; you not afraid that I should sink upon you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by sink upon you?</p>
               <p>Brown. That is to keep part of the money myself, without giving an account of it; then Smith ordered the porter and me to go to a public house, accordingly we went to the sign of the child's top and whip.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried the second parcel to Buckland's?</p>
               <p>Brown. Smith did.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Brown. I saw him go in at the door with it, for I was dubious of him and I watched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know what alehouse you went to?</p>
               <p>Brown. He said to the porter, go to the child's play-thing, that was the whip and top; while we were at the alehouse, I was fearful that Smith would sink upon me; I left the two porters there, and I went to Buckland's door and peep'd thro' the key-hole, and heard Smith and Buckland making a bargain about the cloth, Smith said it is worth 14 or 15 d. a yard, if we had the worth of it; I saw the parcel that I carried lying on the counter, and Buckland leaning with his hand upon it; the bargain was struck for the six pieces, he was to give 6 l. Smith said that is no more than six pence a yard; Buckland was to give six pence a yard, and nothing for the remnant; they measured it to be satisfied, and it ran two yards and a half above what it would come to at six pence a yard; so he said let it come to what it will, I will give 6 l. for them all.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Buckland ask Smith how he came by them, while you stood at the door?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130053"/>Brown. He need not to ask him that, for Smith told him; Buckland said you have sold

             them, could not you have let me seen them first. Said Smith we got them but last night out of a waggon in White-chapel. Well, said Buckland, I should not like to be behind any body; I should like to see the first of every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money paid?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>
               <p>Brown. I would have staid longer to have seen the upshot of it, but my head hit against the door, as my foot slipped, and Buckland came and looked out at the door, but I pop'd under a gateway just by his house; there I saw him put his head out and look about, and when he shut the door, I went to the porters at the alehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the first parcel?</p>
               <p>Brown. Smith told me he carried that to Buckland's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Smith come to you?</p>
               <p>Brown. In about 3 quarters of an hour, or an hour after, he came and hollowed at the alehouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go that night?</p>
               <p>Brown. I paid for the liquor, and we joined Smith in the street, and went over Moorfields; in the middle of Moorfields he said, you know Buckland is a comical sort of a chap, he never pays for all at once, he gave me but half, I have got but 3 l. we went under a lamp, and there he gave me 30 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the porters?</p>
               <p>Brown. I did; I gave one 2 s. and the other 6 d. He that had but 6 d. carried the first parcel along with Smith. There was a great noise about this afterwards, and a man was taken up upon it; it alarmed us, so that we kept out of the way. About a week or eight or ten days after this, Smith and his father and I were going by Pye-corner, we saw Buckland with a woman in an alehouse; he came and called to us to come and drink; we went in and sat down and drank, he took me to the door, and said here has been a d - d piece of work about this d - d says, I wish I had never troubled my head with it, but there will nothing come of it; said he I happened to be at a place, and heard an apprentice say they were going to look after some people that had robbed a waggon, and that they had got intelligence of the persons. I was singing of a song, and it struck me all of a heap; I could not sing any more, I thought the people took notice of me. I had it then at home, so I ran home and sent it out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he mean he carried out of his house?</p>
               <p>Brown. That was the says. Said I, I am told that the people who lost it value it at near 30 l. how could you give us so little for it; he said do you consider how long I shall have it by me; if it had been dy'd I could have afford to have given a good deal more for it. I must have it pressed and dyed, and may keep it seven years before I make use of it; said he Mr. Plump and Bobb Sanders came to me to fist me, but I knew as much as ever a Plump of them all; they have got nothing out of me, do but keep your tongue and nothing can hurt you.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are Plump and Sanders?</p>
               <p>Brown. Two thief catchers. Then we paid for a pot of beer and came away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever receive the other money?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, Smith brought 3 l. more to me, and said he had it of Buckland, and gave me 30 s. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you had received the other.</p>
               <p>Brown. It was that day week after.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you gone by the name of Brown?</p>
               <p>Brown. I have a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>Brown. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say you never went by any other name but Brown?</p>
               <p>Brown. We people in our way go by a great many names.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your way?</p>
               <p>Brown. I have confessed myself to be bad, and I hope to atone for my past offences.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you carry this parcel to your own house, you say you live but in Petticoat-lane?</p>
               <p>Brown. We never carry things to our own houses, but to those that buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your house searched for these things?</p>

               <p>Q. Did they come?</p>
               <p>Alexander. Yes they did in about ten or fifteen minutes, Myers brought it, and put it upon a bulk at the corner of Barbicain, facing Long-lane, which is within sixty or seventy yards of Buckland's door; then Smith took the parcel and went up Long-lane with it, and bid us go to an alehouse, we went and called for a pint of beer, and asked what sign it was, they told us it was the boy's-play-thing; I went to Buckland, and told Smith where we were, when I found it was the whip and top.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the first parcel?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No, I suppose they had put that away; then I went back to the alehouse, and staid there about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Alexander.

               <p>Alexander. He had 2 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid him?</p>
               <p>Alexander. Brown did, then Smith went to his own habitation, and we three went through old Bedlam home.</p>
               <p>Smith. I never saw that man before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Alexander. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where you was going when they first engaged you to carry the parcel?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No, I did not think I was going to Buckland's, I thought I was to have gone to Smith's house.</p>

            , on Saturday night the 13th of May, to carry a load, I did not know what was in it; there were two parcels, a wrapper, and a bag; I took the bag; Lyon Alexander told me to carry it into Houndsditch; I took it from Sanders's house and carried it to the corner of Castle-yard, and pitched it on a bulk, Sanders had told me, I should see a gentleman standing there, he would receive it of me: I went and saw Mr. Brown standing there, I clapp'd it down, and went back, as Sanders had desired me, to fetch the other parcel that was in the wrapper; when I came there with the second load, Brown was there, he said I must go along with him, I went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the first load?</p>
               <p>Myers. That was gone when I came to the bulk the second time; I went with him to the end of Barbican, near the white bear, we staid about 5 or 6 minutes, then Alexander came, and another man with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that man's name?</p>
               <p>Myers. They told me his name was Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Look about, see if you can see him?</p>
               <p>Myers. I believe this is the man, (pointing to the prisoner Smith) he took the load, and where he went with I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you afterwards?</p>
               <p>Myers. We went into a publick house in Goswell street the sign of the whip and top, there Alexander, and I, and Brown sat drinking a pint of beer; afterwards Brown said to Alexander, go and let Smith know where we are; Alexander went and came back again and he said he had told him: we drank another pot of beer, and by and by Brown went out of the room for a few minutes; and afterwards Brown came in and called for a glass of rum and paid the reckoning, and we all went out together, and found Smith at the corner of Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Smith any thing about him?</p>
               <p>Myers. No, nothing but the bag and wrapper; as we went along Moorfields we were about twelve yards from Smith and Brown, we saw Brown receive some money of Smith; Brown gave me 2 s. and I thank'd him.</p>

            . I live in Deptford; Buckland came to my house in the beginning of June, but what day in particular I cannot say; at his first coming he said, he came away for being bound for a man for debt; after a little time he gave me occasion to inquire into his character, I found it not as he had told me.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion was it that you inquired into his character?</p>
               <p>Jones. He gave me leave to inquire into his character for particular reasons.</p>
               <p>Q. What reasons?</p>
               <p>Jones. He made love to a young woman in Deptford, that had some fortune, so he gave me leave to inquire into his character; after I had made some inquiry I talk'd with him, and he owned that this Brown and Smith had stolen a parcel of goods in White-chapel, and he bought them, and that was the reason he came away from his home: he said also, that there was a bill of indictment found against him the last sessions, and he came away to be out of sight; he wrote a letter to Mr. Cornelius, and to that end he applied to my daughter for some paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by at that time?</p>
               <p>Jones. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your daughter let him have some?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, she did not; he pull'd some out of his own pocket, he began to write while I was by, but I did not stay till it was finish'd, but my daughter did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he confess this before he quitted your house?</p>
               <p>Jones. He never quitted my house, for we soon had him taken; that is, the people that first brought him to my house did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he came away because he had bought, or because he was charged with having bought?</p>
               <p>Jones. He said he had bought goods of these men, and several other things besides that parcel; he gave the letter into my hand after he had wrote<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130056"/> it, for me to carry it to where it was directed; but I gave it to Mr. Bell.</p>

            . I am daughter to the last witness, Mr. Buckland was at her house, and one day he asked me to give him some paper, I said I would get up and give him some, he said I have some in my pocket which my man will know.</p>

               <p>Smith's defence.</p>
               <p>I am very innocent in the affair; I know nothing what they have been talking of; ask Robertson what time I came to his house.</p>
               <p>Court. That is Brown.</p>
               <p>Brown to the question. He came to my house on the Friday about 5 or 6 o'clock, he us'd to come about that time, being a proper time.</p>
               <p>Q. from Smith. What month was it?</p>
               <p>Brown. It was the 12th of May.</p>
               <p>Smith. I kept a publick house at the corner of Mutton-lane, this evidence said he was a watchmaker and lived in Ratcliff Highway, and his wife kept a chandler's shop there; he was by when the warrant was serv'd on me; I asked him if he would bail me? he said he would.</p>
               <p>Brown. We have done many such things as that.</p>
               <p>Smith. He told the justice he rented 14 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Brown. These are not the first schemes that you and I have been in.</p>
               <p>Buckland's defence.</p>
               <p>The porter Myers came to me when I was in the Compter, and said I am sorry for what I have done, for this prosecutor has offered me 5 l. to swear against you.</p>
               <p>Q. to Myers. Did you say to him as he relates?</p>
               <p>Myers. No, I never said such a word; no soul offer'd me a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the Compter to see him?</p>
               <p>Myers. I have been in the Compter to several prisoners when Buckland was there.</p>
               <p>Q. from Smith. Was not you brought into the Compter to see if you knew me? What did you say to my Lord Mayor?</p>
               <p>Myers. The first time I did not know him, because it was quite dark, on a Saturday night. When I came again Mr. alderman Cockayne was there, I told him that was the man; I did not see my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Buckland. I was recommended to court this Mrs. Jones's daughter, I made love to her, the father, mother and daughter gave it out so; she had had a sweetheart before, who told me something that wa s not agreeable; I told the old woman of her daughter's fault, and she desired me not to expose her daughter; and because I would not have her, they have done all this out of spite.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130057"/>Q. to Mrs. Jones. Do you give this evidence by way of resentment on the account of his usage to your daughter?</p>
               <p>Jones. Upon my oath I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he court your daughter?</p>
               <p>Jones. He came in pretence to do so, we had not known him 3 weeks.</p>

            . I live over against St. Clement's church, and keep a turner's and toy shop; on the 15th of April, 1754, there came a man in a brown livery, he offer'd a solitaire set round with diamonds to me, he said he did not know the value of it, but said it were diamonds: I had a gentleman in my house that was a jeweller, I carried it up to him, he said they was diamonds; I told the prisoner it was of great value, and I must stop it till he gave a good account how he came by it: he said a washerwoman found it in Grosvenor square, and gave it to him, and that he would bring the woman to me; he did not come, so I advertised it on the 22d of the same month; I advertised it three times in all, in the daily advertiser. Mr. Fielding, Mr. Welch, and Mr. Stuart came to my house about November the 4th, they ask'd to see the diamonds, I shewed them to them, they sealed them up and left them with me, and Mr. Fielding desired I would call upon him, and he would give me farther directions; I did: he told me to carry them to my lady Aston, saying they were hers. I delivered them to my lady and had a receipt of her. (The solitaire produc'd.) This is the same. I cannot swear that the prisoner is the man that brought it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stuart. I had this solitaire from my lady Aston about 3 weeks or a month ago, she is not in town now. The prisoner lived servant with my lady Ashton in 1754, and he wore such a livery as Mr. Shepherd has mentioned. I was with him before justice Fielding, and heard him confess that he found the solitare on the carpet of my lady's house.</p>
