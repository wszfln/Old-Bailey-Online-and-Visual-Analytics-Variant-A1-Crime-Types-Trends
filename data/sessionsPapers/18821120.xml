I have been in the Bank of England 23 years, and have been a cashier in the private drawing office over nine years—I have been accustomed to examine various signatures, and to judge of their genuineness—I have examined this letter and envelope of 9th October, and have no doubt they are both in the same writing—I have examined the signature "William Brookshaw" to the receipt, and also the two signatures "Rob.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the missing letter branch of the General Post-office, and was instructed to make investigations at the Western District Office, Vere. Street—I made up a letter addressed to Master J. Warren, High School, Cathedral Close, Salisbury, containing a sovereign, a shilling, and twelve penny postage-stamps, which had been previously marked—I posted the letter on the 11th November at 8. 45 a. m.—I had previously instructed Overseer Hoade at Vere Street—I then went to a part of the office where I could watch the letter, and saw Hoade place it on the sorting table of the South-Western Railway Division—the envelope was black-edged—Hoade then joined me; we were about sixteen or seventeen feet away from the table—some few minutes after<lb/>wards I saw Theobald go to the sorting table and collect the South-western Division letters, amongst which was this letter,(and he ran through them to see if there were any mis-sorts—he placed a black-edged letter, which was not a mis-sort, on the table to the left of him, and then showed it to junior letter carrier Semper, who was two feet away from him at the South-Eastern division of the same table, and had some conversation with Semper, and Theobald having made a further collection took the letters to the dispatch table—Semper then went to the sorting table and made a collection of letters from the South-Eastern Railway Division, which adjoins the South-Western Division—about 1 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day I saw Theobald in the private room of the Yere Street Post<lb/>office in the presence of Hoade and Police-constable Lord—I told Theo<lb/>bald who I was, and asked him his name, which he told me, and I said to him "This morning at a quarter-past 9 I posted a letter at this office con<lb/>taining coin and stamps, which I had marked; it was placed up to you, and it has been ascertained to be missing; what do you know about it?"—he replied "I know nothing about it"—I then instructed Lord to search him—there was nothing found on him relating to the charge—I said "You were seen by Mr. Hoade and myself to take the letter and show it to Semper and have a conversation with him, and then take the letter away from the table "—he replied "I deny it"—Lord was not in uniform—I said "Have you anything in your locker belonging to the</p>

               <p>General Post-office?"—he replied" No"—I said "Have you anything at your house belonging to the General Post-office?"—he said "Nothing at all"—I said "What has become of the letter?"—he replied "And I shall be arrested on the charge"—I said "It is for you to explain what has become of the letter"—he replied "Semper has taken the letter"—I said "What has he done with it?"—he replied "I don't know"—I said "Did you hand it to him?"—he replied "No, I went round and sorted it up for him to take "—I then went with Hoade to see Semper, whom I brought back to the office, and he was confronted with Theobald—I read over to Theobald the whole of a conversation which I had with Semper at 69, Essex Street—I said to Semper "The junior letter carrier Theobald states that he sorted the letter up to you, and that you took it"—he replied "Yes, I did; Theobald said to me 'Here's a coin letter, take it; I Will sort it up to you; I want halves'"—I said to semper "What hate you done with the letter?"—he replied "I have the money, but not the letter "—he then handed me a shilling and six penny stamps, and said "The sovereign and the six other stamps is at home in my box"—I said "Where is the letter and envelope?"—he replied "I burnt them "—he also said "As I was coming out of the office I said to Theobald 'What about this?' Theobald replied 'I shall see you to-night'"—Theobald said "I deny it"—I then said to Semper "you have heard Theobald's denial I what do you say to it?"—he said "What I have said is true; I am sorry I took this letter; Theobald has been tempting me to take letters for a long time, and one day previous this week he offered me a coin letter, which I refused, but I gave way this morning; I should not have seen the letter had not Theobald shown it to me "—I then gave them in custody to Lord, who took them to New Street Police-station—I weal with Lord to Semper's house, and found a sovereign and six penny stamps, which I identified as being the same I enclosed in the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Every night and day I believe there is an overseer in the sorting-room—there are between 20 and 40 sorters in the room—the dispatch table is parallel with the sorting table—the clerks work on both sides of the table—I was about some 10 or 11 feet from Theobald in a gallery which goes round the room—I was out of sight—Theobald had only one letter in his left hand and two or three in his right—if he had made a mis-sort it would have been his duty to have taken the letters back to the sorting-table—there is no partition between the sorters—very Often a sorter When in doubt would ask another what line a letter was on—it is not the first case I have been engaged in of this kind—it depended upon Theobald's reply whether I should give him in charge—the case had not been completed to my mind at the time I asked him the questions—I had questioned Theobald before I saw Semper, and he said, "I know nothing about the letter.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Between four and five only were at work at the dispatch table and 10 or 12 at the sorting table—there are six divisions of letters on the table, and there are six separate lots—each clerk should stand opposite six sets of letters—the letters which Semper and Theobald had to deal with were close together—a letter addressed to Salisbury, if found amongst the South-Western Bail way division, would not be a mis-sort; if amongst the South-Eastern division it would be a mis-sort—no one else but Theobald would have to deal with a Salisbury letter.</p>

               <p>of the General Post-office—on the 11th of this month, in consequence of instructions I received from Madder, I put a letter for the South-Western Railway division on the sorting table—it was Theobald's duty to deal with the letter—if a sorter has a coin letter amongst his letters it is his duty to dispatch it in the bundle amongst the ordinary letters—In company with Mr. Madder I was watching the sorting table, and I saw Theobald collect the letters from the sorting table and take it to the examining letter, and I saw him select the coin letter—I knew the coin letter by having a pink letter in front of it—Theobald placed the letter on his left hand and had a conversation with Semper, after which he took the letter away, and I did not see what became of it afterwards—if he found a mis-sort amongst his letters he would take it back to the sorting table—a South-Western Railway dispatch officer has no right to take a Salisbury letter to the sorting table—I was present when Mr. Madder had a conversation with Theobald, when he read over in Semper's presence Semper's statement to Theobald.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When letters are posted for various places they are all placed on one table and sorted by the sorters and letter-carriers—they go through several processes—this letter only passed through my hands before reaching No. 3 sorters' table of the South-Western division—if a clerk does not Know an address it is a common thing to ask another clerk where it is—every carrier undergoes an examination in discerning hand-writing—there is a space of 2 inches between the different heaps of letters—it is possible for a South-Western letter to get mixed up with the Great Western letters.</p>

C.—the prisoner has been in my service for some eleven years—on the 20th October the New Zealand came in, by which I was expecting a remittance from some clients of mine in Auckland, but none tame—subsequently I ascertained that the draft in question had been presented at the Bank of England—the endorsement at the back is not mine, nor is it an imitation of my handwriting—the figures written across the face are the prisoner's—I have no doubt about that—the prisoner had access to my letters.</p>

'He said he would, only he bad got a loose tooth, and he was going to pull it out. I said 'If you don't make haste and come out of that I shall come for you.

He said 'Yes, father, I will. 'He got under the bed. I said 'Why don't you light the fire, are you going to do it?' He said 'Yes, father, I will, but I must pull this tooth out. I picked up a boot and said 'If you don't come out of there I will very soon fetch you out,' and made as though I would throw it at him, when be jerked back his head, and I afterwards saw blood coming from him "—that was all he said; I did not make a note of it at that time; I did not think it right to detain him, but when the Coroner's Inquest returned a verdict of manslaughter, on 24th October, he was taken into custody—on the 25th I went to the room and examined the furniture and under the bed—I could not find any projection of any kind that could have inflicted the injury.</p>

                  </hi> the 13th October I was house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—on that day, about 1.20, the boy James Martin was brought there; he was very pale and almost collapsed—there was a small wound on the left side of the head, about half an inch long, about half an inch above the ear, slightly jagged—I afterwards ascertained it was about a quarter of an inch deep, with contusions round it—I sent him into the ward and made a further examination—I then found a small piece of brain matter oozing from the wound—I reported that to Mr. Davey, one of the head surgeons—the boy remained under our care till the 19th, when he died; he never regained consciousness—before he died, Mr. Davey, in my presence, removed a small piece of bone about the size of a threepenny or fourpenny piece, which had been driven into brain—upon a post-mortem examination I found the cause of death was meningitis, resulting from the wound—there was a wound an inch and a</p>

Spottis-woode's premises, 30 yards from the prosecutor's—he was handed over to two constables and taken to the station—he had no boots on—a pair of boots had been found in the bar, and were then at the station—he said "They are mine," and I gave them to him—he walked to the station without boots—the were all three charged with the burglary; they made no answer—I should say the premises had been entered from the fanlight—there was a lamp about fire or six feet from the ground which would facilitate a person active in climbing to get easily into the fanlight, which is the whole width of the door and revolving on two pins, opens half way, and leaves an aperture large enough for a man to get through.</p>

I am a carman, of 5, William Street, Rotherhithe—on the afternoon of 24th October last I was in charge of a timber van and three horses on the Archway Road—I was leading the first of the three, and the shaft horse being restive, the prisoner came up and offered to assist me—when we came to the Woodman Tavern I noticed blood running down the back of both front legs of the shaft horse—I said "How did this come?" he said "I should not have noticed it if you had not"—I went to the Wellington, where the prisoner left me—I then noticed that the mare was very bad, and took some water and bathed her legs—I went on till I got to a little farrier's shop just before you come to the White Lion; there I took the mare out—Parsons made a communication to me there, in consequence of which I looked for a constable, and we went and found the prisoner at Barnet.</p>

I never had any butter in my van!"—he refused to get down, and I got on the step of the van—Detective Collins came to my assistance, and we took Hunt into the passage of No. 81—we put them into two cabs, and on the way to the station Andrews said" If this fellow will bring this stuff to my house how am I to help it? why did not you let me pay for the stuff as I asked you?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreigner, and am a tailor, of 3, John Street, a Holborn—on 14th October, at midnight, I was tipsy in Cranbourne Street, and was going to call a cab to go home—the prisoner Taylor came up and said "If you don't mind I will see you home;" I said "Thank you, it is a very kind of you, but I know my way home myself," and walked on to St. Martin's Lane to get another cab, but Taylor came up again and said "It is no good looking for a cab, you won't get it; if you don't mind I will see you straight home"—I kept on walking—we crossed St. Martin's Lane by Seven Dials, and he took hold of my arm—I told him my address; he said "I know where you live"—before we crossed Endell Street I saw three or four young men coming towards us, kicking up a horrible row—I cannot recognise them—I felt a blow under my left ear and fell—I do not know who gave it me—I felt a hand in my pocket and screamed" For God's sake, what do you want of me, I have got nothing"—my recollection is that I had a sovereign, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, some tobacco, and some cigarette paper, and five tickets of the Amalgamated Watch Company for payments to the club—they were in a purse—a constable took Taylor.</p>

I live at 39, Linden Gardens, Notting Hill, and am secretary to the Prison Commissioners engaged at the Home Office—on 16th August I left town for my vacation—at that time Isabella Martin was my cook—I had received a good character with her, and she had been in my service four years; and, having my confidence, I left her in charge of the house and property—I had seen Patten once at my office—Martin had spoken to me about him, and asked me if I could get him some employment, and I got him employment as a warder at a prison—that was about 18 months ago—he remained in that employment for three months—on Friday, 22nd (September, I wrote to Martin from Ireland to let her know I was going to return home on Monday, the 25th—before I started on the 25th I received a telegram, which I have lost—it was from Martin, informing me that the house had been broken open on the Sunday night and property</p>

               <p>stolen—I returned that night, arriving on Tuesday morning, the 26th—when I got into the house I saw the sideboard in the back room broken open; despatch boxes broken open and their contents scattered about; the wine cellar door was broken open, and about three dozen of wine gone—I missed a very large quantity of property; the value of it was more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of the property I lost—on my arrival the condition of the principal rooms was such that no one could enter them without knowing at once that thieves had been at work—the cabinet doors were broken open and left open—in my wife's bedroom the doors were open and the drawers out—I spoke to Martin about it—she said "Everything was perfectly right when I left home on Sunday afternoon about 5.30 p.m.; when I came back about 9.30 the key would not open the door. I went for the gatekeeper, and he came and brought a policeman. Either the gatekeeper or the police<lb/>man, I won't be certain which, tried the door; and one or other of them, I won't be certain which, I think the gatekeeper, got over the area gate and found the scullery door open, which I had left locked"—on coming into the house she said she found things strewn about and doors and boxes broken, and in the pantry she found a jemmy, her sewing machine, an ulster, and a small salver, as though the thieves had been coming back again, was her suggestion—she gave me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and said she had written it on the Monday night; that the gatekeeper had promised to, call for it to post it, but had not done so.

               <p>"Yes"—the rooms were all in confusion—when we came to the pantry she said "Oh"—there was a cruet stand laid on the lift—the door of the wine-cellar had been broken open—we there found this iron bar, which the constable took charge of—the constable examined the house further—I went on duty that night at 7—the other man goes on duty from 10 to 1 on Sundays, and I go on from 7 till 12; no one is on duty from 1 till 7 on Sundays—I walked round the Gardens about three times, and I saw the gas burning in the kitchen—I went round once as soon as I came on, and then about 8 or 8.30—I noticed all quiet as usual.</p>

I live at 9, Horace Street—on this afternoon I saw Begley come out of No. 7, and walk down the street—the crowd was rather too much for Michael Fitzgibbon and his wife, and he took the pair of them and put them into their own house—then I saw a shower of stones, finger-beer bottles, cups, and other things come towards him, and after that I saw Mrs. Malone come up with a piece of rusty iron in her hand, and she made a hit at Begley, but hit the wall over his head—the crowd Ming out, "Go on, Mrs. Malone, hit him," and she made two hits, and to the best of my belief he got one on the head—he went into the crowd after that to save himself, and I saw nothing more of him till I saw him with the policeman; he got knocked down in the crowd—I did not see him strike Mrs. Malone—I saw her strike him twice—I could not say whether she was drunk or sober; she was betwixt and between.</p>

Where?"—he said "In No. 37, or rather they were there, but they have gone now"—I said "How is it; when did you see them?"—he said "I was here at 5 o'clock and lost several hundred pounds, and I find they have been cheating me at cards, and I want to arrest them"—I said "Do you know the men?"—he said "No, it is the first time I saw them"—I said "How did you come here, surely they did not bring you by force?"—he said "No, one of them was at my office this afternoon with a letter of introduction from New York"—I said "Well, if that is the case I have nothing to do with it; I will inquire whether they have paid their bill and taken their luggage away"—I sent for the porter, who had taken the luggage down, and I asked at the cashier's office whether the bill had been paid, and they said "Yes"—the prosecutor wanted to know the number of the cab which took them away, but we could not give him that—I said "I cannot help you in any way, as the party has paid the bill"—I left them in the hotel—he mentioned poker as the game, and wanted to explain to me how the trick was done, but I declined to listen because I did not want to be mixed up in the matter—the defendant has not lodged at the hotel before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at the police-court—I was called there but not examined as a witness—I saw rooms 37 and 38 were occupied, but I did not know by whom—I could only say from the books whether they slept there on the night of the 12th they were entered as Mr. Manes and another person—this conversation took place about 6.30 or 7 o'clock on the Friday—I understood Mr. Gompers to say that that was the first time he had seen the prisoner, and that the letter of introduction from New York was brought to him that afternoon—the inspector asked me to attend at the police-court, and a clerk gave me a subpoena to attend here to-day—I have not given any statement of my evidence to anybody.</p>
               <p>

I live at 20, Elm Road, Camden Town, and am hall porter at the Midland Hotel—on Friday, 30th October, the prosecutor came to me and asked to be shown to the prisoner's room—I went with him to No. 38; there was nobody there—there was a bottle of a whisky, three-parts full, on the mantelpiece—the prosecutor said "This is the table, this is the room, and this is the door we went</p>

I live at 26, High Street, York Road, and am a billiard marker at the Midland Hotel—on Friday, 13th October, I was in the billiard-room, and about 4.40 the prisoner came in and I played 50 up with him—at 5.40 the prosecutor came into the room, and when we had finished the game the prisoner said "Will you have a game of billiards?"—the prosecutor said "No, I don't care about it, I very seldom play; I don't care about the game"—he also declined to have a drink and a cigar, and the prisoner threw down a sovereign for me to take the money for the game, and said to the prosecutor "Come along upstairs"—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at Clerkenwell—I saw the prosecutor come downstairs about 6.15 or 6.30—I believe he was excited, but not in liquor; he leaned on the mantelpiece and said "Marker, do you know that gentleman who was playing you billiards?"—I said "No, only as a visitor. He is an Australian, isn't he?"—the prosecutor said "No, he is an American"—I said "Well, he don't speak the American tongue"—the prosecutor, in a sharp sort of way, said "Well, it don't matter to me what. he is, he has had me for 250 <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>"—I said "What? had you for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in what way?"—he said 11 At a game of poker"—I then said "I can't do anything for you, but I will fetch the hall porter," and I did.</p>

Bui worthy, pawnbroker, of 12, Aylesbury Street, Clerkenwell—on 26th October Kelly pawned 15 loose diamonds with me about 12 o'clock—he asked 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon them; I said I would lend him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per carat—he did not agree, and took them away—he returned about 3 p. m. with another man, named Cohen—one of them said he wanted to buy a lot of watches—Kelly said would I make the diamonds 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon weighing them I found they were over seven carats, and I agreed to lend 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 15 brilliants—the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes produced are part of the money I advanced—the stones were redeemed on the 27th by Mr. Aaron.</p>

I gave Kelly eight sovereigns and some bits of jewellery amounting to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and promised him if I was satisfied with the diamonds I would give him another 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I have a stone in pledge at Spinks's," and that the money I gave him would be sufficient to redeem it; he would meet me in a quarter of an hour's time, and show me the stone—he gave me the ticket for the 15 brilliants that I had paid for, and I went to fetch Mr. Izanscheim, and borrowed enough to repay the publican his 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after paying that Kelly came there with the stone—I weighed the stone, and gave him 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I afterwards gave it to the inspector—I took the ticket to Mr. Bulworthy's, and redeemed the</p>

I said" The notes you received from the pawnbroker were found on Miller when he was arrested, and he says he received them in payment for some loose stones sold the day of his arrest"—he made no reply to that—afterwards in the cab on the way to the police-station he said "I saw Miller a few weeks ago in the Strand; he was driving a cab, and he looked very bad; I hired him to take me and my wife to Ludgate Hill; before that I had not seen him for several months"—I took him, and he was formally charged.</p>

I am a German, I can speak English—I live at the Black Bull in Old Montague Street, Whitechapel—I was formerly journeyman to Mr. Stanger, at 186, Lever Street, St, Luke's—I was then as a journeyman before Mr. Stanger purchased the business in 1879—up to that time it had been carried on by Jacob Kents—Mr. Stanger carried on the business continuously until November last year—on Saturday evening, 12th November, I saw him at 5 or 10 minutes to 12 o'clock, at midnight—there were three other master bakers along with him, the prisoner, Mr. Kramer, and Mr. Lentz—Mr. Kramer has since died—I have seen Mr. Lentz since—the three did not come into the house—I heard him say "Good night" and the three went home, and he came into the shop—I did not see him again, I went to bed—I did not see him go to bed—my bedroom is on the second floor, at the top of the house—Mr. Stanger's was on the first floor—Mrs. Stanger was at home when he came in—besides Mr. and Mrs. Stanger only me and another <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named Peter slept in the house—Peter works for Mr. Lentz now—next morning I had a conversation with Mrs. Stanger, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's house in St. John Street Road—he was a master baker there, and lived there with his wife—I first saw the prisoner's wife, and afterwards saw the prisoner—I told him that Mrs. Stanger wanted to see him, and to come down directly—he said, "I will be there directly"—I then went back, and shortly after the prisoner came, about 9.30 or 10 o'clock in the morning—I saw him there till 2 o'clock, and then from 7 o'clock in the evening till 12 o'clock—he stopped there that night—I did not see Mr. Stanger that day, I have never seen him since—on the Monday morning 1 saw the prisoner there, he was baking the bread, attending to the business—about half-past 4 o'clock I said to him, "How is the master?"—he said, "Very ill—he did not say where he was—the prisoner helped in the business from that day till I left in May this year—I afterwards went back again—he did not live in the house at first, he was always there in the night for the first few days—hewent home in the afternoon—he slept there at night, in the parlour—of course he had to help at night in the bake-house—Mrs. Stanger continued in the house—the shop was painted and the name changed from Stanger to Stumm—I think that was in April—I remember the prisoner being taken into custody—I was in Lever Street that evening, working there—Elizabeth Harvey, the servant, was there—we called her A lice—I saw her in the bakehouse about half-past 7 or 8 o'clock that evening—there was a gas lamp in the bakehouse—I saw her holding this paper (<hi rend="italic">a mortgage deed</hi>) under the gas, to burn it; it was burnt as it is now—she was. obliged to go into the shop to serve customers, and she pushed it under the trough in the bakehouse—there was a space there under which it could be</p>

I saw the prisoner again at the shop in Lever Street—he asked me if I had a received a letter from Germany or from Kreuznach, I don't remember which—I can't say whether he said from whom, but he led me to believe it came from Stanger—I said "Oh, yes"—he then spoke about the sending of the flour, and I promised to send it—the letter complained about my not sending the flour, and hoped that by this time I would have delivered at least 50 sacks, and the prisoner said "Well, send them on at once," and I agreed to do so——I did not send it—about the end of February or the beginning of March the prisoner called at my place—he said that Stanger had borrowed 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a man named Clark on mortgage, and he said he had had the brokers in and had to pay the 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get the lease back and get the brokers out—he said "That 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave him to mind and to put in his safe he has gone away with"—some time in April I offered a reward for the discovery of Stanger, and advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> on 24th April—I endeavoured all I could to And him—I was one of the executors under his will, and Mr. Evans was the other—I communicated with the police-on 28th July this year Mr. Evans and I proved Stanger's will—the personalty was sworn under under 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original will containing Stanger's genuine signature—it is dated 28th July, 1881—the date of the probate is 20th July, 1882—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a mortgage deed from Stanger to Gooderson of the other premises; it has Stanger's genuine signature.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first charge that was brought was forging this cheque, which had been paid through Stanger's bank, the clerk believing it to be Stanger's signature—I saw the prisoner write this, "Franz Felix Stumm"—I heard him say that he endorsed the cheque in his shop—I find on the back of the cheque "F.F. Stumm"—in my opinion it is in the same handwriting as the Franz Felix Stumm—I think the "U.N. Stanger" is in the same handwriting—the body of the cheque is similar to the prisoner's handwriting—I got these four letters and two envelopes from the prisoner's mother-in-law, Mrs. White or Knight, of St. James's Road, Holloway.</p>

Clark" was there then; I did not notice—I do not know who wrote that—I see it now for the first time—I have not noticed it before—after the person signed the deed I left it in the parlour, and the prisoner took it afterwards, I don't remember whether it was the same day or two or three days after—I don't remember the day of the month, or the month—I don't know whether it was December; to the best of my belief it was—I don't exactly know how long it was after Stanger went away; I should think it was about a month after—I left the house in the beginning of March—I don't know who put the pencilling on this parchment—I do not know Mr. Jones, the solicitor—I don't know who got the parchment</p>

               <p>prepared—I heard my husband talk about making a mortgage for the prisoner for the money he had lent him—whether it was this I don't know; I did not read it—the prisoner never told me that he had been to Mr. Jones and got the parchment prepared—I do not know how much money my husband had in the bank when he went away—I had nothing to do with drawing it out after he had gone—the weekly takings in the business were about 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have took that in August or September last year—the prisoner and my husband went abroad together—I can't tell the date they returned; I believe it was the end of August—they came from Kreusnach—they are both natives of Kreusnach—after my husband went away this time the prisoner managed the business—I left all the business matters to him—he was at Lever Street—he went home, he did not exactly live there, he slept there—he stayed in the daytime, but not in the afternoon, he went away in the afternoon—I have been married 13 years—I had a child on 6th October this year; that was my only child—I wrote these letters—the prisoner wrote this direction, "F. F. Stumm, 136, Lever Street, St. Lukes "—I wrote the word <hi rend="italic">u</hi> Address"—the prisoner wrote the whole of the address "Mr. L. Hoffman"—the prisoner was not present when I wrote the letter—I done it for the best I—I thought I was doing it for the best, for the creditors to get their money—I fastened the envelope up—I did not enclose any letter in it, I am sure of that—the letter says, "Put this letter in the post, for the Suabian need not know where I am; for I have already lost enough through such scamps"—I wrote that—I did not enclose a letter; I cannot explain it, I don't know the meaning of it—<hi rend="italic">u</hi> the Suabian "means Hoffman—I don't know who I meant when I wrote that—1 could not tell whether I wrote it of my own accord, or. whether it was dictated to me—it was not dictated to me by the prisoner, I done it on my own account; I don't know what it means—I introduced the name of the Suabian because Mr. Geisen owes me a lot of money; I suppose that is what it means—I meant him when I wrote those words—1 wrote the letter of 9th January, including the signature of my husband—the prisoner was not present when I wrote it—the "dearest George" means Mr. Geisel—I only wrote those letters—I do not know anything about other letters.</p>

                  </hi>. I was examined at Guildford in July last as a witness on the trial of Hall. The South Eastern Railway Company—that was an action for negligence by a collision alleged to have occurred on 1st March—I had not seen the accident—I heard of it about a month before the trial from a Mr. Farmer—two or three days after I met Farmer he and I met Kingwell near Aldridge's—Farmer said "Here is Charley Hill," and Kingwell said to me "Do you want to be on the <hi rend="italic">job?</hi>"—I said I did not understand what it was about—he told me it was a trap that met with an accident in the Waterloo Road with one of the South Eastern Railway vans; that an omnibus was standing at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188211200117"/>
               <p>corner of York Road, letting down passengers, and a cab was passing the head of the horse, and the trap was coming out of Stamford Street, the bus standing there prevented him from crossing to go to the Waterloo Station; that he pulled up at the rest in the middle of the road, the South Eastern van was coming from Waterloo Bridge racing Carter and Paters; n's van, and was going at a great speed; it being rather slippery he could not pull up; that the horse slided, and the van caught the trap under the seat where the driver was sitting and upset it; that King well took the driver over to the doctor's and afterwards to the hospital—if I was asked if I knew the man who took him I was to say I did not, but he was a big man, and if the case was won there would be a sovereign a day—we said we did not understand the case, and King well said "Well, come over to my house and I will show you," and we went to his house in St. Martin's Lane—he said "Have you got a piece of paper? and I will draw a plan so that you can see"—I said "No, but I have got a pocket-book," which I gave him, and he drew this plan in it" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I tore this leaf out afterwards and gave it to Mr. Bendall, of the South-Eastern Railway Company—Farmer said to Kingwell "I do not quite understand it now, Fred "—Kingwell called him to the window and said" Look here, why you are like a chump of wood, you do not seem to understand the case at all; do not you see it as plain as possible 1 here is the trap, here is the van, there is Carter and Paterson's van, there is the 'bus," and so he described it all—I will show you by the book—he said "It is as plain as possible; the van was racing down from Waterloo Bridge, a 'bus was standing opposite the Waterloo Hotel, a cab was passing the horse's head, the trap was obliged to pull up at the rest through the 'bus and the cab being there, the South-Eastern van coming down at such a pace that the driver could not pull up his horse in time, or else there was plenty of room for him to pass in the rear of the van, caught the trap under the driver's seat, and upset them, and took them to the doctor's "—he repeated what he said before, and said "Here is York Road, here is the agent's, there is the doctor's, and it is quite plain for you to understand "—then we walked towards Long Acre, where we met E. L. Levy—Kingwell said to him "Here are two gentlemen, witnesses for Hall"—Mr. Levy bowed and gave Kingwell some money—Kingwell took us to a public-house and treated us, and then said "I must be off, I have got to go to Walworth,"so we wished him good-day and came away from the public-house—after that we went into Mr. Levy's office, at 3, Long Acre—the name on the door was Micklethwaite and Co.—we went in and saw E. L. Levy—it was about 2.30, and about an hour after I first met Farmer—Levy said "You gentlemen have come to make a statement in the case of Hall v. The South-Eastern Railway"—Farmer said "Yes, we have," and made the statement as Kingwell had told him, and Mr. Levy corrected him in several things—we sat near the fire, Mr. Levy was walking about the room, and a boy took down the statement from Farmer—when Farmer got to the part where the van ran into the trap Farmer said that the horse in the trap was leaning on the posts of the rest, and E. L. Levy said that it must have been farther than that because there was plenty of room for the van to pass between the rear of the trap and the kerb—he spoke principally to Farmer, and Mr. Levy asked the boy to read over what he had written down, and he corrected the boy and told him what to put down; it was slightly different—he said "I remember</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188211200118"/>
               <p>the horse's head in that position,"and E. L. Levy said" No, it could not have been; there was plenty of room for the van to go to the rear of the trap"—the boy read it oyer to Mr. Leyy, who corrected it, and told him to put down that the trap was farther on the rest—Farmer then went on with Mr. Levy's assistance—he corrected him in several things, I can't say what, and he said "You be careful, now, and don't make any mistake"—he wrote down something at the bottom of Farmer's statement, and said "Will you sign here, Mr. Hill?"—this is my signature.

Brown made his statement in my presence—he said "Yes" or "No" to the questions put to him—I answered the questions put to me about the accident, which I said I had seen—my statement was taken down and has been read to-day—nothing was said at Levy's to inform him that that what Brown and I said was not true, that I am aware of—I don't know what I took the two respectable men to Levy's for—I should not have cared whether they were respectable or not if five shillings was to be got by it—I would not have taken them there if I had known it was to commit perjury, nor for any price—I signed what Brown had said as true—I had no thought at the time—I said "Yes" or "No," whichever was wanted—I did not know whether it was true or false—I should have gone to Guildford and committed perjury if it had not been found out' before—I had seen Mr. Bendall three days before I went to Guildford, and told the truth—I do not believe that after seeing him I went to Levy's office to ascertain when the case was coming on—Mr. Bendall knew from me that I was going to turn round in the witness box and say I had not seen the accident—I went to Ashford—I did not enjoy myself, as I could have done something better at home—I was told something very like this, that if I did not turn round I should get my head in a rope—I was not promised a job on the railway, but people said "You will get paid for this affair "—I have only had my bare expenses—I had five shillings a day at Bow Street, and I have had half a sovereign—I had eight days' and five days' lodging, but that is a long while ago; I forgot that.</p>

I was employed in Stamford Street, five minutes' walk from where the accident took place—the Glasshouse was the nearest public-house, and I used it of an evening—I do not know where I was on the night of 1st March, but I believe I was at work—I did not know the name of the injured gentleman till I got to Levy's office—Brown said, "Why, you know all about it; come with me to the office and I will put you where you can get something"—I had told him that I had not seen the accident—I believe he had described it to me, and I said, <hi rend="italic">"Jack,</hi> you had better describe it to me again, because I did not see</p>

I said "I do not mind," and we had one at the Cranbourne Hotel, St. Martin's Lane—the next day I went and told him that it was possible I should lose my work if I did not go; he said if I could get another man I should be well paid, and paid handsomely, for following the case up and keeping with him—he said no doubt we should have to go to Guildford on the Monday—I told him I preferred my work to anything else—that was Saturday; Dudley was with me; Levy asked me why he did not go upstairs—I said Dudley was ill and had just come from Ventnor Convalescent Hospital, and his breath was too bad to come up the stairs—he said "Poor fellow, I will go down and see him "—he went down and spoke to Dudley, and we all three went into the Cranbourne Hotel and had some ale—I had a shilling from Levy three times out of four—I received this subpoena—this letter was left at my house.

I am a labourer, of 3, North Road, Woolwich—I went with Lewis, Telling, Wright, and Ramsay to 3, Long Acre—we waited an hour and saw the elder Levy and Henry Levy—I went there because Lewis asked me if I wanted a job—Henry Levy was at a desk writing, and saying every three or four minutes "Is that right?" arid we was a-saying "Yes—he was writing something about the accident in the Walworth Road—</p>

I am a lithographic printer, of Listock Place, Walworth—I have known the elder Levy five or six years—I knew him in the office of Cooper and Co., in Leicester Square, and also at Micklethwaite's, at 3, Long; Acre—I only knew Micklethwaite by seeing him there occasionally—I heard from the elder Levy about the accident in the Walworth Road between a tramcar and a brougham on Good Friday—he first told me about it a few days before the trial at Guildford—he told me that at the office—I don't know whether any one else was present—there might have been—he did not explain the accident to me at all—he said could I send him some one to witness an accident that occurred in the Walworth Road, that a gentleman's brougham or carriage which had been broken up by a tramcar, I think he said on Good Friday—I said I did not know, I would see—that was all the conversation that took place about it—when near home I saw the witness Lewis—I told him if he went over there he would get something to do—I might have said a job, or something of that sort—Lewis said he would go over on the morrow—I said, "I am going, and you can come with me," but I was too ill to go—I wrote on a piece of paper for him to go to Mr. Levy, but that I was too ill to go; I would come on the morrow—I was going on my own business—I gave Lewis the paper in the street—I can't say whether any one was with him—I met him next morning, and said I would go at 4 o'clock—I met him again at the end of East Street, Walworth Road—Filien, Fillmer, or Wright were with him—I had never seen either of them before to my knowledge—we all four went together to 3, Long Acre—there was only a clerk there—after some time the elder Levy came in, and, I believe, Daniel Levy followed—he sent us all into an inner office, where I saw the elder Levy, Daniel Levy, and a clerk who I did not know—I knew nothing whatever about the accident with the brougham and the tramcar, or of any one being injured, before going to the office—the clerk was told by the elder Levy to take down the statements from the witnesses; and Lewis made a statement, which was written down—he gave a description of the accident, and the clerk wrote</p>

Levy was then his managing clerk, and I have been associated with him ever since—he told me he was an admitted attorney—Mr. Fisher died in 1878, I think in June, and I continued his business in the name he had adopted, Fisher, Mickle-thwaite, and Co.—my name appeared in the firm before his death—Mr. Levy continued with me till the end of 1878, when our professional re-lationship ceased, but it began again in the beginning of 1881—during that period we had accident cases, I should say about ten, but the greater part of our business was commercial—the business was carried on at first at 28, Leicester Square, and it was transferred to 3, Lone; Acre at Christmas 1878—Mr. Ness the coachbuilder was my landlord—I first spoke about discontinuing the business in Long Acre in May, but I did not actually separate myself from it till June this year—Levy had a commission in respect of actions carried on in my office, which were won, which amounted to about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he received 20 per cent, on the net profits, the net costs on business actually introduced by him—I knew the general bearing of the actions, but I did not take any active part in the conduct of common law proceedings—I personally left the office in May, but I went there occasionally afterwards to obtain the winding-up of our affairs, and I certainly did make a few appointments there last June—I wish to correct myself; I made a mistake at the police-court—the first intimation of any severance was mentioned in May—the under-standing was that I was to withdraw myself entirely from the business carried on at Long Acre under the style of Micklethwaite and Co., but that certain actions which were then set down for trial should still be carried on in the name of the firm, and when they were disposed of a final settlement should be made, and I should have nothing further to do with the business in act, name, or deed—there was an action of Hall <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The South-Eastern Railway, Proud <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Smith, Perry <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Arbuthnot, and Wright <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The Tramways Company—I have seen Mr. May to-day; he is the clerk to the solicitor—I know there was an action against the South-Eastern Railway, but I cannot tell you the name of the plaintiff—I did not know it till after I was examined at Bow Street-—I don't recollect it—I did not know of the proceedings in Wright <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The Tramways Company, except that it was set down for trial or ready to be set down—</p>

Levy's account, but whether the cheque was I don't know—I was very little at the office at the time, but to the best of my belief the costs were paid to his account as well—I do not know how the costs or the damages were paid—Levy was to get a commission of 20 per cent., and short of that the other professional costs would go to me after payment of stationery, clerks, and rent—I might not receive the money for weeks after—we used to make settlements occasionally, and say there was so much due to me and so much to Levy—I was the proprietor of the business, but the business could not wait for my coming up to order a ream of paper—I mean that Levy paid me sometimes out of a gross sum which he had received as costs and damages, and deducted what he had paid on behalf of the business—we used to have settlements when money of any amount was received—I know of no payments to Kingwell on behalf of the firm; none were made by my authority, nor do I know of any made to him by E.L. Levy—I believe I have seen Kingwell, but I do not think I saw him more than once till I saw him at Bow Street—there is no mistake about that—I never saw him at my office—I don't know of an action in the Mayor's Court carried on in my name in which Brown and Kingwell were or were to be witnesses—in the ordinary course Levy would not tell me if they were.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I first saw this letter ten days ago—the first entry of it is June 8; that was after my arrangement with E.L. Levy—this book was got for the very purpose that it should be a fresh book under the different arrangement, so that Micklethwaite and Co. should not come into the fresh business at all—I always signed "William Micklethwaite and Co. "—I understood in June that this book was got few Mr. Moody, who was going to take over the business, and Levy said "I have got fresh books, a fresh letter-book for actions which are in initiation;"I said" Let those actions go on which are to be complete for trial, and we will send up the whole thing when they are done "—I wrote those letters, and gave them to the clerk to copy, but I never saw the letter-book—I was only carrying on the business at Long Acre in those two matters—they were personal clients of my own—I did not carry on the business in Long Acre after June, personally—I merely wrote a letter or saw a person there—I carried on my business at my private address at Brixton—I had London clerks and Brixton clerks—when I went to Long Acre I went into the inner room which Levy and his son Henry used—there was another private room that was mine; no one else used it till Mr. Moody came—he is a solicitor, and carried on my business in his own name—he came the end of July or the beginning of August—he had been there some time when I took my papers from the drawers of my table—I had a great many private papers and business papers in half a dozen matters which were pending, besides my own family papers—one was a Mayor's Court action, and nothing was done in the others—one was a mere matter of correspondence as to calling in some mortgage money—this letter of 24th June is not written by me—I signed it, but I can't say that I signed it on 24th June—I never wrote any letter in duplicate which appears in the book—I never saw the book till within the last 10 days, and I think it is within a week—I believe it was last Friday—Mr. E. L. Levy had it brought to him specially in the House of Detention at my request, to show to me because I wished to refresh my memory—to the best of my knowledge I never signed my name in blank in my life, but I may have been foolish and not known what I was doing—I have carried on business at Brixton since June 1 this year—I did not know that the writ in the tramcar case was issued by Micklethwaite and Co. of 3, Long Acre, solicitors for the plaintiff, till I returned to the office on 12th June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of last witness on this Friday afternoon, 18th August, about half-past 3,1 heard a noise in the parlour, as if something had fallen—I came downstairs and leant over the banisters and heard a kind of suppressed groan—I was going to fetch the prisoner's daughter Caroline, and met her coming in at the back door—I spoke to her, and she opened the parlour-door and I went in and saw the prisoner in the act of cutting his throat, and his wife was lying by the side of him; he was lying almost close to her, leaning on his elbow—I saw he had something in his hand, but I cannot tell what it was—I saw no more; I left and called for help; the police and the doctor came soon afterwards—I had not seen the prisoner or his wife during the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a quiet, inoffensive man—we saw very little of him generally—six or seven weeks ago his wife's father and mother came up from the country—for the last two months the prisoner and his wife were not on good terms, but until then we never Knew that they disagreed—we never heard of any disagreement until after the father and mother came up, and then she had a blow in the face—that was about two months before this happened, on the day her father and mother went back to Portsmouth—her face was tied up; she said it was toothache, but the bandage came off and I saw that she had a black-eye—she did not tell me that he had struck her till I asked her, and then she equivocated—she said very little at first, and I aaid I believed it was so, and she said it was a blow—I said "I did not think your husband ever struck you," and she said "He was in a very great passion"—she said no more than that—she was a virtuous woman—they frequently quarreled</p>

               <p>after that blow, but I never knew what about; they never came out of their room, and she never complained—she was a very inoffensive, un-complaining woman, she said very little—I saw none of the quarrels, I beard them several times; I was in the kitchen and they were in the parlour, and I could hear it very plainly—the prisoner was never in the habit of making any noise, we never knew whether he was in the house or out until they quarrelled—he was always verv quiet, he went in and out and we never came much in contact with him—he always kept out of the way—I was rather afraid of him when I heard them quarrelling—I could not so in to see what was the matter; I could not interfere in it—I never had an opportunity of judging whether he was subject to fits of excitement; we always considered him peculiar, because he always avoided us and kept out of the way, he never came out—I never heard him talking or muttering to himself.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter, and am 15 years old, my sister is seven—we lived with father and mother at 2, Tustin Street—on Friday, 18th August, father and mother were at home—I was in the same room with them—father had been at home all the morning, in the parlour at the back of the shop—they had been quarrelling in the morning—I saw him kiss her and pat her on the head—I went out about 12 o'clock or a little later, and returned in about an hour—I met Mrs. Dennington at the end of the passage, she said something to me, and I went and opened the parlour door and saw both father and mother lying with their heads to wards the fireplace and blood between them—I screamed out and Mrs. Dennington came in, and then Mr. Bennington.</p>

I am a surgeon in practice in the Old Kent Road—on Friday, 18th August, I went to Tustin Street, between 3.30 and 4 o'clock—in the back room behind the shop I saw the prisoner and his wife on the floor—the woman was quite dead when I arrived; with her throat cut—the cut extended from two inches behind the left ear, right across the side of the neck in front, and an inch beyond the centre of the throat—at the right side it was only a skin cut, very super-ficial—before that it had severed the jugular vein and the carotid artery and the muscles—considerable force must have been used—if a knife had been used by somebody from behind and drawn right across it would account for the injury I saw—I came to the conclusion it was not a self-inflicted wound, from its severity, and because it went so far back—she died from loss of blood from the wound—I examined the prisoner—he had a wound on his throat about four inches long, almost immediately underneath the jaw—it had slightly cut the windpipe, but not sufficiently deep to sever the large arteries—there was not very much bleeding from that—I think that was a self-inflicted wound—he complained of the cold—I attended to him, and next day ordered him to be removed to the hospital.</p>

I have known the prisoner about two years and have worked with him—I always noticed that he was in a very depressed condition—ha earned very good money, but several times when I asked him how he was he said that he felt very low, and did not feel capable of lifting himself up, as if there was a very heavy cloud hanging about him—about a month before this he told me that he was a very eccentric tort of a man, and in the habit of walking his room of a night foaming at the mouth and roaring like a lion—he has often told me he should turn into a suicide—he was of a gentle, affectionate disposition—he professed to be a natural doctor, but phrenology was the principal thing—whatever you got into conversation about he would fall back upon phrenology.</p>

I live at 37, George Road, Inman Road, and am a fallow-workman with the prisoner—I noticed something strange about him four years ago—he made peculiar remarks, and his ways were very eccentric—he said that he had healing powers, and if the authorities of Brompton Hospital would allow him, he could cure all the patients there, and that he believed in phrenology, and that was his greatest study, and he showed me this circular of his (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the subject, and other papers as well.</p>

               <p>it was done on the impulse of the moment"—I asked him whether he and his wife had been on friendly terms together; he said "Yes"—I asked if ho could mention any single individual with whom he could accuse his wife of infidelity; he said "No"—I asked him on what grounds he arrived at the conclusion as to the adultery; he said "From certain observations which she made occasionally"—I asked him to illustrate what he meant, and after thinking a few seconds he said that one day while at the theatre with his wife she exclaimed, alluding to one of the actors on the stage, "What a fine-looking man that is," and ho returned home and imagined that that actor had been carrying on intrigues with his wife—I then questioned him as to his wonderful powers of cure; he said that he was able <hi rend="italic">to</hi> cure all diseases, and that his attention was always absorbed in considering the ways and manners of society, that he had visited the South Kensington Museum, and had seen there the bust of Oliver Cromwell, and in consequence of the similarity existing between it and himself he was destined to be as great a man in history as Oliver Cromwell had been—I noticed that he was constantly muttering to himself, and he informed me that he was jealous and suspicious, and never could get on with his fellow-workmen because they were always complaining against him, that he had suffered very much from want of sleep, and frequently during the night he would get up and wander about the room, that he had contemplated committing suicide on several occasions, but had never made any actual attempt to destroy himself—from my examination I believe him to be a person of unsound mind decidedly—I have heard nothing in the course of the trial to alter that opinion, it strengthens it—the second examination which I made with Dr. Sparkes was very much the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Greenwood, the prisoner's Counsel, applied to me to attend here to-day for the purpose of seeing a man who was supposed to be insane, and who was going to be tried for murder—I do not think he knew who I was, and I did not tell him—I conversed with him about 20 minutes at each time, and that was quite sufficient for me to say that he is of unsound mind—he certainly knows that he is on his trial for the murder of his wife, and that it is necessary for him to defend him-self on that charge, and to excuse himself for it and explain it, but I do not think he had the least idea that I was examining him to test his mental condition—I do not think he has sufficient sense to make sug-gestions for his defence—I said "Had you any reason for committing the act?" I did not say what act, he knew perfectly well that I meant the act of killing his wife—I think I said "motive," not "reason," and I think he said "I committed the murder "or" act, "but it is immaterial," in consequence of the adultery of my wife"—I did not conclude from that that he was insane—I believe he suspected her, and that there was no cause for it—being suspicious without proper cause is not evidence of insanity, taken by itself—perfectly sane men often have a suspicion of their wives having committed adultery—if he had a suspicion of it that would be a motive for his being angry with her, so that there is nothing in that, nor is there anything in his statement that he had the power of curing all diseases—he might be merely a vain quack boasting of his power—I do not see any sign of insanity in that—I consider that his saying that he was destined to be as great a man as Oliver Cromwell is a sign of insanity—if he fancied he could cure diseases which other people</p>

               <p>could not, and so make a great man of himself in his own imagination, I should consider him more insane, and if he believed lie could do it that would increase his insanity—I decidedly mean to represent that as cogent evidence of insanity—I attribute importance to his jealousy and suspicion, with the other symptoms of muttering to himself, and the ideas of greatness—I have known plenty of sane men who have not committed suicide, but who have attempted to—I do not believe that every man who attempts to take his own life is insane; it is not evidence of insanity by itself—I also base my opinion on his idea that people were plotting against him so that he could not get on with his work—I thoroughly believe that he attacked his wife and killed her because he suspected she had committed adultery, and that he took her life to punish her for her misconduct; it is a very common form of innocent suspicion.</p>

I am a dock clerk at Butler's Wharf—the prisoner was a labourer there on this Saturday I was speaking to the foreman, and saw Hodder two feet from the edge of the river, and the prisoner gave him a push with both hands in his back, and he went out into the water—I called to Matthews, who was in our boat, and he got Hodder out of the water in three minutes, but he went down twice, and was going down a third time, when he was saved—it was the main river, where the tide ebbs and flows, and it was 18 feet deep—the prisoner was given in custody, but he disappeared for a time, and when I turned again he was at work.</p>

                  </hi>.I am a leather merchant, of 89, Weston Street, Bermondsey—in June, 1881, I had us my partner William Cooper—on the 7th of that month the prisoner called on me, and said he came to buy some leather, and wished to see some—he gave me a card, and said he was a shoe manufacturer, and gave his address as Warner Place, Hackney Road, and Nicholl Square, Hackney Road—he selected a parcel, which was to be sent to Warner Place—he wanted credit for a week or so, to which I agreed, subject to his reference being satisfactory—he gave me the name of Marshall and Ray, of whom I made inquiries, which were not satisfactory—he called on us again, when Mr. Cooper saw him, and he gave him a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was dishonoured—I think we supplied him with goods to the amount of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I sent in a van with a clerk named Cranshaw—he left the goods against instructions—I told him to be at the prisoner's premises before 9 the next morning—at about 11 o'clock the prisoner came and asked if we had received the cheques—I said "No"—he said "They were posted, and ought to have arrived"—Mr. Cooper asked him to give us another, and when the others came he would cancel them—the prisoner said he could not give another cheque, that he was going up the Kent Road, and would call back in the afternoon, and if we had not received them then he would give us another—about 3 o'clock I went to his place in Hackney Road—he was not there, and I saw his brother—I waited until alter bank hours, and then returned—later in the day I sent my clerk to Nicholl Square, his private address—he went rather late, and we had left our office—next morning I received this letter: "I waited for the arrival of the goods until I could not wait</p>

                  </hi>. I was at one time in partnership with the last witness, and was so on the 8th June, when I had an interview with the prisoner, who had been to our premises the day before—he asked why the goods which he bought on the previous day were not delivered—I told him we had not had the necessary reference—he then bought a parcel of Australian size, and gave us this cheque on delivery for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was honoured, and the next day the prisoner called again—I told him his reference was not satisfactory, and he would have to pay cash, and I promised an extra discount of 21/2 per cent., which he agreed to, and ordered the goods which were sent that day in the custody of Cranshaw—I saw him again on the morning of the 10th, when he said he had posted the cheque—I had not received it, and offered to cancel it if it came, provided he gave me another then—he declined, and loft—I saw no more of him or my goods—I saw his wife about two or three months after, when she came to me.</p>

From information I received I went to Hackney Road and saw the prisoner at about 8 o'clock on the evening of the 6th of last month—I said "Is your name Nathan Hemerson?"—he said "No "—I said "Oh yes it is; you know me"—he said "I do not know you, but my name is Hemerson, and what about it?"—I then said "I am a detective officer, and I hold a warrant for your arrest for wilfully and fraudulently obtaining a large quantity of leather from Messrs. Cooper, of Russell Street, Bermondsey, and I will read it to you if you wish"—he said "I do not wish you to; I know all about it. Are you aware that my wife called on Mr. Cooper about two months ago, and he has given her a written statement to the effect that he will not prosecute me, and on those conditions I have returned from America?"—I served a summons at the address of the prisoner's brother—he did not appear, and a warrant was granted, but we have not been able to trace him—1 had a transaction with Mendoza about five years ago.</p>

I am an engineer, of 1, Larcher Terrace, Victoria Docks—before June, 1881, I had saved some money, and had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to invest—about that time J saw an advertisement in <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper</hi> for a manager of an off licensed house—I went to the address indicated, and saw the prisoner—I said I had come about the advertisement—he said he had three or four houses, and he took me and showed me one at 33, Win<lb/>ster Terrace, Maxted Road, Feckham—it was then occupied—I saw the bar and the adjoining room—the name up was "Sydney Johnson, licensed to sell beer, not to be drunk on the premises"—there was not much fitting a deal counter and a rail for the casks, no beer-engine—I said, "Who does the house belong to? who is the landlord?"—he said, "It is my own, and if 1 was going to sell it I should want 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it," and "I have three or four more you can see, and have the choice of which you like "—he pointed to a plot of ground at the corner of the street and said, "That is mine, on which I intend to build a tavern; when I have done that I shall shut this up, take the licence from it, and put it to the new"—I made an arrangement and met him again two or three days after at Cyprus Terrace—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit; this is his receipt—when I next met him I paid him 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is his receipt of June 18,1881—I paid him the remaining 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I took possession on 22nd June—some beer was in the house—I made him two payments for beer as he got it in, the full retail prices; first 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what was called beer, but afterwards turned out a good deal of it waste—application had then been made for rent; I told him so—he said he did not know what he had to pay it with, and he paid it out of the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the rent demanded was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for two months—he said they were going to put the brokers in—the next occasion I paid him 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to me for wages, but I allowed that to go on towards paying, making it 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I discovered it was a monthly tenancy when the demand for rent came—I afterwards paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a month—on 13th July I sent the prisoner through my solicitor notice to leave his service—on August 16th he came and handed me this notice (<hi rend="italic">To quit that day month, and promising to settle according to agreement, holding the witness responsible for any damage or for letters returned through the Dead Letter Office</hi>)—I did not know where he could be found, and after keeping the letters a time I handed them to the lettercarrier—once after the payment of the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he came and said, "Well, Powell, what cash have you for me?"—I said, "None, Mr. Johnson "—he said, "How is that?"—I said,"I am advised not to pay you any more"—I owed him more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for beer, I cannot say how much; here is the book—he paid me four weeks' wages—I had been in his service four weeks. up to the notice—he has not repaid me any part of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know where he lived—I have since paid the rent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not say I was in his service after my refusal to pay him—the landlord's agent came for the rent—Johnson's son lived nearly opposite me—I had no occasion to go to him, and I was expecting Johnson to come and settle with me—I sold the goodwill of the house for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to the brewer that supplied me, because I owed him some money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 211, High Street, Borough, and am a wholesale provision merchant—John Waite Bendall was formerly a customer of mine—on 10th June, 1881, I was managing the business; he owed my father money, and in liquidation assigned him the lease of the house in question in Crystal Palace Road, formerly called the' Boss-more Road—the assignment is endorsed on an agreement for a lease between the British Empire Company and John Waite Bendall for 99 years, I think, from year to year for 15 years, and then at the expiration of that time the tenant may nave the option of a lease for 84 years. (<hi rend="italic">One of the clauses of the agreement was read, stating that Bendall teas not to carry on any trade, business, or manufacture without the consent of the company in writing.</hi>) Mr. Bendall carried on the business of a grocer and cheesemonger on those premises, and used to sell bottled beer to be consumed off the premises—I had supplied him with the groceries—he left the premises; I cannot say when—I endeavoured to let the premises before he went—I advertised them for sale, and spoke to Johnson about them—Johnson called on me about the end of March last year, and said he had called about the shop in the Crystal Palace Road—he said he wanted to make it a central depot for bottling beer, as he had a number of off-licence houses, and would supply them from there—I told him he could not open it as a beershop, as we could have let it to Mr. Miller only the British Empire would not strike the clause out of the original lease—I said he could carry on a bottled-beer trade there the same as Bendall, and in con-junction with a grocer's business—he did not say he wanted it for a beershop—nothing was said with regard to draught beer—I showed him the agreement with the superior landlord—he read it, and said it was quite satisfactory—he read it right through—I don't know that I pointed out that particular clause—I did not give my consent to a beerengine being put on the premises; I did not know there was one, nor that a cellar was being excavated—we made all the necessary repairs that Johnson required before he went in. (<hi rend="italic">The agreement between Twiddy and Johnson, was dated April</hi> 8, 1882, <hi rend="italic">set forth a yearly tenancy at a rent of</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year, and contained a clause that the tenant should be allowed to carry on a grocer's trade with the sale of trims and beer under an existing licence after application</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">to the Justices</hi>) Johnson said to me "It is the last day for renewing the licence, and it the licence is lost the property will drop 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and we gave him the money to go and take the licence out—Mr. Bendull had the licence—I was served with a copy of a writ restraining me from the sale—the first quarter's rent was paid in advance—when the next quarter became due, in September, we put in an execution—the agree<lb/>ment does not say the rent is to be paid in advance, but he did so—we took possession of the premises, but allow Mr. Everett to remain there—I believe we distrained for the rent; we regard the fixtures as ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The rent was paid by Johnson up to 21st June, and no rent was due till 29th September—he would have 21 days after the 29th to pay it—I do not know he was arrested on the 29th—I do not think he has lost the 21 years' lease by it; it was from year to year—I do not think the 21 years is at his option; he was going to buy the place of us—I negotiated for it to be a shop where they sold beer off and on; that the British Empire Company would not agree to—they allowed beer and wines to be sold off on sufferance, as Bendall did; there was no agreement—I made an agreement with the tenant that he should sell wines and spirits off, but he knew all about it—the British Empire would not have put in an injunction if he had done it as it was before—he never said he was going to sell beer; he said he was going to make it a depot—I contend lie could not put up the beer-engine and sell wines and spirits by this agreement or make it a beerhouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The British Empire Company had not given me permission to put up a beer-engine or excavate—we have nearly lost our interest in it—they did not consent to draught beer being sold there—I did not explain to Johnson the difference between the two terms; I told him what Bendall sold—it was explained to Johnson he could carry on a grocer's business with the sale of bottled beer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Baxter, the brewer—about February, 1882: the prisoner dealt with us for beer, and we supplied it to several houses for him—in April he owed us 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we advanced him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., giving him a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and setting off 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against what he owed—in consequence of the indebtedness he entered into this agreement with us. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Sydney Johnson deposited with Richard Baxter the deed mentioned in the schedule relating to the house as security for the</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">advanced, promised to deal with Baxter for all beer, paying for the name periodically, and undertook to mortgage the house to him for any sums further due, such mortgage to contain a power of sale.</hi>) I advanced him more money and supplied him with more beer—he owes me 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—this agreement of 8th April, 1882, is for letting 228, Crystal Palace Road—there are two licences for that and three for 2, Wakely Road, East Dulwich—those licences were in Mr. Bendall's name; they have never been transferred; I still hold them as collateral security.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not got other licences in blank of these premises—here could not be two licences of one premises—this licence is in force till 5th April, 1883—it is endorsed by Bendall—it cannot be used by anybody else till it has been transferred by the Magistrate—it would be available for Mr. Everett after it had been transferred to him—the signature of J. W. Bendall on the licence means that he has no interest in it after that—it does not show to whom he assigns it—when Johnson</p>

               <p>deposited the agreement with us he left the licence also—the licence is only a collateral security, the real thing is the agreement—only we should see that the licence was transferred to a respectable man—we wanted Everett to have it—brewers often take a regular mortgage for debt—there was nothing irregular or wrong in his depositing this with you, it was an ordinary thing; we should want some security when we advanced the money—if we had not we should not have given the beer—he never executed a mortgage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I called on Everett after he opened I learnt he had advanced 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Johnson—I spoke to Johnson about the transfer of the licence to Everett—I said he must have the licence transferred to some one, and "as Everett has told me he advanced 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have made inquiries; he is a respectable man, and the proper man to have it trans-ferred to "—Johnson said "I do not think he is fit for it, I shall go there myself; I shall have it in my own name"—he made an application to me for it—I said if he brought Everett up I would transfer it to Everett, but it was not to go out of our possession till it was transferred to Everett.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Dorking Police—on the night of September 8th, about 10 o'clock, I received information with regard to some counterfeit coin—I went in search of the prisoners, and found Seabrook in the High Street—I took him to the Bull's Head, and afterwards to the police-station—I searched him at the Bull's Head and found on him this counterfeit florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in good money—there were two sovereigns, one half-crown, five shillings, twelve six-pences, three threepenny pieces, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I afterwards saw Gilroy at the police-station about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present when Gilroy was searched—Stingimore searched him, and he has got the money with the exception of the gold—he can give you exact evidence as to the money found—I only found one counterfeit coin on Seabrook—the last train leaves Dorking for London on the South-Eastern line about half-past 9, and on the London, Brighton, and South Coast about 5 minutes to 10 at night—I know the potman at the Bull's Head—I know that the landlady and the mother sent the potman out on this evening, but do not know at what time—I did not see him come out—I saw the potman in the High Street between 10 o'clock and the time that Gilroy was taken in custody—I did not see him in a public-house treating Gilroy to something to drink—I do not know that the potman was in Gilroy's company at all—I do not know that he gave him something to drink, and that he went from there home to the bed which he had engaged.</p>

I am a police-constable of Dorking—on the night of the 8th of September I was sent to the Three Tuns Inn about 11 o'clock, and saw the prisoner Gilroy there in bed—I said "I want you on a charge of uttering counterfeit coin"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I asked him to get up—he put on his things and went with me to the station—I searched him both there and at the station, and found 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was 1 sovereign, 2 half sovereigns, 2 florins, 13 shillings, 36 sixpences, 1 threepenny piece, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, all good money—the public-houses close at 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took Gilroy to Mrs. Butler at the Bull's Head to be identified—I asked her if she knew him—there are about 9,000 people in Dorking and there is one superintendent and four policemen to look after the 9,000—these depositions were taken at the Dorking Police-court.</p>
