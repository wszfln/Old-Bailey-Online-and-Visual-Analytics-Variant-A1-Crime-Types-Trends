                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker and pianoforte-maker, and reside at Colchester. In Sept., 1842, Miss Perry came to board and lodge with me and my wife—I had known her before—she was to pay 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for board and lodging, and instruct my children in the pianoforte, if they re<lb/>quired it—I had three daughters—the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was in consideration of the instruction—it would have been more if she had not instructed them—there was no document in writing—she was a teacher of the pianoforte to other pupils in Colchester, and she was to have the use of my piano to instruct her other pupils upon—she continued to board and lodge with me under that agree<lb/>ment till about a month after Dec., 1844—my wife left me in Dec., 1844; and in consequence of that, Miss Perry said to me she was advised to leave as soon as she could get employment; she thought she ought not to remain in my house—I said she could remain for a week or two, till she could suit herself, and then leave.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not yourself actually take lessons in music of her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not any undertaking of hers—she gave me about three lessons—she professed to give me lessons for one quarter—I am not aware that she gave me more than three lessons—I believe that was the extent—it might be either two or three—I would not be positive—it might be four—it was very few—she gave daily lessons to my daughter Jane, who is now dead—she was alive when Mrs. Couch left me—I told Miss Perry that Mrs. Couch and I were thinking about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week for her board, including the teaching of the children, but I do not know whether that was on East-hill or not—she did not reply, "It must depend entirely on the number of my pupils; I cannot pay you such a Sum as 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per quarter, or any sum of money by the week, as you know I am dependent on the pupils I obtain"—she never said anything of the sort—I swear that—I do not recollect her say<lb/>ing,"You know, Mr. Couch, I have not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the world, except that which I earn"—I knew she had not more than she earned—I have got two or three articles of hers—I have not got all that she had—she sold them to a broker, and ordered him to pay me the proceeds, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe she first spoke to me about leaving—I received from her the means of obtaining a legacy that was left her—she thought it would have been 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was only 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received that after the balancing of the account—I have not seen any linen that she left behind—there are two or three garments—she left a few things—I am not aware whether it was all she had—she left a cloak and gown and two or three old bonnets, lying about on the top of a wardrobe—two of my daughters went to school—the prisoner went to their school for the purpose of teaching them music—she told me on the 18th of Dec. that she was advised by her friends to leave, in consequence of my losing Mrs. Couch—I did not try to persuade her to stay, unless it was to suit her convenience, till she could get a comfortable lodging—she did not quit till, I think, three weeks or a month after the 18th of Dec.—I quarrelled with her before she left—I accused her of telling a falsehood, and she admitted it—she said she had a letter for my late servant in the house, and my daughter asked her if she had seen the servant since she left, in order that we might know where to send the letter to her—she said she had not, but my son had just before told me he had seen them talking together that evening, in Colchester—she denied it, and asked where—I said, "It matters not where, you have been seen talking to her"—she denied it again, and</p>

               <p>asked me where—I said, "In St. John-street"—she then admitted that she had, and I asked her how she could tell me such a falsehood—that was the quarrel—I did not call her any names, except as regards falsehood—I said she had told a lie—I did not, to my knowledge, abuse her in the grossest terms, or call her all manner of names—nothing but the word "liar"—the day on which I had this security for the balance was the 21st of Dec., 1844—I think it was about ten, or ten or eleven in the morning, between breakfast and dinner—it took place in the kitchen—I called her to me at a small dresser in the kitchen—I asked her how much she could let me have this Christmas, but that was after the note was signed—she said, "I will do what I can"—I am not aware of saying, "Can you let me have 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but she said she would let me have 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect that I said so—I will not be positive whether she said so to me, or I to her—she said, in all probability she would make it up 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after Christmas—she did not say, no, she was sure she could not, but she expected to receive 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., left her by Mr. De Cover, and at soon as she got it I should have it—nothing of the sort—I did not say, "Oh! that is not what I want, I am in such distress to know how I can go on till Christmas"—I wanted money at that time—I was rather in distress to meet my engagements at Christmas—I did not say, "Now I wish you would oblige me with signing this paper" (producing a paper to her)—she took the note from my hand, and read it—she did not take any other paper—there was not on the paper, "I owe Mr. Couch 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I will pay the 21st of Jan., 1845"—I never saw such a paper—she did not say on reading it, "Why, Mr. Couch, I would not put my name to this for the world; it would not be right of me, as I have not 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give; I was never asked to sign anything by anybody in my life"—I did not say, "You don't understand me, Miss Perry, that is not my motive, I merely want to show it is due to me; I have nothing against you in my books"—I was indebted to Mr. Bear, my butcher, at that time—I did not say to her, "Now, if I say to Bear, the butcher, or any others, 'I expect to receive a few pounds from Miss Perry, at Christmas,' they will say, 'We have only your word, Mr. Couch'"—nor did she say, "What can your creditors have to do with me?"—I did not rejoin, "You don't understand me; that is not my motive; I thought you would not refuse to do it, because it can make no difference to you whether you sign it or not"—she did not say, "I shall get into trouble by it," nor did I say, "Why, Miss Perry, do you believe me capable of such a thing?" nor on my faithfully assuring her she should not get into any trouble, did she sign a paper admitting a debt to me of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards received from her a memorandum to apply to the Rev. Charles P. King, for the payment of Mr. De Cover's legacy—in my book the account purports to be balanced thus, "Balance due to Mr. Couch, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. this 21st day of Dec., 1844," and then purports to be signed Mary Ann Perry—it is not signed in his book—I always wrote in her book also—this is all mine, except the signature—the balance is struck and certified in my book, but not in hers—there is nothing in the book, except charges against her, and certain cash payments from time to time—there is nothing about teaching my daughters or myself—nearly the whole of the items are composed of the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, with the exception of her mother's funeral expenses, and some other little items, making deductions from time to time of the cash paid to me—at that time I had a young woman in my service, named Mary Ann Strickland—Strickland was not in the kitchen on the mor<lb/>ing of the 21st of Dec., when Miss Perry signed this paper—I was at the trial at Bristol—I heard Strickland sworn and examined there—I had an apprentice named M'Carthy—he came to me, I think, about five</p>

               <p>years ago—I am not quite certain—his indentures were burnt in my presence, by the clerk of Mr. Church, the attorney—I believe M'Carthy himself put them into the fire in my presence—I think that was in Jan. or Feb., 1845—it was after Miss Perry had left me—he had enlisted for a sol<lb/>dier more than once, and I said I would have nothing more to do with him—that was the only reason they were burnt, to cancel them—I did not erase the name of a former apprentice from those indentures, and put M'Carthy's on it, and then, to prevent the discovery of the stamp, cause it to be burnt—I never had an apprentice named Lock or Lodge—they were the inden<lb/>tures prepared for a previous apprentice, but had never been signed—I erased the name of a former apprentice, and wrote M'Carthy's name in the body—the stamp was never used for the other apprentice—his name was Smith—it was not observed by me, or in my presence, that I should not be safe until they were burnt—Mr. Church's clerk said he thought there would be some legal objection to it, having been filled up for another—I said I did not want the apprentice any further, as he had enlisted, and that sort of thing, and he ad<lb/>vised me to cancel the indentures, not at all as a means to avoid my getting into any scrape—that was not my motive—he said, if I forced it before a Magistrate, there might be some legal objection made to the indentures—when M'Carthy neglected his work I have ordered him to do it—I do not recollect being violent to him—he ran away two or three times; I believe not on account of my violence—I believe he did not leave me on that account—there was no reason why he should leave me on that account on the particu<lb/>lar occasions when he did leave—I have treated him with violence when he has neglected his duty—that was not the case with Mrs. Couch also—I swear that—she is now in London, not with me—I saw her this morning—I have been reconciled to her about a few weeks—I corresponded with her before this indictment was prepared—she went away with one of the apprentices—I corresponded with her, from time to time, within a few weeks after she left—I knew where she was—I have been reconciled to her about six weeks—the name of the previous apprentice to M'Carthy was not York—I had an ap<lb/>prentice of that name—he was not the apprentice that the indentures were intended for, and I swear it was not his name that was erased from the in<lb/>dentures—I do not recollect that we dined earlier than usual on the 21st of Dec., it was about one o'clock, I believe—I do not believe Miss Perry left the house till after dinner—I know Miss Emma Clay, of Greenstead, near Col<lb/>chester—I believe she is a person of respectability, and Miss Johnson also—York came into my service about eight years ago, I cannot say the date exactly—I have had a great many apprentices—he quitted, I should say, about six years ago; I am not quite positive—M'Carthy came about five years ago—york's indentures were burnt, I think they were cancelled, by his father, about two years after he was bound—I believe they were burnt before M'Carthy came, as well as I recollect—I do not exactly recollect whether it was before or after—I do not recollect going to Miss Perry on Sunday even<lb/>ing, the 12th of Jan. last year, and asking her to give me a list of her pupils' names, that I might go and get some money from them—I asked her who owed her money—I do not know that I asked her for a list of her pupils—I will not swear I did not—I do not recollect that she refused—she told me one or two—I do not recollect that she refused; I will not swear either way—she did not refuse—I swear positively I did not ask her for a list of her pupils—I do not recollect doing so—I do not recollect mentioning pupils—I will not swear that I did or did not—I did not, upon her refusing, charge her with knowing of my wife's intention to quit me, and call her an infamous wretch and a base and infernal liar; nor did I add, if she was in hell, I would</p>

               <p>take a pitchfork and keep her down—I never made use of such an expression—I am not given to such violent language as that—she did not tell me she could not suffer herself longer to be so insulted, and go into the bedroom of my youngest daughter, and finally quit the house—it was not the following morning before I knew she had quitted my house—I do not recollect exactly the day she left, but I heard of her leaving as soon as she had quitted—she went out in the ordinary way, to teach, and did not come back that night, and I then found she had left—I do not recollect whether it was the 12th of Jan.—it was after the note was given to me—I am not aware that she left the following morning to this conversation—I do not know whether she did or not—I did not ask her again, on the morning before she quitted, for a list of her pupils—I did not tell her, if she did not give me that list, it would be her ruin; that I would post her up in all Colchester as one of the greatest liars and worst of wretches, and that I would have my revenge—I do not recollect, on the morning she quitted, her telling me it was the last time I should have it in my power to insult her—I will not swear either way about it—she did not say she was too well known in Colchester for me to injure her, nor did I reply I had done that already in a way she little thought of—I never had such a conversation—after she left she wrote to my daughter for her clothes—she did not get them or her music—I believe I saw the letter my daughter wrote to her in answer—I did not stand by her, and dictate it to her—I know a person named Robert Shaw King—I did not tell him that though I did not write the letter, I stood by my daughter, and dictated it to her—I saw the letter—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it is my daughter's writing—I believe this is the letter that was sent by my daughter—I am not sure of having read it before it was sent—I saw her send it out of the house—I do not recollect whether she showed it to me before she sent it—I will not swear I did not read it before she sent it—I do not recollect whether I read it all through—I read part of it—I do not recol<lb/>lect whether I read the whole—I had at that time and have now in my house two boxes and some wearing apparel of Miss Perry's—I was aware my daughter had written a letter something like this to her, but to say I read the whole of it I cannot; the probability is that I did run it through, but not so particularly as I have done now—it is my daughter's letter—I think I must have read it through, but not so attentively as I have done now—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Miss Couch begs to inform Miss Perry, in answer to her note received this eve by a boy, that there are a quantity of old dirty pads that Miss Perry has been in the habit of using to endeavour to hide her deformed shoulder, lying about the room, just the colour of the flannel waistcoat that Miss Perry once wore for more than a year without washing, and which her brothers talk of exhibiting for the benefit of old maids and bachelors, and that in their moving a polka dress a large-sized pad fell out; but Miss C. feels too great a contempt for such a lying wretch as Miss Perry has proved herself to be, to take any further notice of her request, and requests Miss Perry will not annoy her any more"—I read all that—I am not aware that it was read over to me to meet my approval before it went—she told me she had written such a letter—she handed it to me and I sent it—I did not know anything about the pads or anything of that sort till my daughter named it—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the broker for such of her furniture as was sold—I believe the morning she signed the note I asked her when she could pay me—I asked her how much she was going to pay me at Christmas—I never made a demand upon her to pay the note—no demand was made till it went into the hands of the assignee, who is my brother-in-law—I think that was in May, but I am not sure—I have not preferred this indictment—I am not the prosecutor—I was</p>

               <p>aware that I was to give evidence in the case—I was not subpœnaed—the indictment was preferred with my knowledge and assent—I do not particu<lb/>larly desire it—I am anxious that my character should be relieved from the imputations that have been cast upon it—I came to no agreement with my brother-in-law about preferring the indictment—he gave notice at the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Court that he should prefer it—the bill was found last Session—I have done only what I considered necessary to the establishment of my character, and no more—I accompanied the officer to the place where Miss Perry was found—I denied the truth of her statement of her not having signed it—I heard that she had been offered a situation in a school in Belgium—I went to Clarendon-square with the policeman to find her—I do not recollect say<lb/>ing, as I walked to the station with her and the policeman, "She can't now stand up and tell me her lies, nobody ever got the better of me"—I will swear I did not say, "Nobody ever got the better of me," no such words—she said she had friends, and I said, "Then you had better make use of them"—I did not call her a liar and a wretch—I swear that positively—I denied her state<lb/>ment saying she did not sign it—I do not recollect that I called her a liar or a wretch in the officer's presence—I will swear I did not call her a wretch, and I do not believe I called her a liar; but when she denied ever having writ<lb/>ten it, I denied her statement—I called her a liar, but not a wretch—I did not say, "I have got you, and if you had been in France I would have got you, and transported you for seven years"—I did not say I would transport her—I said if she had been in France in all probability she would have been taken—I said I believed the crime of perjury was punishable with transport<lb/>ation—I might have said that—I do not recollect saying it to her—I have said such a thing—I did not tell her she should be transported—she applied to go somewhere, I do not know where, to see her friends—I said, "Let her see none of her friends or anybody else"—I followed her to the station-house in Fleet-street—I went with her from Fleet-street to the Judge's chambers, to ascertain to what prison or station she was to be sent—I was desired to go and identify her with the officer—I do not know that I called her a liar—I do not believe I did—I went next morning and followed her—I understood it was necessary to identify her at the Judge's chambers, that she was the person mentioned in the indictment—I went for that purpose—I do not recollect the policeman telling me not to stay any longer, or that I was not wanted—I will not swear he did not—I believe M'Carthy was at Chelmsford last spring—that is where I understood him to be living—I was then living at Colchester—they are about twenty miles apart—you can go by the rail-road in about an hour—I did not take M'Carthy down to the Bristol assizes.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230012"/>
               <p>been an erasure of the name in the body of the indentures, in all probability they might think they were got up for the purpose of getting him off from the army, and I might be required at Chelmsford to prove that was not the case, because I showed that erasure to the subscribing witness and to the boy and his father when it was first entered into, several years previous, that they had been intended for another apprentice, but not executed, and as he was taken from charity there was no occasion for stamped paper at all, as no premium was paid; but in order to show the boy we were legal, as I drew the inden<lb/>tures myself, I substituted the stamp that was intended for another; and I thought if this man took them to Chelmsford I should have the power I have had over the apprentice taken out of my hands, and probably the Magistrate might compel me to show that the indentures were genuine—that was nearly twelve months before they were burnt—I had a fire at my house in 1841—I think I was insured in the Phœnix—I had tools in my house and workshops—M'Carthy and I had not removed any of them a short time before the fire—if M'Carthy has ever stated that there were any tools removed from the pre<lb/>mises for which I made a claim as if burnt, it is not true.</p>

I was living with my father at Colchester, at the time Miss Perry boarded and lodged with him—I remember in Dec., 1844, my father telling me to fetch a bill-stamp—no one was present except my father, when he sent me for the stamp—I brought it to my father—he wrote on it, and told me that Miss Perry was going to give him a note of hand—she was not present then—after he had written on the bill, I went with him into the kitchen—Miss Perry was there when we went in—my father said to her that he had drawn the note out, and he wished for her to sign it; and he gave her the note, which she read—she said, "Very well," and then put her name to the bill—I saw her do that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the note</hi>)—this is her handwriting—my name is on the bill—I witnessed her signing it—I am quite sure I saw her sign that bill—I shall be seventeen years old next April—I have been to sea—I was examined at the trial at Bristol, last spring—I have never had any quarrel with Miss Perry.</p>

On Monday, the 9th of Feb., I was on duty in the Union-house, and at half-past seven o'clock in the morning I went to the upper ward to open the windows, and see that all persons were out, and to lock the ward, which was my duty—I saw the three prisoners in the ward—Murphy and Dench have been some years in the house, but Golding not so long—they ought to have been down at breakfast at that time—I proceeded to open the windows, and when I had opened about three, Dench passed me towards the door, from the other end of the ward—Golding and Murphy were on the right-hand side, about half-way up the ward, by the side of their beds—I passed Golding, got up to Murphy, and, on turning in between the two beds, to open the next window, just as I passed Murphy, I received a violent blow from his right hand—I saw the blow coming, but could not get from it—it knocked me down—Dench and Golding immediately came to his assistance—they kicked and beat me about very severely—Dench and Golding both kicked and struck me while I was on the ground—Dench placed his foot on the pit of my stomach, and said, "Get the b—r's staff, and give it him"—Murphy and Dench endeavoured to get the staff, and in doing so got hold of my body coat, and tore it up the back under my arm—my staff was in my pocket—they tore the skirt of my coat up to my armpit—Murphy eventually got the staff, and Dench struck me a blow on my right temple—it was swollen very much—he immediately re<lb/>peated the blow on the left temple—when I found my staff being seized I tried all I could to get up—I got hold of a bedstead, but they bent me over the edge of it—I was glad to get down on the ground again—the blows produced blood—the first blow covered my face with blood—the second caused my eye to swell as big as an egg—I then got on my feet, and made towards the door—Dench and Golding then left me, and shut the door that I should not get out—I went to the window, and held by the bar, calling "Murder!"—they continued beating and kicking me till they heard Wakefield, the porter, picking at the door—they then said, "Let the b—r go," and they ran down stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was done to you after the blow in the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They continued beating and kicking me—I was struggling to get from them—I was almost insensible—I was confined to my bed for a week, and now am unable to return to my duty—I was taken to Dr. Lynch, and have been under his care ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy.</hi> Golding had nothing to do with it; this is a very different statement to what he made before; he said he did not know which of the two took the staff, and that he did not know what he was saying at Guildhall;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230024"/>
               <p>I was lying on the bed—he asked if I meant to get up; I said I was unwell, and wished to lay a little longer; he pulled the clothes off; I asked what he meant; he pulled out his staff, and said if I did not get up by fair means I should by foul; I got up, put on my things, all but my jacket; I was walking down the room, and had not got many feet from my bed before he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me along with his staff, saying he would have no nonsense, poking me in the back with his staff; I turned round and asked what he meant; as he was going to strike me I seized the staff: he seized me by my neck-hand<lb/>kerchief, and almost strangled me; in the struggle the staff fell down; he kept hold of my throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not a word he says is true—when I entered they were up and dressed, even to their caps—I said at Guildhall that Murphy took the staff and struck me—when there I was much confused from the blows—I had no less than seventeen wounds—the doctor did not lay any stress on any but the two I received from the staff—I did not speak a word to either of them till after the assault commenced—I did not touch his bed—my staff was in my pocket till he took it out—the first thing Golding did was to kick me when on the ground, and he continued striking me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at the West Union workhouse. I was on duty on the 9th of Feb., about half-past seven o'clock, and heard a cry of "Murder!"—I went towards the upper ward, and met the three prisoners on the stairs, running down—I asked who was crying murder—one of them, I do not know which, said, "It is <hi rend="italic">Baskey</hi>"—the prosecutor goes by that name—they went on about a yard and a half—Murphy turned round, pulled a staff from under his jacket, and stepped towards me to make a blow at me—an inmate who was standing by said, "For God's sake, don't strike Wakefield"—one of the others said, "Oh don't strike Wakefield"—Murphy brought the staff, and gave it into my hand without saying a word—I then took him into custody—I went up stairs and found Bristy bleeding—I brought him down—he was taken to the lodge, and my wife bathed his face to get the blood off.</p>

On this morning I saw Murphy coming down stairs—I had charge of the door, and "when Bristy went up I locked the door to prevent anybody coming in—in a minute or two I heard cries of "Murder!" repeated—I did not know where it came from, but recollected that Bristy had gone up—I saw the three prisoners coming down together, and saw Wakefield and the night porter come up—I saw Murphy turn very suddenly round when he saw Wakefield—he drew the staff from under his coat, and raising his arm high, was about to make a tremendous blow at him—I said, "Oh Murphy," or "Stop Murphy," and he did not strike—I have before this heard Murphy say, in a conversa<lb/>tion with me, the very first opportunity he had he would lick Baskey's b----y head with his staff—he said no power on earth should put down the young men of the West London Union, and "The very first chance he gives me I will punch the b----y b----r's head with his own staff," for it was impossible for the governor or any Magistrate to keep down the spirit of the young men of the West Union.</p>

                  </hi>,. M.D. I am surgeon of the West London Union. On the 9th of Feb., about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was sent for, and found the prosecutor in bed—he complained of giddiness in his head, and stated that he had been beaten—I found two contusions on the side of his head, extending along each temple—on the left eye was extravasation, and it was considerably swollen, so much so I could not see whether the eye itself was injured, the effusion of blood was so considerable—on the other side I found considerable effusion, but that was the result of a minor contusion—on the temple was an abrasion, the skin scraped off, and blood streaming down that side of the face—there were several minor wounds in different parts and several small scratches on the temples either done by the hand or a kick—there seemed five or six of them—it was necessary he should keep his bed some days—I feared for two or three days there might have been concussion of the brain—the blows on the temple might be struck by this staff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dench. Q.</hi> Might the blows be struck with a fist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The abrasion might—there would be some indentation from the knuckles if all the blows were from the fist, and they were too large contusions to be done by a fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dench.</hi> The staff was never used at all; it is the same as charging Golding, that he should not be a witness for us; what blows he had was from the fist; he got Murphy down and said he would serve me the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy's Defence.</hi> Bristy assaulted me first, and not being satisfied with that, he pulled out his staff and was going to strike me; it was natural to make some resistance, but I should not have struck him had he not kept his grasp of my throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dench's Defence.</hi> When I saw Murphy on the ground I told Mr. Baskey it was unmanly to hurt him, so he said, "You—, I will serve you the same;" then I certainly acted in my own defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Moore Walker, of North-place, Cromer-street. I lodged at No. 7, Manchester-street, before that. On the 31st of Jan., 1845, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner there—I knew her before—she came down and sat by my fire till near four o'clock—I left her in the room alone for about three minutes—I went to my drawers about four o'clock, and I missed my shawl, which I had seen safe three mi<lb/>nutes before she came into the room—she was also gone—I did not see any<lb/>thing of her till the May following, and before I said anything to her she said, as I went to speak to her, "I did not take your shawl"—I had not mentioned it to her—I then asked her what she had done with it—she said she had pawned it, and promised me the ticket the next day—I went with my husband that evening and a policeman, but she was gone—I did not see her again till last Friday week—I then told her she had told me a great story as to where she had pawned it—she said yes she had, but it was pledged at Brown's.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 8th of Feb., about seven o'clock, my attention was called to a very strong smell of fire in the passage leading to the prisoners' house, No. 3, Bridge-row, in the parish of Hammersmith—I had seen the elder Stone pass our house about half-past five o'clock in the evening, coming in a direction from the house of Catch<lb/>pole, which is about five minutes' walk from the prisoner's house—he passed our window going ia a direction for his own house, but I did not see him go into it.</p>

I am the witness's husband—I let the house, No. 3, Bridge-row, to the elder Stone, I think in June last, at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, at a quar<lb/>terly tenant—Mrs. Hyde came into the house first, and Stone, sen., about a month after—they lived together as man and wife—Stone, jun., hat not been there long—he came a little before Christmas—in Nov. last Stone, sen. came to my shop and asked if I was insured, and where (I am not cer<lb/>tain about the time)—I told him yes—he asked if Carter, who was a tenant of mine, was insured—I said yes, that I insured with Mr. Austin, who is agent to the Union, and said Carter was insured in the same office—he left me, saying he would go over and tee about insuring—he came back and said he had been to make inquiry, and asked me to let him see a paper connected with insurance—the prisoners, all three, lived at the house up to the beginning of Feb.—I saw them occasionally going in and out—I was at a friend's house on Sunday night, the 8th of Feb., when there was an alarm of fire—I went to the prisoners' house—I live next door—I got there a little after eight o'clock, and observed smoke coming from the up-stair window—the house is only one story high—I tried to get in at the window, but it was fast—I at last broke the front door open—there was to much smoke coming from the window we did not get in, or we should have been suffocated—I went through a little shop which the front door opens into, to get up stairs—I at last got to the top, but was suffocated with smoke and fell down against the person behind me—when I recovered I knelt on the floor, and saw the bed was on fire—there was an old bedstead and the bed which was on it was on fire—it was a sort of bag of shavings—it was a common bag of cooper's shavings and tome tow mixed with them on the ticking—I pulled the bag down stairs into the road—I went up to the room again, and when the air got in, the partition of the room and the bedstead began to blaze—the wooden partition was fixed to the house—I had some difficulty in getting the fire out—if I had not had plenty of water I should never have done it—we saw smoke coming out of a box under the bedstead—the lid was closed, and smoke coming out where it shuts down—there Was no sign of fire outside the box—we opened it and found in it a lot of cooper's chips, and a bag of chips and shavings, and a large piece of coke or cinder, about us big us my fist, in the middle of the bag—it appeared to have</p>

               <p>been put into the bag to set it on fire—the bag had a hole cut in it, and the coke put in—it was burning—there was no fire-place in that room—I thought the box when opened smelled very strongly of turpentine—I think there was also a clothes-horse, one chair, a tub, and, I believe, a horn lantern in that room—we saw fire through the chinks of the partition in the other room, which were made by being burned—I burst a piece out of the pannel with my feet, so that we could get water through, and found fire was underneath the floor—we got it out—it appeared as if a piece of the floor had been taken up and a lot of old baskets, chips, and cinders put in, that was burning underneath the floor—there was an old-fashioned tent bedstead in that room, and a piece of old white curtain over the top of it, of no value—the place was so full of smoke we could not get into that room—I ran down stairs to my own house, and by bursting open two doors I got into the room—I found a bag on the bed there, filled with shavings like the other, and it was all in a blaze—there was no bedding in that bed nor any ticking—the bag rested on the sacking—there was a chest of painted deal drawers in that room—we observed smoke coming from the bottom drawer, and on opening it it contained a lot of cooper's chips and cinders, lying along the middle as if thrown in with a fire-shovel—the chips were burning—I saw no cinders on the floor, but in the drawer, which was it<lb/>self on fire—there was a stove in that room, but no remains of fire—I put my hand to the stove and it was quite cold—there were five drawers to the chest—we opened them, and the one above the bottom one was strewed with cooper's chips, which were in every drawer—I found three or four bags of shavings altogether, one in each bed, one in the box, and another under the second bed, which was not on fire—I think there was one chair in the back room, and a washhand-stand—there was no furniture up stairs but two bedsteads, a wash<lb/>hand-stand, a chest of drawers, and two chairs—they sold sweetmeats in the shop, and we found some in the shop—the whole stock, I should think was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the officer, Jupp, came to my assistance, and he found a policy of insurance in the drawer which was on fire—Sergeant Mount afterwards pro<lb/>duced a key, which I knew to be the key of the street-door I had given to Stone when he took the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-row, St. Matthew Bethnal-green—it my dwelling-house. The prisoner has been in my employ—on Tues<lb/>day, the 17th of Feb., at five minutes to nine o'clock, I saw him in Barnet<lb/>grove, about thirty or forty yards from my house—he asked if I was going to chapel—I said, "Yes"—he asked who was at home—I said they were all at work backward, meaning in a little shed adjoining the house—he bid me good night, and left—he said he was going to Pritchard's-place—I was fetched from chapel by two apprentices, and went home—I found things of no value strewed about my front room floor, and missed the articles stated in the in<lb/>dictment—all the articles produced are mine, and were safe in my room—the quilt was on the bed, this coat in the drawer in the front room, and this silk dress was on the bed—I found them at the station about ten o'clock that night—I found a lucifer-match in the middle drawer.</p>

On Tuesday, the 17th of Feb., about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was at work in the back shop, near the front room—there was a knock at the door, which I opened—it was the prisoner—he said nothing to me, but walked through the passage, and went on to the back shop—he spoke to Mrs. Poole there—he said he had come for his mother's eye-water bottle—lie took it off the shelf, put it into his pocket, bid us good night, and left the workshop—I cannot say whether he left the house—I did not hear the street door shut—I left off work at five minutes to nine, went into the passage, and found the street door wide open—I called Mrs. Poole—I got a light, went into the parlour, and found a parcel of old things about the floor, not of much value—the drawers were wide open, and quite empty—not a soul had come to the house but the prisoner—I had not heard anybody but him.</p>

Dear Sir, On the other side I send you three checks for your signature—the first for 2,596<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is made up as follows:—Amount paid to Mr. Pease for principal, interest, and costs, directed to be paid into Court, with interest at 4 per cent, 1,241<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

Amount of unpaid costs of the inquiries and pro<lb/>ceedings relative to the arrangement with Pease, directed to be paid into Court conditionally, 364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Amount directed to be paid into Court, to an<lb/>swer the costs of Messrs.

Gosling and Co." has been written on it since it was in my hand—I believe that to be Mr. Garey's handwriting—when I had signed the check I think I enclosed it to Mr. Triston for Mr. Foster's signature—Mr. Triston is solicitor for Mr. Foster, my co-trustee, and he had been solicitor for me also—this is the letter I sent—between June and the January following I wrote to Mr. Foster respecting the money—I do not think I wrote to the prisoner or had any interview with him on the subject between Nov. and Jan.—I wrote to him requesting a copy of the receipt might be sent down—on the 18th Jan., 1846, I received from him this letter, marked A, enclosing this paper—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Thos.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230044"/>
               <p>complicated business—they had to go into the Ecclesiastical Court, for there was another will, and Mr. Garey had the conducting of the whole business—Mr. Triston received his costs, and Mr. Garey said they were correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that Mr. Triston had your authority to give Mr. Wakefield a brief to appear on the hearing of the petition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote to Mr. Garey, and then I wrote to Mr. Triston to go to Mr. Garey, and to see that it was done—I was informed that the order was drawn so that Mr. Garey was to receive the money—I said I should have no objection to trust Mr. Garey myself, but I could not as a trustee, and I desired Mr. Triston to see that the order was to pay to the trustees and not to him—there were two policies of insurance—I never understood they were to be handed over to Mr. Triston as my soli<lb/>citor—I acted entirely in this case under the advice of Mr. Garey, with the exception that when I heard he was to receive the money I said, "No, it must not be so; it must be paid to the trustees"—the policies were got through Mr. Garey's exertions—the commission of lunacy was taken out against Mr. Frank in 1825, I think—the commencement of his lunacy was declared to be from 1816—his income was about 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—in 1817 he made a deed of settlement of the Pontefract estate on his younger children—that deed became invalid, in consequence of the commencement of the lunacy being declared to be in 1816—there were two other children living at that time—after Mr. Frank became a lunatic, an allowance was made to himself and his family—that allowance to the younger children continued up to the time of his death—immediately upon his death the heir filed a bill to set aside the settlement of the Pontefract estate—Messrs. Foster, Evans, and Smith were concerned as attorneys for the younger children in the first instance—in consequence of Mr. Frank's death the three younger children had nothing except what their aunts chose to give them—their allowance was taken away the instant Mr. Frank died—Foster, Evans, and Smith were never concerned in the suit in Chancery—Mr. Garey was concerned as their solicitor at first, I think, but I do not know—Edward Bacon Frank, one of the younger children, had no property of his own—he was entitled to a rever<lb/>sion of one-third of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the death of his aunts Catherine and Elizabeth—he told me he had sold that reversion for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I advised him to go to his attorney directly, and pay the money, and get it back—I thought a court of equity would relieve him from such an imprudent bargain—Mr. Garey undertook the defence of this suit for the three younger children—he got an issue at law directed as to the validity of the settlement of 1816—Mr. Garey was then in the firm of Low, Garey, and Sweeting—I believe Mr. Garey was the acting man—it was finally decided by a verdict at law that the deed was a valid deed—he also succeeded in getting back the reversion—the proceed<lb/>ings in Chancery connected with both those matters, and the proceedings at law were very expensive—Messrs. Low, Garey, and Sweeting behaved remarkably well on that occasion, and did not ask the parties to advance much money, and immediately afterwards I paid them the whole amount—I do not know that Mr. Garey advanced money to go to trial out of his own private funds—I never heard of it—Mr. Garey, on the part of the three younger children, carried on the proceedings to recover the money on the policies—he was concerned for the younger children, and for myself at first, to avoid expense—he got the offices to pay the policies—it was a very difficult case—it was some years before the offices would pay the policies—Mr. Frank died a natural death—it is a question still to be decided whether the offices shall pay the interest on the policies—Mr. Garey quitted the firm of Low, Garey, and Sweeting about two or three years ago, when Mr. Low died—all these matters, of course, required outlays of money on the part of the solicitor, but Mr. Garey might have had any money he liked—before</p>

               <p>the deed was decided to be valid, I should say the younger children were merely dependent upon bounty for their existence—the whole weight of the matter was on myself, the contest with the elder brother as to the validity of the deed—I advanced them money before it was decided, and would have advanced anything—I went with 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—they asked me for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave it them—I would have given them anything—I forget what the proceedings came to—I think we paid 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as extra costs—the outlay was not so much as I expected it would have been—I think it was under 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other party had to pay costs—I do not know how much—it was a very heavy concern altogether—sales were made of portions of the Pon<lb/>tefract property—immediately I knew the value of the assistance we had from Low, Garey, and Sweeting, I said, of course, they ought to do the other business, the purchase, and they were employed—I think Mr. Garey always conducted the business connected with that—the monies upon those sales were paid to another attorney—Captain Mainwaring was my co-trustee, and he employed a separate solicitor—I employed Mr. Garey, because there should not be three solicitors—I do not know, of my own knowledge, that large sums passed through his hands in the progress of that business—they were paid into Coutts and Co.'s, by Mr. Govet—I think there was one sum paid in by Mr. Garey, and the rest by Mr. Govet, and one or two by Mr. Triston—Mr. Garey had the management of the business—he was to send the deeds to Mr. Govet, for Captain Mainwaring's signature—they were returned to Mr. Govet, and then Mr. Govet paid the money in—Mr. Garey did not receive the money from the purchasers—Mr. Govet did—he was Capt. Manwaring's solicitor, and Captain Mainwaring thought it right and proper that he should, he did not know Mr. Garey—I do not know that much of the money was paid to Mr. Garey, and by him handed over to Mr. Govet—I know that the money was carried to our account, as the trustees, at Coutts'—it may have all passed through Mr. Garey's hands, but I do not know it, and I do not think it did—I recollect that he received some deposits which I requested he would pay into Coutts', and he promised me he would—Mr. Edward Bacon Frank went with Mr. Garey to sell some part of the property, and Mr. Garey received the deposits—Mr. Edward Bacon Frank was Mr. Garey's client—I suppose Mr. Garey had a bill of costs against him, but not on that account—that would tell into the trustees' account—I do not know that his bill of costs against the three younger children was as much as 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Jan. last—that was the trust property—it had nothing to do with that—a bill of costs for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was delivered yesterday, I believe, or the day before—I do not know that a bill of costs is due by the Franks—I had no bills delivered to me till the night before last—I was told in coming to town, to go to the office, and there was Mr. Garey's attorney, with some papers, saying, they were indebted to him 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know anything about it—I should say Mr. Garey succeeded in getting for the three younger children, property to the value of between 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say the Pontefract estate was worth 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more, and the policies 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the interest on them is considerable—I do not know that Mr. Garey advanced money out of his pocket from time to time to Edward Bacon Frank, to support him—it is four or five years ago that the verdict at law was recovered—it was a long time pending after Mr. Frank's death—I do not know that the Master of the Rolls had pronounced the settlement deeds to be bad before Mr. Garey took it to issue—it is not so.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, and have chambers in Lincoln's-inn; I am co-trustee with Mr. Bellamy; Mr. Triston was my soli<lb/>citor. I recollect, in June last, his bringing me this letter—I recollect re<lb/>ceiving the check better than I recollect receiving the letter—it was imme<lb/>diately</p>

               <p>after the date of the letter, about the 25th of June I should say—the check had at that time been signed by my co-trustee, Mr. Bellamy—I signed the check—I had an account at that time at Coutts', jointly with Mr. Bel<lb/>lamy—my impression is, that at the time I signed it the words "Gosling and Co." were not on it—when I had signed the check I gave it to Mr. Tris<lb/>ton to take it to Mr. Garey—I was not acquainted with Mr. Garey personally, except relating to this trust—he had not been acting for me, that I am aware of, in any way—in Dec. last I received this letter from Mr. Bellamy; I think it was the 8th of Dec.—in consequence of that letter I saw Mr. Garey at his place of business, in Southampton-buildings—I asked him if he had the office copy receipt of the Accountant-General for the amount of this money—he said he expected to have it in a day or two, or something to that effect—I had two or three interviews with him subsequent to this, shortly after—I cannot re<lb/>collect precisely what passed about the money having been paid, further than I was given to understand the money had been paid by Mr. Garey—I made an arrangement with him that the certificate or receipt was to be sent to Mr. Bellamy at Brighton—I recollect Mr. Bellamy coming to town about the 21st of Jan. on a Tuesday—I accompanied him to the Accountant-general's on the Wednesday, I think—in this month I accompanied Mr. Bellamy to the Chancery-office, Bank of England, and the sum mentioned in the order, 2,596<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was paid by me conjointly with Mr. Bellamy.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who has got the trust deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think Mr. Triston has it—I became trustee in 1837—there was a deed appointing me trustee—I have seen Mr. Garey perhaps a dozen or half a dozen times—I believe the deed of settlement appointed me trustee—he had not been solicitor to the trustees before I became a trustee—there were no trustees before I became one—I am trustee under the deed of 1837, which carried out the former deed—I am thirty-seven years of age—there was a previous deed, in which trustees had been named—they died, and in pur<lb/>suance of something in that deed I was appointed one of the new trustees—I have no personal knowledge whether Mr. Triston was solicitor for the old trustees—he applied to me to become a trustee—I should say he continued to act as solicitor for the trustees—I was certainly not the active trustee—I always dealt with him as the solicitor—when I signed the check I handed it over to Mr. Triston, as solicitor for the trustees, to take to Mr. Garey; that was my impression certainly—Mr. Triston did not receive the monies on the policies—we received the monies ourselves—we did not hand them over to Mr. Triston—I took the check to Coutts' myself—Mr. Triston acted in the matter as my solicitor as well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Solicitor for the trustees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I speak according to my own under<lb/>standing—by Mr. Triston's advice, I sanctioned Mr. Garey's employment to conduct the petition on behalf of the trustees—it was said it could be done in a less expensive way, if he appeared for all parties—the petition was, if I recollect right, to deliver the policies to Mr. Garey on behalf of all parties—I am speaking from recollection—the order directs that they should be delivered to Mr. Triston as solicitor for the trustees, after the cestuique trust have paid off Sir William Cooke's charges—I believe they were delivered to Mr. Triston—Mr. Triston attended with them at the office when the money was paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. I was the solicitor of Mr. Fos<lb/>ter, and was also the solicitor for the trustees, Mr. Bellamy and Mr. Foster, generally—I recollect receiving this check from Mr. Bellamy—I took it to Mr. Foster and obtained his signature on the next day, and on the next day handed it to Mr. Garey—the words "Messrs. Goslings and Co." at that time were not on the check—it was crossed "Bank of England to the account of the Accountant-General"—in November I saw Mr. Garey two or three times, I think, on the subject of the Accountant-General's certificate and the Bank receipt—on that occasion I said that Mr. Bellamy and Mr. Foster wished to have the Accountant-General's receipt, and to know whether he had obtained it for the money paid in—Mr. Garey said he had not got it, that it was at the Accountant-General's office—I assumed in my question that the money had been paid in—I did not ask him whether it had—I asked him for the receipt for the money paid in—on each occasion he said he had not had time to send for it, or something of that kind—Mr. Garey conducted the business of the petition on which the order proceeded.</p>

Foster and Bellamy, as their general solicitor, as solicitor for the trustees—I delivered a brief, at a late stage of the proceeding, to Mr. Wakefield, and for a particular purpose, on the hearing of the petition, before the order was made—Mr. Wakefield's name is mentioned in the order—he was to represent Messrs. Bellamy and Foster—I sent in my bill of costs—the petition was pending only a few months, I think, speaking from recollection—the amount of my bill of costs at that time was 300 and odd pounds—it was a bill of costs running on for business done for ten years—I had not been paid for that time—it was relating to the policies—whilst those proceedings were going on I had not been paid—in the matter of the petition I should say that there was not above 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due—the next thing that was made on the hearing was the order—I had appeared on the petition in another capacity, as representing Sir William Cook, the committee of the estate—I had the policy in my hand as solicitor—I represented him when I delivered the brief to Mr. Wakefield—he appeared for Sir W. Cook—I took the petition to Mr. Foster—he perused and corrected it—I cannot say whether it was sent to Mr. Bellamy to be looked at—I do not think Mr. Bellamy saw it then—Mr. Foster corrected it for both of them—I think I did not say anything to Mr. Garey on the subject of the receipt before November—I have no recollection of that—I took the check to Mr. Garey myself—I recollect seeing him—I only handed it to him—I recollect no conversation, but I presume I must have said, "Here is the check from the trustees"—Mr. Bellamy was the only trustee in the suit in which Mr. Garey was concerned for the cestuique trust—Mr. Foster had nothing to do with that suit, only Mr. Bellamy and Captain Mainwaring—I was only concerned for Mr. Bellamy—when Mr. Garey took the case up it was considered to be a very difficult one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Accountant-General's office. When an order is made for any payment into the name of the Accountant-General at the Bank, the solicitor brings the order to the Accountant-General's office, and the clerk who takes the order reads it, to see what is to be done under it—whatever the order directs to be done the clerk draws—in such an order as this there are three separate sums to be paid into the Accountant-General's name to three separate and distinct accounts—one of these sums requires that the interest of it should be verified by affidavit, and then, as far as that sum is concerned, the solicitor must bring an affidavit of the amount of interest to be paid under the order—from such an order as this the clerk would draw three directions, one sum to go to one account, one to a second, and one, with interest, to a third—the certificates or directions are then handed over to another clerk to examine with the order—he then draws another certificate, which we call in the office a duplicate, but it is not exactly a duplicate, as the tense is altered—the first direction is to pay it in, and the other direction is, having paid it in; it is a duplicate with that difference—the first direction is taken into the Accountant-General, whose order the clerk proceeds to draw; and if the Accountant-General finds the certificates are drawn agreeably to the order he signs them—the second certificate is not signed then—it is put by—the first is entered in a book, and then delivered to the solicitor, who takes it to the Bank, pays the money, and obtains a Bank receipt—he then brings that receipt back to the Accountant-General's office, signed by the cashier, which is compared with the duplicate, and if found to be correct, it is annexed to the Bank receipt, signed by the Accountant-General, and taken to the office of the clerk of accounts, a branch of the Report-office, where they are both filed—office copies are then made of them—the originals are filed and kept in the Report-office, for the purposes of Court—the office co<lb/>pies are received by the Court as evidence—they are brought to the Account<lb/>ant-General's office, and put into pigeon-holes under letters, for the solicitors to take away—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the forged document</hi>)—this is very nearly in the form of such an office copy as I have described, but in those the price is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a wrong price is charged for it—they charge so much per folio at the Report-office for copying, and the price is always put in the margin—it has nothing to do with the contents of the order—the docu<lb/>ment itself is in the ordinary form of an office-copy, such as I have described—there is no price on the original—the "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is not a copy of anything—such a certificate as this would not be a certificate under this order, be<lb/>cause it directs to pay three different sums—the original could not possibly be drawn so, this is such a certificate as would be made if there was but one sum.</p>

               <p>early as the 10th—a direction to pay in money would have been attended to up to the very day of closing—there is generally a great rush of people before the office closes—a great number of orders are brought in for the payment of costs, which keeps the clerks employed—the office does not open again till about the 2nd of Nov., the first day of term—if the interest is calculated short of the day of payment we could not take the money—the Bank would not take it—the Accountant-General's direction is to pay in on or before, up to the date—there is no order that all sums paid to the Accountant-General should be paid in cash, and not by check—not one-tenth part of the railroad money has been paid in cash.</p>

I know the prisoner well—he lodged at my house two nights on Satur<lb/>day and Sunday, the 14th and 15th of Feb.—he first came in the early part of the day, and brought his clothes and box to my house—I saw him between six and seven o'clock that evening (Saturday)—he left me half-a-sovereign, and told me he had borrowed it of his mother—he said he had met with an acci<lb/>dent—I said, "Thomas, what is that?"—he said, "I have lost 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of mas<lb/>ter's property"—I said I was very sorry for it—he (the prisoner) said, "He will stop no more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or half-a-crown a week, till the money is made up"—I said, "Thomas, perhaps he will stop it all"—he afterwards came and told me his master had stopped it all—he left with me the duplicate of a watch-guard and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and told me, if any person called, to give him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the duplicate—nobody called, and I gave him back the money and du<lb/>plicate—he went out, and brought the watch-guard in, and put it on his watch—this was all on Saturday evening—he showed me a pistol that even<lb/>ing—he pointed it at me, and told me it was loaded—I asked him what he was going to do with it loaded—he told me he was going to Primrose-hill on Sunday to shoot birds—he went out between eight and nine that evening, as near as I can recollect, and returned at twelve—before he went to bed he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver to keep for him—he went out on Sunday morning between eight and nine, to his mother's, as he told me, and was not long away—I saw him about half-past eleven, and he was clean—all day on Sunday he kept fidgetting in and out—he came into the house about eleven at night, and went to sleep on a chair, and then went to bed—he was sober both on Satur<lb/>day and Sunday night, to the best of my belief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of King's-college hospital—on Monday morning, the 16th of Feb., about half-past six o'clock, the deceased, James Bostock, was brought to the hospital quite insensible, and the upper part of his body covered with blood, caused by a gun shot wound on the left ear—the ball lodged in the brain—he died shortly after three o'clock in the afternoon—I examined the head, found the ball in the right half of the brain, and produce it—that wound was, undoubtedly, the cause of his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have attended many cases in which accidents have happened to the head, in which there has been some pressure or congestion of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you found when that has occurred, persons subsequently may be subject to a certain partial derangement of the mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my own knowledge—it is likely—it might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a blow is inflicted on the head, the result of which has been insensi<lb/>bility for fifteen or sixteen hours, must that necessarily be the result of the brain being affected in some way or other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—it would be an affection of a somewhat serious character for a time—it might arise both from a rupture of a vessel or from concussion causing congestion of the vessels of the brain—congestion would not necessarily leave a turgidity in the vessels—it might do so in an elderly person, not in a young person—the circulation would go on right afterwards—the vessels might regain their strength, and they might not, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where either congestion or rupture of a vessel has once occurred, it would, I presume, leave those parts extremely susceptible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It all depends on the cause—congestion arising from a blow would not render the brain liable to disease in excitement—it may arise from some internal cause, from the body being out of order—congestion would be more likely to occur if a blow took place when the circulation of the blood was at all obstructed—cases of that kind have not come within my observation afterwards, merely at the time of accident.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>the cause subsides, the other would indicate disease of the organ—if a person of the prisoner's age met with an accident causing insensibility for fifteen or sixteen hours, and afterwards attended to his ordinary avocations and pursuits, I should certainly not infer there was any amount of disease in the brain.</p>

Finding nothing of it, I went and ac<lb/>quainted my master what had happened; my master was a little in drink, but not much, and said, 'Well, then, you must be the loser of it;' no more passed then, but I went up to get paid; when I went up I said, 'I have not found any tidings of the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sir.

I said, 'Cer<lb/>tainly I'll be the loser of it, and pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, if you will allow me;' he said, 'No, you won't, I will stop every b—y farthing to-night;" then said I, 'Sir, you doing so, what am I to keep myself on next week? 'Why,' says he, 'go to your mother and borrow money of her, as you have done be<lb/>fore. 'I said, I could not for shame's sake borrow of her, for I borrowed enough of her when I was out of work, the week I summoned you.'

'No, sir,' says I, 'I shall not, for my indentures express me as an indoor apprentice, and if you won't give me my wages, or part of them, you must keep me;' when he saw I would stop, he said, 'I'll d—d soon turn you out myself,' and then he commenced, and we had a scuffle; when he saw he could not get me out, he said, 'I'll not lay hands on you, I'll fetch a policeman; and on his going, mistress said, 'James, don't have no bother, but give the lad part of his money.' 'Not a d—d farthing,' he says; the policeman then came up, he gave me in charge for being riotous in his room and not going out, I stated what was the cause of it to the policeman, and he sadly wanted to take me—the policeman said, 'You must either pay it, or go down along with me;' so sooner than be locked up all Saturday night and Sunday I paid the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half a crown which I had borrowed of him, made it up 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I borrowed half a sove<lb/>reign of my mother; mistress was present, and I do not think she will deny it."</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a widow, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, my husband is living, but I have been separated from him nine years—my other children are both dead—the prisoner is the only one living—in the letter there is mention made of a person of the name of Lynch, a companion of his, a young man he was acquainted with—I do not know where <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Lynch is now—I have not seen him this week—I did the week before—there is a family of the name of Lynch—I saw him a week or ten days ago—he was a constant companion of my son, among others—they went out together on a Sunday before he was apprenticed, and since—he has not lived at my house lately—he has ceased to do that upwards of twelve months—I live in Queen's-place, Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields—he used to live with me, but as there were only myself and my aged mother, I thought it was very melancholy for him, and I thought it would do him service if I could get him somewhere where there were young men, to make him more comfortable—I placed him under the care of Mrs. Miers, who had an amiable son, and I thought it would be a good thing to get him there—my son did not make much of a companion of him—he was much given to study, and my son was so very different to that—he was a very great oddity altogether—he liked going out into the fields better than studying—he did not go to places of public amusement very often, I believe, nor to theatres very often—I had not much knowledge of his acquaintance with the young woman here to-day—I have known her above a month, and of their being acquainted—he took the laudanum when he was at work, not in my house—he was brought home to me from Mr. Bostock's—it was after his apprenticeship, and I went for Mr. Harvey—he did not attend him for more than a week—he was not living with me at that time—he had left me before that took place—I think he left me about a year ago—I cannot be certain when he took the laudanum—he did not live with me then—that was two years ago—I do not recollect any quarrel having taken` place with him about the time he was brought home—I know a man of the name of Nobbin, who worked for Mr. Bostock—Mr. Nobbin brought him home after he had a taken the poison—I wished him to come back to me at that time—I had a difference with him about that time about his coming back again—I wished him to come back again—he was not very willing to do so—he was against coming home—I was not at that time on very good terms with him—I was anxious for him to come back again—I do not know what he told Mr. Noddin—I did not hear anything said about his having taken the laudanum, because I was not on very good terms with him—I was not on good terms with him</p>

               <p>at that time, because he did not seem willing to come home—I consulted Mrs. Collins about binding him to Mr. Bostock—she is a friend of mine—I asked her advice—the indentures were drawn at Hoxton—he went on liking to Mr. Bostock's before he was bound, for some time, not so long as a month—he received wages from the first time he went, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, and then a rise up to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; and that he used to expend in his own way, living by himself, with the exception of what he gave me—he has borrowed money of me sometimes, shortly before this matter occurred, for two weeks running he had half-a-sovereign—he sometimes complained of Mr. Bostock's treatment of him—sometimes he said he behaved very well to him, and considered him a kind master—he was not twice in one tale—he sometimes said he treated him ill, and sometimes said he treated him kindly—I, in consequence of what he told me, spoke to Mr. Bostock about him, and Mr. Bostock made complaints—I spoke to Mr. Bostock more when the prisoner was present than in his absence—the last time but one I went was about twelve months ago, I cannot say exactly—Mr. Bostock had accused my son of attempting to break into his room—I went to Mr. Bostock, and told him if he thought he had any justification for what he said, the law was open to him to take him up, but if not, not to accuse him of theft—that was in my son's presence—Mr. Bostock as soon as he could waived the conversation, and began to talk about his own apprenticeship—he did not say anything about his attempting to break open the door—Mr. Bostock was in liquor—I went for the purpose of speaking to him about it—as far as I can charge my memory, he seemed to deny, or to that effect, that he had said the boy attempted to break into the room—he denied that he had said so, or words to that effect—he said he did not mean it if he said it—my son said nothing—many more words ensued on that occasion, in the same strain—I have seen him once since, after my son took him up for a half-crown—my son made a charge against him for stopping him for bad work, about a month ago from this time—my son summoned him to go before the Magistrate—I went on the occasion of the hearing of it—it was decided in favour of the master—he then went home to his master's house, but his master would not let him work—he said he should not keep his shop open for him—I heard that—his master told me so—that was in the presence of the prisoner—the hearing took place at Bow-street—my son then went by himself to Mr. Bostock—I after<lb/>wards went there, and found Mr. Bostock would not let him stop there—I found him at his lodgings—my son then told me that his master would not let him work—that was a month ago—I told my son I was going to the master, and I brought him to the master myself the same evening—Mr. Bostock then told him he was not going to keep his shop open for him, and told me he should not come that night—he said so out of my son's presence and in his presence—my son thought he was ill-treated by Mr. Bostock's refusal, and said that Mr. Bostock would not let him come there with me—I asked Mr. Bostock, when he refused to let my son come to work that evening, if he would let me have an interview with him—he said it was not convenient then, he would in an hour—I went in an hour—I saw my son after seeing Mr. Bostock—I told my son what had passed between me and Mr. Bostock—Mr. Bostock still refused to let him come that evening—I told my son so—he said he knew Mr. Bostock would not let him come, because he would not give him an oppor<lb/>tunity of defending himself—it was after that that I went alone to Mr. Bostock on that evening—I saw my son again, after the interview with Mr. Bostock—I told him Mr. Bostock still refused to receive him—Mr. Bostock said he would not keep the shop open for him—throughout the whole of the transaction my son appeared to consider himself ill-treated by Mr. Bostock—that was about a month ago—I cannot charge my memory as to any other occasion on which I</p>

               <p>interfered with respect to any differences between him and Mr. Bostock—this was the last that I am speaking of—I cannot charge my memory how many times I have heard my son complain of Mr. Bostock's ill-using him—it may be as many as eight or ten times—he told me Mr. Bostock was careless in not learning him his work—my son complained of Mr. Bostock not teaching him his work, and he complained of Mr. Bostock using most cruel and foul language to him—I have seen him generally on the subject of these complaints of my son, and spoke to him about it—I am certain that there was reason for his complaining, he did not teach him, and that he used foul language to him sometimes—it did not appear to me that he taught him as much as he ought of his trade—all the com<lb/>plaints made by him of Mr. Bostock were much to the same effect—I do not know anything more about the charge of breaking into the room than I have told you of—I went up and saw Mr. Bostock, who was in liquor—he was much addicted to it—he never complained that his master got drunk, but I have seen him so—on that occasion Mr. Bostock said if he had said so he did not mean it, or something to that effect—he did not deny that he had said so—I do not keep the house I live in—there are three families live in the house besides—I have lived there about eight months, I think—my son has come frequently there to see me—he was very kind to me—he used to come and fetch my water, and do anything, and behave kindly, as a son ought—he made no acquaintance with the other people in the house—he had several acquaintances of his own—persons living in the neighbourhood—I do not know any of his acquaintances—at the time the fall happened he was not at school—when he left school he was about nine years of age—at that time he was an errand-boy—he was at Mr. Payne's, in Great Queen-street, where I work at trimming coach-lace—he acted as errand-boy there, I think, about two years, behaved very well, and was trusted by his employers—he had left there when the fall happened to him—he was working then at Mr. Smith's, in Long-acre, a book shop, not as errand-boy, but as a machine-ruler—he was there, I think, upwards of two years—he has not been in many places—he was receiving wages at the time the fall occurred on his head—he was getting 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—I think he soon left after that, if I charge my memory right—he went back to his work after he got better—how much less than a week, I cannot exactly say, but it was not exceeding a week, and then he went back to his former employers—his fall was against a brick wall as he was playing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were not present at the time of the accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when he was brought home to me he was in a state of insensibility—at that time he was an errand-boy—he remained ill somewhere about a week, and then went back to work—during the time he remained ill, I had to support him—I am a poor woman, and have an aged mother to support—he was then thrown upon me for support entirely—owing to my circumstances, when he went back he was not fully recovered—perhaps he might have gone back too early—in my opinion, he was not fully recovered—he did not remain there any length of time—before the accident occurred I had no reason to suppose he would leave the service—he came home to me after he had left the service, to live with me—from that time I always considered there was a difference in him from what there had been previous to the fall—it was about this time that these matters took place about the meals—he had not pursued that course of conduct before the fall—but he was a very strange child from his birth, he has a defective vision—as far as I can answer I think it was born with him—he used to come and desire to have his meals and then leave them—he did so very frequently—it was on account of my having observed him to be melancholy that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230065"/>
               <p>he left me—that was after I had observed the alteration in his conduct—when he complained of his master's conduct to him, he referred to it generally—sometimes he said his master was a good master, and sometimes a bad master—he did not speak of any particular occasion, but generally—on one occasion I heard from him that his master had made a charge against him of breaking into his room—when I went to the master he did not exactly deny it, but seemed to intimate that he did not mean it—he said he heard a rumbling at the door—I was before the Magistrate with my son, the decision was in the master's favour—my son did not exhibit any anger about his master to me after that, or use any threats—he was not received back immediately to his trade, but he was in work when this matter happened—he did not go to work after his master had been to the Magistrate, not that evening, he did the next morning, and continued to work till the morning of this occurrence—I found this letter in his pocket—I wanted him to come home, and he preferred not doing so—there were never any words passed between us, or any quarrel—generally speaking he has been a kind son to me—he did not exhibit the least cruelty to me—I have received wages from him—I have had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one week—I have received wages from him on more occasions than one, towards my own support—he squints, and has bad sight at well—I cannot exactly answer whether it increased after the accident occurred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Great Queen-street, Lin<lb/>coln's-inn-fields. I have been in business for fifteen years—I know the prisoner—I was called in to attend him from a fall that he had had, about seven years back—when I arrived at the house he was in a state of insensibility—I was called in in the evening—I should think he remained insensible about fourteen or sixteen hours—I did not remain with him during the whole time—I saw him on the following morning, at perhaps between ten and eleven—he had not then come quite to himself, but partly so—I remained in attendance on him perhaps about a week—I heard that it arose from a fall—I considered that insensibility arose from some oppression of the brain—I did not see any marks of the fall particularly on his head—I am hardly able to speak defini<lb/>tively as to the nature of that oppression—it is just possible that it might have arisen from rupture of a vessel, or from congestion—there is no doubt it must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230066"/>
               <p>have arisen from one of those two causes—(I fancy I had seen the prisoner once or twice before that accident for simple illnesses—I knew him but not to notice him)—it is just possible that either of those causes might affect the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it affect the brain in such a manner as to cause insanity in some patients? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I speak from inference, it might do so—supposing either of those causes existed at that time, it would undoubtedly render the brain more susceptible—great excitement of mind would very much add to the effect—I saw no more of the prisoner until about two years since, when I was called in and found him suffering from the effects of opium—he was in a state of stupor which would follow a large dose of laudanum—I think I attended him about three or four days at that time—I should say he was in danger certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would such a dose of opium as you found him labouring under affect the brain materially? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that it would affect the brain so, very materially, still I should augur that it would operate in that way—I should not say it would affect the brain permanently, on all occasions—it might do so permanently—if the brain were previously diseased or injured I think that would render the chances of permanency greater—if it were permanent, I should say it would interfere with the reason—he was not quite recovered when I left him—he was recovered from the greater danger—I have not seen him from that time to this—I have noticed his vision—if I was asked whether it is a congenital defect or a squinting, I should give an opinion that it might perhaps be on the side of congenital defect of the brain—persons having dis<lb/>ease on the brain sometimes exhibit such appearances—they do not always indicate an affection of the brain—from the sort of appearances I observed about the prisoner I should say there was something the matter with the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not an established distinction between conges<lb/>tion of the brain, and the effects that that congestion may have, if caused by ex<lb/>ternal violence in one instance, or by spontaneous congestion in the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know of no distinctive difference—I differ certainly from the gentleman who has been examined in the nice distinction he makes as to that—I do not think I could tell which was which—possibly congestion from violence might be the more permanent—I should consider that congestion arising from a blow would be more permanent in its effects than congestion arising from constitutional de<lb/>fect or from disease—the effect on the constitution might be longer, and might subject the individual to disease in after life—a state of insensibility may be produced from a blow, from the shock given to the brain, without causing any congestion of the vessels of the brain—I should have called this concussion—in this case I should have augured that it was accompanied by Congestion—there was coma—that might certainly be presented without any congestion—there was no other symptom in particular upon which I form my opinion that there was congestion, that might arise from mere concussion—I did not notice any external mark on the head—I looked for it—I conjecture that there was an amount of disease that might either be severe congestion or rupture of a vessel—I could not pledge my professional opinion that there was a rupture of a vessel—that would be followed by extravasation of blood on the brain itself—I saw no pressure on the optic nerve—I desired him to be kept very quiet, and used the ordinary treatment, quietude and raising the head—I took no blood—I saw him from day to day for a week—I do not think he resumed his employment again before I left him—I gave him emetics to remove the opium—I saw him from day to day for a week—when I first saw him he squinted—I do not say a person squinting from infancy always</p>

               <p>indicates a defect of the brain, I say it might indicate it—I say congenitally it might have an effect on the brain.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it that a person having a defective brain squints? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a person who squints may have a defective brain—I have known squinting occur at an advanced period of life from some defect of the brain, and have known it arise from a blow, from concussion—if a person looked straight for years, and met with an injury in the head and afterward squinted, I should infer that to some injury done to the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where they have squinted from birth that inference would not arise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If so, I should be inclined to believe it was a defect of the brain—I should not infer it congenital squinting nor to any cause in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose, if you saw a person in a state of insensibility, and heard they had a blow on the head, you would use the term concussion to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the brain would not be acting properly at the time—it is difficult to say whether it arises from congestion or a rupture of a vessel of the brain—it is not of necessity either—there may be concus<lb/>sion of the brain without a rupture of the vessel, or congestion—from a shock given to the nervous system—concussion is a term applicable to a rupture of the blood-vessels, to congestion of the brain, or a shock of the nervous sys<lb/>tem—I do not mean to say a person who squints from his birth is insane—there may be disease affecting the nerves of the eye connected with the nerves of the brain causing that appearance.</p>

I live at No. 8, Cradle-court, Red Cross-street—I knew the deceased, Martin—he was in St. Martin's workhouse—that was his last residence before he died—I know the prisoner—he lived in Cradle-court—I lived with him for two years and a half—I had not previously lived with him—I had previously lived with Martin, but not for above these three years—I did so for thirteen years, and had four children by him—the two last are living—we were compelled to separate, through being distressed, about three years ago—there was about twelve months interval between my separating from the one and living with the other—I was in the house myself—on Tuesday, the 17th of Feb., between ten and eleven, Martin came to No. 8, Cradle-court, where I was, to remove my things belonging to me—he first came on the Tuesday morning—I had told the prisoner on the Monday morning that I would not live with him any longer—Martin was assisting me in removing the furniture which was left to me by my uncle—Martin came again after that, and we went out together—it was about one o'clock, or I should say, between twelve and one when we came back—Martin remained there with Feacy, and we all three sat talking together—Feacy made an objection at first in the morning to my removing the things—that was the cause of our going out—in the afternoon I went out, between one and two, to look for a room to remove my things to, and Martin remained there with Feacy and their children—no one else—the elder child is nine years of age, and the other seven—I came back about two, I should think, or between two and three—I cannot say exactly the time—I found them both there—Martin had tied up the bed ready to be removed, and took it away to the lodging that I had taken, and I remained on the stairs—he came back again, and we went into the room, and then Martin began to undo the bedstead, and while he was doing so, I gave him a bed-winch out of the drawer—Martin said that would not undo it, and I went to see if I could borrow one, and when I came back Martin had undone the bedstead without it, and had tied it up partly, and while tying it up Feacy asked me about a shirt—it was a shirt belonging to my uncle—I was looking up the dirty things, and I picked up the shirt, and said to Martin, "This is one of my uncle's," and I said to Martin, "Never mind that; let him have that;" and I threw it down on the floor—Martin said, "Oh! he shan't have that;" and with that Feacy laid hold of it, and there was a struggle between the two—Martin twisted it out of his hand, and threw it on the floor, and with that Martin stooped to finish tying up the bedstead, and while he was stooping tying up the bed<lb/>stead, Feacy took the knife, and run it into his side—the knife laid on the table when he took it a few minutes before I saw it—the table was near to him, on the left-hand side of him—they were one on each side</p>

I am stabbed"—I run down stairs instantly to the landlady, in the bottom room, and said, "Oh! he has stabbed Martin"—my eldest son was there, and I said, "Run for the doctor," and he run for the doctor, Mr. Ponder, in Redcross-street—when I came back, I went up stairs, and the police had got the prisoner—the name of the deceased was Thomas Martin—he re<lb/>mained in the room till next day—I have seen him since his death.</p>

I am stabbed"—I told it to those in the house where I lived—I have said a great deal concerning it since the poor fellow has been dead—I said it to the landlady—she is not here—and to others—I was very much alarmed at the time—I ran down as fast as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and live at No. 54, Redcross-street, City. On Tuesday afternoon, the 17th of Feb., I was called to Cradle-court—I found Thomas Martin there—I saw him in the corner of a room lying onthe prisoner—Martin said, "I am the man that is stabbed, and this is the man who has stabbed me"—Martin then showed me a knife, and said, "This is the knife that has done it"—I then assisted the wounded man to a chair—the pri<lb/>soner was given into custody of the police—Martin became faint when sitting on the chair—I immediately laid him down—the faintness increased very rapidly, he became perfectly collapsed, the skin cold and damp, and the extremities, and without any pulse perceptible—after using means for resuscitation he gradually revived—a temporary bed was made for him, on which he was placed—I then examined the wound, after taking off the belt, which he had round him at the time—I found the wound as I thought, between the eleventh and twelfth, but I have since discovered it was between the tenth and eleventh rib—I had the assistance of another medical gentleman, Mr. Parnell, of Char<lb/>terhouse-square—we afterwards examined more minutely, and found that the wound passed obliquely downwards, probably to the extent of an inch, or an inch and a half—I could not exactly say at that time—I rendered him every assistance that could be done for him, and he was removed to the hospital next morning, about one o'clock—I superintended his removal, and took every care that his person should not be shaken in any way—I saw him every day after that, but the day on which he died, which was Saturday, about a quarter past eleven o'clock—I saw him when dead, on the Sunday, about two o'clock in the morning, in the dissecting-room—the wound did not penetrate the thorax—I said it did at the police-court, but I had an opportunity of cor<lb/>recting that afterwards—it was such a wound as might be produced by a weapon like that, and in my opinion the wound was the cause of death—I have not the least doubt of that myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. In consequence of infor<lb/>mation, I went to the office of Messrs. Grissell and Peto, of York-road, Lambeth, and on Saturday morning, the 24th of Jan., I went with Stevens to the works at the station of the railway at Ponder's-end, which is now about being constructed—I marked every piece of timber that I found on the works—there is a large shed, or warehouse, erected there, and the greatest part of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230073"/>
               <p>the timber was in that shed—I marked from twenty to thirty planks there, from fifteen to twenty feet long—the prisoner James Adams sen., keeps the Railway Tavern public-house, close to these premises—there are some large sticks of timber adjoining the line of the railway on the works—on the night of the 26th of Jan. I was watching from nine till twelve o'clock—between eleven and twelve I saw Arthur Adams come out of the Railway Tavern—he went to a stable on the premises of his brother, James Adams the younger, took a horse out harnessed, took it into a shed, and brought out a cart with the horse—at that time James Adams the younger came out of the tavern and joined him—some conversation took place between them about watering the horse—Arthur then left, and, as he was leaving the horse and cart, James Adams, jan., said to him, "Let us have those deal boards out"—he then put the cart into the shed again, and went into an adjoining building with a candle and lantern, brought out some pieces of wood, and put them into the shed where the cart was placed—Arthur Adams was away at that time—he returned with a pail of water, while James Adams was coming out of the adjoining building with a second bundle of wood—I saw James Adams the elder come out of the Railway at the time that James Adams the younger took the third parcel of wood in the shed—the three prisoners were then altogether in the shed—I then heard a rumbling noise, as if some wood was being put into the cart—the three prisoners came out of the shed together with the cart—they went in front of the Railway Tavern, and there was some conversation, but I do not know what that was—James Adams the elder and Arthur Adams went away with the cart, and James Adams, jun., remained—I gave a signal to a police<lb/>officer to stop the cart—I ran on, and got into the cart—I said to James Adams, sen., "What have you got here?"—he made no answer—I com<lb/>menced searching the cart, and found in the hind part of it ten pieces of Wood, covered over with sacks, or a horse-cloth, but I did not examine that—it was covered with something—here is one of the ten pieces—it is one that I had marked when it was in the shed that was about being erected on the premises—when I marked it it was from fifteen to twenty feet long—here are two other pieces which are marked—when I marked them they were in the building that is erecting near the line—the shed the timber was taken from that night is at some distance from that building, and is on James Adams the younger's premises—I believe it is a building for the reception of coals—I asked James Adams, sen., where he got this wood from—he said, "From the Railway Tavern"—I took him and Arthur Adams into custody—I returned, and took James Adams, jun.—I told him I had stopped his father and brother with some wood in their possession, and I had come to take him—I searched his house, and found a great quantity of wood, which is here in sacks—I took James Adams, sen., to his house at Cheshunt, and found there a great quantity of wood—as I was conveying James Adams, jun., to the station, he said, "Others ought to be in this as well as me."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brunswick-street, Soho, and am a shoemaker. On the 17th of Feb. I spent the afternoon at a public-house—I saw all the three prisoners there—I left the house for a particular purpose, and went to a wart—it was then nearly dark, between half-past five and six o'clock—while there I was struck at the back of my neck, and I fell on my knees—the pri<lb/>soner Williams had passed me about a second before I received the blow—he was not above a yard from me—he came back when I was down, pushed me on my chest, and pushed me down on my back; and when I was on my back, he took my ribbon and watch out of my waistcoat pocket, snapped it off, and broke it—I did not see either of the other prisoners at that time, but about a second afterwards they were close to my person—Wood seized me round the waist and held me, and the two men ran across through the court together—Wood did not go back with me to the public-house—she went part off the way with me, and came into the public-house afterwards—I have not found my watch—I am quite sure it was in my pocket—I was not quite sober, but I was sober enough to know what took place.</p>

On Tuesday, the 17th of Feb., the prosecutor came to my house about one o'clock—he drank several half-pints of wine—I served him with five and the young man with one—I went away at three o'clock, he was there then—I came back about six o'clock, he was there then—Wood had been drinking with him—she was nearly as tipsy as he was—I saw Williams and Ryan there about six o'clock—Wood and the prosecutor had been away somewhere—they returned, and Wood made an observation that some man with one arm had got the watch—(the prisoner Williams has only one arm)—Wood said it was done in some court in Wild-street—Williams was not there at that time—Wood said if the prosecutor came home with her she had got the ticket of his watch, and he should have it for a sovereign—she exhibited a ticket, and I looked at it—it was the ticket of a whittle, not of a watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I am sixteen years old—I was in the service of Messrs. Figgins, the type-founders, ten or eleven weeks, and was then taken into custody—on the 24th of Jan. I took one of my master's moulds—I took it to Mr. Somers, a pawnbroker, in Bath-street; to Mr. Brooks, a pawn<lb/>broker, at the corner of Banner-street; to Mr. Reeves, a pawnbroker, in Red<lb/>cross-street; and to another pawnbroker's, at the corner of New-street and Old-street, but I do not knew their name—I offered it in pawn at those places, but I did not succeed in getting rid of it—I went next to Mr. Blunt's, a type<lb/>founder, in Bartholomew-square, Old-street—he was not at home—I then went to the prisoner, in Bartholomew-close, which is not far from Messrs. Figgins—they live on one side of Smithfield, and the prisoner on the other—I think it was about seven o'clock in the evening when I got to the prisoner's—I saw him and his son—I produced the mould which I had stolen—the prisoner asked me whose it was—I said it was my brother's—he asked me what I wanted for it—I told him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would give me three half-crowns for it—I told him my name was Blunt—I did not say where I lived or where I came from—I handed the mould over to him—he told me, when I went in, to go through the passage into the kitchen—I went into a room with him and put the mould on a table—I wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would give me three half-crowns—I said I dare say it was worth more than that, and then he said he would give me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and I got the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him—he said he could not try it while I waited, it would take him a good bit to try it, to make it hot—he asked me if I had any more tools or anything, or any more articles—I said I believed my brother had one or two more little things, and he said any time I brought them round he would purchase them of me—he did not say any more at that time—I went away—on the following Saturday evening, the 31st, I took three more moulds to the prisoner—I found him and his son and two women there—I went into the same back room, at the end of the passage, as before—I put the moulds on the table—the prisoner, his son, and the two women were there—I told the prisoner I had brought him three more—he asked me what I wanted for them—I said I wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I thought they were worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he said he would give me the same as he gave me for the other—during this conversation in the room a lad who worked for the prisoner was going out, and he told him to shut the door—the women were present—I did not consent to take the money he offered me—I was coming away with the moulds, and he said he would give me 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I said I would take 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three—these are the four moulds—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I believe this is the one I took on the 24th—I do not know the numbers of them—the prisoner sent a lad, who was coming down stain, out for change for a sovereign—that lad was not present at the transac<lb/>tion—the prisoner then paid me a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him there was a matrix in one of the moulds—he said the matrix was of no use without he had the whole of them—he asked me my name, and I told him Henry Blunt—he asked me where my brother worked—it came into my mind to tell him he worked in Scotland, and I told him so, but at present he was living in King-street, Islington—a paper was produced, and I believe the prisoner's son produced it, but I will not be sure—I wrote "Henry Blunt" on it—he opened this mould with the matrix in it, and looked at this other large mould, and said it was not finished.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a type-founder—I received some communication, and obtained a search-warrant—I went to Mr. Pavyer's premises, with Roe, a City officer, a sergeant of police, and Sime—his premises are in Bartholo<lb/>mew-close, on one side of Smithfield, and my premises are in West-street—I am in an extensive way of business—I searched the prisoner's premises for a mould, No. 860—I did not find that at that time, but I found another mould, No. 847—when I went there was some little delay, the prisoner not being at home—Me went in search of him—the sergeant went up stairs, and as there was some little commotion in the house, I thought it best to proceed at once, and I proceeded to search—Sime pointed out the mould, No. 847, that was found by him on a shelf in the warehouse—three other moulds were pointed out by the prisoner's son, in the warehouse—it is a parlour used as a warehouse—there was type and scales in it—it is a room in front—these were apart from his own moulds—his own moulds were up stairs in the foundry—there was chiefly manufactured type in that room, and scales—I went there on Thursday, the 12th of Feb.—I am quite certain all four of the moulds are my property—the prisoner produced this paper to me, as the receipt for the money—Sime was in the room at the time—at that time I had not the least notion about the witness Bland—he had been in my employ for two or three months—I have seen Bland write since, and none of it is like what he wrote—he wrote a very small, cramped hand—I never saw him write before—his writing was not at all like this.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FIGGINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were present at the exami<lb/>nation of this case before the Alderman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this paper was then pro<lb/>duced by Mr. Child, the prisoner's solicitor—at the time I made the search at the prisoner's premises, I had no knowledge at all of who the person was that had taken this property from me—I took the prisoner's son round to one of the addresses which he gave to me, to Mr. Barlin, the tobacconist, in St. John-street—it was represented that the person who sold the mould was working at cigar-making—he went through all Mr. Barlin's establishment, and did not recognise any one—I then took him round my own foundry, where Bland and all the persons were at work—he did not recognise any one there—I think last Saturday week was the first time I had Bland followed—it was about a week after the investigation had been made by the prisoner's son at my factory—when I had Bland followed, he dodged and showed other symptoms which caused my suspicion—on Saturday night last, when he came to fetch his things, I had him in—(he had absented himself for several days before)—I had him apprehended.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe the type-founders are men of large capital, and there are not many of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are not many—Mr. Caslon, myself, Mr. Sharwoods, and Mr. Wilson—we have a considerable number of men—there are persons who have more or less extensive concerns—there are small houses—I cannot tell what goes on on their premises—I do not know that these articles find their way to the pawnbrokers, and are sold by auction, and that is the way in which some type-founders possess them—my own father began in a small way, and yet he always made his own moulds—the principal part of the business is done by persons in a large way—I do not think that to make your own moulds would require a capital which a person in a small way does not possess—a man might make one mould—Sime had been in the employ of my father and myself about nineteen years—he left me for about twelve months—I dismissed him because he was so irregular in his attendance—he was drunk occasionally, but I never heard anything against his honesty during the nineteen years I knew him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In point of fact are these things in which you are making day by day improvements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There have been little improvements constantly going on—no house when they make improvements dispose of those that are less perfect—we can always alter them for out-of-the-way things—we pay a man who makes these moulds from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—it would take him eight or nine days to make a mould—we consider the mould is worth three guineas when it is made.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for nineteen years in the employ of Mr. Figgins—I occasionally got drunk—after being there nineteen years I went to work for Mr. Pavyer, for the last few months, for two or three days in a week—on the 24th of Jan. Mr. Pavyer told me he had bought a nice new pica steel mould, of Scotch manufacture, made by one Blunt of Edinburgh—I said (I being an Edinburgh mould-maker, and the first who introduced the system of making these moulds in London, to Mr. Figgins's foundry,) that there was no such man as Blunt, a mould-maker in Edinburgh—I had worked in Edin<lb/>burgh and learned the business there—I am sure this was on Saturday, the 24th of Jan.—Mr. Pavyer'sson then brought up the mould in presence of his father—it was this pica mould, No. 860—I knew it directly, and said, "That mould never was made in Edinburgh; it was made at Mr. Figgins's foundry, and I was the last person who took it to pieces, and repaired it" (when I went to work at the prisoner's he knew perfectly well that I had worked at Mr. Figgins's)—when I said that, the prisoner told me that the young had who brought them had twenty more for sale—I took off this wood part on the side of the mould, and showed his son and him how particularly I knew it, by the screws and the different way they are made in England, and by the No, of it—I said, "Gentlemen, were I in your place I would endeavour to detect the man, or secure him if he comes again, and let Mr. Figgins know of it;" the prisoner said to his son, "Never mind, Benjamin, take it down stairs, it will be of use some time."</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with Mr. Henry John Collett, at No. 5, Seymour-place, Camden-town—he keeps a toy-shop. I was in the shop on the 11th of Feb., at half-past eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner Scott, and another, who is not here, came into the shop—they purchased a halfpenny ball, and went out—they came in again, and wanted the ball changed for a halfpenny shuttlecock—Scott went with me to where the shuttlecocks stood in the shop, and the one who is not here stood against the door—I gave them a shuttlecock, and they went away—as soon as they were gone a little girl came in—I looked into the window, and missed a card and some knives—Scott had proposed to look at those knives—I had shown them to him, and put them back</p>

I passed the prosecutor's shop on that Wed<lb/>nesday evening—I saw the prisoners Pearson and Westbrook looking in at the window—I saw Scott inside the shop, looking in the window, and another boy who is not here—Scott came out with seven knives under his jacket—he ran away with them—he had come out with a ball first, and looked at it, and spoke to Westbrook and Pearson—he went inside again, and came out with the knives—the boy who is not here went in, put his right hand behind him, and drew the knives out of the window—Scott stood behind him—he took them from him, doubled them up, and ran out with them—Westbrook and Pearson ran after him—they all ran together down Hawley<lb/>crescent—they could see the other boy draw the knives from the window—they were watching him, looking in at the window—when I was noticing what was going on, Pearson said to me, "What do you want here?"—I said, "What has that to do with you?"—I went and told my master, and he told the policeman.</p>

M." had been picked out, but the mark was very legible—I asked the prisoner if she knew anything of that, and told her she had no occasion to answer me the question unless she thought proper—she said she did not—I found a pillow-case in the tame cupboard; and in a cupboard on the other side of the fire-place I found a bed-quilt, a quantity of new calico, and three dusters—I asked if they could tell me how they came by that bed-quilt—Mrs. Cook said she had bought it of a tallyman, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for it—I went into the back place, and found three knives and five forks, which were identified by Mr. Cocksedge, the steward, as belonging to the establishment—we then left with the prisoner, and she was taken, to the station—we went before Mr. Bingham, and she was remanded till Friday—she was allowed out on bail, and on the Saturday she went to fetch her boxes and things away from the establishment—a short time after she had left I was shown some things by Mr. Cocksedge—I took them with me to the station—the prisoner was store-keeper in the establishment—I brought away the things from Mrs. cook.</p>

Weston <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> right away from me across the street, and stood against the wall, as if he had not a hand in it—I saw him run across the street, and he was one who had been holding me down—I am positive of that—he was the only one I recognised—the policeman came up—I told him what had happened—I went right straight to Weston—I said, "Here is one of them," and gave him in charge—I did not see Murphy after I was in the house, nor Selliss—he came out of the house after me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living in Newington-terrace, Dover-road—in Aug. last and previously I was engaged in buying shares in public companies, about Capel-court and the neighbourhood of the Stock Exchange—I know a gentleman named James Gibbons, living at No. 9, Collet-place, Commercial-road—on the 10th of Aug. I received from him this letter of allotment in the British and Irish Union Railway Company, for which I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per share—that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it that same month to Smith, Payne, and Smith, the bankers appointed to receive the deposits—I had received money from Mr. Brown, who had money there, and I paid a deposit of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per share—this is the bankers' receipt—on the 17th of Sept. I was in the Hall of Commerce, where I am a subscriber—my name was called out in the hall—I went up, and found the prisoner—I had seen him before several times, and knew him about there as a party who was in the habit of selling letters, but in no other way, not to have any conversation with him, no more than he may have come up and asked me the price of any particular railway—I did not know who or what he was—he said, "Have you a banker's receipt for some shares in the British and Irish Union Rail<lb/>way? Mr. Gibbons has sent me for it, to get the scrip"—he did not name the number of shares—I replied, "I am glad of it, for I want the scrip to deliver to be sold"—in order to get the scrip, it must be signed by the original allottee—I believed that he came from Gibbons, as it was a very common occurrence at that time, and I went and got the receipt from Mr. Brown, and handed it to the prisoner—when I gave it to him I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "To Westminster"—I said, "How long shall you be?"—he said, "About an hour or an hour and half"—he did not come back—I saw no more of him till he was in custody three or four months after—we had been after him for a long time, and I had him put in the "Hue and Cry" as well—I never got the letter, the scrip, or one penny—I have lost about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it.</p>

               <p>believe you must be a freeman of London to be admitted a broker—I am not acquainted with the City—I did not serve my apprenticeship in London—I never did anything before I became a share-jobber—I had money—I decline to say how I got it, as I do not see that it has anything to do with this matter—I was in no occupation or employment before I took to share-jobbing—I was not in any one's service—I first took to share-jobbing in Capel-court—it was at Bristol that I was a member of the Stock Exchange—I did not start there—I am a native of Croydon—my father resides at Lincoln—I was learning the corn business at Lincoln, not in any shop—I went to a gentleman to teach me the corn business—I left Lincoln about five years since—my name is Hitchins—I always understood so—I never laboured under the notion that it was Gibbons—I have gone by the name of Gibbons for about twelve month—I was not called Gibbons in the Hall of Commerce—I went there by my own name—I was never called out by the name of Gibbons there—I have been so addressed by parties in the habit of congregating in Capel-court—I did not tell them my name was not Gibbons, but Hitchins—if they had called me <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Smith, I should have answered them, and for this reason, I knew pretty Well the characters that associated there, and it made no difference to me what they called me—I never called myself the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—this letter of allotment is to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I am not aware that Mr. Gibbons is the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I never knew him by any other name—I never knew him with a broad-brimmed hat and canonicals—it was no business of mine how Gibbons got the shares allotted to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I made no inquiries as to who he was—it was no business of mine, or as to whether there ever was such a person—I got this letter from Mr. Gibbons for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to do what I thought proper with it, either to sell it or to get the scrip—I got it from Gibbons about a month before it was obtained from me by the prisoner—it was in the possession of Mr. Ebenezer Brown, who acted for me as broker occasionally—he had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine—I went to him, and got a check from him to pay the deposit—I had not seen Gibbons, I think, for a fortnight or so—I asked him on that occasion if he knew when the deed would be in town—he said he did not—I said, "Well, I should like this done as soon as the deed comes to town, for I don't wish to hold them"—he said it was coming up from the solicitor at Dumfries—it was to be delivered back to Gibbons for the purpose of getting the scrip—I knew no person in the transaction but Gibbons—the deed must be signed before the scrip is obtained—the name of Joseph Fletcher must be put to the deed if the letter of allotment was in that name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Either the real Joseph Fletcher must come, or there must be a forged Joseph Fletcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I know nothing about—I have heard about those things the same as you may have done—I knew Mr. Yeakell by being about the court—I had no dealings with him—I did not supply the funds to defend him when he was tried here for forgery, nor did I employ a solicitor to defend him, or communicate to any solicitor about it—that I swear—I gave the letter to the prisoner for the purpose of Gibbons getting the scrip—I cannot tell whether Gibbons was to sign the deed or who was to do it—if he had done it I should not have asked him whether he had or had not done it—I never thought about whether he would sign it or not—I did not give the prisoner the letter for the purpose of Gibbons signing the deed, that I am aware of—I did not, on my oath, believe that Gibbons would sign the deed—I solemnly swear that—I never thought at all how he was to get the scrip—I have never inquired whether there was such a person as the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I have had nothing more to do with it than bringing the prisoner to justice—I am not aware that I have ever received any letters directed to</p>

               <p>the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I have not-never in my life—I swear I never received letters from Mr. Brown directed to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I recollect having some letters from Mr. Brown, but not for the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I do not know the Rev. Joseph Fletcbor—the letters I have received from Mr. Brown were always directed to Hitchins—I swear that—I have applied in my own name for letters of allotment, and I have purchased a great numher in other people's names—I have handed them over to the persons from whom I purchased them, for the purpose of signing the deed, they not being the persons to whom they were allotted—I have not been aware when doing so that I have been handing them over for the purpose of a forgery being committed—I have not known that in dozens of instances they have been handed over, and forgeries have been committed—I have not be<lb/>lieved it—I have never given it a moment's consideration—I know there have been investigations about this matter, and that it hat been a great deal talked about—if I pay these parties for their letters am I to ask them whether they are going to forge the deed?—I have not got an office where letters are sent in different names—Mr. Brown is not the person who receives all my letters in different names—he is a highly respectable man, and known by many gentlemen in the City—I know that the deeds must be signed for the purpose of getting the letters of allotment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you know they must be forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has nothing to do with me—I made no inquiries about that, and did not care about it—I should have received the scrip although the deed was forged—I had paid for it—I think the parties holding shares have been the sufferers—if I purchase a let<lb/>ter I am not compelled to ask a man if he is going to commit a forgery, or how he is to get the scrip—I have heard that there if no such person at the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I did not know that at the time I handed the letter of allot<lb/>ment to the prisoner—I was not informed to by Gibbons—I have never seen the deed.</p>

Q.</hi> In point of fact you never wanted to see the letter of allotment again, after you had got rid of it I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It made no difference to me whether I saw it again or not—I never gave a thought about seeing it again—I had sold it—I did not expect it would come back to me—I have had several transactions with Mr. Hitchins in the way of business, share transactions—I have done in shares—I am like most—I saw Hitchins after I had parted with the letter of allotment—he asked me if I had sent Thompson for it, and I told him I had not—I had no other conver<lb/>sation with him about it—I knew nothing about the deed at Dumfries—it made no difference to me where it was—I had got my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the job—I would not have signed the deed as the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I did not expect to be asked to do so—I never expected to be employed to sign the deed myself—if it had been brought to me I should have given it to the person I bought the letter from—that was not the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I have not tried to find him—I do not know whether there is such a person—I have been informed that there is no such person, but I do not know of my own knowledge—I was not informed so before I sold this allotment, or I should have had nothing to do with it—I did not believe that there was no such person before I sold the letter—I believed it was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> letter as far as it went—I did not write for shares in that name—I never received any letters directed to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I never received any letters from the post-master at Ilford—I never gave directions to the post-master at Ilford to send up any letters to town—I never had any communication of any kind with the post-master at Ilford, never about Fletcher, or to desire any letters to be sent up to me—I have never gone by the name of Car<lb/>penter, or received letters in the name of Carpenter—I never had a place at No. 3, Great Alie-street—I never got any letters from there—I never was there in my life to my knowledge—I do not know the place—I do not know No. 5, Fenchurch-street—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a person named Rix</hi>)—I do not know that person—I have never seen him before to my recollection—I have received no letters from him—I may have received letters in the way of business from many persons I cannot call to mind—I never received any letters of that description—I have not, to my knowledge, received any letters in Great Alie-street, Whitechapel—I swear I have not received letters of any description from Great Alie-street—I have not been to any house there and received letters, nor in any other street in Whitechapel—there is no place in Whitechapel where letters have been directed and where I have received</p>

               <p>them—I have received letters at Assembly-place, Mile-end—none directed to Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I have received business letters there—it was my place of business—I went by my own name there, Gibbons—if this letter had been handed back to me I should have given it to the person from whom I bought it—I had this from a gentleman named Upston, with whom I have had a good many transactions—I should have given it to him to get the shares from the party he bought it of—he would go to the person from whom he bought it, and he would go on till the Rev. Joseph Fletcher was found to sign the deed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live at No. 9, Newington-causeway—the prisoner has been in my service about three weeks—on the 13th of Feb., about twelve o'clock at noon, I had occasion to leave my house—I left my daughter in charge of the shop—I had a small bag in the till—I took some money out of the bag and left the remainder there—I saw sovereigns and half-sovereigns in it, as near as I can guess twelve sovereigns and eight half-sovereigns—the prisoner was out on business at that time—he was in the shop when I returned—I went directly into the adjoining place to dinner and my daughter was there—after dinner my wife sent the prisoner out—he came back and then went to his dinner—I went to the till a few minutes after he went to his dinner, and missed the bag—I sent for a constable and charged the prisoner when he returned with taking the bag out of the till—he said he had not got my property, and was never charged with dishonesty in his life, that I had a good character with him and he always bore one—the parlour commands a view of the shop, so that nobody can enter without being in view of the persons in the parlour—nobody came into the shop while I was in, till after the prisoner went to dinner—he went to dinner when the workmen came in, and I saw what part of the shop he went to—I went into the shop to him before he got fairly through the door—the door of the shop was in his hand—I had a looking-glass in the parlour and a glass case</p>

               <p>also, and when the door opens whoever enters it reflected in both—I had given the prisoner notice to leave, and he was to leave the following day, Saturday—a person in the shop could not go to the till without being seen by two or three of us in the parlour—the till is a long one with three divisions, and the bag was in quite the back department—the prisoner might draw it out without being observed, but he could not stand there without being observed—the glass-case on the top of the counter would conceal his drawing anything out—a person behind the counter could get to that part, but anybody coming in at the door would have been in view of the persons in the parlour—it could not be done by anybody on that side of the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chemical operator at Apothecaries-hall. I received three parcels from Kendall, in the early part of Dec. last—they con<lb/>tained oxalic acid—I ascertained that by subjecting them to a series of chemical examinations, and the result quite satisfied me of the nature of their con<lb/>tents—the two packages described to me as having been sent to Mr. Clouter, contained one fifty grains, and the other thirty-five grains—the corners of the papers were a good deal worn, and the acid was liable to be spilt out—I am not prepared to say whether the quantity contained in those two papers, if taken into the body, would be capable of causing death—we have no direct</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 3—"Newgate, London, Feb. 14, 1846. Dear brother,—About eighteen months ago Harriet gave a little party consisting of some of the neighbours' children to come to tea and spend the evening, among whom was Elizabeth Spriggs. At the time the party was given I asked to leave off my work about a quarter to seven; when I came home I noticed Elizabeth, but as I had never seen her before I did not look at her much at that time; in the course of the evening I had to go in to Mrs. Howe's, our next door neigh<lb/>bour, to fetch something, when she said to me, 'Did you notice what a very pretty girl that little Miss Spriggs is,'(meaning Elizabeth), and I said no, because being a stranger to me I did not think to look at her more than any of the others; when I went in the room again I did look at her, and I thought she was very handsome, and for about a week afterwards I could not forget her, and during that time I noticed persons (neighbours or their children) speaking to her, and it made me feel rather jealous to think that they could speak to her and I could not, and so I determined in my own mind that she should not speak to any one, and so I took some oxalic acid out of the bot<lb/>tom drawer in our parlour and took and bought two seidlitz powders, for which I gave 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I took and ground this oxalic acid up fine, and took and mixed it with the seidlitz powders, and put it in a letter, and posted it and sent it to Elizabeth, at Miss Ward's; at the time I wished it to kill her, but I was sorry afterwards that I had sent it at all; the letter was merely telling her to take it with a little cold water, and telling her I would come to tea with her on the following Sunday; however, I did not take any more notice of her till about three months after, when I saw her again. On new year's night Harriet gave another little party, and that was where I did see her again, and every word she spoke to any one made me feel jealous, and so I thought in my own mind that I would murder her, and so I wrote that letter threatening to murder her as she returned from St. George's church on the following Sun<lb/>day evening, which was some weeks after the second party, but I never, at the time, meant to fulfil the threat—however, the fact was, I had for a long while read a great many of Lloyd's works, in which were some most wonder<lb/>ful characters, and I thought at the time I could do as was represented in the books, and appear a very mysterious character, and then after that I wrote them letters to Miss Ward, and then to Mrs. Spriggs, and then to Mr. Humble; and when I signed your name and Miss Ward's name, which was signed in the first letter sent to Mr. Humble, I did not do it with the intention of doing either you or her any harm, and when I had gone so far writing so many let<lb/>ters I could not drop it, and so I thought I would send to Clouter's, not that I owed any of them any spite, nor did I, when I sent the poison to Elizabeth Clouter, wish her to take it, or wish her any harm—and then I sent some to Mr. Bowling's, and then to Mrs. Humble, and although I sent the poison to her I did not wish her to take it, for it was impossible for me to owe spite to a person who I never did see; and when I sent that letter to the church about Elizabeth's mother I did not owe her any spite, nor did I wish to injure her, but I thought it would be a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi> These are the facts of the case. My reason for beginning it, was as I have stated, concerning Elizabeth Spriggs, but I had no reason for keeping it up, nor did I ever wish to injure any one, but I used to think it a rare <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, and at the time I was not aware of the dangerous course I was pursuing. Dear brother, I have now stated it all to you. I am sorry, very sorry to think that I have pursued such a wicked course, but when I get my liberty again I promise I will fulfil that promise that I will do no<lb/>thing but what is upright and just. I used to write the letters up in Mr. Lewis's composing-room, during my dinner-hour, and I used to post them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230149"/>
               <p>when I went out. The first letter that was took to Miss Ward's I took there; it has cost me a trifle for postage, and besides, losing my time in writing them. If I only had the last eighteen months to go over again, and knew as much as I do now I should never be in trouble now. The three last letters that I wrote to Elizabeth was just what I felt towards her—and about going to Miss Ward's with the knife the night that I was taken, which was Feb. 3rd, 1846; when I knocked at the door the servant came and she asked me what I wanted; I said I wanted to see Miss Ward, and she said I could not see Miss Ward, but I could leave any message and she would take it to her, or if I would leave my name she would go and tell her, but I objected to that and said I wanted to see her; so she shut the door, while I waited outside, and said she would go and tell Miss Ward. In about three minutes' time Miss Ward came down and opened the door to me, and asked me what I wanted, so I said I wanted to see Miss Elizabeth Spriggs; so she wanted to know what for, and I would not tell her; so while I was talking some gentleman came to the door, so she called him by his name, and she said I had better come in; so we all went into the passage, and she then asked me what I wanted to see Elizabeth for, and so did the gentleman, saying he did not con<lb/>sider it a proper thing for a youth like me to see a young girl like that alone, however, I persisted in seeing her, and alone; so Miss Ward was quite agree<lb/>able, but the sister was not, and so, while I was waiting in the passage they sent for a policeman, and he also asked me, but I would not tell, so he asked me my name and address, and I told him, and then we went to the station-house; so he asked me what I had got about me, and I did not answer; how<lb/>ever, he searched me and found the knife. Now, if I had have seen Elizabeth Spriggs alone I meant to have told her I loved her, and asked her if she would try to have liked me, as I was a going to be tried to-morrow, found guilty, and then, perhaps, I might be away a long while, and I meant to have pulled out the knife and told her I would kill her when I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> her again if she would not do as I had told her, and then I meant to come away. The knife being dirty when I brought it away from home in the morning, in my tea-time I rubbed it on the stone, with the intention of cleaning it, not sharp<lb/>ening it. Talk about harming her, I would not harm a hair of her head, for I love her too dearly. While I was standing in the passage Miss Ward asked me if I sent those three last letters, and I said no, and I also denied telling her who I was, and she asked me if I had heard she had been annoyed by a great many letters, and if I had sent them, for she thought my name was Kil<lb/>lerby, she did not say why; I told her I had heard about it, but I did not send them, nor did I know the person that did. I was in the passage talking to her about half an hour. Now I have stated all the particulars just as they occurred. I am very sorry to think I have acted as I have, and when I get out of this trouble I will never do anything that shall bring me into trouble again. I have now told you all of it. Be so kind as to write to me, so that I may have the letter, the latest moment at two o'clock on Tuesday next, just telling me how to act. I have been the only person concerned in it, and I never did think that you bore any affection towards Elizabeth, nor did I suppose any one did. I have to ask pardon of all of you, and you also, dear brother. You must excuse bad writing, and you must make the sense you can of it, for all the trouble I have brought upon you and all the family.—Your truly sorrowful but affectionate brother, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY KIILERBY</hi>."</p>

               <p>twice before me—I found him labouring under severe inflammation, the symptoms of which were chiefly pain and fever—he complained of violent pain just on the left side of the pit of the stomach—it was attended with fever, and great constitutional excitement—he died on the 4th of Feb., I think—I opened the body afterwards—the immediate cause of death was inflammation of nearly the whole contents of the belly—it had spread, apparently, from the liver downwards—the liver was inflamed to a very great extent—the entrails were glued together by the result of inflammation—I speak of the viscera, the liver, stomach, bowels, and kidneys—there was a lacerated wound about the extent of an inch and a half on the left side of the liver, near the end, just emerging from the lower rib—no doubt it might be done by a blow, by some external violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you examined to see whether there was any appearance of external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did not find the least—I cannot say, to a few days, how long the violence had been inflicted before I saw him—the injury was not so great but what in some circumstances it might be recovered from, even such a case as this—it must not have taken more that a fortnight, I limit it to a week in my mind, to have pro<lb/>duced the state from which he died—I think that more probably the injury must have been inflicted a week before, than a fortnight—I first attended him on the 26th or 27th of Jan., and he died on the 4th of Feb.—I mean a fortnight before I first saw him—I think I am in a condition to state, with some de<lb/>gree of certainty, that external violence produced this—I know that no wound of the liver can take place without violence; and I know, also, that the inflammation I saw had spread all over the surface of the inside of the abdo<lb/>men, from the liver—I had not heard of his taking brandy a few days before he went to bed—I think that would not make any difference in my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had heard he had been walking about the streets, and doing his usual business, a week or ten days after the supposed violence, should you suppose that any preceding violence could have produced such a result? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, under some circumstances a slight wound of the liver as this was, might have passed off again, under favourable circumstances—it was an inch and a half long, and less than half an inch deep—I should not necessarily expect to find external violence corresponding, possibly I might—I cannot conceive anything but external violence could have produced the injury to the liver—I looked to see if there was any, having a doubt as to whether the injury was owing to violent vomiting, or to external injury—I satisfied myself that the stomach was sound, therefore it could not have been from vomiting.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he sometimes sensible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was more sensible than otherwise; occasionally he was quite rambling, quite delirious—I think, in the intervals, he was perfectly aware that he was dying—he did not show any desire to hear any statement of mine as regards his recovery, and I have rea<lb/>son to believe he heard me state to his friends that it was likely he would not recover—I said it so that he might hear me—I cannot be certain that he did hear me say so—I did not direct it to him, but to his friends—he might have heard me—I do not let my patients know they are about to die, unless I feel certain they are about to die—I had no doubt he was about to die seven days before—I did not think such a statement would influence him much, if at all—I partly thought him not very sensible of external impressions, and I was partly careless of the place in which I said it—I believe he would rather</p>

I keep the Vine public-house, Vine-yard—I know the prisoner by sight—I knew the deceased Townsley—I remember him and the prisoner being at my house together last Saturday night fortnight the 7th of Feb.—I saw them both in the tap-room—I had seen them in my house before on that night—not in company but in separate parties—I saw the prisoner first about ten o'clook in the evening, and Townsley at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, when I went to clear the house, and both were then in the tap-room—both appeared to me to be very tipsy—they went out among the rest, sepa<lb/>rately, perhaps two or three minutes apart—Townsley went out last—I suc<lb/>ceeded in clearing the house, and got my door shut before twelve o'clock—about ten minutes after the door was shut I heard a disturbance outside—it appeared to be people quarrelling—I heard angry voices—I went out and saw the prisoner and Townsley down on the pavement—Towmley was uppermost—I assisted them up and advised them to go away—they both insisted on fighting again—I did not hear them say anything, but when they got up they ran at each other—they were wrestling with each other and both fell down again, very heavily, on the pavement—I do not think either of them was undermost—Townsley was quite as large a man as the prisoner—they got up again—I helped them up and kept them apart—I had sent a messenger for the police—I could not keep them apart—they would go at each other again—they both appeared equally desirous of fight<lb/>ing—I could not see any particular blow given—I do not think they hit each other, but they were pulling and hauling—it was more like a wrestling-match—Townsley fell again, but the prisoner did not—they had hold of each other just before he fell—they held any part they could get hold of—Townsley fell backwards, and his head struck against a door I think, for it was in a door<lb/>way—he did not get up—I went to assist him and he appeared to be dead—I</p>

I remem<lb/>ber a man being brought there at half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 7th of Feb.—he was dead—on Monday, the 9th, I opened his head, and found, on removing the scalp, several contusions and bruises, and one larger than the rest on the top of the head—on removing the skull-cap and the membranes covering the brain, the brain was found in a state of great conges<lb/>tion, and blood poured out from the surface of the brain—his death was caused by the blood pouring into one of the most important cavities of the brain—there was no bruise exactly over the part where the blood filled the cavity, but there was one on the top of the head which would occasion a rup<lb/>ture at the base—there was no indication of his having been drinking—if a man was drunk, and fell backwards on the pavement, that might have occa<lb/>sioned all I saw—it was very likely to do so—he was a well formed, power<lb/>ful young man; not quite so powerful as the prisoner—if he was in liquor when he fell, that would be likely to make the fall more dangerous, and pro<lb/>duce the appearances on the brain.</p>

I was at my sister-in-law's house on this Sunday night—I recollect the knock at the door and her showing me the letter—I went into the passage and saw the man standing at the door who I afterwards saw tried and convicted here by the name of Thomas Smith—I asked him his business—he said, "I have come for the money in the house, and if it is not handed over to me I must get it"—I told him we lived in a free country, and were not in the habit of having our money demanded, and asked what he meant by it—while speaking to him, having a dagger in his right hand, he pulled a horse pistol out of his left hand coat pocket—he then went to the entrance door, opened it, gave a whistle, and in came a second man, armed as he was—I could not identify that man, as he stood in the dark—it was not the prisoner I believe—he was a shorter man—I at last handed over to Smith a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said if he had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would leave the house and take the men away whom he had brought with him and had outside—when he was going out of the hall I followed him, and he turned round immediately, pre<lb/>sented a pistol at my breast, within twelve inches, and vowed he would shoot me if I followed him or looked after him—I parted with the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for fear he would alarm the invalid if he knew of it—I was not particularly alarmed about myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On Saturday, the 14th, I went with Single<lb/>ton to the Mint, and found both the prisoners there—Winton first—Cooper, I believe, ran out of the house—Singleton brought him to me—I took both to the station—in going along Winton said to Cooper, "They cannot swear to the money"—I searched Cooper at the station and found on him a knife, two half-crowns, sixpence, a penny, and one halfpenny; and on Winton, one half-crown, two shillings, and fourpence—I asked why they left the workhouse—theysaid they had heard of another job—I asked where—they said at the docks—I asked which docks—they could not tell me—I went to the work-house, examined the outer shed, and saw some sharp instrument had hooked the bolt of the lock back, and the marks corresponded with the knife—I examined the counting-house door, and found a piece of wood had been cut away by screwing the knife round, and there is a little gap in the knife—I tried both the locks to see if I could put them back with the knife after they were locked, and I did.</p>

The prisoner is married to my sister—they live it No. 3, Halford-terrace, Walworth—I lodged in their house from Jan. to Feb.—on Sunday, the 25th of Jan., in the morning, as I was lying in bed I heard them quarrelling below—it was about half-past seven o'clock, or day-break—I judge that was the time—we had no clock or watch in the house—my mother came into my bed-room—I heard them quarrelling and a severe struggling between Mr. and Mrs. Munton—when the struggling was all over, I heard a voice at the foot of the stairs—I sent my mother down, and told her to call me if I was wanted—my mother went down, and about two minutes afterwards she called me—I went down and saw the prisoner stark naked and covered with blood—I asked him what was the matter—he made no answer—Isaw my sister, and I asked her who did it—she was lying on the ground with her throat cut in the centre, and she feebly pointed to him—I went to the street door and found it double locked and the key taken away—I on that asked the prisoner for the key—"I do not know" was his reply—"You have concealed the key" I said to him—"I do not know" was his reply again—I asked him to lend me a hand to take down the board in front of the parlour window that he was in the habit of cutting out his cloth upon—the white roller blind was down and marks of blood on it—I pulled it off the roller altogether and threw it into the corner of the room—we took the wire blind down, he raised the sash and I got out of the window and called the policeman—Dr. Otway was sent for—he came and attended her for the wound—there was blood on the panels of the folding doors as if squirted upon, and marks of fingers, and likewise round the room, on the looking-glass and on some tea and sugar that laid on the mantel-piece—they have latterly lived on quarrelling terms, anything but happiness—I have heard him use threatening language to her—I heard him go out on the Thursday nigbt pre<lb/>vious and return home about one o'clock on Friday morning—when he came home I heard a quarrelling and a knock as if somebody was knocked down, and I went and demanded admittance at the parlour door—it was locked—I heard him knock her down—I went to the street door to call "Police," when my sister came out and put her hand before my mouth—I asked her if he had struck her—I asked her that twice, and she answered "No no, never mind, never mind"—I then went up stairs into my own bed-room, and then I came down and listened to them, and he wanted her to take a false</p>

The prisoner is married to my daughter, Johanna; I have lived with them nearly a month; he has been married three years; he has very much ill-used her; the first thing yesterday morning I heard the prisoner call "Murder!" that was a little after eight o'clock yester<lb/>day morning; I ran down stairs, and met the prisoner at the foot of the stairs, without his shirt;. his wife was lying down on the floor, with her throat cut, and bleeding; I said to my daughter, "Who did it?" I and she pointed to the prisoner, and said, "You did it;" I slapped him on the shoulder as he passed, and said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>, put your shirt on! look at your hands!" my daughter fainted away; he made no observation, but ran into the back parlour; he was sober; he came home about half-past twelve the night before; they slept together in the back parlour; it was in the front parlour she was on the floor; she had only her night-clothes on; I picked up a razor that lay on the left side of my daughter, on the floor; I called, "Police!" and gave the razor to, the policeman; the prisoner ran into the back parlour, and fastened himself in; I think the prisoner heard his wife say he had done it, and he made no observation, but ran out of the room; I called to my son; the key of the front door was lost, and I was obliged to open the window to key people in; I did not hear the prisoner say a single word; they had been quarrelling last Thursday night, and I heard her say, "I will not take a false oath for any. one," and I heard him say he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for her; her face was dreadfully bruised some time ago; he has been in the habit of ill-using my daughter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 11, Canter<lb/>bury-row. On Sunday, the 25th of Jan., I was called to No. 3, Halford<lb/>terrace, and saw a woman lying in the front parlour—the prisoner was by her side, with his left hand on her throat, and his right hand in one of her hands—he desired me to come in, and said, "You see what this has come to, Mr. Otway"—(I had been called in two days before on account of a quarrel which had taken place in the family, and I then gave them some advice, and left them)—I had the woman removed on to the bed, and examined her throat—it was a short, clean wound, about an inch and a half long, half sepa<lb/>rating the windpipe—blood was issuing from it, and also passing down the throat—it was such a wound as would be likely to be caused by such an instrument as this (a razor)—she did not appear quite sensible when I first saw her—I dressed the wound after some time—the prisoner was very much agitated during the whole time when the expressions were made use of by her friends—the wife made signs to me, intended to lead me to the opinion that she did it herself, and she several times shook hands with her husband, and caressed him—after she recovered a little, she spoke to me, but she could only speak in a whisper—I said if she had anything to say, she had better write it down, as she ought not to speak, but she said, "I did it myself"—she repeated it in a low tone—a paper was given to her, and she wrote on it—this is it—she at first wrote—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "I did it myself through distress of mind; pray, my dear Fred., take care of our dear Arthur, for your poor Ann's sake; will you be father and mother for ever; do not charge my mother and brother with anything, they are innocent"—she signed that in the presence of the po<lb/>liceman and myself, at our request—I said to her, "Your mother and brother are not charged with anything; you have heard what your mother hat said, have you anything to say about your husband?"—she in great excitement wished to write again—I had the brother and mother, with the policeman, present, and she wrote these words, "Nor my husband," in their presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your opinion as to the mode in which the wound was in<lb/>flicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider a razor must have been taken, and the head thrown back so as to protrude the throat, and the razor just pushed there—I think if a man had taken the razor, he would take a sweep as if cutting his own throat, but a female would handle a razor in a very different manner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think it was given by herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I think if it had been done by another person, it would have been rather a larger wound—if it had been deeper, it would have cut through the large blood-vessels—this had just cut the windpipe—it was not such a sweeping wound as would have been done by a man—if there had been any resistance or struggling, I think there would have been more wounds, or it would have been an irregular wound—it would be very likely to be a clean cut—I form my notion that it was done by herself, from the small extent of the wound, and the cleanness of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If there had been considerable struggling previous to and at the time the wound was inflicted, it was not at all likely to have pre<lb/>sented these appearances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly not—if it was inflicted by a man intending to cut her throat, it would have been a larger and stronger wound—ifthe head had been down, it would have cut through the carotid artery—the head being thrown up, would throw the windpipe forward, and that was cut through—there was no danger to her, except from the excitement the friends got her into—the mother was very greatly excited, and I told her if she was quiet I should be obliged to have her removed—she was saying he was a villain, and he did it—I had been called in on the previous Thursday, in consequence of a quarrel between the mother and brother and her—the prisoner himself sent for me then—I had never seen him before—he was not a patient of mine—he exhibited on that occasion affection and interest about his wife—she was then very excited, rushing out of bed, throwing herself on her knees to her mother, and begging her to leave the house—she exhibited no want of affection towards her husband—I believe the mother said they had been so often quarrelling, and the brother also, and he said he would not leave the house, being determined to protect her, but the whole time she was begging them to leave—it is decidedly my belief, having examined the wound, that it was inflicted by her own hands.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 15th of Feb., about a quarter past six o'clock, I was on duty in Red Lion-street, Richmond—I saw the three prisoners in company, come up close to the pro<lb/>secutor's house, they remained there three or four minutes—Joseph H. A. Barnes and Cork then came eight or ten yards down the street from the shop—and Frederick J. Barnes came away from the door and joined the other two prisoners, who were in sight of the door—they then all took to their heels and run away—I pursued them into King-street, where I took the two Barnes'—Cork made his escape—I found this box of cheroots on J. H. A. Barnes; I asked him where he got it from, he said his brother gave it him—F. J. Barnes said he had been to Mr. Rolls' for a halfpenny worth of figs, and took the box of cheroots and gave them to his brother.</p>
