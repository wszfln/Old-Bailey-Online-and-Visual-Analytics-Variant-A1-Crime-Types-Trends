On 4th Nov. two persons came to the shop in Winslow-street—ons of them gave the name of James Nicholls—he said he wanted a machine for crushing Gain—I took them both into the show-room, introduced them to Mr. Lewis Cottam, and left them with him—I have never seen them since—Nicholls represented himself as a miller, at Stratford, in Essex—T took down his address from his lips—in the course of a few minutes Nicholle came into the office is which I was, on the ground-floor—he gave me directions to make a weighing-machine, which was made according to his order—on the evening of 15th Nov., the prisoner Brown came with this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Stratford Mills, 15th Nov., 1847. Gentlemen,—I shall thank you to forward the weighing-machine I ordered by bearer, and two fenders, and two sets of fire-irons, namely, three feet six inches; one fender for drawing-room, about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., three feet six inches; one ditto for parlour, about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; two sets of polished steel fire<lb/>irons; I expect to receive a letter from my friend to-morrow, about the drill, and will write you his decision; I shall be in town on Friday next, and will call and settle my account.

Rice came, and brought me this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Stratford Mills, 17th Nov. Gentlemen, I find you were correct respecting the fenders; the measurement is three feet six inches, and to clear from jamb to jamb, and must come to the centre of the jamb, making four feet with standards; I do not confine you to the price named in my other letter; my friend the bearer will look them out for me, and bring them with him, with two sets of polished steel fire-irons; I shall be in town on Friday for the drill, and will settle my account with you. I am, yours respectfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES NICHOLLS</hi>, Stratford Mills.")—I handed the letter over to Mr. Harrison, the manager of the department, knowing that it was a swindling transaction—I had heard something before—I kept Rice in conversation while a police<lb/>fire-irons to Stratford—he said, "Yes"—I had not read the letter at that time—he said he had a cart at the Old Bell, and he was going to take them there on the omnibus, and from thence home, in a covered cart—I supposed he meant Nicholls's cart—he was speaking of himself—I do not remember that he said anything about Nicholls—I did not open the letter—I handed it over to Mr. Harrison—he went back to the other part of the house with it, and left me with the prisoner—he was gone three quarters of an hour, I think, altogether—Rice went out, and said he would get a cup of coffee, as we said the fenders would take some little time to get ready—he went away, and came back in about ten minutes, and I kept him in conversation about the weather, and where he was going, as the police were not ready—I do not remember that he said for whom he was to take them—I understood they were for Nicholls, because he came from Mr. Nicholls—he said, when he first came in, that he had brought the note from Mr. Nicholls, of Stratford—I do not exactly recollect whether he said of Stratford, but I knew the man he meant—he said he brought the letter from Mr. Nicholls.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and am married to the defendant Usher's sister. I set up a shop at Holloway which had been in my wife's family for some time; it was a private house; it had been closed some time—there was no one in it—about Aug. 1843' I put a shop-front into it, stocked it with my own money, and put up the name of "Read and Usher"—it had been carried on before in the name of "Usher"—I took Usher into my employ at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, I think, first, he had no share or interest in the shop;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801030012"/>
               <p>he was only a servant—he did not pay any rent—I was the tenant; I paid the rent, and have the receipts—Usher used to come down and settle with me every Sunday evening, and I used to pay him his wages—on Sunday evening, 14th Nov. last, somebody told me something at my other house, and I went to the shop at Holloway, about half-past five, and found Usher, Partridge, and four or five more, smoking in the parlour—I asked what they all wanted—Partridge said, "This is Usher's place, and we have got possession, and we will keep it"—I had been told the property was in jeopardy, and took Wm. Wood, Wm. Coney, and three more men who work for me, and told them to stop over the way till I saw if anybody was there—I called them in, and said, "I shall go home; you stop and mind my property till Monday morning, and I will see Mr. Young, my solicitor"—I took down the partition between the parlour and passage, and moved all the shoes away—no violence had been used then—Usher went out, and in about ten minutes got twenty or thirty nabigators from the railway—the minute they got in they fell on my four men: one of them ran out and said, "They are in, Mr. Read, they are in"—I went in, and was knowcked down with a spade, and my hat cut through with it—I do not know who did that—one of the men made a blow at Coney with an instrument about three feet long, as he was coming from the parlour, and opened his face from the eye to the chin—there was a good deal of noise—they tore down the fixtures to defend themselves—one of my men was pitched out, and his head came in contact with the edge of the door—I went to Mr. Earle, a neighbour, for protection—my party had not the opportunity of using any violence—there was a great deal of noise; blood flowed.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th Nov., the Tuesday after the Sunday, I saw Mr. Read and Usher at the King's Head, Holloway—Read said he was very sorry for what had taken place, it was all his wife's fault; the matter was all settled, and they all shook hands together—that was after they had been before the Magistrate—they drank and smoked together, were very good friends, and had two or three pints of half-and-half, and a glass of brandy and water—they all drank out of the same glass, and I did too—Read asked me to drink—Usher took some—there were four of us in the party, Read, Usher, his brother, and me—Read said he might go home, it was all right now, and think no more about it—they shook hands together and parted very good friends, and I thought—I should say we were in the public-house an hour and a half, or two hours, all sitting down together and enjoying ourselves com<lb/>fortably—there was nothing said about the books—they were in there before I went in—what we had was all put down to Usher—it has not been paid for.</p>

On 10th Dec., between two and three in the morning, I was at the Cock public-house in Tothill-street—the prisoners and others were there—I was not perfectly sober—Lever came behind me and threw me down on my back—he then put his hands into my pocket and took my purse—I turned round and grappled with him, and nearly got the purse out of his hand—while doing so, while Lever got away with my purse—out of his hand—while doing so, I was pushed down on my face, I cannot say by whom—they held me down, while Lever got away with my purse—I called out "Police," and the constable came—I desired him to go and search the back premises—I asked the landlord for a candle—he would not give me one, but laughed at me—we get a match, and went into the yard to look for Lever—I did not find him—I afterwards saw him by the bar—I went to call the police, and when I brought the police back Lever was gone—Glynn stood at the bar, and I gave him in charge—I went with him to the station, then returned to the Cock, and found Lever and gave him in charge—I have never found my purse—it contained a sovereign and robbed—when—I had a friend with me—he had gone backwards when I was robbed—when I got up off my face, Glynn was standing over me—I am sure he was there—I cannot say that he was taking any part in my being pushed down.</p>

               <p>about six o'clock—about eight o'clock I heard Fitzsimmons call out—I was sitting by the fire reading—I instantly ran out of the drawing-room door, took up the candle that was on the slab outside the drawing-room door, and ran up stairs, and about five steps up I encountered the prisoner Anderson—he was just two steps above me on the turn of the stairs—I saw his front face—I had a candle in my hand, and it gleamed right on his face—I did not see any other person, but I heard some one rattling down the stairs in advance of Anderson—I have no doubt of Anderson being the same man I saw—I gave a description of him to the policeman directly I came down—one of these dressing cases contains my things, and the other the General's—I found this lucifer-match box on the rug outside the drawing-room door—it was open, as if thrown down, and a piece of candle on the stairs—I was present when Phillipson was brought back to the house—I said directly that he was not the man I saw—I went to the police-station on the Monday night following, saw Anderson there, and recognized him to be the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson. Q.</hi> In what way did the person pass you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can hardly say, I rather think on the banister side—they are narrow stairs—you rushed past me, and I rather think you pushed me against the wall—I think I observed you for fully two seconds, because you seemed to be puzzled how to pass me—I think I saw you for three seconds, for I saw your dress, and remarked all that you had on—you had on an open dark frock-coat, a black satin stock, or handkerchief, and I think a dark waistcoat—I told the policeman that the young man I saw had black eyes, dark hair, small features, and was between twenty-three and twenty-four years of age—I cannot tell how many persons in private clothes there were at the Police-court when I saw you—I saw a good many there—some were in a separate place—you were inside there—when I came in I turned to the left, right opposite that place—I came with the policeman, and some of my own family<lb/>the policeman told me that the person who was taken would be shown to me—he did not say upon what evidence he had taken you—I believe it was from my description—he said he thought he knew who you were—the inspector asked me if you were the man, and I said, "Yes, to the best of my belief"—I looked at you afterwards, you were very differently dressed—I paused for some time, because General Fleming had told me to be sure to look well before I said anything, and I then said, "Yes, that is the man"—I did not contradict myself afterwards—it was just about eight o'clock that I saw you in the house—I cannot say to a few minutes—it was not five minutes difference either way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employ of Mr. Dark, of Robert-street, Grosvenor-square. On a foggy Tuesday in Nov., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was ordered to go with a covered van to No. 36, Grosvenor<lb/>stret—a lad went with me—he knocked at the door, it was opened—there were three men inside, the prisoner was one of them—some bedding, carpet<lb/>ing, and pictures, were brought out of the house—the prisoner assisted in bringing them out—the van was about ten minutes loading—when it was completely loaded, an apron was tied round behind—that would conceal what was inside—they all got in the van, two in front and two behind, and we drove to New Oxford-street—we stopped there and had some beer—the two in front, the little one and the prisoner, told me to stop there—the prisoner got out of the van there and brought some beet out of the public-house—he was close to me all the time I was driving the van—and when be brought the beer out I had an opportunity of seeing him—he then walked down Holborn a little way, and said to the lad who had fetched the van, "Give me my handkerchief out, and I will go and get my coat"—I went on with the van, and saw the prisoner again just by the City toll in Holborn—he paid the toll—we went on to a pulic-house opposite Aldgate Church, in the Minories—after calling for some beer, the prisoner and two of the men went away from the van up a lane by the side of the public-house, leaving the boy there—they all came back in about a quarter of an hour—we all went round Tenter-street, I believe, stopped at a house there, and Anderson and the two other men went in there—the boy remained outside—they all came out again in a few minutes, and directed me to go on and turn round the first turning to the left—I got to a gateway, and they told me to wait there a few minutes and they would come back directly—one of the men said, "You had better come up here"—I cannot say which one it was, they were all together—the gateway was not hight enough for the van to get up—the men went up the gateway and remained there about a quarter of an hour—while they were gone a police—sergeant and a policeman came and made some inquiry of me, and as I was talking to them two of the men came down the yard—I do not know whether the prisoner was one of them—as soon as they saw the policemen they ran back again—I saw no more of them—the policeman took the van and the goods to the station.</p>

               <p>that kind of thing—I have seen him write "Not known in Princess<lb/>square, Kennington," or "Not known in the Kennington-road"—there is a particular style about the M's and N's—I may have seen those letters more frequently than others—these figures are similar to his—I have repeatedly seen him write figures when signing the book—I feel satisfied that these letters are his writing, the style is exactly the same as the check—I am equally satisfied of them—I have no doubt about one more than the other—the check is written in rather a more slovenly hand than the letters—there is a peculiarity about these letters in the words "Kensington," and "Bank of England," which occurs in two or three place—they are just his style—I have seen him write similar to both—I consider them both to be his natural writing—the book would show what time he left on the 29th—he was only off once in July, and I am confident that was the 7th—while the election is going on in the district there is always a great deal more letter work—on a bust day he would have from half-past eleven or twelve to half-past four to himself—when the election was going on in our district the men were kept on till two—that was not the day of the Westminster election—the Lambeth election was going on then—that certainly affects us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. We have been married twenty-two years—we habe never been separated, until I was in the Ham<lb/>mersmith workhouse three weeks before this occurred—my husband was then out of work—I left him in the street—I was only there one night—that is the only night we have beed separated since we have been married—this is our child with me—it is four years old next March—he was not at the workhouse, he remained with his father—I was at the Hammersmith Police-court about his ill-treatment before I went to the workhouse; but I forgive him all that—it has nothing to do with this—one Saturday night, about three weeks before this happened, I met him with the little boy in the street—we did not engage a room then—we did afterwards, in White Lion-passage, Harrow-road—I lived there with him up to the time of this occurrence—I did not send for a policeman while we lived there—a policeman named Pollard was in the passage—he did not come into the room—the landlady fetched him—she said she heard words, but there was nothing of the kind—on the day in question, my husband came home about half-past five—I set the tea things—he was going to take off his shoes and stockings, as he had got wet feet—I asked if he would have coffee or tea—he said he did not care, "You have made the tea, that will do"—I had boiled the water in a saucepan, as I had no tea kettle—the tea was not made before he came in—we had no table in the room—I made the tea, and poured out two cups, and a little mug for the child—I placed the two cups on a chair, one on each side, between me and my husband—the little boy cried for the chair his father was sitting on—he im<lb/>mediately got up, gave the child the chair, and sat down on the floor by the side of it, and therefore I must have got the cup that he intended for himself—there was no chair in the room but the one he sat on, and the one that had the tea things on it—he did not sit on the same side as before—I mentioned this before—I sent the boy for some milk—he was the only child we had in the room—he came back, kicked at the street door, and called "Mother!"—I went and opened it—I had not observed the cups of tea before I went—when I went to put the milk in I thought the cup looked rather thick, but the candle stood on the mantle-shelf—I tasted the tea, it was bit<lb/>ter and very nasty, not like tea—I asked the prisoner to taste it—he did so, and said, "There is nothing in it for you"—I said I would see what it was—he did not interrupt me, I placed the cup on the chair again, then poured the tea off into the basin; he took the cup out of my hand, and what there was in it he threw under the grate—I said I would go and see what it was—he said nothing then—he said afterwards it was for himself—I looked in the saucepan and teapot before I went out, but saw nothing—I tasted the other cup of tea, that was not nasty—that was upset when he gave the child the chair—it was filled up again—I did not taste it again—the child drank the tea in the mug—there was nothing nasty in that, for I tasted it—I went out to several doctors shops with the basin and cup—I went back to my husband, and said a doctor said there was poison in it, and he was to come out with me—I did not mention any particular kind of poison—he said he was not coming out—I went out by myself—a woman who had been at the doctor's and heard what I said, had sent for a policeman—Pollard came, I gave him the basin and cup, and accompanied him to Mr. Faulkner's, in the Harrow-road—my husband came in directly after—I have seen him take a great deal of</p>

On the even<lb/>ing of 22nd Nov., the prisoner came to my house and asked whether a woman had been in with a child with a cup in her hand, asking whether there had been any opium in the cup, I said, "No"—I did not know him before, he addressed me first—I am certain he used the word "Opium"—he went away immediately, and twenty minutes or half an hour after he was gone, his wife and Pol<lb/>lard came in together, and brought a cup and basin—I examined them cur<lb/>sorily—some dregs remained in the cup, which consisted, in my judgment, of coarsely powdered opium—I smelt the contents of the basin, but did not dis<lb/>tinguish any particular smell—the dregs smelt like opium—I did not taste it—the taste is very strong, but I was satisfied—the prisoner came to the shop again—the woman and Pollard went into the back room while I examined the things—they were certainly in the house when the prisoner returned—he was shown by the servant, or some one, into the back room—he said if any one had taken anything, he had taken it himself, and it must be inside his body; and he wished me to apply a stomach-pump—I do not recollect that anything had been said to him then—no one was present but the woman—Pollard was gone to search for him, but missed him—I did not think it neces<lb/>nary to apply the stomach-pump from any symptoms which he exhibited—I do not recollect that his wife said anything at that moment, or that anything was said about who put it in—I was engaged at looking at the poison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lecturer on practical chemistry, at St. Thomas's Hospital. I received from Pollard a cup and basin, and analysed the con<lb/>tents—I found in the cup a small portion of a dark-coloured substance, which appeared to have been coarsely powdered, sticking against the sides—it was scraped away, and had the consistence of a very thick extract—it smelt strongly of opium, and had every character of powdered crude opium—I submitted it to a very careful analysis, and from it produced morphia, which is the active principle of opium; and also meconic acid, which is a substance which has never yet been found in anything but opium; it had the smell and taste of opium—I mean poppy acid—meconic means "poppy"—I found about half a grain of crude opium in the cup—I examined the con<lb/>tents of the basin—they contained a solution both of morphia and meconia—I made a rough estimate of the quantity, but being mixed up with milk and sugar it was difficult—I should say there could not have been in the quantity I had, less than half a grain more opium—there was not above a dessert spoonful of tea, hardly the tenth part of such a cup as this—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—according to my judgment, three or four grains of opium would be sufficient to kill a woman of that age and constitution, provided there were no antidotes used to prevent it—if opium was made into the form of an ordinary-sized pill, and dissolved in tea, I should not think it would present the appearance I found at the bottom of the cup—in the form of a pill it sometimes would and sometimes would not be compounded with other ingre<lb/>dients—I imagine if you ask for an opium pill, they would give you a pill formed of opium, but they might put something else to make it into the form of a pill—if I were asked for an opium pill, containing half a grain of opium, I should mix it with something to make it roll up a little better—opium existed in the contents, in the state of power—as regards the dregs I can say nothing, because part of them were thrown under the grate; but leaving the dregs out of the question, and supposing the whole to have been uniformly stirred up, there must have been four or five grains in the whole cup—I exam<lb/>ined all that remained in the basin; there was a dessert spoonful of tea in it—I should not imagine that it would be much stronger towards the bottom of the cup, because only the dregs would settle—it was not a saturated solution—not as much as it could possibly hold—whether the whole was equally infused, would depend on how long it had stood, and whether it had been stirred up or not—if it was not stirred up, the chance would be that it would float on the surface—whether it would get weight, would depend on the time it was left, you might leave it half an hour, and still find some on the top—the heavier portion would sink to the bottom—that which was left would be a little stronger than that at the top of the vessel, if you did not put anything in to disturb it, provided it has stood for a length of time—it would never take up the whole of the opium, there is a portion of resin which would always remain at the bottom—all the soluble potion would be taken up and would be uniformly diffused—this at the bottom contained a great deal of the soluble portion of the opium.</p>

I am one of the clerk at Marylebone Police-court, I was present at the examination of the witness before the depositions were taken—the prisoner's statements were taken down each time—they are not signed by hin—he could not write—they were read over to him, and signed by the Magistrate—on 23rd Nov., after the witness were examined, the prisoner said, "The roof my mouth is now sore from the stuff I have taken from her; the roof of my mouth has been off several times from what she has given me; if there was anything in it she must have put it in"—on 1st Dec., after Lee's examination, he said, "I never saw that bey before with my eyes"—on the same day he said, "I have been a good husband as anyone can be, and I have been as bad as any one since"—on the 8th Dec., after Mr. Heisch's examination, he said, "Last Tuesday fortnight I went into Mr. Watson's, in Edgware-road, and asked for two pills of opium; he asked me if anything was the matter, I said there was a great discharge in front if me, and he gave me two pills; I have been suffering from it for three years and three months, and never divulged it till this day; I have been in the habit of taking them, and must take the same again to-day; I have also taken some in tea, and I put the pills into the cup myself to take in to my own body, and I have taken many a hundred, and I must take more again; at half-past two o'clock that day, I had fifteen drops of laudanum in me; I would not tell my wife about it; I took the cup from my wife, and drank the contents, all but a little, and threw the rest under the gate."</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the goal of Newgate. I visit the goal everyday—I have seen the prisoner repeatedly—he complained of a little cold, and on my putting so me particular questions to him last week, in re<lb/>lation to this trial, he told me be suffered from the effect of old venereal disease, for which he had been in the habit of taking opium for a cousiderable times—previous to that he had not made any complaint to me—I talked to him about his asserted complaint—I believe it did not exist—I did not give bim any opium—he has not taken any to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Hodges's barman. The prisoner came there on the morning of the 29th, and called for twopenny-worth of rum, and half a pint of beer—a man came in just after him—I am quite sure the prisoner ordered it—a lad, who was assisting in the bar, drew the rum, and gave it to the prisoner—he drank out of his beer, and the other man drank of the rum, and went straight out—the prisoner staid there, finished drinking his beer, and I asked him for the money—he walked towards the door a little way, then turned round, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down a penny—that was sufficient to pay for the beer without the rum—(the other man did not order anything—the prisoner asked him what he would take)—I ran round the bar, stopped him, and said, "You must not go without paying for the rum"—he went close up to the door—the lad who was assisting went and asked him for the money—he put his hand in his pocket, pretending to pull out some money, and then went outside the door—my master came down, and the boy said the man had had twopenny-worth of rum, and half a pint of beer, and had not paid for it—master tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Come in, old fellow, you must not go without paying for the rum as well as the beer"—he came inside, and said something to the effect that he did not intend to pay—he was standing up in the corner, and all the time my master was looking at him he was drawing this instrument steadily out—I believe my master had caught him by the collar, and said, "You shall not go until you have paid"—he attempted to go, and when he found my master would not let him, he drew this instrument out, threw the stick down in the corner, then pulled it up as high as he could, made a thrust forward, and pricked Mr. Hodges in the thigh—I took it from him, and broke it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

We live on the first floor—on 16th Dec., about a quarter to eleven in the morning, I went out and left nobody in the room—I locked the door and took the key with me—I came back at a quarter to seven in the evening, went up stairs, put my key in the door and found it would not turn—I then took hold of the handle of the door, found it was unlocked, and opened it by turning the handle—I saw a man standing in the room by the window—I did not see his face, only his height—he had on a frock coat and a hat—I saw his back—I shut the door, ran down stairs, and screamed—a man, who I believe by his height to be the same that was in the room, came down after me, struck me a blow on the side of the head, and knocked me down at the street door—I went up stairs again with the policeman, when the had brought back the prisoner, and missed a work-box, a victorine, a waistcoat, and one cuff—a clock, which hung behind the door on a nail, was taken down, and the weight-chains twisted round it on the sofa, ready to be taken away—there was a coat beside it, which had also been taken down from a nail—the things are worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the clock—they are my husband's property—the man I saw in the room was the same height as the prisoner—I never saw his face.</p>

I slept there on the Monday and Tues<lb/>day night, but not on the Sunday—Durden and Dickson came there on the sunday morning—I cannot remember what day of the month that was—I was in the room when they came in—neither of them brought anything—I slept in the same room as Targett and his young woman—I had no separate bed—the clock was taken out of that room by the policeman, on Wednesday morning—I was in bed then—durden and Dickinson had been there on the previous Sunday—I did not assist in cleaning the room—I did not observe this bundle in the house—I was there when it was found—I had never seen it before.</p>

On 15th Dec., at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was sent for by the young men—I went and found the prisoner very much intoxicated—she owned she had been taking some elderberry wine, and it had got into her head—I told her to go to bed, and get up early in the morning, and pack up her clothes and go—I went next morn<lb/>ing at ten o'clock—I found her intoxicated then—I went two doors off to another shop of mine, got the housekeeper, and told her to assist her to pack her things together—the things were brought down into the parlour by the other housekeeper—a hat-box came down with the bottom nearly out, and out rolled some money and 1/4 lb. of peppermint—that raised my suspicion—I called my young man to bring my peppermint—I compared them with those lying about the floor, and they tallied—I went up stairs—the prisoner wished me to search her box before she left the house—I said, "Give me the key of your box?"—she was five or ten minutes before she could find it—when it was handed to me, I opened her box—I took out some clothes, and found the box half full of grocery—her bed-room was strewed with tea and coffee—about 4lbs. of candles were in her bed-room—she said she had selected these things for the use of my young men—I gave her 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. every Monday to keep house, and whatever she had in the shop she used to purchase, the same as any other person—there were two young men and herself—she was not confined to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. it was sometimes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>evening, 21st Dec., I missed a pair of hind-quarters of mutton, they were not parted—they were hanging at the corner of City Garden-row—I saw Hunt the next morning—I asked him whether he knew anything about any mutton I had lost—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had any objection to have his house searched—he said, "No"—I staid there while the policeman searched—he went into the wash-house, looked into a tub, and pulled out a leg of mutton—I saw what he took out—I have every reason to believe it was mine—it was the same size and description, and the weight and quality and every<lb/>thing the same as that I lost—the mutton was rather chilled, it had been kept alive rather too long.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I have heard the statement of Catharine Mahon—I think the kick which the deceased received in his side might have caused his death—any degree of violence would accelerate his death in the state I found his heart and body—I first saw him on 18th Nov., he was then suffering from fever and delirium—I was not informed until 21st that he had been ill-used—he complained of pain in his right side, and had a blister put there—he did not complain of his left breast till five days before his death—he died on 5th Dec.—I opened his body—there was an abscess as large as my fist on the right side of the chest, between the ribs and the lungs—it was full of purulent matter—there was inflammation of the heart, and a serous infusion into the pericardium—one of the lungs was healthy—the right one was inflamed—the intestines did not exhibit symptoms of inflamma<lb/>tion—the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the heart—fever</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801030104"/>
               <p>and inflammation would produce that—the boy was always healthy before—he was never well after he received the kick—a severe blow on the right side would, in my opinion, produce inflammation, and lead to the dis<lb/>ease which ended in his death—a boy like that would be more likely to have inflammtion than an adult—he would suffer more readily from violence—there was nothing in what I discovered, to exclude the idea that death was caused by violence.</p>

In Nov. last I had a sister, named Johanna, in a hospital in London—I went to see her, accompanied by a married sister named Julia—we returned in the evening, and went into the Noah's Ark public-house, between eight and nine o'clock, to get some refreshment—my sister had a child with her—we went into the tap-room, intending to have a pint of beer, but we had not time to call for anything—a lodger of my sister's was there, and he told her to bring her child to him, and he would have a kiss at him—she went over to him for that purpose—the prisoner came in out of the yard while she was talking to the man, and said had no business to go over to his companion—there was no dispute, that I know of, between my sister and the other man before the prisoner came in—he and another man owed her some money, and she said it was worse than highway robbery, because they did not pay her—the prisoner came in then, and said she had no business to come to interrupt his company—she said she did not speak to him; that she was speaking to the two men that owed her money, and let them answer for themselves—he called her a wh—; I made over to him, and asked him what he had called my sister such a name for—he said I was no better myself, and if I did not leave he would knock my b—y eye out—I took up my umbrella and made a knock or two at him, but never hit him—I am quite certain I never touched him—I then turned away from him, for fear of his hitting me, and he hit me three or four blows on the head—I turned down, and put my hands to my face to save it from being disfigured, and he gave me a most unmerciful kick on the right side of my* * *—my back was towards him—I held up for one or two moments, and then dropped quite insensible—I was taken home on a stretcher, blood came from where the kick was, and I fainted away—I was confined in consequence of the kick, and am now very weak indeed—Mr. Dowling attended me.</p>

On Friday evening, 24th Dec., about eleven o'clock, I locked up some lard, pork, butter, and herring, in the safe in the area—the herrings were in brown paper, on the bottom shelf, and the butter also—about two o'clock next morning I was called up by my master, went into the kitchen, and saw my master, an officer, and the prisoner—I had never seen him before—I found the zinc-work of the safe cut down—the things had been removed, put back again, and all heaped up together on the top shelf—the safe is just out of the back kitchen door—the area is below the street—per<lb/>sons could only get in by getting over the area railings—there are no steps—it is about ten feet deep—he would have to drop, or lodge his foot somewhere.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Masons' Arms, Horsemonger-lane, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington; it is my dwelling-house. On 29th Oct. I was the last person up—I saw the prisoner there at twelve o'clock, and ordered him to leave the premises—the staircase window was then closed—at a quarter before five in the morning I was alarmed by the policeman's rattle. I got up and came down, and saw the staircase window up—I never saw it up before—the side door was open—it had been shut the night before—I went into the street and saw the policeman—he came in with me and asked for a light—I went to the bar-parlour and found the till had been forced open—I missed a carpet-bag and a blue—bag, containing a barrister's gown—the cigar-box was emptied, and about thirty pounds weight of cigars gone, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I missed a pair of gravy spoons, two pairs of German spoons, a pair of ladles, a dessert-spoon, two large table-cloths, and other things—they had attempted to set fire to the house—I kicked against a hat, about four feet off the side-door, between my bar and the side-door—I had seen that hat on the prisoner's head scores of times, and knew it to be his—this is it—the policeman took charge of it—the prisoner was dressed the night before as he is now, and to the best of my belief he had this hat on, but I would not positively swear that—I saw it tried on his head at the police-court, and instantly swore it was his—I have not any doubt about it—I have not found any of the property—on the Saturday morning I saw the prisoner he had a different hat on then—I think he said something, but I did not take notice of it—I was taken ill about that time and did not see him any more.</p>

The prisoner and another person, named Emma Coppin, came to lodge with us on 2nd Nov.—they had an unfurnished room at first—at the end of a week the prisoner felt dissatisfied at being with the other person, and asked if I could let her have a furnished room—I gave her one—Coppin had some things in her room—the prisoner remained in the furnished room till 26th Nov.—she was in my room about ten o'clock that morning—I had a watch on the sideboard—I had it in my hand in the prisoner's presence, and moved it a little further on the sideboard—about a quarter of an hour after, I went into the kitchen—I returned in about two minutes, and sat down—the prisoner took up a card, and said it would make a nice watch paper—I said, "What is the use of a watch<lb/>paper?"—I looked as the sideboard, and did not see the watch—I thought no more about it then—I left the room again. and she then left and did not return—I had occasion to go to my purse, which was in the drawer, and saw it had been shifted—I found the money was all right—I then locked my door, and went out for an hour—when I returned I found the door locked, as I had left it—I missed my watch when I was going to bed at night—I went to the lodgers' room, up stairs, and told them of it—I then went to the pri<lb/>soner's room, and missed a pair of blankets off her bed—I went to my room again, searched further, and missed from a box in a drawer three half<lb/>sovereigns, three ear-rings, and a brooch—I also missed a pair of boots and a pair of shoes from a cupboard in her room—she was in my debt 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for lodg<lb/>ing—next morning, in making her bed, I found the ring of the seal, which had been in the box where I missed my money from, and this bit of bent wire—I afterwards tried the key of the prisoner's door to mine, and it would unlock it—I tried the other keys, and none of them would do so—I have not found any of my things.</p>
