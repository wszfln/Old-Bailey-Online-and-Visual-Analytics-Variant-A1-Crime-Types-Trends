                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at 7, Worship-street, Finsbury. About half-past eleven o'clock on 2d September, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner there—I was returning home; I called at a public-house at the corner of Acorn-street to have a glass of ale—whilst there I noticed the prisoner standing in front of the bar, and another woman near to her; they went out, and when I had finished my ale I walked outside, and the prisoner and the other woman were standing outside—they asked me if I would treat them; I said "No," as I was going home—the other woman pushed me, and immediately she did so the prisoner put her hand in my pocket—I felt her hand come out of my pocket, and immediately seized hold of her, and found the purse in her hand; I called out "Police"—I had seen one on the other side; he crossed over; previous to his coming over, about 7 or 8 persons surrounded me; the prisoner caught hold of my whiskers, I gave her in charge—I had some loose silver in my pocket, perhaps to the amount of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the purse contained 2 half-crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was my own, the other belonged to my employers—I took the purse from her hand, and gave it to the officer—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the purse.</p>

I am a commercial traveller, I travel in London and suburbs, about 8 or 10 miles out of London—I travel for James Bates, of Norton Folgate, tobacco and cigar manufacturer—I have been travelling for him for some time; I had been so that day—I went into the public-house to have a glass of ale—there was no one else there, in the apartment I went into—I first saw the two women standing in front of the bar—there</p>

               <p>was not one word between us in front of the bar—I will swear that I said nothing whatever to them—immediately I went outside the door, they were standing outside the door, and they asked me if I would treat them; I said "No," I wanted to go home; that was the first time that any conversation took place between us—I had not taken my purse out while I was inside the house—I had some loose silver in my pocket, and there was no occasion to take my purse out—I sometimes mix my own money and my employer's money together; I very often have to give change—it was my own money in the purse; that in my pocket was perhaps some my own, and some my employer's—I generally do carry my own money in my purse, but I have to give change perhaps 20 times a day, and if I have not change of my employer's, I take it out of my purse—I dare say plenty around us saw the purse in this woman's hand—I don't know whether any of them are here; when the policeman came they all ran away—I heard her say at the station-house that she never had my purse—I think the first time I heard her deny it, was at the station-house; I am not quite sure; perhaps she might have told the policeman, I did not hear any<lb/>thing about that—I will swear that she did not say so the moment t the policeman came up, in my hearing—there were perhaps 6 or 7 people got round me immediately—I don't know what became of the other woman; she went away, I suppose, when she saw the policeman, as the others did—I had been in about 3 public-houses from about 6 o'clock, and had a glass of ale in each of them—I will swear I had not been in more than three—I cannot swear how many I bad been into in the day, because my customers are in public-houses, and I have a number of public-houses to go into; but I have no occasion to drink in all; sometimes I go to as many as 30 public-houses a day—I will swear I had not been in 30 public-houses that day—I might have been in ten—I don't believe I was in fifteen—I can't say how many I had been drinking in—perhaps I might have had something else besides ale that day; I cannot distinctly say; all I know is, I was quite sober at the time the purse was taken—there were 2 half-crowns in the purse—I put them in some time during the day or evening, and left the other loose in my pocket—some of it was my employer's, I cannot under<lb/>take to swear it was all my employer's—I always keep my own money in my purse, unless I require it for change—I did not see the prisoner searched; I believe she handed the policeman the money immediately she went inside, from what I have heard—the other woman must have gone away, or I should have charged her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a merchant at 46 East-cheap. On Saturday last, September 18th, about 8 o'clock I was in Little Tower-street, looking into a print shop—a lad told me my chain was banging down—I observed that my watch was gone—in consequence of something said to me I ran down St. Mary-at-Hill—I saw the prisoner running down the hill; I pursued—I came up to him just as he got to the bottom of the hill—I was close behind him when he dropped the watch—I picked it up, and caught him almost immediately—it was my watch—I am sure the prisoner is the person that dropped it. I did not lose sight of him—I caught him within a few yards of where he dropped it.</p>

On 11th August, I went into Petticoat-lane to sell a bag of clothes—I was not able to sell them—I then went into a public-house in Houndsditch to get some<lb/>thing—I had not seen the prisoner then, but he came in with two others—they talked about knocking up a game of skittles; and they said to me, "Coun<lb/>tryman, you may as well go and see it fair"—they took me to another public-house—I went into the skittle-ground attached to it, with my bag of clothes with me—there were one or two games played—I am not able to say how much I drank, but it was not much—we had three pints, perhaps I might have had a pint—I afterwards felt quite stupid, I don't know that it was the drink made me so—I missed my clothes, and inquired about them—I could not find them—I walked away to go home, and the prisoner came behind me, put his arm round me, and took from my waistcoat pocket a silver watch—I had a coat on then, not a smock—my watch had a metal guard, which went round my neck—he broke the chain when he took the watch—I did not see him again till he was in custody—the value of the clothes was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the watch 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am confident the prisoner was one of the persons, and he was the one who took my watch—I never saw him again till about a fortnight afterwards—I then saw him in Bishopsgate Station—he was alone—the officer was with him—I am sure he is the person.</p>

I told him the charge, and he said "Not me"—I found on him some thimbles and some peas.</p>

It was there said that I abandoned my husband at the church-door, imme<lb/>diately after the marriage; whereas we both, with our friends, went to Mrs. Burchell's, where we lunched, and spent the rest of the day at the British Museum. We then returned to Mrs. Burchell's, where he remained till 11 o'clock at night, when he left and went home to the barracks. I remained at Mrs. Burchell's till she found a situation for me at No. 16, Upper Baker-street, Regent's-park, where I lived some months, my husband coming occasionally to see me on a Sunday evening, unknown to my master, until being seen one Sunday, I was questioned about him, and on their inquiring about him at Mrs. Burchell's, she told them he was my husband, and I received notice to leave, when my husband took me to some friends of his at Westminster, where he left me, and did not come near me until I met him in the Edgeware-road, when he beat me in Mrs. Burchell's presence, and sent me home to my mother's in the country. There I remained some time without trying to have further communication with my husband. I heard by chance that he had his discharge, and some months after that he was dead. Eight years after this, having heard nothing whatever of my hus<lb/>band,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185809200008"/>
               <p>I married Charles Thomas Farmer, with whom I have lived 4 years. I had some disagreement with him, on which account we parted, and I, in a moment of insanity, I suppose, attempted to drown myself; but being rescued and taken to the workhouse, and asked to give an account of my<lb/>self, I, of course, thinking my first husband was dead, mentioned my first marriage as well as my second, which led to inquiry, and it was discovered that I had been misinformed, and that my first husband was still living.</p>

On Tuesday night, 17th August, at 25 minutes to 11 o'clock I heard a row in this beer-shop—I went in and saw Rachel Haynes bleeding from the arm—I saw Bradley and his wife sitting in the corner of the tap-room—Haynes showed me her arm—she was bleeding from it—there was blood on the tap-room floor—I know Mrs. Williams, the landlady—she called me in and handed me this knife; it was wet with blood—I saw wounds on Haynes' arms, and a cut between the fingers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Butcher, of 81, Long-lane—on 2d September the prisoners came into the shop about 4 o'clock—Leather asked me to show them some shawls out of the window—I showed them some—they said they did not suit, and asked to see some more—I told them that I had no more of the same quality—Roe then pointed to a parcel behind the counter, and said, "Let us look at those," and she went round the counter—I said I would show them the shawls—she said she thought she would save me the trouble—I then showed them the shawls, and I counted 7 in the parcel—Roe then asked me to show her another shawl out of the window—I went to the window for that purpose—before doing so I placed the 7 shawls on the counter, near the edge where the customers stand—when I brought the shawl from the window, Roe said, "Will you hold one corner while I see the size"—she laid hold of one corner and I held the other—I was near the window, and she at the other end—the shawl almost hid those that were on the counter—while I was holding it I saw the shawls on the counter move—Roe then said that the shawls would not suit, that the colours were too gay, and her mistress would not like them—she said that she had been told that Mr. Butcher kept such a nice assortment of shawls, and they were recommended there—I told them they were not such a good assortment as we generally had got, because we were taking stock—she asked if we would send some up to<lb/>morrow at the Victoria Hotel, opposite the post-office—I said I would speak to Mr. Butcher about it, and if I did it would be about 4 o'clock—she said I should see a lot of servants there, but I was to go down stairs and ask for Ann—they then left the shop together—as soon as they were gone I counted the shawls that were on the counter, and missed one—I directly went after the prisoners—I secured Roe; another witness took Leather—a person named Shreeve gave me this shawl—the witness Morgan had given it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an inspector of the G division of police. On Friday, 3d September, I went with four other officers to 2, Crown-place, Crown-street, Soho, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—I found the street-door open and I went up to the two-pair—Bryan and James Brannan were with me—I had left the other two officers outside—I forced the door open and the first thing I saw was three or four children in bed in the first room—another room led out of that where I saw the two prisoners in bed—I said, "Well Mr. Ferryman, I have come to pay you a visit;" he jumped out of bed, and I said, "I have come to take you in custody;" he said, "For what?" I said, "For having coining implements;" he said, "You wont find much; you may find enough to give me a stretch, but not much else"—I called up Elliott and Cook—Bryant and Bran Dan then took the two prisoners—I proceeded to the mantel-shelf, and under an image I found 6 counterfeit sixpences of the date of 1846, they were wrapped separately in paper—I found on the top of that image which was broken, another little packet, containing 4 counterfeit groats of the date of 1844, wrapped separately—I went to a shelf in the room, and in a little box I found a galvanic battery plate with the wire attached, which had evidently been dipped in solution—this jar was full of acid—in a tea-cup close by, I found a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece partly dissolved, and a cup containing a little fluid—I preserved a portion of the acid—in the box I found 2 files with white metal in their teeth—they apparently had been recently used—I found a canister con<lb/>taining plaster-of-paris in powder, this bottle which contains acid, and there were several other bottles—I noticed that the copper-wire had been</p>

I returned to the mantel-shelf and took up this book—Thomas Ferryman said, "Don't take that Mr. Brannan, that is our rent book"—I went to the cupboard and found some sand and several articles all necessary for coining—I found this pad which is for holding the mould when it is so hot that they can't hold it with their hands—these are articles used in manufacturing counterfeit coin.</p>

I took the two women in custody—I saw them on Champion-hill, walking towards London quite fast—I told them what I took them for—they both said, they had passed no bad money—I took them to the top of Camberwell-grove, where we met Westlake—she said to Teague, "You gave me a bad half-crown,"—Teague said, "If I did, I did not know it." Westlake gave me this half-crown, and Atwood gave me this other—Lane and Teague were taken to the Station—Teague gave the name of Mary Ann Griffin, Pye-street, Westminster—there was nothing else known against them, and they were discharged.</p>

On 28th August, about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock I heard my shop lad talking to a person in the shop—my lad came into the room to me, and gave me a bad half-crown—I then went into my shop and saw the prisoner there—I said to her, "This is a bad half-crown"—she said "Is it? I will change it"—I said "Not quite so fast, you knew it was bad"—she said, "No, I did not know it; I took it of a cabman last night"—I said, "I am of a contrary opinion; I shall give you in custody"—the boy then left the shop—the prisoner said, "You need not do that, I will bring my husband; he will make it all right"—she then went out of the shop, and I saw no more of her till she was brought back within a quarter of an hour—I gave her in charge—I gave the half-crown to Holmes—they took it to the station, and I believe Emmett marked it—I did not go</p>

I don't know where to find her no more than a child; I have not seen her for three or four years; she robbed me and left me"—he said, "Your wife lies dead; if you like to go out you can"—I said, "If you had brought me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, you would not have brought me better news"—these facts can be proved by application at Clerkenwell Workhouse—I could have brought those persons, but I had no money, being out of work—I have not had a farthing since November—when I married Elizabeth Lorimer, I never knew but what that woman was actually dead—when I left the workhouse, I was had up before the board, and the master stated before the sixteen guardians that a message had come there respecting my wife, that she was dead—when I went out, the first person I went to was this boy and his brother; I said to him, "Do you know whether Mrs. Craven is dead?"—he said, "I do not know anything about Mrs. Craven; if she had died twenty years ago, all the better for you." I went from there to Greenman-lane, to a person who is now gone to Australia; she told me she did not know whether she was dead; but she said, "I have no doubt that she is dead"—I then went to a person named Probert, who knew her perfectly well; I said to her, "Mrs. Probert, do you know whether Mrs. Craven is dead?"—she said, "I dare say she is; the last time I saw her was a month ago, and I thought she could not live that day out"—I went to the master, and told him, and he said, "You take it for granted that she is dead"—I did not know but what she was actually dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am metropolitan police-sergeant—I know Henry Smith; he is too ill to travel—these depositions were taken in the presence of the defendant—they are signed by the justice before whom the enquiry took place—the defendant's attorney had an opportunity of cross-ex<lb/>amining Henry Smith—(<hi rend="italic">Read: This deponent Henry Smith, upon his oath, said as follows</hi>:—"I am sergeant of the metropolitan police force (detective). From information we received from Portsmouth, through the Board of Ad<lb/>miralty, I went with the officer Robinson to-day about 11 o'clock, to 5, Windsor-street, Bishopgate-street-without, and outside the door I saw the prisoner—I asked if his name was Cohen,—he said, 'Yes'—I then told him I was a police officer, and asked him if he had received two casks—he hesitated and went inside—I went in with him—I repeated my question; and he said, 'Yes, I have,'—I said, 'Who from?' and he told me 'Mr. Warren, of Portsea,'—I asked him what Mr. Warren was; and he said, 'A. marine-store dealer'—I then said, 'I suspect they contain metal, the pro<lb/>perty of Her Majesty, and have you any objection to our searching your place?' he said, 'I have; you shall not search it'—in the passage of the house where we were, I saw two casks—I opened the head of one of the casks, and I saw it contained copper nails and bolts, marked with the broad arrow—I asked him if he knew the contents; and he said, 'No, I do not.' I had previously seen these two casks at Mr. Harris's, a carrier at the Nag's-head in the Borough, and I had watched them delivered at this house—on the desk of the counting-house, where we were talking, I found the bill I pro<lb/>duce, for the carriage of the two casks, made out to Mr. H. Cohen—I said, 'You must consider yourself my prisoner, and you must go to the station'—he resisted very much, and gave orders to his men to bolt the doors, and shut us out, and tried to get away into the street—we secured him with assistance.</p>

               <p>the property in it, bearing the mark of the broad-arrow—he then told the defendant he must consider himself in custody on that charge—Smith then took charge of Cohen, I taking charge of the property, the two casks—the workmen were then called in by Mr. Cohen—we asked to search the place; he said, "No"—a signal was given to the workmen to close the gates, and get us out—a great mob of people came round and tried to get the prisoner away, and prevent me taking the casks, but I did ultimately get them out, and get them into a cab—Smith charged Cohen with having in his pos<lb/>session government stores, the property of Her Majesty—that was after the sign had been given to the workmen—he said he should not go, he did not know anything about it—I took charge of the two casks, and took them to the station—I have them below stairs; they are a great weight—I stood by the side of Smith when he opened the cask head—that was after he had told the prisoner he was in custody, and after the resistance was made.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">to the defendant; but they had also proved that he had not had the opportunity of opening or looking at them, when he might have accepted or rejected those that were marked with the broad-arrow; he referred to Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Wilmett, in support of his argument</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WEST</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the word "knowingly" used by Mr. Justice Coltman in that case did not apply to the knowledge that they were the Queen's stores, but to the knowledge that they were in the possession</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON WATSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that it was necessary in order to convict a person under this statute that he should have knowingly in his possession goods marked with the broad-arrow, that he must have knowledge of the possession, and that he must have knowledge that they were marked with the broad-arrow; the statute was couched in very general terms; it did not state in so many words that he must have in his possession, power, or custody "knowingly." but that was the true meaning of the statute; the word possession imported knowledge, it implied that he received into his possession something marked with the broad-arrow; therefore, it was necessary first to show possession, and secondly, to show that the thing possessed was so marked to the knowledge of the defendant. As to the question of possession, if it were necessary, in this case he should leave it to the Jury, with the observation that although the casks were brought to the prisoner's premises, there was no evidence of the terms upon which they were sent, nor was any time given for examination, or of exercising a power of adoption or rejection. The case of Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Wilmett, before Mr. Justice Coltman, was precisely on all fours with this, and specifically pointed to a knowledge of the mark being there, otherwise there could be no conviction; that view appeared to him to be one of sound law and sound sense, and gave a reasonable interpretation to the statute; in his opinion it was necessary in point of law to show that the defendant did know the articles had the broad-arrow upon them, supposing they were in his possession, and there was no reasonable evidence to go to the Jury to support that</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HILL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of the same opinion; it was no offence under the second section unless the party charged had possession of the goods, knowing them to be marked; this was made clear by a reference to the recital in the first section; the possession in the second section was put in exactly the same category with the concealing, which was a positive act done by the individual in order to constitute the crime; in his opinion it was necessary to show that the party sought to be fixed with a crime under the second section, had a knowledge that the goods were marked with the broad-arrow, and if he was ignorant of that fact, he was not guilty of any offence within the meaning of the statute; and the application of common sense to the construction of the statute showed that this must be so; if there had been ordered a couple of casks of old metal, obtained from ships, and out of 1,000 pieces, one only bore the objectionable mark, could it he said that the person to whom the casks were sent was guilty of any criminal offence, before he had opened the casks and seen the metal? and yet if this application of the statute was insisted upon, the Crown must go the whole length of contending for that absurdity. It appeared to him therefore to be applying plain common sense to the construction of the statute, to say that no offence was committed against the second section, unless it was shown that the individual in whose possession or custody it was alleged the goods were, knew that they were marked with the broad-arrow</hi>.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Gillespy and Co., carrying on business as merchants at 2, Brabant-court, Philpot-lane—Mr. Gabriel Raine Ford, of Constantinople, was a correspondent of our house—he died recently—he was in the habit of drawing bills on our house, on my father, Mr. Thomas Gillespy—this bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented at our house for acceptance in the beginning of January, 1857—it is dated, Constantinople, September 25th, 1856—it is drawn by Mr. Ford on my father at 30 days' sight, and indorsed to the order of Mr. Joseph Ruscovitch—it was accepted and taken away from our counting-house the same day by the prisoner, and that was paid in the usual way—on 15th August, 1857, the prisoner called at the counting-house, and brought this bill for 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by Mr. Ford on my father, payable at sight—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:"25th September, 1856.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> All this has been a machination by somebody else—when I came to London first, I had a bill of exchange for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—I had the first and second, and having received the money from Mr. Gil<lb/>lespy, I kept the duplicate, and wrote on it received by me, and my address; and after having left the house, 41, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square, I did not find that duplicate amongst my papers—I saw it was lost—I did not make any noise about it—I thought, having received the money, the duplicate was of no value—I therefore believe that somebody who has found the duplicate which I lost, has imitated it, and made the second bill for 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the bill at Constantinople, and I saw that the forged bill and the original bill was the same writing—when I had established myself at Constantinople, a gentleman came to my office, and, as he did not under<lb/>stand Turkish, he made a proposal that I should go to Beyroot to buy cotton for him, and he would supply me with money, and what I might gain we would divide between us—on the day I left he gave me no money, but gave me a bill of exchange for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling, on the house of Hanson &amp; Co., and when presented, they said they believed it was a forgery—they protested it, and so I went to Constantinople and gave the address of that gentleman, and the Turkish police could not find him. I was told he was in London; I therefore believe that he stands in connexion with that forged bill of exchange, because it may be seen from the bill of exchange for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that it resembles the writing of this forged bill—all this might proceed from the duplicate of the bill of exchange which I have lost—I therefore protest against my imprisonment because I am entirely innocent, and I leave it to the Judge and jury to make such provision that I may defend myself further, because I have got no lawyer here in this country, and when leaving Constantinople they refused me to speak to my friends—I have got no money—I have been eight months without being able to speak to anybody—I was not allowed to see my own mother, and that was a barbarism.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper at Hambro'-wharf—I generally go there about half-past 5. On August 7th I saw Dawson come out of the Brown Bear—the prisoner was there before I got there, harnessing one of Cordery's horses—that was not usual, but he said that Cordery and he had to be at Brown and Eagle's early that morning—his own horses were in the other stable—I believe they were harnessed, but I did not go to see—at eleven or twelve minutes before 6 o'clock I saw him take away his van with the chestnut horses—I did not see Cordery go away, but he had his horses out in the yard—I saw Cordery's boy about half-past 6—they sometimes go away without their boys—the boys are not always there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the service of Messrs. Pickford—on Saturday, 7th August, I was in the Back-road, St. George's-in-the-East, driving a pair-horse van, with two hogsheads of sugar—I saw a van of Chaplin and Horne's, about 8 o'clock in the morning, loaded with wool, and covered with a company's sheet, which attracted my attention, as the orders are that no sheet shall leave the premises without an order—it was just going across Cannon-street-road—going from Aldgate, passing White<lb/>chapel Church, you would turn to the right, and that would lead you down Cannon-street-road, which runs into Backchurch-lane, at the end of it—the first time I saw the van it was beyond Cannon-street, more towards the City—I do not know whether it came down Cannon-street or not—it was in the same road as I was going—I am not aware that it is usual to see vans of wool in that neighbourhood—there are no wool-houses that way, and no wool is landed on this side of the water below there—a man whom I do not know was driving, and the prisoner was walking ten or twelve yards before the load; he was in working condition, and had something on his arm—I have identified the load since, but I did not notice the number of the van; Mr. Gale asked me which was the load, and I picked it out from a number of others; that was two or three days afterwards, I think.</p>

I am constable of the Victoria Dock Company—I was on duty in plain clothes at West Ham, on 14th September, and saw the prisoner going towards the iron bridge—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, something a man had given him—I found he had got 74lbs. of lead wrapped up in a handkerchief—I took him into the Dock, and then he said he saw this lead in a hole, and he took a portion of it—we have missed 230 feet of lead from the roof of the building—I have com<lb/>pared this lead found on the prisoner with the place where it was taken off; it is part and portion of it; the nail-holes correspond exactly—the prisoner was in the employ of the Dock Company occasionally, as a labourer.</p>

               <p>at a little after 1 o'clock; I called to know if it was Miss Izod, and she called out, "It is not me,"—I got up, put on my trowsers and shoes, and went down stairs—I went in the back parlour and saw the prisoner there—he had got in at the back parlour window—there was not a regular fastening to that window, but I had put a nail in at each end, and the nails had got in between the two sashes—I asked the prisoner how he came there; he said he came for a night's lodging—he could not have got in there if he had not been sober—a chest of drawers stood before that window, on which was a jug; I could scarcely have got in without knocking it off; a drunken man could not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Downing, of Deptford, the surgeon to the police—I was sent for to the station at 1 o'clock on Sunday morning—I examined Kendall's middle finger of the left hand, and found the nail torn off, and there was a wound which was evidently the result of a bite; it was about half an inch long, and has proved very troublesome, as the tip of the finger began to slough; he has been on the sick list ever since, and has not been able to do any duty—Frost complained of some<lb/>thing the matter with his mouth, and I found that his jaw was fractured on the left side; he was sent to Guy's Hospital—Farley had several con<lb/>tusions on the face and back of the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Thompson very much knocked about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not examine him then, because he was in a state of stupor from drink—his face was not covered with blood, to my recollection—I gave him an emetic and a lotion to keep down any swelling from the result of the blows, and Dr. Downing went to see him at 10 next morning—Neale had one tooth knocked out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Knott's-terrace, Tanner-hill. On 7th August, between half-past 12 and 1 o'clock, I heard a disturbance; went out and saw Neale running down from his own place; he lives in Knott's-terrace also—that is not far from where the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was—he did not stop there; but one policeman told another to take a woman in custody—he struck the woman across the shoulders three times, and a man ran up and hit the policeman, and knocked him down, and he struck John Neale with staff—Neale used no violence to the police; he stood with his hands at his sides—I am sure I saw another man knock the policeman down, and kick him—there was not much crowd going down.</p>

The first thing I saw was Neale being taken to the station; his face was covered with blood—there was a noise, but I did not go there; they were hallooing out, "Murder!"—I did not hear cries of "Shame!"—I saw Thompson, and then I said, "Is that you, <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> Neale?"—he said, "Yes;" and the policeman hit him across the nose with a staff, and attempted to strike me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of Bermondsey. On the night of 4th September, I fastened up my house myself, and went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock, as near as possible—I was awoke about a quarter before 6 o'clock in the morning, or it might be earlier—I heard a noise at the back part of my premises—I slept in the first floor—I came down to the back parlour, and saw Donovan in the act of cutting a square of glass out of the back parlour window—he saw me, and ceased his operation—I made my way to the back parlour door, and to the kitchen, where I saw Elliott at a chest of drawers—he saw me, and they both made their escape to the yard—I pursued them, and they turned round and threw a cart-wheel down that was standing in the yard—I followed them through the stable into the open street; I gave an alarm, and an officer followed Donovan—Elliott cut across the road to a passage—I had seen the prisoners before, but not had any conversation with them—I am quite positive that they are the persons;</p>

               <p>it was broad daylight—when I came back, I examined the premises—a square of glass had been cut out of the kitchen window, by which they undid the fastening and got access into the kitchen—they had unfastened the sash—when they got in the kitchen, they opened the kitchen door to the yard—when they came to the parlour door, they found some fastening which they could not get through, so Donovan turned out of the kitchen door, and came into the yard again, and was in the act of cutting a square of glass out of the window to get into the parlour—I found a razor on the top of the drawers, and several things had been removed in the drawers—I examined the razor-case, and the razor which was on the drawers, had been removed from it—my house is in the parish of St. Mary Magdalene, Bermondsey.</p>

I am a cow-keeper in Robert-street, Brixton—the prisoner was in my service about six months—I gave him a week's notice to leave me—I think that was about a month before the fire occurred—there was no dispute between us afterwards with reference to his leaving, no more than he did not come in the morning after I had given him a week's notice, until I had been to him the third time, then he came—there was no dispute about it—on the same night that I gave him notice, he said he had got a place at Mr. Morgan's, and was going to it on Monday—I said to him, "You can't leave me in less than a week"—he said, "Oh, yes! we had no written agreement"—I said, "That does not matter, you are a weekly servant"—he said, "I must go"—then he left me, and I went over to Mr. Morgan; I saw him, and had some conversation with him—I did not see the prisoner afterwards—I don't think I saw the prisoner at all after I saw Mr. Morgan—he left the service about a month before the fire—I found my cows turned loose the day after he had left me, on the Sunday; I found that done six times—they must have been turned loose by some person—I sustained very little injury by that, two or three of the cows got a little bit gored by the horns—they were let loose in the shed—I found that some boards had been taken out—I found that out about three weeks I suppose before the fire, in the same week that the prisoner left—the effect of that was, that a hand could be put in and unbolt the door—I found among the grains, dirt, human dung—I found that twice—at last I was forced to get one of my men to sleep in the shed, and then I noticed nothing further—On the afternoon of 21st July, I was in the stable—my brother-in-law</p>

               <p>Evans, and another man, were there—we left the stable somewhere about ten minutes after 2—all three of us left together—we had been in the stable about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—when we left the stable it was quite safe—there was no wet grass about there, it had been all used up the day before—there were seven cows in the shed when we left it that afternoon—there were two doors, a locked door and a bolted door; they were both fastened when we came away—we left the stable about ten minutes past 2—I went over to my house to give the milk to my men, and then I went on serving my customers—my house is in Robert-street; out of Robert-street runs a short turning which has no thoroughfare; my shed is at the end of it—coming from the shed and going down the court I should have to turn to the left to get into Robert-street, to my house—after I had left the shed, and before I went to deliver my milk, I saw the prisoner—he passed me, I was on the opposite side to my house, serving my customers—he was going towards my shed; he was in Robert-street—I did not see him turn up the court towards my shed, I was going the other way—it was somewhere about forty yards from the turning that I saw him; he was going in the direction of the turning where my shed was—it was about a quarter past 2—I think it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to 3, before the alarm of fire was given to me—it would be about twenty-five minutes before the fire broke out that I saw the prisoner—there is a cottage in that place, opposite my shed, and that is all there is; that is the only dwelling that is in the place—it is an inhabited cottage—it was about twenty minutes to 3 that I heard the alarm of fire—I was then serving at a house called the Jenny Lind, about forty yards off, in Robert-street—I went at once to the shed—it was in that state we could not enter—there were three policemen by the side of me—the fire was most all over the shed—I did not observe where the fire had begun, I was so excited I could not recognize that—my cows were there; they were all burnt; one broke loose, but I was obliged to have it killed directly—I should say it was somewhere about half an hour, or less, before the shed was entirely down.</p>

               <p>I do not think he ever complained to me that he had found the cows loose, or that there was any disturbance within the shed such as what I have described as in the grain—the boards were not down before this, nor were they loose during the time the prisoner was in my service—I am quite sure of that—I never had a board down before—I have boards very near the top of the shed, for ventilation, but that is at the further end of the shed—the boards there are within the reach of a person standing on a short ladder.</p>

               <p>where the cow-shed was—I saw Williams in the middle of the road, up the turning where the shed was—she was between me and the shed—I saw the prisoner at the corner, about three yards from Mr. Fowler's shed—he was standing at the side of the shed, with one hand down his side and one hand in his smock—he ran down Clark's-row, that is opposite the turning, a continuation of the court where the shed is—he crossed Robert-street, and turned round and looked when he had got just by Mr. Lowe's, the beer-shop; and I noticed how very pale he looked—I went to my door, 3, Robert-street, and saw him run down Clark's-row—I did not hear anything of him after that, but I saw the flames—I saw the fire about ten minutes after the prisoner ran down from within three yards of the shed—I was in the back garden when I first saw the fire—it appeared to be at the side of the loft, in front—I saw the flame rising up—I heard the prisoner say, about a week before the fire broke out, that he would serve Mr. Fowler a trick, and it should not be long first—I did not hear him say anything besides that on that occasion—I did not hear him say anything at all about why he would serve him out—I was passing by very quickly with some beer in my hand.</p>

               <p>the direction of the shed as if he was coming into Robert-street—he looked very pale—I did not notice him turn round at all as he was coming along—I did not notice anybody else in the turning, only my sister; I was running after my little sister—I have known the prisoner about four years, by living there—this was about five or ten minutes before the fire—when the fire first broke out I was standing in the garden next to my mother's, scraping some potatoes—I saw the flames, and I ran to my mother and said, "Oh! mother, there is a fire"—it seemed to come from the loft door facing the turning; that is the front—I saw the prisoner again some time afterwards, I can't say exactly how long—I have heard the prisoner say that he owed Mr. Fowler a grudge, and he would pay him before long, for he had got Morgan's <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> in his place, and was going to send him away without a week's notice—that was about a week after he left Mr. Fowler's—I do not know Morgan's boy—Mr. Fowler had a young man that used to live with Mr. Morgan I believe.</p>

I am the son of the last witness—I do not recollect at what time in the afternoon I saw Finch at my mother's house—he was turning the mangle—I recollect the alarm of fire being given—I was at the fire—I saw the fire, and I ran to it as all the others did—the prisoner was in our house when I ran to the fire—I do not know how long he was in our house before the fire, because I did not see him come in—I suppose I was in the room with him about five minutes before the fire began, but I will not be sure of the time; I mean about five minutes before I heard of the fire—it takes me about a minute to run from our house to Fowler's shed; not above two or three minutes to walk—I left the prisoner behind; he was turning the mangle when I ran out—I saw him at the fire a good while after I got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the house of Mrs. Murphy—I was present on the evening of 17th August, and saw all that took place—I and Leonard were standing at Mrs. Murphy's door, 269, Kent-street, when the prisoner passed by—she turned back and said, "Are you talking to me? if you are, talk to my backside"—I and the prosecutrix were talking to each other—with that the prisoner goes in-doors, and comes out and says to the prose<lb/>cutrix, "Here, I wants you;" and the prosecutrix said, "If you want me, you must come here"—she comes over, and with that hit the prosecutrix on the temple with the poker; and with that she went in-doors again, and she came out, and the prosecutrix went to make a grasp at her to give her into custody, and she had a knife in her hand—the prosecutrix held up her hand to keep the blow off her face, and she received it on her left hand instead—after that she fainted in my arms, and I called two young men to my assist<lb/>ance to take her to the doctor's shop; and with that I cried out to her sister, Mrs. Murphy, that she was stabbed—the prisoner rushed in-doors—coming back from the doctor's shop, I saw Mrs. Murphy's servant, Catherine Clark, break the windows with the poker—I left the prosecutrix at the doctor's—she was quite insensible at the doctor's—I came back to give the prisoner into custody, and I saw Catherine Clark break the windows with the poker.</p>

                  </hi>. I was servant at the house of Mrs. Murphy on 17th August—I saw all that took place on that evening—on 17th, about 11 o'clock at night, all three of us were standing at the door, the prosecutrix, and the other witness, and myself—we were laughing at our own affairs—the prisoner was coming from her mother-in-law's, and she told us to talk to her backside—then she went inside her own door, and she called Leonard—she said, "What is it you want?" she said, "Come here"—she went to her, and with that she up with the poker and struck her on the temple—she went in-doors, and immediately came out again—Leonard went to get hold of her to give her into custody, and she <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with a knife and made a stab at her forehead—Leonard put up her hand, and caught it in her hand—she was then taken to the doctor's—I did not go with her—I stopped near the house, and after she was gone to the doctor's I broke five panes of glass—I did that because the prisoner was laughing inside her own room at me, and I wanted to give her into custody—the prosecutrix did not break any windows.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was Mrs. Murphy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had come from her lodging-house in Red-cross-street—this house is not a brothel; it is a coffee-shop—persons sleep there all night if they want a bed; they do not come there for an hour or two—I have been living there five months—I do not know the man that took the prosecutrix away to the doctor's—I did not see any man take her to the doctor's—I saw her fall in the last witness' arms, and then I broke the windows—I did not see any one assist in taking her to the doctor's—the prisoner did not come out again, after she went in doors and shut the door—I saw the whole of the transaction—the prosecu<lb/>trix did not go into the prisoner's house—I swear that—I cannot say what sort of knife it was that the prisoner had—I am sure it was a knife, I saw it—there was a lamp at the public-house, on the same side of the way, three doors off—I saw the point of the knife, I did not see it all—I do not know Mrs. Hales—I know the woman who keeps the chandler's shop opposite—I do not know her name—Mrs. Murphy was not present—she came as I was breaking the windows—that was after the blow was struck; she was not there when the blow was struck—she came from her house in Red-cross-street—I heard Ellen Griffiths say, "Here is Mrs. Murphy coming;" that was after the blow was struck—Leonard was then at the doctor's shop, insensible—the doctor's shop is five or six doors from Mrs. Murphy's—it was while I was breaking the windows that I heard Griffiths say that Mrs. Murphy was coming—I did not see Mrs. Murphy endeavour<lb/>ing to take the prosecutrix in-doors; she was not there—no windows were broken till I broke them—I swear that—I did not see the woman at the chandler's shop that night—her shop was closed—I have never been tried; I swear that—I was locked up the other night, on account of this person being fully committed for trial—her sister-in-law said that I had assaulted her, but I never did—I was locked up from between 2 and 3 in the morning till between 11 and 12 next morning—I do not know who sent for the policeman on this evening; I believe Mrs. Murphy did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on 18th August, with a wound in her left hand about an inch and a half long—it was in the ball of the thumb, extending into the palm, very deep; it was a clean cut wound; there was a great deal of bleeding from it—in my opinion it was caused by a knife—I should think an ordinary dinner knife would produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering the position of the wound, do you think it probable that it could have been inflicted by breaking a pane of glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not be the usual way of breaking a pane of glass, and I should have expected to find glass in the wound, from the direction of it—it was not straight, and glass would not bend as a knife would—there was no glass in the wound; she was in a dangerous condition for some time—she had repeated attacks of bleeding, besides the danger of tetanus, that is in all these cases the great danger—she was there till the 15th of this month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you will not say that it could not have been inflicted by glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is barely possible—I have been house-surgeon for twelve months; I have seen a great many cases of this kind—we have twenty or thirty accidents a day sometimes, and a great many of them are from cuts.</p>

I am a paper-stainer, of 255, Kent-street—I was at the greengrocer's for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of oysters, and heard a smash of windows three houses off, on the same side—I went out, and the door was shut, and the blind down—when I had been there half a minute, the pro<lb/>secutrix <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with her left hand and went so at the window, and I saw blood drop on the pavement which was not there before—I saw Carpenter take her away—I do not know Leonard—I afterwards saw a young girl with a rod of iron, or a poker, come from the coffee-shop door, which is next to the house where the window was broken; she broke a window, and said, "Poll, why the hell do you commence and not finish fort?" and her sister, as I was told, a big stout woman, called the one that was out, a b—fool, and said it was all against herself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 5, North-street, East-lane, Walworth—I was about calling on Mary Ann McDonald—I was passing 299, Kent-street, on the opposite side of the way, and saw the prosecutrix rush into the prisoner's house, and then she was pushed out and tried to force the door, but was not able—she broke a second square of glass and cut her left hand, and two young men led her from the window to the doctor's—on her breaking the second square, the blood flowed directly—I cannot say whether her hand was open or closed—another woman then rushed out from the coffee-shop with a poker or stick, and commenced breaking the windows—she broke three or four, and while she was breaking them she called Mrs. Murphy a cow, making use of worse language before it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Kent-street, opposite Mrs. Murphy's—I keep a general shop—my husband is living—on the night in question I was standing at my own door—the prisoner was at her door, and the prosecutrix was at her sister's door—she went to the prisoner, caught hold of her dress, and tore her dress, calling her a bad name—she pulled her out and told her to come and fight—the prisoner went into her house, and the prosecutrix followed her—what happened inside I can't say; but the prisoner turned her out and closed the door—the prisoner knocked and hammered at the door for two or three minutes; she could not get the door open, and she then thrust one hand through a pane of glass, and then she repeated it a second time—I did not see it, but I heard them say that she cut her hand at the second blow—two young men took her to the doctor's—the prisoner did not come out any more—I afterwards saw the servant come out</p>
