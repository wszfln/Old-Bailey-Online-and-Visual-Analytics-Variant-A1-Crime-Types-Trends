            . On the 29th of July, when the child had given an account how she came by the injury, I went and asked the prisoner how he came to behave so? he confess'd he had acted with the girl twice the week before; that is, he had had carnal knowledge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words?</p>
               <p>Dermot. He told me he was concern'd with the child twice the week before; and pointed to a place, which was on the corner of a board, by the window: he said, he did it; I said, did you really? he said, yes, I did, and only twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge him with?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I charged him with lying with, and ravishing the child; and he confess'd he did it twice.</p>

               <p>Dermot. I am a neighbour to the prosecutor: I brought the girl to confront him, and she pointed to the same place he had done, before his face, and he did not deny it.</p>

I have known him about three months: since this affair happened I have enquired into his character; when I first knew him, he was a farmer's man; his master gave him the character of a very industrious man. We expected him to have been tried at Oxford, or he would have had a great many to appear in his behalf. I never heard that his character was stain'd before.</p>

               <p>Smith Dalton. Last Monday was sen'night, I went into the Tun and Bull, in Oxford-road, about eight in the morning, and call'd for a pint of beer; I saw a shop mate going by, and call'd him in; we had a couple of rolls for breakfast: the prisoner came in, and sat down by my shop-mate; she asked him for a piece of bread? he said, here is a roll, you are welcome to it. She came in with a complaint, that a man had robbed her, and taken some money and a spoon out of her pocket: one of the men went out, and fetched some roast pork: she wanted bread and mustard; I went out and got some; we drank, I believe, two or three pots of beer. She went out and came in again, and asked who would lend her a shilling? I thought she was in distress, and so lent her a shilling. She went out and came in again, and said she was a captain's widow, that she had money enough, and a very fine house; she made choice of me, and said if I would go home with her, she would marry me, and give me all she was worth. I went with her to the Coach and Horses, not far off: I asked a soldier at the Tun and Bull to go with me; I thought if there was any body with me, she could do me no harm. She said, my dear, send out for some victuals for the poor man, he has not eat any thing all day; she shewed her money at the Tun and Bull. I said, you have got plenty of money, you might send for something. She said, do my dear; so I sent out for some stakes. While the soldier was gone for them, she put her hand into my breeches pocket; I took her by the wrist, and said, don't take any thing out of my pocket: she took her hand out, and I had my money then; the money was wrapped up in a piece of paper (half a guinea, and a five and three pence). The soldier and I went to the Tun and Bull again; she followed us. An oyster-woman came in; she wanted me to have some oysters: she said, Do, my dear, eat some oysters; she would have some, right or wrong, and I eat one or two. She said she would have me home with her, to this fine house: then she met a man with a laced hat like a gentleman's servant; she said to him, Cousin, this man I have got, I am to marry to-morrow, and said, get a coach. I said, madam, I suppose you have walked London streets before, and can walk home without a coach, and if you get a coach you must pay for it; she said she would. The fellow went for a coach; we got into it, she and I on one side, and the man on the other. I had not been long in the coach, before she unbuttoned my breeches, and laid her hands upon my private parts, that was the time she took my money; then she went to the other side of the coach, where the other man was: she laughed and sung. When we came to the fine house, which I saw was a bawdy-house, I went in, and unbuttoned my breeches pocket, and found my money gone; I thought with myself now she has flung me sure enough: she did not come nigh me afterwards. She said, my dear, what is the matter with you? I said, matter enough, you have picked my pocket. She went out, and this fellow followed her: then he came in again, and asked what that woman did to me? I said, did not I tell you she had pick'd my pocket: he said, God d - n the whore, I would have hang'd her, if you had told me of it. He went out again, and I thought it was my best time to make off from this bawdy-house, as they were both at the door talking together. I said, madam, you must go with me to the watch-house; she said, yes, my dear, you shall lie with me all night. I said, give me my money; she said, if you say any thing about the money, I'll swear a rape against you; and the man said he would swear I ravished her in the coach: I thought it was time to make off, and I got to my lodgings about twelve o'clock. I went to Justice Wright's, he granted me a warrant, and she was taken the next day: when I took her before the justice, she offered me twenty guineas to make it up: I told her it was out of my power.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took your money?</p>
               <p>Dalton. Before I went into the coach, I buttoned up my pocket, and I had my money then, it was about 10 o'clock at night. I am a carpenter, and came from Bristol but ten weeks ago.</p>

            . The warrant being brought to me, I took her up: when she was before the justice, she offered twenty guineas to make it up: while the justice was writing her mittimus, she offered a hundred guineas for ball. As we went in the coach with her to Newgate, she said she would give any money to make it up, for she had so many different causes in hand, that they would ruin her. I saw them together all the day before this affair happened, in the Tun and Bull, which is next door to my house, and I was afraid something would happen, as I knew her to be an infamous woman: she was discharged here last sessions.</p>

               <p>He was to be sure in the coach with me, and had I the man here, he would be upon oath, that he never complained from the beginning to the end; I believe he did not lose any thing; he staid drinking. After he got out of the coach, he never said a word; he said he wanted to find a rich brother that lived in the city, and said he would be 6 d. towards a coach: he was very angry, because I would not let him go home with me. It is very hard to have my life swore away, when I have witnesses, that if they were here, would prove the contrary.</p>

               <p>Thompson. If the hosiers sent twelve pair, and set down only eleven, is what I suppose they call over number; whereas they are not, for they charge me with them all, I can prove it by my bills.</p>

I let my parlour to the prisoner and a man that came with her, as her husband, for 3 s. a week: at that time, I had a very good character of them; but afterwards having reasons to think they were not married, I gave the man warning; (his name was White) but could not get rid of them: he went into the country to see his friends: then she received all sorts of men, as a common prostitute. After that, I was informed she belong'd to a gang of thieves: I gave her warning on a Monday morning, and on the Tuesday I had reason to think my house was beset; there were several fellows came after her. I applied to Justice Girdler for his advice: he told me, the way to get rid of her was by taking the door off the hinges, and the windows out. I went and demanded admittance into her room; she made no answer for some time: then she abused me for coming at that time of the night. The watch going by, I called him; I sent for the constable of the night; he came, and we broke the door open: there were a man and she sitting by the table; they were both conducted to Bridewell: my wife examined the bed, and miss'd a blanket. The under turnkey took her before Justice Girdler, and told him there was nothing against her but an assault: thus by deceiving the Justice, she was discharged. I got a fresh warrant and took her again; and by a search warrant, found the blanket at Mr. William Whitton's, on Hare-street-hill, who told me the prisoner brought it there in the name of White.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you let the lodging to her in?</p>
               <p>Rollos. In the name of White, as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you let it to?</p>

We went and brought them in again : Gill ran into the yard, and returned again, and the next day we found one of my half pint glass mugs put between the water-tub and the wall. After he sat down again in the same room, another glass mug was taken from under his coat, behind him; the two mugs were both in a cupboard, in the parlour, just before they came in. A surgeon, named Maglassey, picked up the bundle in the street, and brought that in after the prisoners. In the bundle were my sheet, and Mrs. Club's two aprons, with other things, not mine: they both denied knowing any thing of the bundle, and said they brought no bundle in with them, but I saw Gill had a small bundle under his arm when he came in.</p>

               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Gill. I believe he is 21 or 22 years of age. I always took him to be a very sober boy; he sent for me that evening, by the keeper of Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to live constantly with his mother?</p>
               <p>Gill. He has been backward and forwards there; he has been a waiter at a tavern, but was then out of business: I know nothing of Shaw.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to the prosecutor's; he said he had a suspicion he had been robbed by some of his servants: when he began to accuse the prisoner, he said he knew nothing of the matter. I said, you have two other servants, search them all, and their boxes; that was agreed upon; the woman searched the women and boxes, but nothing was found: the prisoner said he would make the prosecutor smart for what he had done, in accusing him. The prosecutor asked the prisoner what he had done with the green purse he used to have? the prisoner said, he having no occasion for it, had sold it for 3 d. that morning. Mr. Gittos said, he believed the purse and his money were some where in the house; he believed it must be in the cellar. At last the prisoner said, D - n it, if you hang me, I don't care; I'll tell you where the money is, if you'll go down into the cellar; so we went down with him; he delivered to me this green purse and this money in it. It was hid behind some old boards. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the prisoner deliver the purse and money to Mr. Hendrick.</p>
               <p>Hendrick. There was in the purse 1 l. 14 s. two sixpences and a few half-pence. He said it was all his master's money, except the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose purse was it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is the prisoner's purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he took the money from?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. He said he took it out of his master's bureau, in his bedchamber.</p>

She did not come up, so I went down after her, and went to the Swan, but she was not there when I came in; yet she came in about half an hour after.

The prisoner came into our shop, yesterday was three weeks, about one in the day, to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I was in the shop by myself: while she was looking at some handkerchiefs, a man came in and wanted to look at some garters; he went to the other counter, and I call'd for somebody to come to me in the shop: the prisoner bid very low, and out she went; the man went out also. A woman came in, and said she thought I had had some shop-lifters; I looked, and missed a parcel of handkerchiefs, which she had just been looking at. I sent the maid after her, and was informed she went towards Grub-street: she was brought back with the handkerchiefs.

I went up into Chiswell-street, and there was the maid; she said the woman was gone on, dressed in a black gown, and a striped bed-gown over it: I went on, and overtook her in Moorfields, and stopped her till the maid came up: in bringing her back to the shop, she strove all she could to drop the handkerchiefs, but she could not. When she came within about three hundred yards of Mrs. Carew's house, she pulled them out of her bosom, or pocket, and gave them to me, and said, there are the handkerchiefs. I brought them and her to the shop, and delivered the handkerchiefs to Mrs. Carew; these are the same. I put the letters B G upon them; here it is.</p>

I advertised it the next day, and then there was an advertisement in with mine, giving an account that it was stopt: the gentleman came to me, his name is Wallis. and said he believed he had got my ring, which he had seen advertised; he had delivered it to the gentlemen at Hicks's-hall. (Produced and deposed to) I saw the prisoners the same day; I saw the ring again at Hicks's-hall; they said, they bought it of two chimney-sweeper-boys in Moorfields, for three pence, and that the boys told them they cut my glass with a diamond, and then they could not get the ring out, till they went to a butcher's shop, and got a skewer and took it out with that: I asked them if they knew the two chimney-sweepers? they said one was named Joss, but did not know the other's name.</p>

            . I live in Cow-cross, and am a pawnbroker. A girl came to my shop to pawn or sell this ring the same night it was lost, between 8 and 9 in the evening. I asked her which way she came by it? at first she said she had bought it; I threatned her; then she said that she had it of two boys, and that they were in the street, opposite my door. In order to secure them, I desired her to go and tell them I would give seven shillings for it. I stept out along with her, and as soon as they saw me, they set off; she and I went after them; at last I took both of them, Hatton got from me, and got away; Whitfield told me he found it in the middle of Smithfield: I secured him and the girl, and went the next morning and delivered the ring to the justice at Hicks-hall; Hatton was taken the next day. I asked him how he came by the ring? Then they both insisted on it for some time that they found it in Smithfield: at last they said they bought it in Moorfields, of two chimney-sweeps.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched?</p>
               <p>Wallis. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a diamond to cut glass being found?</p>

               <p>Wood. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Hatton's Defence.</p>
               <p>The chimney-sweeps that found it, asked us if we would buy it? they said they would sell it for a groat; we gave them three pence for it. After that, they said they stole it, and went and shewed us where : then Whitfield laid hold of one, and I the other, in order to take them, but they knocked their caps in our faces, and almost blinded us with soot, and so got away. We went home, and told the people we thought it was stolen. My mother is a washer-woman, and I have lived in two or three public-houses.</p>
               <p>Whitfield's Defence.</p>
               <p>Coming through Moorfields, I met this boy, (meaning Hatton) he had a top in his pocket, and we played with it; there were two chimney sweeps that asked us if we would buy a ring? they said, they believed it was gold, and asked a groat for it, we bought it for 3 d. after we had bought it, they shewed us the place where they said they stole it: when we were going to take them, they flung their caps in our faces, and ran away. We shewed it to a girl, and asked her if it was gold? she said she would give us some apples for it: and said she believed a gentleman in Cow cross would buy it of us; the man came out, and took me, and the other ran away.</p>

            . I was going home to Hampstead, along with Mr. Stockhill; the prisoner came and catch'd him by the collar, and demanded his money; I said, you shall have none: upon that, another man came up, catch'd hold on me, and demanded my money: I told him that neither of them should have any; we took them both, and carried them to Mr. Bird's. When we came there, Mr. Bird said he knew one of them; and persuaded us to let them go for that night, saying, it was hazardous carrying them to prison in the night, and we might get them again the next morning.</p>

            . I keep the public-house, called Mother Red-cap's. Stockhill and Campion brought the prisoner and a chimney-sweeper, who goes by the name of Nesbit to my house, and said, they insisted on going before a justice, saying, they had made an attempt to rob them: the prisoner used to go by my door with a cart and greens almost every day: I said, if you take them to Hampstead, you must go to the cage to secure them; and if you let them go to night, you will be sure to meet with them to-morrow.</p>

The landlord there said, he knew me very well: they say they were going from Smithfield, but instead of that, they were going from Hampstead towards London, and met me; Campion collar'd the chimney-sweeper, and Stockhill collar'd me.</p>

He put his hand in at the door, and took them out of the window; there were ten pair: we went on to the Red Lyon in Whitechapel, where we were to meet the Jew; then it was about half an hour after eight o'clock. We sent for him, and Byfield pulled out the stockings form his pocket, and shewed him them; he told them over, and paid Byfield 20 s. for them.</p>

            . I am a Jew. I bought ten pair of stockings of the prisoner, on that Wednesday night: I have one pair of them here, the rest are sold. (Producing a pair of silk stockings).</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the nine pair for?</p>
               <p>Territchino. I sold them for three shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Jew told us, if he went into any shop, he could buy such for 3 s. a pair: these are not the first things he has bought of us. There is a boy in Newgate now that he has bought things of; and he has given diamonds to him to cut glass windows with. (See the trial of Hatton and Whitfield).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (He takes the pair of stockings in his hand). I sell these for 12 s. or 13 s. a pair: this pair is the worst among the parcel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say. This Jew used to encourage us to do so; he used to give us diamonds to cut windows, and he said, if we got in trouble, he would bail us. He has encouraged several little boys to thieve: he gave 8 s. for a large pair of silver buckles that were worth 30 s.</p>

The serjeant was very much in liquor: the prisoner called me out of the bar, and said, he was going to the Indies, and the serjeant was full of money, and he would noint him: I said, how: he said, in oil: I said, you shall not noint him too much in this house; they went up together to bed: the prisoner came down: I suspected he had robbed him, seeing him come down with a pair of silver buckles in his shoes, and remembring I had seen the serjeant with silver buckles in his shoes: he pulled out a shilling to pay: I heard money rattle: (he had said he had none when he went to bed.) I put three men at the door, and locked it: he found he could not get out: he put his heels over the top of the door, and his back-side next, and hung on the top of the door, and went to make a push off, and the three men stopt him: he began fighting with them: I was in such a taking, I sainted away: they took him in custody: we searched him; and just below the waistband of his breeches, under his shirt, above his private parts, we found the serjeant's silver shoe buckles, and one of his knee buckles, the other he had dropt out of his pocket; we took 6 s. 9 d. out of his pocket, and two pocket books, belonging to the serjeant; all which the serjeant owned: and said, he had the books in his pocket when he went up stairs, and the buckles in his shoes, and knees of his breeches: the serjeant was drunk, and in bed fast asleep, at the time the prisoner was searched.</p>

            . I was sent for, being constable: I saw the prisoner stript in the house; the shoe buckles and one knee buckle were found in his breeches; and the other buckle was found in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Spencer. He said the prosecutor trusted them with him: but the prosecutor said to the contrary in the morning. (The two pair of buckles, two pocket books, and 6 s. 9 d. produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Summers. I saw the two pocket books in the prosecutor's possession before he went to bed; and heard the prisoner say to him, the next day, he hoped he would spare his life: and at the Angel and Crown, in Whitechapel, he hoped we would be favourable to him. The prosecutor was bound over; but was obliged to go to Scotland: so he took some papers out of the pocket books.</p>

            . Last Monday in the afternoon, after dark, I met the prisoner and one Sullivan, in the street: I wanted a pennyworth of tobacco: the prisoner undertook to get me a guinea changed; he went with it, and staid a long time; but at last brought me my change, a little short: I put up with that: we then went to a public house: they wanted me to stay there all night: I did not like the house nor them neither: there was a woman called me on one side, and got me down on the bed: I insisted upon getting up again, and did: I said, I would give her a dram, then I would go home to my lodgings: I took my money out to pay for it; and had it in my left hand: the prisoner snapt the money out of my hand; and said, I'll take care of this, and see you home: he turned and went out at the door; and so did Sullivan: I insisted on having my money again: they would not let me have it: they walked along, and I followed them, till we got into a dark alley; there I lost them. I went then to a place where I knew he was known: there a woman went with me, and shewed me the house where he lived. There were two women and a soldier drinking: I asked if it was Mr. Bourn's house? the woman said, he would be in presently: in five or six minutes I heard his tongue: I ran out; there was he and Sullivan: I took hold of the prisoner: Sullivan ran away: the prisoner got from me: there were two men, I told them he had robbed me; but they would not assist me: then I thought it was best to dodge him; which I did, to the Red-lion, in Nightingale-lane: I told a young man in a shop I had been robbed, by a man just gone in there; he went along with me: just as we got to the door, they were coming out with a parcel of women about them: I shewed him to the gentleman: we took him, and brought him to the watch-house then I charged him with having taken my money: he denied ever knowing me, or having a penny of my money: he said, he never saw me in his life, before he changed a guinea for me in the day. When before the Justice, he acknowledged the other man took the guinea, half guinea, and quarter guinea, and three or four shillings, out of my hand, and gave him part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lost?</p>
               <p>Devene. I had above two guineas in my pocket in the morning; but I had spent some on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mold. I am constable of Aldgate: I, and my brother constable, had been collecting money for the watch: about nine o'clock that day, the prosecutor came into a public house where we were; and said, I understand you are a constable, and I have been robbed; and if you will go along with me, to such a place in Nightingale-lane, we might take the man: he mentioned the same sum of money as he has here: we went with him, taking two watchmen with us, and just as we came to the Red-lion, there was the prisoner coming out of the house, with several women: the poor man said, that is the man, I desire you will take him: the prisoner was a little obstropulous: but we got him to the watch-house, and put him in the cage: then we searched his pockets, and found nine or ten shillings, one farthing, a knife, and a key: which we produced before the Justices in Whitechapel. He declared over and over, the next day, that he knew nothing of the matter: the prosecutor declared he was along with one Sullivan: the prisoner declared he had not seen Sullivan: for several days; and that they wanted to swear his life away. When we came before the Justice, then he said, he believed Sullivan had taken it; and had thrown him down half a guinea, and he would not take it; and they then drank it in egg-hot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the prosecutor in my life, till yesterday at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrys. I am the other constable: the prosecutor came and enquired for a constable; he was admitted into the parlour to us: he told us he had been robbed of a guinea, half a guinea, a quarter guinea, and some silver, which he could not be certain of: we went along with him : when we came to the Red-lion, Nightingale-lane, the prisoner was coming out at the door, with some women:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160017"/> he said, this is the man: I took the prisoner by the collar, and my partner by the other side: we brought him to the watch-house: he denied at first, that he had ever been in the prosecutor's company, only that evening for three or four hours; and that he had never seen Sullivan for several days: after he came before the Justices, he acknowledged, at the Coach and Horses, that he and Sullivan had been together; and that Sullivan was the man that robbed the prosecutor, and he threw him down half a guinea for his share, and he would have none of it: so they drank it in egg hot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was in a disorderly house, yesterday : I was going by at the back of the White-Swan, East Smithfield; he was along with a woman, on a bed: they had a sidler in the house: he called me in to drink: I believe I drank to the amount of two or three pots of half-in-half: there was a man called me out, to go and take a warrant out against a man: the prosecutor took out a guinea to change to buy some tobacco; the woman could not change it: I went out, and brought him the change, all but six-pence: we were all three of us walking arm in arm down Ratcliff-highway; we met Sullivan, who asked me to take share of a pot of beer : I said, I was going home: he insisted on my going to take share of a pint with him: we had it in the street: the prosecutor wanted to go to the same house again: we went up as far as Buckle-Street; he left me in the house, and gave me half a guinea out of his pocket: he came back again, with Sullivan and two disorderly women: he asked me where the money was; and said, let us drink it out: I went home to my wife: I was not at home five minutes before I went out, and went in at the Red-lion for a pint of beer; the woman drawed it me: these men came, and the prosecutor said, this is the man that took the money out of my hand: I said, I never saw you since three o'clock in the afternoon : he charged the gentlemen with me; and said, he was robbed in my house. I don't keep a house.</p>

The prosecutor came into the prisoner's house: he sat down, and asked me if Mr. Bourn was within: I said, no, but I expected him home very soon: we asked him, if he would drink; he did: he said, he was robbed in this house. After coming from the Justice's, we brought him into the room: we asked him, if that was the room he was robbed in: he said, he believed it was. </p>

On the 14th of September, about ten at night, I missed my horse out of the field; my man turned him in at eight: I sent one man one way, and another man another way, and I went myself, but could not find him till Monday the 16th. I ordered my man to go to the field to see after the horse, and I went to the New-road; I found him loose in the road, about a quarter of a mile from my house, with the print of a saddle upon his back, and a breast-collar; he seemed very much fatigued, as if he had been run very hard; he had six or seven wounds, as if he had been stuck. I drove him home, and went into Whitechapel, and examined of all the people that let chaise, whether they had let out a chaise without a horse? Mr. Poulston told me he had heard it whispered among his servants, and that he would enquire of them. Accordingly he brought his servant,

I found the prisoners in a hayloft; I went up with a cooper's adze in my hand, and said, here they be, as if there were many people with me, thougth there was but one; they lay as if they were asleep. I held up the adze, and Robert cried out, for God's sake, forgive me, I never was guilty of the like before: he said he had but one guinea in his pocket, but he would give me that and another, and the horse that was in the stable. I asked him why he went into the hay-loft? he said, he heared I had a warrant against him, and he went there to hide himself: we got them into the Black-Horse, where they confess'd it, and offered to give me any money to make it up; I said, I would not compound felony; they said, they had been at Woolwich: I said, how could you cut the horse so? you have cut him with some instrument; he said he did it with a whip.

            . I am servant to Mr. Lawrence. I turn'd out the grey gelding, whose name was Sharper, into the field on Saturday night, the 14th of September; it is the first field going up the Turnpike-road to Stepney. My master called me up on Sunday morning, to fetch up the horses; I took four of them home, and told my master that Sharper was not there. My master called me up again on Monday morning, to see if he was brought back again; I went all over the field, but could not find him. I saw him when he was in the stable: he had stabs in the flank in five or six places, and under the belly.</p>

I saw the prisoners on the 14th of September, about eight o'clock, and between nine and ten in the evening; then I saw them with a horse, which is Mr. Lawrence's; I had seen the horse go by frequently, so that I knew him: I put him into their father's cart, in my master's yard; they borrowed a hammer of me to drive a nail, but did not say where they were going; the cart came home between 10 o'clock on Sunday night, and 5 on Monday morning, but what hour I cannot tell: the justice asked them whose horse it was? they said they had got a horse from Bow-common, and went to Woolwich, and that he was hurt by the briars and thorns: my master's house is about half a mile from Mr. Lawrence's.</p>
               <p>Danial Reason. I saw the prisoners a little before they were taken up; Mr. Lawrence and I went into Mill-yard: when we went into the stable, there was a horse that shook his head; says I, this horse has got a palsey: Mr. Lawrence said that horse belonged to a man he had a warrant against; there was a cooper's adze in the stable, he took it up, and said. he would look in the haylost; he said, here they are, come down, you villains: I said they are not there; he said they were. I went up, and they were rising out of the hay; the prosecutor went for an officer to take them up; I went home, and saw no more of it: they said they were guilty of a great fault, and that they would never do so any more.</p>
               <p>Q. When they owned they were guilty of a great fault, what had Mr. Lawrence said to them?</p>
               <p>Reason. He charged them with taking his horse out of the field. and using him ill: they said they did not stick the horse, though they did not deny but that they made use of him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160019"/>Q. from Prisoner. Whether you heard any thing offered about making it up?</p>
               <p>Reason. I said, are you willing to make the man satisfaction for the horse, if he will put up with the affront? that I said, because we were afraid of ourselves, and I wanted to decoy them down; I did not hear the prosecutor offer to make it up, he went immediately for an officer.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came into my shop last Wednesday, between three and four in the afternoon; she had a paper in her left hand. and something in it; she said, she wanted to buy some lace; I said, then I hope I shall serve you. I opened a box with, I believe, fifty pieces in it; she looked, and found fault with it. Said she, I have been buying a housewife, do you understand such things? I gave 9 s. for it; she took it out of a paper, and held it to me. I took it out of her hand, and said it is a great price, I should think it not worth quite so much: I began to be jealous of her, and thought she gave it into my hand, on purpose to amuse me: my bonnet was so low over my face, I could only see her hands at my lace. This piece of lace (holding the piece in question in her hand) was in a half-yard length; it was under, I believe, twenty other pieces: now and then she would give this piece a twirl up, and lay it down again. Then she said, what is the price of this? then talk about the housewife; I said, I do not think it is worth so much. O madam, said she, it is all needle-work, and gave it another tura up again. When she had doubled it up to her liking, which took up two or three minutes to do it, she clap'd it into her paper. Well, said I, here take your housewife; to my thinking, it is not worth above half a crown; she took and pop'd it upon the lace. I said, which lace will you please to have? said she, I think I will not buy any today, I see none that pleases my fancy; said I, they are very pretty. How do you sell your butter, said she? but let's see, I have butter enough till Saturday; I'll come another day for some butter; I think I'll come on Saturday, and all the time she kept drawing herself out of the shop. I said, but stay madam, you have not paid me for the lace you have in the paper: what lace, said she, you base woman? I said to my neighbour, pray Mrs. Martin, come to me; she did. I struggled with the prisoner; she clench'd her hand, and strove to get away: in the struggle we broke the glass of the housewife, and I at last wrench'd it out of her hand, and gave it to Mrs. Martin. I soon had a good many of my neighbours about me, and some of them fetched a constable. Then the prisoner call'd me a many bad names, and said I was very wicked. I said, how came my lace in your paper? she said, you wicked woman, I don't know. She at last begged I would not be cruel to her: I said, how do you mean? she said, not to swear false against her: I said, I shall tell the truth; if I am favourable to you, I shall be cruel to my neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Deale. I have seen her in my shop two or three times within these two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell her any thing?</p>
               <p>Deale. I don't remember that I ever did; I never knew her name, or where she lived.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity is there of the lace?</p>
               <p>Deale. Here is three yards and a half of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether you was asleep or awake, when I came into your shop?</p>
               <p>Deale. I was not asleep, but she might very well think I was; I had put my apron over my head:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160020"/> she came in and said, are you asleep? I said, no, I am not.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Deale's shop; she said, where is my mistress? I saw Mrs. Deale shew her several pieces of lace, till I saw the prisoner get up and tastle the butter, and say it was very good; she came towards the door: then I heard Mrs. Deale say you have not paid for the lace you have got: she then called to me, and said, come and help me, here is an old thief: the prisoner's back was towards me; they tussled very much; Mrs. Deal took something from her, and gave it into my hand, and said, there, she has stole this piece of lace from me. The prisoner strove to get it from me, and said, she did not know how it came into the paper. It was this piece of lace.</p>

There was a young man pleaded with her, and said, I had not the looks of such a one as she charged me: I had a 5 s. 3 d. in my pocket, and lost it in the scustle: she struck me on the head; I said she should dearly pay for that blow: I make flowers for ladies hair.</p>

               <p>Martin. There were no such words mentioned as the prisoner says; I was in the shop almost all the time: Mrs. Deale gave her a push, and not a blow; she does not use such language as the prisoner mentions.</p>

My mother keeps a haberdasher's shop, in Stanhope-street, Clare-market : the prisoner had always free entrance in and out of the shop; she has a very honest character; I never knew to the contrary before this; we have had connection till within very lately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Luallen. I have known her about 19 years; when I knew her first, she washed for two gentlemen in the temple: she washed for me three or four years, and several gentlemen that I recommended her to: I never knew her guilty of any thing amiss; she had a good character during the time I knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since she washed for you?</p>
               <p>Luallen. It is about three months ago.</p>

I was coming down the yard on Friday last, about six in the evening, and saw the prisoner come out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160023"/> of a warehouse that I have the care of; he had this bag, and what is in it, on his shoulder: (Producing a bag, with the ink-born and pen cases in it): I stept to him, and said, who do you want? he said, The Cambridge; he stept up to the Cambridge warehouse, put the bag down, and went away, without saying a word more. I looked at the bag, and saw J. GOODMAN wrote in large letters on it; I know it was what I had had in my care for three weeks: the prisoner made his way into the street; I followed him, and asked him how he came by that bag? saying, it contained goods left in my care. He said, if that belonged to me, he had left his bag in my warehouse: I said, if he had, we would have a light, and go and rectify it: we got a light and searched, but could find no bag; then he did not say he had left any. I was fully satisfied he had brought none; I asked him his name, which he said was Davenport, that he was a linen-draper, and lived in Goodman's fields: I sent for a constable, who took him to the Poultry-Compter. On Tuesday, he was before my Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house; there he seemed to equivocate, and said he had brought a parcel, and somebody had taken it away, and trick'd him out of it. The bag was opened before my Lord Mayor; the inkhorns were wrapped up in single dozens; there were twenty-eight dozen of them; I had orders to sell them for 12 s. a dozen.</p>

               <p>I brought a bag to the warehouse at the Bull Inn, in order to go to Cambridge; I went down the yard, and asked for the Cambridge warehouse; they said it was lower down. I went and put it down in the warehouse, and looked about for the book-keeper: when I could not find him, I went and left the bag. After that, I took this bag by mistake: coming up the middle of the yard, I met this man; he said, who do you want? I said, The Cambridge; said he, there is the Cambridge. I went and said, there is a parcel for you, please to take care of it; very well, said he. When I got to the gate, he came running after me, and said, these things don't belong to you. I went back with him to the warehouse; we looked about, and could not find it: whether any body had taken mine away, or put it any where else, I know not. Mine was a bag of linen and chintz; I bought them of a man that came from India.</p>

            . On the 23d of last month, I had been taking a walk; a person told me them two fellows (meaning the two prisoners) had been killing of ducks; Mr. Balch has lost a good many lately, and it is proper he should know of it. I saw them go up against a wall, and put something in a bag: as the prisoner was coming away about the middle of the field, I said, what have you got there? he said, what is that to you. I said, I will look, and open'd the bag; there were five live ducks: Jenkins ran away. I secured Smith, and took the ducks from him, and brought him to the prosecutor. Jenkins was taken the same day, near Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Jenkins was with Smith?</p>
               <p>Mawley. I am; I met them both together.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is the field where the ducks were taken, you. field?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is; it joins my yard where I keep my poultry; the ducks sometimes go into that field.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were any of your ducks in that field at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was then down at Stratford. I don't know the number of ducks I have; I have a great number of them: it is impossible to swear to the ducks.</p>
               <p>Jenkins said nothing in his defence.</p>

            . I live at Newport, in the Isle of Wight. On Tuesday last, in the afternoon, about three or four o'clock, I went in at the <placeName id="t17651016-26-crimeloc148">Three Lemons, in Lemon-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17651016-26-crimeloc148" type="placeName"

I enquired after a person; I was inform'd she was not at home, but gone down to Gravesend; but if I chose a young lady to drink a glass of wine with, there was one in the house, and they introduced the prisoner. I pulled out a green purse, in which were four guineas, one half guinea, one quarter guinea, a moidore, and some silver; I don't know how much. The prisoner snatch'd my purse with the money in it, out of my hand, and ran out of the room: I followed her immediately, but was prevented going out into the street after her: the waiter met me in the passage; he shut the door against me directly, and fell upon me, and beat me. Upon my calling out at the door I was robbed, there was a porter, who went and got a constable; the prisoner was taken, and carried to the watch-house; and in the watch-house the waiter swore with terrible oaths, he never would be easy till he had satisfaction of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160025"/>Q. Have you seen your money since?</p>
               <p>Majour. No, I never have. She was brought back again, but where she had been, I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she gone, before she was taken?</p>
               <p>Majour. She might be gone an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person that took your money?</p>
               <p>Majour. I am sure she is the very person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any money?</p>
               <p>Majour. No, I never gave her a farthing in my life; neither was I near her to kiss her lips, any farther than when she came to take a glass of wine from me. When she was before the justice, she declared she was with me, and drank several glasses of wine, but did not take any money: there was nobody else in the house but a soldier, another man, and the waiter. The soldier came to me at the latter end of the time, and forced me out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking before you came there?</p>
               <p>Majour. I had been drinking two or three pints of wine at the Fox, in Goodman's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at any other house that day?</p>
               <p>Majour. I had been at another house about ten o'clock in the morning, and drank two pints of half-and-half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink alone at the Fox?</p>
               <p>Majour. There were several people drank with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any company go in with you?</p>
               <p>Majour. No, I went in alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure what money you had in your purse?</p>
               <p>Majour. I had six guineas and a moidore in the morning. I had five guineas and a moidore, when I went in at the Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was your money taken from you?</p>
               <p>Majour. That was about half an hour before dark; it was just coming dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you call for at the Three Lemons?</p>
               <p>Majour. I call'd for half a pint of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober when you went in?</p>
               <p>Majour. I was as sober as I am now. I had changed a guinea at the Fox, out of the five; they gave me half a guinea and quarter of a guinea in change.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other person in your company at the Three Lemons, but the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Majour. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come voluntarily to you again?</p>
               <p>Majour. No, she was brought in by the waiter. After I charged the house, on account of the woman, then they produced her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not charge another person besides the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Majour. No, I did not. I had no discourse with any body besides her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the house the whole time, till the prisoner was brought to you again?</p>
               <p>Majour. I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw a purse, nor a farthing of the gentleman's money.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>The witnesses were examined apart.</p>
               <p>Grizzle Hussey. I never saw the prisoner till about ten o'clock last Tuesday evening, at the Three Lemons in Goodman's-fields; I called to see the gentlewoman of the house, that lay-in lately; the prosecutor brought in two women with him; one is named Smith, I made her a gown; they came in about seven o'clock; Mrs. Dutfield was giving suck to her young child; the prosecutor catch'd hold of her arm, and said, You b - h of hell-flames, if you don't deliver me four guineas and a moidore, that was taken from me, I will destroy you, and blow up the house. I sent for a person to come and get the mob away: Mr. Beal came, and the gentleman did not mention a word of the prisoner; he said his pocket had been picked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk, or sober?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160026"/>Hussey. He was very much in liquor. The waiter said the gentleman had been at the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes, the house of one Shelly; not a house of good same.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what sort of a house is this Three Lemons?</p>
               <p>Hussey. It is a tavern. I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a house of good or ill same?</p>
               <p>Hussey. I never heard any ill same of the house: the people are lately come into it.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have any pretensions to any character yourself, you will do well to know what sort of a house you come to speak to: Is that a house of of good same where they will produce women to drink with strangers?</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing there?</p>
               <p>Hussey. I was drinking tea in the parlour forward, with the gentlewoman of the house, and her mother.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you was in the house, was it that the prosecutor came in?</p>
               <p>Hussey. He came in about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the door before you came in?</p>
               <p>Hussey. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which door did you go in at?</p>
               <p>Hussey. I went in at the fore door.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Hussey. I am a mantua-maker, and live at the Crown and Slipper, in Lemon-street.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dutfield. The prosecutor came into my house, about three or four in the afternoon, last Tuesday; he said there first and last, till he took the people up, which was near nine at night: he was out three times; the first time, I believe, he was gone near an hour: he came back alone, and went out again; that I take to be about five or six: then he was gone about an hour. The next time, he was gone about two hours: then he came in, and did not go out any more. Mrs. Hussey and my mother were drinking tea in the fore parlour: he made a great uproar in the house; he took me by the hand, and d - d, and said, the man had robbed him. I said, have you no money in your pocket? consider where you was last. I said to the waiter, open the door, and let the man go; don't make an uproar about eighteen pence: the gentleman said, You b - h of hell-flames, if you don't give me my moidore, four guineas, and green purse, I'll be death of you. I said, I am not used to these flusterations; why do you behave so? I am sensible nobody here could see your money: he walked out of one room into another, and told us the house where he changed a guinea; he was very much in liquor. When he came in the second time, he brought in a young woman with him; I never saw her in my life before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any body else with him?</p>
               <p>Dutfield. I saw nobody else; the house was in great confusion; I believe the prisoner was in a room with him, and drank a glass of wine with him, but she was not long in the room; they were together backwards in the passage, five or ten minutes before she went out. She comes in sometimes, when her mistress sends her for a job in the mantua-making way.</p>

            ; I said she was there, but was then gone to Gravesend said he, is there never a lady to oblige me with her company, to take a glass of wine? this lady being in the house, he said to her, what do you chuse to drink? she said, she chose a pint of port; I carried it in. When the bell rung again, I said, do you call me? he arose up, and was going out of the room; I said, you have not paid your reckoning; you lie, said he: if you don't let me go, I'll call murder and thieves. My mistress desired me to let him go: he said he had lost a green purse, a moidore, four guineas, half a guinea. a quarter guinea, and four shillings in silver; he said he had given me a guinea, and I had not given him his change. I asked the lady if she saw any money pass between him and me? she said no. After that he went out, and was gone some time. My mistress said, never mind it; it is better to lose the reckoning, than have an uproar: he came in at candle-lighting, with two women; my mistress had her little child at her breast, with Mrs. Hussey in the fore room. The gentleman laid his hand on her, and accused her, and struck me: after that I got him out, he struck his hand through a pane of glass in the door. When he was out, I said the woman was one of a very good character, I'll send for her; I went, and she came freely with me.</p>

Whoever took it, went in at the entry door, which commonly stands open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davidson. I am a pawnbroker, and live near Temple-bar: the prisoner brought this silk gown to me on the 23d of September, and asked 16 s. upon it: she said, it was a gentlewoman's, from whom, at various times, she had brought several things: I lent her the money upon it: I seeing it advertised, let the prosecutor know I had it: when the prisoner came again, I stop her, and she was committed: she said, she had it of a woman, but would not mention any name: there were seven shillings found in her pocket.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Hatton-garden; just by Holbourn a woman met me, and said, she would give me a shilling if I would go and pawn the gown: I did; and when I came back again the woman was gone: so I kept the money.</p>

            . On the 21st of February, as I was going up Holbourn, the prisoner met me, and asked me if I wanted a place? I told him I did; he said, a gentleman had a misfortune with his man, he had broke his leg, and if I would go with him, he would take me to the gentleman; that there was nothing to do, but only to look after a couple of hunting horses. He took me to the <placeName id="t17651016-32-crimeloc183">Blue-posts, in Holbourn</placeName>

Presently, in came the kinsman, as he called him, and asked him how he came off the night before, about tossing up? the kinsman said he lost 25 or 26 with the butcher, but did not say of what. The prisoner asked him if he would have a toss again? he said, he had had very bad luck the night before, and he would not: he at last agreed to toss up with him; they tossed for a guinea. They put a halfpenny under a hat, and tossed at what they call the best two in three. The prisoner won the guinea; the kinsman went out, and said he had had very bad luck; he got five or six guineas of him, and the kinsman went out between every time. While he was out, the prisoner wanted me to go his halves; I said, I have no money to sport with: he said, it was only venturing, there was no danger but that I should get money; so I agreed, that if he lost, I was to give him 6 d. and if he won, he was to give me 6 d. The man came in again; they tossed, and the prisoner won, and gave me 6 d: they tossed up two or three times more; the prisoner won every time, but gave me only one 6 d. the prisoner wanted me to go more, and said, if you come to London, you must not mind a trifle; what is six-pence? you may as well get as much more: this was while the other was out. I put my hand in my pocket, but did not know how much silver I had: I pulled my money out, and said. I would not go any more than a shilling; he put his hand upon mine, and said, this is the very thing; he took my money out of my hand, and said, go my halves: I said, I would not go all that, it is all the money I have: he said, you will be sure to get as much more. The man came in again, but I did not consent to it: they tossed up; then the prisoner said, it is all gone, I have lost 10 l. he would not give me my money; the other man took the money up. Then the landlord came in, and said, I understand you are gambling, I would have you get out of my house; the kinsman paid for the wine, and paid something over the reckoning. I was frightened, and did not know what to do; it was all done in an instant; they went away, and I soon lost sight of them when they got into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Davis. He took out of my hand two guineas, one half guinea, and nine shillings in silver.</p>

            . Last sessions but one, Mr. Alderman Harley desired me to go to Hicks's-hall, because this man was indicted there for the same offence. I got a warrant which the alderman granted, back'd by the justices: about a fortnight after, I took the prisoner, and carried him before my Lord Mayor; he owned there he had the money by gaming, and that he had a right to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I said the money was won, and I was in company the time it was won; but I had no part of it, nor no connection with him: I lost my money with the man. It is a malicious prosecution carried on by Mr. Pain; he has taken my liberty away, and would have taken my life away, if he could. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160032"/> was capitally tried on this offence last sessions: though this man tells his tale with such simplicity as he does, he is a monstrous villain to swear I took his money; he wanted to make it up for a guinea. Mr. Fielding's man came to me four or five times before I was taken up, and said this man would make it up for a guinea. I said I had a right to demand of him, and not him of me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is that about a guinea?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He got four guineas of a countryman of my acquaintance, and he made it up with the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether you was not offered twenty five shillings in a cellar in the Strand, by the man that had won your money, and you said, take it back again; if you can give twenty-five shillings, you can give me fifty.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. One of Justice Fielding's men, named Wright, took me to meet a friend of the prisoner's, to make it up; he said, I should have all the money again, and I must come before Justice Fielding, and say I was satisfied, and I would not say so; then he said I might go about my business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This young man, named Wright, belonging to Sir John Fielding's office, came to me, and said, I hear there is a warrant out against you, and rather than you shall come to any trouble, I will make any satisfaction. He went over to the prosecutor, who had given the man that took me up, orders to make it up, if he could have any reasonable satisfaction: the man that won the money, offered him twenty-five shillings, and he said, take it back; if you can give that, you can give fifty.</p>
