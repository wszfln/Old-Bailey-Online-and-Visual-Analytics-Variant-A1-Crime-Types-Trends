I should have no money left, the house would be no use to me—he said, as to money it was no object, he was a merchant in the City, and a ship-owner, and he wanted to get rid of the house as he expected every hour to be called to Liverpool—he said the house was his own freehold <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> property—I believed that the house was his freehold, and paid him thirty sovereigns and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he had had as a deposit—he said money was no object to him, he wanted to go to Liverpool to his ships, and if I wanted money he would lend me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. directly I paid the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on a future day I could have a hundred or two on a per centage, but after had paid him the money I could scarcely get a receipt—instead of handind me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he packed up his papers and went into Mr. Mitchell's—I fol<lb/>llowed</p>

               <p>him, and would not let him go except I had some acknowledgment for my money—at length he went into a stationer's shop in Sloane-street; he there got a receipt—it was drawn up by Mr. Keach, the stationer, and he signed it, and gave it to me—"Received, July 11, 1851, of Mr. Benjamin Evans, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as Per bill delivered.

In July I occupied the house, No. 5, Church-lane, Chelsea—I remember Mr. Evans calling to inquire whether the house was to let—I told him, "Yes"—I showed him first about the shop, and he then wanted to know if the whole house was to let, and if I thought the landlord would let it on lease—I told him the landlord was Mr. Fischell, and if be went to Mr. Mitchell, the furnjlure-broker, he would get information—I told him one Mr. Lyall was the ground-landlord, and Mr.Fischell only held the lease—he asked me how long he had held the lease—I told him, "A little better than twelve months"—he asked me what rent I was paying—I told him, "30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—he asked if I knew what would be required by Mr. Fischell for a lease—I said I knew he had offered it to us for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he said he should go and see Mr. Fischell, and would give me a call when he came back—I saw him again the same day—he said he had seen Mr. Fischell—I said, "How did you get on?"—he said, "I don't know; I think I shall have the house; he seems a straight-forward sort of man"—he said he had deposited 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and was to meet him the next morning to pay the money for the house—I then said to him, "How do you get on with the ground-landlord? I suppose you will see him first about it?"—he said, no, He did not know that that mattered much—I said I did not understand much about taking houses myself, but if I were taking a house I should see the groud-landlord—he made light of it, and went away—in the course of the conversa<lb/>tion on the 8th, I told him the ground-landlord lived at Brighton, and his son lived at Brompton—I saw him next on Friday, the 10th, when he came to the house with Mr. Fischell—Mr. Fischell asked me for the keys of the rooms, and they went into the bouse themselves—on the Monday they were there again, and Mr. Evans felt very angry to think that the house was not empty—he asked for the keys, and I gave him them—he wanted the key of the front-door, and Mr. Fischell said he had lost the key, and could not find it, and he offered to buy a key, or get a new lock put on, and he would pay for it—he then asked Mr. Evans if he would stand to his bargain—Mr. Evans agreed to do so, and they were going out of the house for that purpose—Mr. Evans's wife then told him to stop; she said, "Let us see if we can arrange matters a little better"—then Mr. Evans agreed to take the house, and Mr. Fischell asked me for the keys again, and I gave them to him, and be girt them up to Mr. Evans—I was a tenant of Mr. Evans for a short time—I left the house, in consequence of notice by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Acorn-court, Rolls-buildings, Chancery-lane, and am a carpenter and builder. On 25th Aug., between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, I met a man named Wright in Acorn-court, and accused him of decoying my daughter away—I said hold of him, and threatened to take him before the police—I said I wished to know where my daughter was—we, got to words, and from that to blows; and in the contest I felt some one stab me in the head, just over the ear, with some sharp instrument—I turned round, and saw the prisoner—I then received another puncture in the eye—I cannot say whether the prisoner struck the second blow—I bled a great deal, and went to Mr. Jones, the surgeon—I spoke about two girls, but the other had nothing to do with me.</p>

On 25th Aug., about half-past nine o'clock, I examined the prosecutor, and found a small punctured wound on the left side of the head, above the ear, going to the bone—an artery was divided, and there was a very large quantity of blood—there was also a small wound under the eye, and under that the appearance of a scratch, which was not bleeding—the wounds soon healed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Tritton, of 9, Crescent<lb/>terrace, Millbank. On Wednesday, 27th Aug., about 2 o'clock, I was at Paul's Wharf, which is a steam-packet wharf—I felt something touch my side—I put my hand into my pocket, and somebody's hand touched mine—it was coming out as my hand went in—I saw the person whose hand it me—it was that woman (<hi rend="italic">pointing out Yardley</hi>)—I had in my pocket a purse, containing half a sovereign, and some silver, and also two pocket-handker<lb/>chiefs—after Yardley took her hand out of my pocket she went and spoke to Thompson, and gave her something—Thompson immediately turned round, and was going off the pier—I told Yardley that she had taken my purse from my pocket—she said, "I have not got it"—I said "You have given it to that person who has just left the pier," and I turned round immediately, and called to a man to stop her—she was brought back immediately—I have since seen my purse.</p>

I saw the two prisoners there on Wednesday, about 2 o'clock—I noticed Thompson going away with one of the Company's tickets in her hand, which is contrary to the regulation, sit ought to be delivered up on landing—as she was passing my box I heard the prosecutrix call out—I called out to her, but she took no heed—as she turned sharply round I noticed something that she appeared to throw away similar to paper—I stop<lb/>ped her, and looked over the bridge, and saw as I thought a piece of paper</p>

I was on the road and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoners running; I stopped Deekins—Lyons, the policeman, came up, and took him and 1 pursued Bailey, who continued to run on—when I came up near him, I saw him take some<lb/>thing? from under his smock, put it into his right hand, and throw it over the Marquis of Abercorn's wall—I left an officer to follow Bailey, add I went into the Marquis's grounds, and found three half-crowns, which I gave to the officer—Bailey was soon brought back, and I said I saw him throw them away.</p>

Cubitt and Co.'s foreman, to be left at the Weybridge station till called for, Waterloo station, half-past nine train"—I wrapped it round with string, and sealed the ends of the string with a seal, having on it "W. Cubitt and Co., Gray's-inn-road"—on the advice-note I had written, "Dear sir, herewith you will receive 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gold, and silver 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; total, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Yours truly, W. Harrison"—the parcel remained with me from about 3 o'clock in the afternoon till about 7 in the evening—I then ascertained that one of our carts was going to Hatchford, and I put my pen in a zigzag manner through so much of the direction as directed it to be left at the Weighbridge station—I delivered the parcel to the yard-foreman, Loughborough, and gave him direction about it—these two piece of brown paper(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Ferdinand-place, Camden<lb/>town; I know the prisoner and his wife. On 26th June she was lodging in Caroline-place, Camden-town—about 10 o'clock that night I went to where she lived, and knocked at the door—I found the prisoner there with his wife—they were <hi rend="italic">arguing</hi>, that is, quarrelling—I told them to be quiet—she was sober—we all came down-stairs into the street—the prisoner asked her to have a drop of beer—she said, "No"—he put his hand to her back and pushed her before him, and I made myself agreeable for peace—he asked her again to have some drink—we went; but she would have none of the first; there were two pots—she had a little—he then said, "Are you not my wife?"—"Yes"—"Am I not your husband?"—"Yes"—"Will you not come home with me"—"No"—and she would not let him go home with her; she denied him everything—after we had come along a little way, he bid us good night, and we thought he was gone away—he did not say that he would do anything if she did not come, not in my hearing—my deposition was read over to me, and I made my mark to it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I wanted to go, and she pulled me back, and wished me to stay—he was all the time asking her to come home, and she would not go with him—I really do not know whether he said he would do anything if she did not come—I am so confused I can hardly think of it—I think he said he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for her, or something, if the did not come home with him—after that he bid her good night, and we thought he was clear of us—he came back and called her—she turned back—she thought he was going to strike her, and put up her hands, and he then made a dart at her—he did not say anything at the time, he ran away—I think he said, "There, I have done that for you"—she hallooed out, "Oh, Mrs. Bryan, I am stabbed!"—I did not see what he struck her with—I looked behind and saw streams of blood flowing—I assisted her a little way and then, the prisoner came back and laid hold of her, and assisted me in holding her up till the policeman came—I said to him, "Sullivan, you have killed your wife"—he said, "Oh no, she is not dead yet"—in consequence of what she said when she laid down by the doctor's door, I put my hand under her clothes, and put my fingers on the guts.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband. On the night of 26th June, I was taken to the hospital—I remained there eleven weeks, and am there up to this time—on 26th June, I was living apart from my husband, and had been doing so about five weeks—before 26th June, I lived with him in Ferdinand-place—my husband has repeatedly come to my place for the purpose of getting me to live with him, and I refused—on 26th, he came be<lb/>tween 9 and 10 o'clock at night, came into my room, I was just sitting down—he took hold of me by my left-hand, and said, "Old lady, I have <hi rend="italic">drop<lb/>ped upon</hi> you at last"—I think he was sober—I did not see any sign of drink on him—I answered, "You have left me no home, and I shan't go with you; I will do for myself, and get my own living"—I had work then from a gentleman in the same street—I had just come in from work when this happened—an old lady keeps the room—my bed was in it—the prisoner sat himself on the bedside, and said, "Will you come home with me, or shall I stop with you?"—I then gave him the answer I have stated—he had on a jacket, and I saw him put his finger to the jacket-sleeve to some<lb/>thing which I thought he had in the sleeve—I said to him, "What have you got in your jacket-sleeve?"—he said, "Why, you foolish woman, do you think I have anything in my jacket-sleeve to take away your life, and send my soul to the devil?"—with that Mrs. Bryan knocked at the door—I said, "Come in"—I asked her to sit down—I was very glad to see her in the room—the prisoner then proposed some beer, and said he would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> It—he still had hold of my hand—I said, I should go for the beer—he said we should all go out and have it—we went out, and went to a pub<lb/>lic-house kept by Mr. Gurney—it was a goodish distance from my lodging, I believe in the high road—he called for a pot of beer between the three of us—he paid for it—after it was drunk he asked me to stand a pot of beer—I told him I had no beer-money to spend—we then all went out together, and went to another public-house in Kentish-town—he called for a pot of beer there—I made signs to the landlady not to serve him, and she did not—he was not tipsy at that time, but he was cross-like—I saw him drinking part of the pot of beer with me, that was all—we then went into the Black Horse in Kentish-town, and there he was served with a pot of beer—Mrs. Bryan was still with us—we did not sit down at all in that public-house—we were there about a quarter of an hour—the clock was then on the stroke of 12—we then came out together, and came down the Kentish-town-road as for as a turning towards my lodging—I said to Mrs. Bryan, "Do not go far away, stand where you are; I shall be back in a few minutes"—at the same time I shook hands with the prisoner, and said, "Good night! God bless you; and get to bed as well as you can, and I will meet you to-morrow</p>

               <p>night anywhere you like to make an appointment"—he then went on towards the bridge, but did not go very far—I followed Mrs. Bryan towards Ferdinand-place—the prisoner called after me by my maiden name, "Julia," and I returned—he said nothing more—I saw him bring his hand from behind his buck, or from his pocket—I put my hands before my face—I thought he was going to strike me on the face—I did not feel anything touch me—I did not feel the knife at all, before I felt the blood running down my legs from my stomach—I put my hand under my clothes, and found myself cut—the top of my finger went info the cut, and I found that part of my entrails were coming out, and I was streaming with blood—I did what I could to retain my entrails—I sat down on the kerb, and called Mrs. Bryan to my assistance, and said that I was stabbed—the prisoner went off a little way, but returned again as I was sitting on the kerb—Mrs. Bryan said, "Oh! Mr. Sullivan, you have killed your wife"—he said, "She is not dead yet, what does she want sitting down here?"—he came and laid hold of my arm—I still had my hands on my stomach, endeavouring to retain my bowels—he on one side and Mrs. Bryan on the other, brought me to Dr. Mushat's—I saw a policeman, and said to him, "I throw my life in your hands"—he came along with me, but I was getting very weak, and by the time I got as Mr. Mushat's I had not a bit of sight—when the prisoner was asking me to come home with him, and I refused, he said, "If you don't come home with me on this night it will be either death or glory," and swore—I said "If you do anything to me you will be surely punished for it; you will surely suffer for it, both in this world and in the next too."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of University College Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there about 10 o'clock on the night of 27th June—she was then in the casualty-ward, lying on a stretcher—I examined the lower part of the abdomen—I found, both on the outer and under gar<lb/>ments, a vertical cut about two-thirds of an inch long—they were wet with blood and the contents of the intestines—on removing the clothes I found a coil of intestine about eight inches across, comprehending, perhaps, about a yard of the small intestines, protruding from the lower part of the abdomen in'a red congested state—the most prominent part of this coil presented two wounds in the intestine itself; they were almost opposite to each other, trans<lb/>fixed somewhat obliquely—it is no doubt that the two wounds were made by a single stroke—the contents of the intestine, both fasces and flatus, were acaping at the time; there was also a wound in the mesentery—those wounds were of about the same length as the cut in the clothes—no doubt all was done by one instrument and one stroke—the entrails were cleansed with water about the temperature of blood, and I then attempted to return a part of them prior to sewing up the wound—I found it necessary to make the cioatrix wider in order to do so—I was enabled finally to restore them—the injury she had received was excessively dangerous—she is now perfectly recovered, as far as we could judge.</p>

On the day in question I was in the parlour of this public-house—I got out of the window into the skittle-ground—the first thing that drew my attention was the pot-boy and the prisoner having some words about a pot of beer—I saw the prisoner strike the pot-boy several blows with his open hand—the land<lb/>lord came out and parted them, and sent for a constable—about a minute elapsed—the deceased got up from his seat, and called the prisoner a b—y thief—the prisoner said something; but what, I cannot exactly say—I believe it was a caution for him not to call him that again—the deceased then said, "If you are not a thief, you are a b—y rogue"—upon that the pritoner stripped off his shirt, and said something—I cannot say what it was; it was a challenge to fight—the deceased was the tallest of the two, and a much older man—I suppose he was about thirty years of age; the prisoner calls himself eighteen or nineteen—they fought four or five rounds—they went to it in earnest—I saw two or three falls; they both fell together—there were two blows given in the last round, and the last blow was given with the left-hand under the right ear—I consider it was a fair fight—there was no unfairnes on either side; only the prisoner remarked at the time of the fight, that he would fight any man in Hoxton—when the last blow was given Dutton was in act of falling, but he was caught up by a man, and never spoke afterwards—he was dragged to a seat, and sat down and bathed—somebody exclaimed, "You have killed the man!"—the prisoner, in a low kind of voice, said, "Oh, God! dont say that," and he dipped a pint pot in some water and took it up to the deceased—I consider the man died directly after he received the blow—I did not observe him revive at all afterwards—I and another went for a doctor, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

About half-past 12 o'clock on this night Stride called on me at 11, Finsbury-place—I found he had received jagged wound, of about a quarter of an inch in extent, on the left side of the face, just above the upper lip, close to the side of the nose—I probed it; the probe struck on some hard substance, at some depth, resembling the stem of a tobacco-pipe; I found it necessary to enlarge the wound, to expose the upper jaw, and to break down some portion of the upper jaw, to introduce the for<lb/>ceps, and then, after about three-quarters of an hour, I extracted from the upper jaw the stem of a tobacco-pipe two inches long, firmly impacted in the hollow of the jaw—I dressed the wound; inflammation followed, and he is still under my charge—there was no immediate danger, but it was impossible to say what the remote effect might be; it was a very serious injury, the force must have been very great indeed, it pierced the bone of the jaw; it slanted upwards, and if the jaw-bone had not stopped it, it would have entered the eye.</p>

The boy was brought to me last Saturday week by the police—I examined him—the whole of his back was severely bruised—there was a burn on the top of the back, ten inches long, and at the bottom of the back a burn two inches long; one on the upper portion of the chest, three inches long; one on the right arm, three inches long; another on the left arm, three inches long; one on the light thigh, two inches long; another on the left thigh, two inches long; and one on the left leg, three inches long—the skin was destroyed at the two burns at the back, and the burn on the chest—such an instrument as this poker might have caused the burns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 2, Three Herring-court, Crip<lb/>plegate. On Friday, 22nd Aug., the prisoner came to lodge there, and brought two children, one by her side, and another in her arms, which appeared to be eighteen months old, but was not able to walk or talk—while the prisoner was there she was always drunk, and in a state of stupor—she was in the habit of going out for drink, and bringing it home in a bottle—she had plenty of money—on the Tuesday she was so much intoxicated that</p>

               <p>she fell from her door at the top of the stairs to the bottom—on the Thursday I went up-stairs with two more people, and found the infant in a most awful disgusting filthy state for any one to leave a dog or cat in—there was part of the crust of the bottom-part of a loaf lying by its head—three of the child's fingers were clung together from the filthy state of its nose, and with the other hand it had managed to pick out pieces of bread from the loaf—I took it down-stairs, washed it, and gave it some milk—I sent my lad up to the mother the same night to ask if she would let me give it some gruel, and she positively refused, and I offered to take it down and warm it, but she refused to allow me—on the Friday, in consequence of its having cried so bitterly on the Thursday night, I was determined to go and see it, for I thought it had died and I found it lying on the bed insensible, as though dead, without any covering on it, and the prisoner drunk by its side—I roused the prisoner as well as I could, and said, "If you do not light a fire, and give the child nourishing food, the parish authorities shall be made acquainted with this, for I am certain the child will die"—I gave information to Mr. Lloyd, the parish surgeon—he gave me directions, in consequence of which the child was takes to the police, and ultimately before Sir George Carroll—the child was a com<lb/>plete skeleton with scarcely skin enough to cover its bones—the fire was not lighted more than once during the week the prisoner lodged there—the other child was supplied with food from one of the neighbours—the prisoner told me her name was Johnson, that she was married, and her husband was a commercial traveller in the City—the infant was a girl, and she used to call it Mary Ann.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer; I live at Woollaston, near Newcastle, On 22nd Aug. I was lodging at the Captain of a Man-of-War, in High-street, Poplar—I had in my possession ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes and fifty-three sovereigns—while I was there I saw the prisoner generally every evening in the public coffee-room, where I used to take my meals—he used to come in to smoke a cheroot and read the paper—I got into conversation with him—on 1st Sept. I told him I wanted to find a Mr. Miller, who lived in St. John's-wood—he directed me, and told me he was going to the Yorkshire Stingo, and to meet him there it 2 o'clock—I went, and found Mr. Miller's, but he was not at home—I went to the Yorkshire Stingo, and met the prisoner soon after 2 o'clock—we had something there, and walked arm-in-arm to Oxford-street—when we got there, I said, "Now I know my way home"—the prisoner said, "I don't feel very well after taking that ale at the Yorkshire Stingo; will you go and have something to drink?"—we went to a house, and had something, and came out again—he then said, "You wait here about five minutes; I have a little business to settle over the way; if I am not back in five minutes, you go away"—he left me to go across the road, and he could not have more than crossed the road when a second man came up and accosted me by name—I had seen that second man that morning at the public-house where I was lodging—he was standing at the bar—when he came to me he asked me if I would go and take something to drink—I told him I was waiting for a friend who was gone across the road, and I should not like to lose him—he said, "Come in here, and we can see when he comes across," and he pointed to the same public-house that I had been in with the prisoner—we went in, and went to a front window in the billiard-room, in order that I might see my friend—I stood there from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, and did not</p>

               <p>my purse—the third man then got up to leave the room for some purpose—I supposed he was going to the back-door—as he was leaving, the second man said, "You will not leave us now?"—he said, "No," and he took out those sovereigns that he had in his pocket, and put them into the second man's hat—he came in again in a few minutes, and took the money again—the second man then said to me, "Now we will go and get each a 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-stamp to receive this money"—the third man then went to the window, and lifted up the little red curtain—that window looks into the street—he held the curtain up for a moment, and did not stop to look any time—he then came and sat down, and the second man and I got up to go and get the two stamps—the third man said, "But you will not leave me, you will not run away now?"—I said, "No, certainly not"—the second man said, "Of course, Mr. Gibson, you will leave a deposit with him, the same as he has done with us"—I said, "Certainly," and I put my hand into my pocket, and took out my purse, containing the 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and put it into his hat, as a guarantee for my returning, leaving the hat on the table—I and the second man then left the room, to get the two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-stamps; and as we got to the door, I happened to meet the prisoner—I stopped, and said, "Halloo, Mr. Smith, what are you doing here?"—he laid hold of me by my left arm—I took it to be in a friendly manner—then the second man, who was a little in front, returned, and held me by my right-arm, and the prisoner by my left—I just turned myself, and I saw the person with the money, the third man, coming walking along the passage—I tried to extricate myself from the other two, but I could not—I said, "Let me go—let me go!"—but they still held me, and I could not get away—I was so <hi rend="italic">petrified</hi> and astonished that I had not power to call anybody, or make any alarm—I tried to extricate myself from them—they still held me fast, and by-and-bye they gave me a pull, and pulled me bang off the door-step into the middle of the footpath, and the third man passed me, and crossed the street—I did not see that he had anything with him—he had his hat on, and he ran across the street—I did not know that there was a passage opposite the public-house; I thought he would run up the street—I was then more resolute than I had been, and broke from those men—I ran across the street in a slanting direction, to get before him; but I could not find him—then the thought struck me that I had heard of such passages in London; I came back and found the passage—I went through it, but I could not find him—I came into the other street which, I suppose, is Fenchurch-street—I stood about, wondering which way the man was gone; and the prisoner came to me and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "I have had a heavy loss"—he said, "What?"—I said, "Ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and some sovereigns"—I do not know whether I told him how many sovereigns, but I said I knew the numbers of the notes—he said, "Don't make a noise, come along with me; and he took me to a house and gave me a small glass of brandy—we came out, and he said, "Don't make any noise, but go directly home, and go to bed; and to-morrow morning go to the Bank and tell the numbers"—I took his advice, and went home to my lodging—I went up-stairs and laid down a little while on the bed—I then got up, and went into the street, and told a policeman, and asked him what I had better do; that was about 9 o'clock in the evening—I have not seen the two men since, nor the money, nor any part of it.</p>

               <p>and meat—I moved to No. 7, and he stood by me eating the bread and meat; and afterwards he went over to No. 21, still eating the bread and meat—he did not remain there long, but went and put on his blouse again, and came and stood by No. 21 again, with Bridget Moore; that was between 1 and 2 o'clock—I saw Cole, the prisoner, coming up again—Cogan saw him, and said to Bridget Moore, "I shall be off from here," and he and she ran into No. 18—Cole followed them quickly into No. 18, with Lockyer, the Shoe-lane police<lb/>man—I saw them come out again some time afterwards, and the prisoner had bold of Cogan by the collar, and beat him several blows with his fist about the bead before he came to No. 21, and then he put his band in his pocket and took out his truncheon, and beat him with it round the arm and body—he still held him with his left hand, and went into No. 28; before they got there the prisoner gave him a blow across his neck—I heard him beating him several times in the passage, and be said, "You b—b—r, I will do for you," and he flung him on his face and hands into No. 28—I followed them, and stood within four feet of where the deceased laid; with that, the Shoe-lane policeman came, turned on his bull's-eye, and asked what was the matter—I said, "You know very well what is the matter"—he came alongside of me, by No. 28 door, the prisoner was beating Cogan then in the passage—I saw him hit him under the right ear with his truncheon—Cogan said, "For God's sake do not murder me, and I will go up-stairs and not come down no more" Lockyer was there then, and told me he should serve me the same if I did not go about my business—I had said to Lockyer that it was a scandalous shame to murder the young man—before that Lockyer and Bridget Moore had bad some words up the court, but my attention was taken up with Cogan—Cogan was as sober as I am at the present moment—I have never seen him in liquor since I have known him—Lockyer ordered me away, and that was the last I saw of Cogan—I saw him two or three days after when he was dead—on the following morning I heard several persons telling the prisoner and Lockyer that they had done a nice job for that young man, and I cannot tell whether it was Cole or Lockyer said, "I did not do it"—I saw Mrs. Lyons in the court.</p>

               <p>saw Cogan again, as near as I can say, at twenty or twenty-five minutes to 2; I will not exactly say which, because I may be wrong in the dock—I saw Cole have him by the left-hand, by the collar of the blouse which he had on—I was looking out of my bedroom window—they were then between No. 9 and No. 21. between that and the gully-hole—I was able from my window to tee him quite plainly—I saw Cole strike him about half-a-dozen blows on the right side of his bead; he might have struck more; I speak within compass—he said, "For God's sake! don't murder me: I will not do it again"—Cole said, "You b—, I will murder you;" and he struck him with his left-hand, and took him into No. 8 passage, and I saw no more—he struck the half-dozen blows with his bludgeon; he was dragging him by his collar—Cogan said, "Policeman, don't murder me"—Cole said, "You b—, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you;" and struck him the last blow on the right side of the head—the deceased had a cap on—it was a violent blow, and it was near the ear I should say by what I saw—I could see the door of No. 28 quite dis<lb/>tinctly from my window, but not into the passage—I could see that Cole went into the passage; they were in the passage some minutes—I did not see them come out—while they were in the passage, Lockyer, No. 264, who they call the Shoe-lane policeman, came up—he does duty in Shoe-lane—that court leads into Shoe-lane—he stood on the opposite side, turned his bull's-eye on, and said, "Halloo!"—I could see that he turned his light into the passage of No. 28; he must have seen the persons in the passage—Cole was in the passage at that time with the deceased—Mrs. Lyons was there; she was quarreling with her husband, and he would not let her go in—my husband was there, standing at No. 7 door; from No. 7 he could see No. 28, not into the passage, but he went forward towards it—I saw no more after Cogan was thrown into the passage; I saw him again about a quarter to 6 on Sunday morning; he was dead, and had been deed some time—when I saw him at half-past 11, and at 12, and again at twenty minutes to 2, he was perfectly sober, as I am at this moment—I did not see him do anything to the police—I never saw anything wrong of him—I had known him about a fortnight—he was, I think, about 21 years of age.</p>

               <p>I lived there on 5th July—I have seen the deceased about the court for three weeks, and knew him by sight for about a fortnight or three weeks before 5th July—I saw him on the night of 5th July, as near as I can tell, near 12 o'clock, before I saw the policeman—I nearly passed him as he was standing with his back to the wall, in the court—he appeared sober—I saw nobody else near him at that time—he appeared, to the best of my know<lb/>ledge, to be eating a bit of something; whether it was a bit of bread and meat, or what it was, I do not know—I did not go in because my husband was drunk, and had shut me out—I went into the next house—I did not see Cogan again till about 20 minutes before two—the prisoner Cole was then running after him, and he was running away from the policeman towards his own house, No. 28—I do not know that I had ever seen Cole before that night—I had not seen or spoken to him before that night, because he did not belong to our beat—I did not exactly look at him so as to swear to him, but I took notice of him about half an hour before that, he was going to take me to the station for scolding my husband—he ran after Cogan, who was, about as near as I can say, two or three yards from the side of his own door, and took him by the side of his neck, with his left hand—Cogan took bold of the door by the side, to try to rescue himself from the policeman—he said, "Don't hit me, I live up here"—it was at the door of No. 28, where he did live—the policeman had got hold of him, trying to drag him back<lb/>wards into the street, but he could not—Cole took and pushed him on to the step of the door, and Cogan fell inwards, into the passage—he fell forwards—while he was lying in the passage, the policeman put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and took out his staff, and struck him with it on the right side of the head and the shoulder; but I could not see clearly, because the policeman was betwixt him and me—there were several blows on the head, and one on the right arm, the shoulder at least—while the policeman was striking him in that way, Cogan said, "For God's sake, don't murder me; I won't come down any more to-night"—they were heavy blows, such as I should not like to have—Cogan said, "Do," and the policeman said, "You b—r, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you before I leave you"—as my door opened, I went in; and at the shutting of the door, Mr. Lockyer, the Shoe-lane policeman, came down, and turned his bull's-eye on to the left and to the right, and said, "Halloo! what is here?"—he came to the corner, and I went in-doors, shut my door, and saw no more of it—he turned his bull's-eye towards where the deceased lay and the policeman.</p>

               <p>am quite sure; I do not say I can swear to him—when he threatened to take me, he was so near to me that he put me down in the mud; but I did not look into his face—I told him if he wanted me to go to the station I would go with him—before he dragged me into the mud, he was quite close to me, and I was sober—I told you before I could not positively swear to the man—I said, "To the best of my belief, that is the man"—I was not able to see the face of the person who was beating the deceased—nobody pointed the prisoner out to me—when I came to the Coroner's Inquest, they said, "Is that the man?" and I said, "To my best belief, that is the man."</p>

On Sunday morning, 6th July, about half-past 4, or nearly 5 o'clock, I was sent for by Williams, who has been examined, and went to 28, Plum tree-court, and found the deceased there; he was quite dead—his coat was off, and on a cursory view I saw con<lb/>tusions extending from the muscles of the right shoulder—his shirt was not off, but I put my hand under his shirt—there were contusions also on the right side of the neck—I observed mucus from the nostrils and mouth—that was all the examination I made then—I returned in two hours and made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the external parts of the body—I pulled the shirt down over the shoulder, and noticed discoloration, extending down the arm—a slight one over the lower part of the wrist, and likewise up the right side of the neck, extending behind the right ear as far as the lower edge of the temporal muscle—one blow or one fall could not, in my judgment have occasioned those contusions—blows or falls would have produced them, but they must have been several—I took off the scalp, which was unusually vas<lb/>cular, and I found the dura-mater rather more adherent than is usual at the inner surface: there was as light fissure in the lateral sinus, which is a tube conveying the blood from the brain to the heart; it runs in a groove to the lower part of the occipital bone, on a level with the ear—the fissure was in the lower part behind the ear, and beneath it—I made a particular observa<lb/>tion of the external skin over the fissure, there was no abrasion, but there was a considerable contusion, which might have arisen either from a fall or vio<lb/>lence of any kind; a blow with a truncheon would have done it—I have heard the evidence to-day, and consider the blows the deceased is stated to have received might have caused this—the immediate cause of death was extravasa<lb/>tion of blood pressing on the brain from the rupture of the lateral sinus, and I</p>

               <p>attribute the rupture of the lateral sinus to external violence, such as I saw marks of behind the ear.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might not all that you saw, I do not mean externally, but on removing the scalp and opening the head, have been produced without external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible—I have never met with such cases in my practice—I have had many cases of apoplexy—the lateral sinus is a vessel of a triangular form, formed from a reflexion of the dura-mater—it is not a thin vessel, but has three coats, the same as other blood-vessels—I have frequently met with ruptures of vessels on the brain without any violence—they were vessels composed the same as this vessel—a person under the influence of drink is much more liable to strong excitement than a person that is sober—strong excite<lb/>ment would not produce such a rupture as this, because it is a vessel of lam calibre—I have never known a vessel of large calibre to burst from excitement—I have known the largest vessels in the body to rupture from excitement, but not unless there has been some previous disease of the coats of it, which there never had been to my knowledge in this case—supposing this man to have received blows from some person, and that the fissure was produced by the blows, I should expect the effusion or extravasation of blood to have pro<lb/>duced coma—I should have expected there would be symptoms of coma immediately—I do not think it possible for a person, after having received a blow which would rupture this vessel, to be playing about the court and climb<lb/>ing up the lamp-post—supposing the fissure in the first instance to have been only slight, and the blood to have flowed, it would have produced pal<lb/>pable effects according to the extent of it—if the blood flowed on to the brain I should have expected immediate effects to have exhibited themselves in a greater or less degree—supposing that up to the time of his first climbing up the lamp-post there had been a slight flowing of blood on the brain, I should expect that the mere effect of climbing, or a man's raising himself up on another man's back, would immediately increase the fissure so as to produce the immediate results of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the man to have been <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> and playing about the yard, and getting up lamp-posts, might a fall from the lamp-post have cansed that fissure in the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is possible; it is not probable, unless he had been of a full plethoric habit—it is my impression this was the result of excitement, accelerated by violence—it is possible that if he was in a state of intoxication, and provoking violence by wrestling with other people, that might have produced it—supposing him to have been in a state of excitement from drink and previous quarrelling, the very effort of springing up a lamp<lb/>post might have produced it—supposing the fissure to have been made at 25 minutes to 2 o'clock, and there to have been an immediate flowing of blood, I should not have expected to have found the person alive at 4.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is, if you find an internal injury of this kind, and if you find, precisely corresponding with it, an external appearance of violence, you would consider one the cause and the other the effect, rather than the possi<lb/>bility of apoplexy arising? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; none of the houes through which the sinus passes were in the least degree injured—a blow, or fall, or any violence</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and have been in the profession some years. I assisted Mr. Topping in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I have been in Court, and heard what has been stated by the witnesses in reference to the violence—I heard Mr. Topping examined—my observation also discovered the external appearances he states—there was a contusion of the shoulder muscles—in my judgment, the exter<lb/>nal appearances were produced by blows of some kind; I do not think they could have been produced by one blow or one fall—I have heard the wit<lb/>nesses state that the right-side of the man's head was repeatedly beaten with a policeman's truncheon; supposing that to be true, repeated beatings might have caused the appearances I observed—I agree with Mr. Topping as to the cause of death, the rupture of the sinus caused by violence—I observed a contusion externally, but no abrasion—violence of some sort must have caused the contusion; I cannot say what—I attribute the breaking of the sinus to violence—the contusion might be caused by a fall or a kick—the sinus runs in a groove of the bones—the rupture of the sinus might be caused by a blow without the bones being at all broken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose there had been a blow, such as has been described here to-day: would you not expect to find that there would be some injury to the bone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should; the effect of taking stimulating drinks is to accelerate the heart's action—if a person under the influence of drink was running violently, that might have induced the rapture of that vessel; but I think it is improbable—if the person run<lb/>ning was in fear of another, the fear would also tend to create excitement—those two causes combined might have tended to produce the rupture of that vessel—I have never seen a rupture of the sinus without a fracture of the skull; but excitement might do it without violence—supposing the man to have received a blow at 25 minutes to 2 o'clock, which had produced a rup<lb/>ture of the vessel, an escape of blood from that vessel would be the immediate consequence, which after a time I should expect to produce stupor—I cannot say after how long; that depends upon the size of the opening—I saw the size of this rupture—supposing it to have been caused by these blows, I should not have expected the effect to be immediately apparent—it might be an hour, or two or three hours—supposing the rupture to be one-eighth of an inch, I should consider that the consequence of blood escaping would be almost immediately palpable—if it was not so large, but supposing the exer<lb/>tion of climbing up a lamp-post to have increased it, I should expect the con<lb/>sequences to be immediate, if it enlarged the opening.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity of blood had been extravasated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three ounces; if the opening was very small at first, the blood would ooze out gradually, but it might become larger, and the man might die sud<lb/>denly—the blood oozing out was the cause of death—the time when death would take place would depend on the opening in the vessel—it is impossible that any stimulating drinks could have caused the external violence on the man's head, nor could mental excitement of any sort—I attribute the cause of the rupture to violence, not to mental excitement or stimulating drinks—I have heard the evidence that the deceased was twenty—on e yearsold, and that he was sober on this occasion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What height was he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was of short stature, and a very strong, powerful, muscular young man—his short neck tended to apo<lb/>plexy—that does not often occur in young men of twenty—on e—half an ounce</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Haydon's-buildings, Wands worth. On Sunday night, 7th Sept., I had been drinking at several public-houses—I then went into the Grapes, at Wandsworth—it was then between 10 and 12 o'clock—I saw the two male prisoners there—I tossed with Battcock for some gin and beer, he challenged me to toss or I should not have done so—I changed half-a-sovereign at the bar—I had examined my money before I went into the house—I had half-a-sovereign, a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece, a half-crown, in my right-hand trowaers pocket, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in my jacket-pocket—I cannot say what beer I paid for, but I paid for bread and cheese in the bar; I felt the money in my pocket then, but only took out the half-sovereign—Everett changed it, and I put the change with the other money—when I got a short distance from the house, a woman, I cannot say whether it was Marks, came up to me and asked me if I was going home for the night—I told her no (the two male prisoners were by when she came up) she asked me to go home with her—I said I wanted to go home to my own place, and asked her where I was; she told me in a lane away from Putney—she said, "You promised to give me half-a-crown, and I will have it whether you go home with me or not"—I said I would not, and I did not want to go anywhere with her—she pat her hand in my trowsers pocket where my money was; the male prisoners were close by—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the woman away, and they came up, knocked me down, and the hand of one of the men took the money out of my pocket—Stanes said, "If you insult my sister, I will knock you down"—they kicked me as I laid on the ground, knocked me about, and hurt me; my face was covered all over with blood—they turned me over, and searched all my pockets—they had their hands on my breast, and they both searched me with their other hands—the woman was standing by while the beating was going on—I cannot say whether she took anything out; they took my shoes and cap off, and took a knife from my pocket—Battcock got up, and went away before the others; I then laid hold of Stanes, and turned him under me on the ground—I was over him; the woman <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> hold of me by the face, and pulled me from him—they left me <hi rend="italic">foolish</hi> on the ground, not having sense enough to get up—Stanes and the woman beat me after Battcock had gone away, with their hands, and fists, and shoes—I was in liquor all the time—the police came up, and I described the parties to them—on the Tuesday following I went with the sergeant and saw some men, Battcock was with them—I am sure he is one of them; I pointed him out to the sergeant—he said, "I am not the man, it was the pot-boy who tossed with you"—I saw him by the water-side, where a good many of these girls and men live toge<lb/>ther—constable took Battcock to the Grapes—we saw the pot-boy there—he heard it, and said, "It was not me, for you sat one on one side of the</p>

Candy and Co.—I made the entry in my own writing, and put into the box thirty-four pieces of mousseline-de-laine of various colours, and two pieces of merino—the box was then taken down-stairs, into the lower room, and weighed—I took the weight of the goods from the scale, and put it down in ny book—the box was afterwards taken to the Douane, where the goods were examined by the Customs' officers, and the box was corded and leaded; I made out this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it to the carrier—the mark on the box was "C. C. &amp; C. 704"—I did not see it put into the cart—I left it there—it was in course of transmission for Havre—the pieces of merino were of a very valuable character, of very fine texture, and only made on order—we received the order to make this from Messrs. Caady and Co.—we do make it for other persons.</p>

Sayward said, "We have not got it, we have sold it all, there were two pieces" I said, "Let us have a look; where do you keep the black?" he went to another part of the counter, and produced some black; Mr. Wilson immediately put his hand on one piece and said, "That is ours;" Sayward said, "I did not know we had got it, I thought it was sold, I sold it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard"—I took him into custody on the Friday; on searching him I found several letters, and a written paper.</p>
