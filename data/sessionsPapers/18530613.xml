                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Bliss, the barrister, of No. 11, Bentinck-street, Manchester-square. On the night of 12th May, about 10 o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at the door of No. 12, which is opposite, trying to open the private door with a latch key—after he had tried twice, he turned away as if he was waiting to be let in, but as he did not knock or ring, I watched, him—he went away—he afterwards returned, tried the door a third time, it opened—he went in and shut the door after him—I told the landlord's daughter, and a policeman was called.</p>

No male person lives in the house but myself—I know the room in which the prisoner was found; it is Mrs. Wright's bedroom, the lodger—she has not a latch key—a latch key which was found in that room has been shown to me, it does not belong to the house—the door, when closed, can only be opened with a Bramah key.</p>

On 13th May I was called to No. 12, Bentinck-street—I went to the second floor front, a bedroom, and when I got to the top of the stairs, the prisoner opened the door of that room (he could have heard me coming up stairs)—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he was waiting for a gentleman—I took him to the station, searched him, and found these two keys on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and several lucifer matches—he said he was a painter—neither of these keys will open the street door—I went back to the house about half an hour afterwards with another constable, and saw him find a key behind a box near the door of the room where the prisoner had been—it opens the door of the house.</p>

On Tuesday, 24th March, about half past 2 or 20 minutes to 3 o'clock, I saw my husband's watch hanging in the bar parlour—shortly before I missed it a boy came in—I cannot swear that the prisoner is the lad, but I know him very well by his serving in his father's shop—the lad said he had dropped a penny down the area; I said, "If you come in the morning you shall have it;" he went outside, and presently three boys came in—I am not certain whether the first boy was one of them, or whether the prisoner was one of them—they asked for a pint of beer, I served them—they were outside the bar—they wanted some bread and cheese—I did not like their appearance, and would not give them any; upon which they went out and brought some in, and asked me to let them have a knife, which I did—I kept my eye on them, but my parlour is dark—I cannot swear to either of them, but have every reason to believe the prisoner is one of them—one of them asked me to let him go into the yard; I said he might go; when he got into the passage the dog interfered with him, and fearing the dog might do him an injury I went to him, leaving no one in the place; when I came back the other two boys we're gone; the boy who had gone to the yard went after them, and I then missed my watch—I went to the station directly—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I saw it on the following Thursday at the pawnbroker's—the boy never went into the yard, the dog would not let him; he only went into the passage.</p>

On Tuesday, 24th May, I was at work there between half-past 2 and 8 o'clock, and saw three boys go in to Mr. Heritage's—the prisoner is one of them—I know him by sight well, and have no doubt of him—one came out first, and went down the street, and about two minutes afterwards the other two, of whom the prisoner was one, came out together—the prisoner was the last that came out—I had seen him before in the neighbourhood—Mrs. Heritage did not come out till after they had gone down the street—then she came over and told us—I did say before the Magistrate, "I cannot swear to the prisoner as one of the boys," but 1 have no doubt about it—I believe he is the boy.</p>

On 3rd of June, about 9 o'clock at night, I was at Oxford Arms-passage, Warwick-lane, Newgate-street—the prisoner came up to me, and said, did I want her—I said, "No"—she said, "You are wanted down here"—I said, "Who wants me?"—she said, "You go"—I said, "No," and she seized me with her left arm round my neck, and I felt a scratch at the side of my neck—she then threw a quantity of pepper in my face, out of her hand—I then saw her change a razor from her left into her right hand, she cuddled me in tome way with her arms, and I felt the sharp edge of the razor passed all over my throat—I had a shawl and a handkerchief tight round my neck, which were both cut through, but my throat was not cut—it was just scratched, but did not bleed—I think the mark is gone now, but I was cut across the breast—the skin was cut through—it bled a little, but very trifling—I put my hands up with the intention of seizing her arm, and my fingers went across the edge of the razor, and it cut all my fingers, two of them very severely—the top of one of them was very nearly cut off—the prisoner's hands were seized, and I went to the hospital, and had my fingers dressed—my shawl is not here.</p>

The prisoner was partially in my service three hours a day to take orders and sell goods for me, but he had no authority to receive money for me—I always sent the goods by my boy; the prisoner only went with samples to obtain orders—I collect myself—I know the prisoner's receipt; this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing—he had no authority to sign it, or to receive the money—he received it after he had left my service for the day—he was in my service from 9 to 12 o'clock, after which he was at liberty to work for any other person—he has never accounted to me for this money; it is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Sugden, Bores, and Co. owed me that amount—the prisoner told me on the Saturday after he left me that he got into bad company and spent the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of No. 189, Drury-lane. On 16th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke fey the police I meet down stairs, and found a shutter of the shop down, and a window broken—I missed three pairs of boots from the window, which were there the night before—the house was also safe when I went to bed, and the window was sound—my house is in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields.</p>

I am a lamp lighter, of 19, Kaingsgate-street, Holborn, On the morning of 16th May, about 10 minutes to 4 o'clock, I was in Broad-street, St. Giles's, putting out the lamps, and saw the prisoner crossing Broad-street from Drury-lane—I had seen him before that morning, about twenty yards from Mr. Jackman's—he had nothing with him then—he asked me what time it was—when I saw him a second time he bad some boots under his arm, and was coming in a direction from Mr. Jackman's.</p>

Annuities—I think I received the last dividend on 22nd Oct. 1847; since when having no occasion for the dividends, I have not received them, thinking it was safest to leave them in the funds—the signature, "T. Davidson," to these two dividend warrants, No. 141 and 142 is not my writing, nor is it written by my authority—they purport to be warrants for the half yearly dividends, Oct; 1851, and April, 1852, and are for 291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., each, deducting income tax.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the Dividend Office, Bunk of England. The course pursued with respect to dividends is this; the party applying is asked the name, and then, "What amount of Stock?" if he answers the right amount, the book is turned round for his signature, and he signs it—if a man signs instead of a woman or a woman instead of a man, or a child of ten years old, I should stop it—with those exceptions we take it, that the person applying is the right person, except in cases where the dividend is above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when if the clerk does not know the party it is his duty to refer to the former signature, and if it corresponds, the dividend is paid to the party applying—and further than that, we have to put our initials</p>

               <p>against the signature in the former dividend book to show that we have referred to it—unpaid warrants in arrear are checked every three months from the dividend book—if the dividend book in any instance purports not to be signed by the party who signs the warrant, we take it out upon what is called the query sheet—the dividend book is signed at the same moment that the warrant is delivered—on 31st July, in consequence of a communication made to me, a comparison was made between the dividend warrants remaining in the drawer of the reduced stock, and the dividend books, upon which it turned out that the dividend book in respect of two warrants for Mr. Davidson's dividends, Nos. 141 and 142 had not been signed—I went to the check officer, and examined the warrants which were attested by Joseph Farrall—in Nov. last I again examined the dividend book as to the 141st and 142nd warrant of Dr. Davidson, it was still unsigned, and I reported it to my superior officer, Mr. Palmer—the 143 dividend book was made up about 4th Oct. last; I did not make it up—I made a memorandum in the book respecting the two preceding dividends to call the attention of the clerk who paid them to it.</p>

I know Powell, he ordered a horse and a dog cart there; I cannot say the date—Philcox brought it back the same evening, with the tire of one of the wheels broken—I did not see Powell afterwards that evening, nor Farrall; bat next evening I received orders from Farrall to have a horse and gig at Mr. Baxter's house at six o'clock in the morning; in consequence of which I took the horse and gig there at 20 minutes before 7 o'clock, and Farrall came out, got into the gig, with a portmanteau and carpet bag, and a hat; he wore a cap with a little black peak, and drove away—the horse and gig were brought back by a stranger, about two days afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Bath-place, Kensington, in the parish of St. Mary Abbots. Ellen Horrigan was in my service; she came about the middle of Oct.—her wages were 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—when she came she had a very scanty supply of clothing and necessaries—shortly after she came some clothing was bought for her—she sent it home, not having paid for it—it was paid for with my money; I advanced the money to pay for it—it was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few pence, and it was afterwords deducted from her wages—I was asked to advance her some money to send to Ireland—I advanced 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a half sovereign, a few weeks after she came, and that was also deducted—in July last, previously to her entering my service, I had sold out some stock, which realized 274<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received two notes of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, seven 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in gold and silver—I wrapped them up, and put them amongst some clothing in my drawer, which was unlocked—I put them there on the day I brought them home, having ascertained that I brought it home correctly, on 14th July last—it was in an unlocked drawer in my bedroom it continued there a considerable time without my touching it, but I took from it two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes and the silver, and put the rest away—I find that I have lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; one note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I went away for a short time; for about ten days—that was previous to Ellen leaving me—that must have been in March—I took the parcel, supposed to contain my money, with me, but without examining it before I took it, or when I brought it back—when I came back I put it in a closet—I again looked at it on the evening of 21st April, to the best of my recollection, and missed one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note was left there still—from the time I had put the money away in July I had opened it and looked at it once—I cannot say whether it was in July, but I remember I looked at it while it was warm weather—I might have looked at it again, but I did not scrutinize it; I merely looked, as a person might look at any parcel—I know the other prisoner, Julia Horrigan; she is Ellen's sister—she lived at No. 27, Lower Pbillimore-place, which is nearly opposite my house—she was a general servant there—she did the general duties of the house—I saw her very often at my</p>

I was in the employ of the prisoner Perkins—he pur-chased waste paper of the prisoner Hogan—some of this sort, and some a great deal worse, which I have some samples of, which you will be so good as to look at—Mr. Perkins used to buy it by weight at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt—all that we had of this description came from Mr. Hogan—Mr. Perkins bought them in bogs mixed with other things—he gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt for all of it, rubbish and all—all the prints came from Mr. Hogan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of Mr. John Cassell's printing business—I have examined a great quantity of this paper, it is Mr. Cassell's—I describe it as printed paper, prints and publications—it is by no means waste paper—a small portion of it may be—on some of these sheets is a print that has never been published—here is on this sheet a print that is not published up to the present time—it is part of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Magazine of Art</hi>—here are a large number of this print—it is the "Virgin and Child"—the whole of these (<hi rend="italic">looking at a number</hi>) are duplicates of that—they are all the same print—these other are printed parts of books—Hogan has been in the habit for some time past of dealing with us for waste paper—he has been in the habit for some time past of clearing the office of refuse, purchasing it—he was in the habit of giving half a crown a cwt. for what he bought—the value of the sheets produced here by weight before any printing was put on them is nearly 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a cwt., but the paper the prints are on, would be more, because it is heavier—these are never sold in sheets, they are divided into four parts the size of a page of a book—we keep them in this form for sale in different publications—they are all made into books before Mr. Cassell sells them—they are cut up, and one accompanies each No. of the book—this print of the "Virgin and Child" has never appeared in any publication—in the most careful printing some sheets would be damaged—the majority of these are good sheets, fit for selection—it is possible that a single sheet or two may be damaged; but, speaking generally, I do not consider these waste sheets by any means—none of them have been sold in the state they appear in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of paper is it that you sell to Hogan for half a crown a cwt; could these have been taken for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; by no means—what be has is dirty and utterly destroyed, except to be re-produced at the mill—it is the sweeping of the office, and paper run through printing machines so frequently as utterly to deface it—if we have any clean waste it is not sold, but used up on the premises—one way in which we get rid of a great quantity is to print large posting bills on it, by which way we get rid of a large quantity—this is one of the bills (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—in this way we can use clean waste—this is a printed sheet, but quite good enough to print posting bills on—it is quite the same value to us for that purpose as white paper—the paper we sold to Hogan is swept up into a closet or cupboard—there is a place appropriated for that kind of' waste—this paper could not have got into that place by any means to the extent I see before me—a single sheet might.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>and I might say he is now, for if we wanted a night hand, or an extra hand, we should employ him—the office would be swept at night, the printing office frequently wants sweeping—Hogan would come ordinarily before the work began for the waste paper</p>

On Monday, 6th June, the prisoner came to the office, between half-past 1 and 2 o'clock—he brought with him two receipts for an explanation of the charges—he produced this receipt to me—at the time he produced it, it was in the state it now is—I saw it was given for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in appearance—he said, "I have called for an explanation of the difference between this receipt and the amount of gas I have consumed—I referred to our books, and found it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him there must be some error in the case, and if he would leave it with me I would get it explained—he gave this receipt into my hands to keep in my possession—I said it was very much out of the usual course for persons to give their receipts up, but I locked it up, and thought nothing of it till the next morning, when Mr. Kitchen came—I called him in and spoke to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver; I live at 3, Hodson's-court, Mile-end New-town. I know the prisoner by sight—on the evening of Friday, 27th May, about 12 o'clock, I was at the Jacob's Well public house, playing at cribbage—the prisoner came into the tap, and turned up the cribbage board—I said, "What did you do that for?"—he said, "Because I like"—I had not spoken to him before—he said he would fight me, and said, "I will give you a <hi rend="italic">spank</hi> across the nose"—I said I did not want to fight, and then he gave me a backhanded blow like this (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—that did not put my mettle up—we did fight, and were parted, and then I went and sat down—he was taken away by some one that he knew—while sitting down he came and said he would fight me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he took up the cribbage board, and made a hit at my head—he missed my head, but broke the pipe in my mouth—then we went out into the street and had another round—I saw a policeman, and went towards my house—somebody hallooed out, "He is behind you"—I turned round, and saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> up to me—I went into the road to defend myself, and we had another round—we both fell, and while we were down he tried to bite me in the private part of my person, and as I was getting up he pinched me also in the same place—he caught hold of my trowsers with his mouth near that part—when we got up he came up <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>, and stopped to tie a handkerchief round his head, which he took out of his pocket, and I saw him pull out a knife, shut up, from his right band trousers pocket—he began <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> up again, ran at me all of a sudden, and stabbed me under the left eye—he then cuddled me round the neck, and stabbed me on the top of my head—he then threw me down, and as I was trying to get up he stabbed me again near the left ear—I said I was stabbed, and he ran away—I called out" Police!"—a policeman came, and I gave him in charge—I found him at the door of the Jacob's Well—in going to the station house he said he would give me one that I should remember when he came out—I went into the London Hospital the same night, the wound was dressed, and I remained there till Monday morning—the surgeon attended to me—I have been weak ever since, and not able to follow a day's work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, of High-street, Mile-end. I was at the Jacob's Well that night—there was a quarrel—I saw them go out of the house—after the third round, I heard one of them say he was stabbed, and I went up, and lifted one of them off the ground—the prisoner was in the act of closing a knife—he put it in his right-hand pocket—it was a similar kind of knife to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prosecutor bled very much; the blood was running all down his clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. John Grant, of No. 70, London wall, pawnbroker; I sleep in the shop. On Monday, 16th May, I was awoke by a noise—I heard the side door which leads into the passage open; it makes a noise when opening—I noticed a glare of light from a lantern or candle—I immediately jumped out of bed, went, into the back shop, looked through the window, and saw the prisoner, Jackson making his way on the top of the water closet—I heard a noise of more than one person calling out "Jackson," from the house top—I went to the door of the next house, and met three men coming out of Carpenter's Hall gates—there was a policeman within twenty yards, and I called his attention to them—they went to the policeman and passed him, one on one side, and the other on the other—on looking over the premises I found two hats and some tools, one of the hats has been tried on Jackson, and it fits him (<hi rend="italic">the hat was here produced, and tried on Jackson</hi>)—I found the shutters on the first floor had been opened with a centre bit—they are bound with iron, and have bars at well—the wood work was riddled—the lead work of the plate room had been pulled up, that is where we keep valuable plate—there was a great quantity there—I found a chisel left by the burglars—it fitted the mark under the lead—I have tried it—they got in at the second floor window—they must have got on one another's backs—the window shutters of the first floor were very much strained—a centre bit would have done what I observed—I saw Jackson again at the station house on the Monday following—this occurred on the 16th, Whit Monday—I have no doubt that that is the man.</p>

On Sunday, 29th May, I went to see the deceased—the prisoner was sitting by the side of the bed, and I asked him how it happened—he said it was from the effects of drink; that she called upon him on the Saturday, and he asked her to have something to drink; that he was in company with some other persons, and she would not have it, and he came home and laid down to sleep, and when he got up he found her lying before the fire, and she was so afraid of him that she ran down stairs, and broke her ribs—I stopped with her till 10 minutes past 11 o'clock by the clock in the house—about 6 o'clock she requested to see a clergyman, and the prisoner said, "If you have anything to say, say it before Mrs. Wynne"—she called him to her bedside, and said, "Francis, I am worse"—he held his head over, and I beard her say something; I could not hear what; but he said, "If you have got anything to say, here is Mrs. Wynne, your old acquaintance, speak out"—she said, "What do you want me to say?" in a very short tone—she then said, "I forgive you, and the Lord forgive you; take care of my children, and do not beat <hi rend="italic">Frankey.</hi> "</p>

I got out of bed, ran into the boy's room, and saw the prisoner on the bed, with the little boy underneath the clothes; she had a large carving knife in her hand, and struck at the boy's neck with it, and he caught it with his hands—I immediately took the knife from her hand, and threw it out of the room; there was blood on it—the moment the prisoner found that somebody had interfered, she fell on the bed apparently insensible—the boy ran out of the room; I noticed that he was bleeding, he is between twelve, and thirteen years old—the prisoner said nothing whatever—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

The prisoner is my husband—we have been married twenty-six years, but we have not been living comfortably together for the last six years, as he has not been employed in mind or business, and has been intemperate in his habits—he has used threats to me several times—about Christmas last he asked me for some money, and words arose from that at the time, and he had a pistol in his breast from 7 o'clock all the evening; I went down stairs, and was afraid to go down again, and I stopped till one of the women fetched my son home, and then I opened the prisoner's coat and showed my son the pistol, and told him that his father had got it there to blow out my brains—the prisoner told me that if I did not get out of the way, or something of that kind, be would blow my brains out; but it is some time ago, and I do not wish to say</p>

I fully expected the parcel would have been in the place; if it is not there to-night by 8, you will lose all chance, for, as I told you in my last note, the goods will be removed to-night at 12, after which all trace will be lost; so you can please yourself.

                  </hi>. I am a money scrivener; I belong to the Eastern Metropolitan Loan Society, held at the Red Lion public house, Whitechapel. A few months ago I had an application paper left, it is here—it was left about the latter end of Feb.—in consequence of that I went to the prisoner Lay ton, at No. 5. Nelson-street, Stepney—I saw her, and told her I called respecting an application her husband had made for a sum of four guineas—I did not say where it was made—I asked her which her apartment was, and she showed me into the front parlour—I asked her if she rented that apartment—she said she rented the house—I then asked her to produce her rent book—I asked her where her husband was employed, and other questions—she produced her rent book—she said her husband worked at the Commercial Gas Company—Layton is employed at Carpenter's as a carman or driver at the coal wharf—I do not recollect the whole that was said—she said nothing about letting any part of the house—she asked for the money—I lent it her, and then went out for the securities—I looked at the rent book, and told her to send her husband to the office—she went with me to the security, at No. 2 in the same street—I made no reference to Payne—I told her I was going to Mills as a security, and she went with me there—I saw the prisoner Mills, and Layton said, "This gentleman has come about the loan"—Mrs. Mills asked me into the parlour—I told her I called respecting a loan of money that Mr. Layton had</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, carrying on business at No. 27, Claries-street, Piccadilly. On 21st May I saw the prisoner at my shop, between 1 and 2 o'clock—he was in front of the bar, or in the parlour, some time before he came to ask me for anything—he was walking from the parlour to the bar—he asked me for a pint of brandy—I asked him which he would have, pale or brown—he told me pale—he said he bought brandy of the former landlord, and paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pint—he had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cold gin and water—I believe he was drinking gin and water when I served him with the brandy—he took a bottle from his pocket, and I put the brandy into it—he asked me if I could change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I told him I did not know whether I could or not, but I would ask my wife—my wife went up stairs to see after the change—she was in the bar at the time—when she came down I gave him the change—he gave me the note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent my boy to a grocer's, fifty yards away, to get the note changed again—Mr. Barlow sent it back, and said he did not like the appearance of it—I took it to a banker—from the description I have heard of the forged notes, I can state that it is a forged one—the prisoner left with the brandy directly after he had paid for it—he said he was either lodging with Mr. James, or Mr. James with him—in consequence of that I went to the neighbourhood of Paddington to see Mr. James—it was some time between 5 and 6 o'clock; I could not say to half an hour what time it was—I saw Mr. James, who went and fetched the prisoner—when the prisoner came in I said, "Well, Mr. Guyenette, I have come concerning this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note you passed, which is bad"—he said, "So help me God! I never passed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with you"—he said he had not had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his possession for six weeks—I said I was now convinced he was the person that passed the note, but I did not mean to say with a guilty knowledge—he persisted that he had not had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his possession for six weeks—in consequence of some inquiry I gave him into custody on the following day—I am quite positive this is the person that patted the note—there were other</p>

My attention was called to the prisoner by receiving a letter from Dr. Nesbitt—he has only been under my care two or three days; I had a long examination of him yesterday with Dr. Nesbitt—I cannot say that he does not know right from wrong, but as regards what he did previously, he said he was quite sure I should have done the same thing under the same circumstances; but when I asked him if he knew he had no right to steal the horse he said, "Why do you ask me such a foolish question?"—although he reasons acutely on some points, I consider he ought not to be called upon to plead.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Woodford. On 16th May, I was standing at the Bald-faced Stag, seeing a greasy pole climbed up for a leg of mutton—I had never seen such a thing before—it was the fair day, Whit Monday—I had a purse in my pocket, containing 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I felt something touch me—I turned round instantly, and the prisoner was drawing my purse out of my pocket—he ran away; he looked round about three times—I ran after him, and told the police—I missed sight of the prisoner for about a minute—during that time he could have thrown the purse away, or passed it to some one—I then saw him again—I put the prisoner into custody myself—I said, "That is the man that stole my purse"—at the time I saw him draw the purse from my pocket there was a man standing near me—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woodford, and am a groom. I was at the fair on 16th May, near the Bald-faced Stag—I saw the prisoner there against the greasy pole—I saw the prosecutrix; he was about four yards from her—I saw him put his hand in her pocket, and then run away—I followed him, but was pulled back—I saw the prosecutrix run and cry "Police, police," and she was pointing to find the policeman—I ran, but Iwas</p>

On Saturday, 30th April, Aldridge came to my shop; she asked for half an ounce of tobacco—I served her, and while I was serving her, I saw Robinson outside the window smoking his pipe—the tobacco came to 1 1/2 d.—Aldridge gave me a sixpence to pay for it—I should have given her change, but I had not change sufficient—I called my daughter to go and get change—I took</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Morriss Myers, a builder, of Charlton, in Kent. In April last he was building some houses in Sand-street, Woolwich—the prisoner was one of the workmen employed there; he had to use cement belonging to Mr. Myers—on the Saturday after 23rd April he left his work, and went to work at some houses close by Mr. Wales', leaving his contract with Mr. Myers unfinished—I believe he is rather more indebted to Mr. Myers than Mr. Myers to him—I am quite certain Mr. Myers owes him nothing.</p>

I worked with the prisoner at Mr. Myers's buildings in Sand-street—the usual time for his coming to work was 6 o'clock in the morning—on a Thursday in last Feb., I think it was, I got up at half past 5 o'clock and knocked at his door; his wife told me he had gone; it was dark—I went to the houses, and saw the prisoner moving some cement out of one of Mr. Myers's casks, and putting it into a bag—I was about 100 yards from him, but I could see that distance—I did not say anything, but he said, "If anybody should ask you any questions, say you do not know;" but I was not aware that he was stealing the cement—I should think he took about half a bushel away it a time in a</p>
