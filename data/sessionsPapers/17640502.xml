The brother said, To be sure he carried the napkins there with intent to have them washed, and to bring them back again. I do not remember any thing was said by him about the bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, The prisoner had lived with him about ten years and a half: that he paid a great regard to him, and he never had any reason to suspect him before: That he takes the wine left by customers as his property, as they leave it for the advantage of the house; but that it is a common thing for the waiters (of which he has generally five or six) if they go into the room before the master, to take what is left in the bottles, and apply them to their own use: That he never countenanced their taking such wine out of the house to alehouses, but should not deny their drinking it at his own house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Andrews. When they were searching the waiters boxes, I observed the prisoner very busy in taking something from his box, and concealing it under his bed-cloths; I went and turned the cloaths down, and found there three glass cloths and ten napkins. My method is to deliver the waiters a certain number of glass cloths in a week, and when they give me back a dirty one, I deliver them a clean one. I employ a washer-woman to wash my linen, and do not expect the waiters to deliver the cloths clean to me.</p>

These were found when we searched the woman at the bar's lodging. The man said he carried them to his sister's in order to have them washed; and the sister said, he brought them in his pocket, at different times, for her to wash them.</p>

               <p>It is usual for all waiters in town to carry napkins in their pockets; as to the wine that gentlemen leave in bottles, that lies among the waiters; sometimes on an evening we save three or four bottles; and I have often carried a bit of fowl that has been left to my sister, and a napkin to be washed; the wine that is left we carry it into the garret, and save it among ourselves; I know nothing of the Rum and Arrack.</p>

On the 25th of February, in the morning, the clerk came to me, and told me our synagogue had been robbed, on the 24th at night. I went to Goldsmith's-Hall, and had these goods advertised, ten guineas reward. The Friday following, being the 2d of March, Mr. Smithson came to my house with the prisoner, and brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176405020006"/> the goods; and told me, that the prisoner was the person that took them out of the synagogue. The prisoner then owned he was locked into the synagogue, and when we were all gone out, he took the things away. (The goods produced in court.) These are the property of Mrs. Hannah Solomons: the clerk brings them on the Friday afternoon, to be used on the Saturday morning, our sabbath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smithson. The prisoner is a Jew; he used to look after my horse: I went to give the horse some corn in the stable; I had sent the prisoner out: I seeing a bag, took it out; there were these things here produced in it; I went and carried the bag, with the things in it, to Mr. Ritherdson's, and ran back to the stable, and met the prisoner. I took him back to the stable, and locked the door, and went home. I had not been at home above ten minutes, before the prisoner came to my house; I said to him, Stay here till I go to Mr. Ritherdon. When I came there, Mr. Ritherdon shot them out, and said, These are the things which the synagogue was robbed of: I said it must be the prisoner that took them; I said he was then at my house: I went to him, and said, Emanuel, what the d - I have you been doing of? he fell a crying. I took him to Mr. Ritherdon, who asked him how he came by them? he said, he got into the synagogue one night; that the door went with a spring lock, so that they within could get out; and they without, could not get in; he let himself out with the things, and nobody was concerned with him, and that nobody persuaded him to do it. I went with the prisoner to Mr. Gompertz's: there he told Mr. Gompertz how he got in and out, all the same as he had told me; and after that, he told it before us and Mr. Gompertz's two sons, that he did it himself, and no other was concerned with him. Though I was in the country all that night, yet I was accused by the Jews as being a party concerned with him: the boy said before my Lord Mayor, that I carried part of the things to the stable; and he produced two men, one said he had seen me five or six times in the synagogue (and I never was there in my life): the prisoner confessed he had sold part of the gold fringe to Mr. Plunk, in Long-acre; and after that, he said I was along with him in Long-acre, and received part of the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ritherdon. On Friday the 2d of March, between one and two in the day, Mr. Smithson came running into my shop, with a bag in his hand; I having a customer in the shop, could not speak to him, but sent for him presently after; he said to me, Have you locked at these things? I looked at them, and immediately said, these are the things that were taken out of the Jew's synagogue: he said, then the Jew boy that looks after my horse has done it, and he is at my house now; I said, go and fetch him; he did: I told the boy he had done something that I believed would hang him: he said, no; he had broke no lock. I said, was any body concerned with you? he said, no, nobody. I asked him, what could induce him to do it? he said, he could not tell. Mr. Smithson asked him the same questions, and he answered him the same. He said it was the first fact he ever did, and desired I would speak to Mr. Gompertz for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the Jews charge Mr. Smithson with it?</p>
               <p>Ritherdon. After the prisoner had been with young Mr. Gompertz, Mr. Solomons was very earnest to have the boy go with him; I said to Smithson, you must not let him go out of your sight. Mr. Smithson said to him, What do you want with the boy? his answer was, I'll plump you, and away they went together. Presently after they came back; he came to me in the shop, and said, Mr. Ritherdon, I want to speak with you; the boy says Mr. Smithson is concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Smithson a Jew?</p>
               <p>Ritherdon. No, he is not; that Solomons is a Jew; he is son to the clerk of the synagogue.</p>

            . As soon as these things were brought to Mr. Gompertz's, he sent to let me know they were found, and the person that took them. Mr. Gompertz said he was going to carry the prisoner to his father, to know what to do with him; he delivered him to me, and I brought him to the Compter. I said to him, how came you to be guilty of this rash action? he said Mr. Smithson had learned him to do it, and delivered a bit of the ornament to the cloke from his pocket, as we were going along. I said, if any body is concerned with you, you ought to tell it; the boy said the same before my Lord Mayor.</p>

I took him before my Lord Mayor; there he owned he had taken oil at several times: we have had a general complaint, and I allowed him a shilling a week extraordinary, that he should take care to do the work well.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he had taken the oil from?</p>
               <p>Sabe. He was served with oil every day at my cellar, and the oil must have been taken from my pots. My Lord asked him how he came by the oil; he said, he had saved a little at sundry times, out of the quantity that I allowed him to light the lamps. I had told him several times, if he had more oil than was wanted, to bring it to my house: he never brought any; only the empty pots next morning.</p>

            . I am church-warden of our parish; and on the 20th of March, I was sent for to our workhouse; as I was coming back, it was dark, between 11 and 12 at night, I met the prisoner, and kicked against his pot; he gave me an oath: I said, Who is that, Joe? he said, yes. I said, what have you got there? he was carrying his pot home, and pretended to reel, as if he had a design to spill the oil. I insisted on his carrying the pot to my house; he did, and there was three quarts and half a pint of oil in it, which I perceive to be one day's theft; thus I have been injured in my property and reputation; he had lighted the lamps in St. George's parish, Ratcliff-highway, and he was coming by my door, to carry this home. I have had a general complaint in his walk, and had been out several times to watch him, but found it impossible to go, but he by some means or other knew I was there. He acknowledged before my Lord Mayor, that this was oil that he had saved out of what was delivered to him: he was to have brought the oil home, if there had been any left, after serving the lamps.</p>

            . On the last Saturday in Dec. Mr. Sampson and I had taken an account of stock: we left 2 pieces of holland on the counter, in one of our warehouses, intending it for a particular use. On the Monday morning I went into the inward warehouse, and one piece of holland was gone. Three or four days after, one of my servants came to me, and said, he had lost a dozen pair of stockings; we were all greatly alarmed. The next Monday following, I bought 14 yards of crimson silk and worsted damask, and that was presently missing: we searched the maid, nurse, and footman, but could not find the thief: I discharged an innocent person, who had lost his own stockings. Some time last month, we had word there was some cloth at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176405020008"/> Mrs. Pen's; and the prisoner hearing of this, he absconded: this was on a Thursday, and on the Saturday following, his friends brought him to me, and said, they were very sorry he should be guilty of such a crime: he in my counting-house owned, before me and my partner, that he had been guilty of stealing only part of this cloth; after that, he confessed he had taken the whole piece of cloth; and when in the Compter, he confessed he took the stockings that were missing, and the piece of damask, and sundry other things not laid in the indictment. He was brought before my Lord Mayor, and there owned to the same. I intended to lay the indictment favourable; that if he was cast for transportation, his friends, as he is young, might have an opportunity; by giving security, of sending him abroad for seven years. I did understand he intended to plead guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to have an opportunity to take the goods?</p>
               <p>Webb. His master, Mr. Sing, works for us, in making up furniture. He owned, when he came, and was in the back-warehouse, he saw the holland lying convenient, and he wrapped it in the wrapper which he had brought things in, and took it away; he said, he gave part of the holland to his sister, that lived with Mrs. Pen, and part of it he sold to a workwoman at Mrs. Sing's, and the other part, which we have here, was found in the room where he lay, at Mr. Sing's house, concealed behind a board. There was one

               <p>Mr. Axby. I saw part of the holland and the worsted damask, and some other things in the garret, where he and his fellow-apprentice lay: the plaister was pulled away, and the things put in, and a board nailed tight over the place.

            . The prisoner was my apprentice; Mr. Axley brought me word where the goods were concealed; I went up with him, and found them as he had mentioned: but how they came there, I cannot tell. He served me a year and a half, and I never knew any dishonesty of him before; I have so good an opinion of him, from his natural inclinations, I would take him again, if he was discharged: he is 15 years of age, or thereabouts; I think he was seduced to do it. I believe a very bad woman seduced him: she was intimate with Brown, my other apprentice.</p>

               <p>I lay in the bed where Brown did; I dropt my knee-buckle by the bedside, and in looking for it, moving the bed, I saw these things; a piece of holland stuck out, and I pulled it out. Brown came up, and said it was his; he got it of a young man that came from sea, and if I would not say any thing of it, he would give me some to make a shirt. I delivered it to my sister, and bid her keep the remainder for herself.</p>

I stood at master's room door; he came down, and said, Daniel, will you please to have a half-penny: to buy some nuts; he gave me a half-penny: at night, I told my master's daughter of it, and she told my master; then master asked me about it, and I told him: and on Wednesday at night, my master sent me up to see if the prisoner's partner was in bed; coming down again, I saw the prisoner standing behind the door, with his knapsack on the bed, with a piece of linen sticking about three inches out of it; I went about half way down stairs, and he called me up again to bring the light: when I came he said, I have got it now; so I went down.

            . I keep the George at Holborn-bars; it is a night-house: we sit up all night for the reception of watchmen and coachmen, and others that come to lodge in the house: about 3 in the morning, the prisoner came down stairs, with his neckcloth tied about his jaw, and complained of the tooth-ach; he asked for a glass of gin, and drank it, and walked backwards and forwards, holding his hand to his jaw, as if he was in pain; he made towards the door; but I perceived by his pushing so hastily to it, he was for making off: I stepped to him, and laid hold of him, and said, My friend, stay till I see all is well up stairs. The maid went up; he made an attempt a second time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176405020011"/> to get away: when the prosecutor missed the things, I searched the prisoner, and the things were found in his shirt. The prosecutor described the purse before he saw it; then the prisoner fell on his knees, and asked pardon.</p>

I was going out, the landlord asked the maid to go up and ask if any thing was lost. I went up with the maid; there were four more men in the room; but the prosecutor getting up, he put his hand behind the pillow to take out his breeches, and the purse fell out; the garters were in in my pocket, not in my shirt.</p>

On the 28th of April, about ten at night, I lost a silver tankard; my wife was coming out of the city, on the 7th of March, she told me she saw it at Mr. Steven's shop. I went there, and he told me he bought it of a woman, that he could swear to, if he saw her again; so said his servant. I went before the sitting alderman, and got a summons for Mr. Stevens to appear the next day: he came and brought the tankard with him, and described the prisoner: the alderman directed that he should go to my house; he did; the prisoner lives in my neighbourhood, and was a chair-woman in my house, at times. As soon as he saw her, he said, that was the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been at your house, the day the tankard was missing?</p>
               <p>Allen. She had; but we had no call for her that week.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen your tankard last?</p>
               <p>Allen. It stood in the corner cupboard, in the kitchen, on the 28th, at one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stevens. I live at the Dial and Crown, in Aldgate high-street, and keep a silver-smith's shop. On the 28th of February, the prisoner at the bar came to my house, and said, she wanted to dispose of a silver tankard: I examined her where she lived, and what business her husband was, and how she came to sell the tankard? she said she lived at Bow, near the Golden Cup, and that her husband had the misfortune to break his leg, and she had five or six children, and they were drove to necessity; telling me this, I bought it rather out of pity, than that of profit: I gave her 5 s. an ounce for it: she was well dressed: Mr. Carrington was in my shop at the time; it weighed 30 ounces, 7 pennyweights; I sell new silver now, at 5 s. 5 d. an ounce.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176405020012"/>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was about three or four in the afternoon: I put it in my window for sale: Mrs. Allen coming by some time after, she came in, and desired me to let her see the tankard: I did: she said, this is my tankard: then Mr. Allen, and another gentleman, came at night and asked for it: I said, I was very ready to deliver it up before a magistrate, in case they would prosecute the thief. Mr. Allen, and his wife, described the woman they suspected, and it tallied exactly to the woman I bought the tankard of: I have had it in my custody ever since. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) I went to Mr. Allen's house with Mr. Carrington, who works for me and a little boy: when we saw the prisoner,  ing in a dirty dress, I said, I should be glad   in the cloaths that she dresses in: they were   we knew her before she put them on, but then looked more like what she did before.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and work for Mr. Stevens. On the 28th of February I went there to carry home some work: the woman at the bar, and three or four more, were in the shop; I staid till the other women were gone; the prisoner and Mr. Stevens had agreed for the tankard; the boy went up for some money; she received seven guineas, a five and threepenny-piece, and two shillings. I saw a tankard standing by them; whether this is the same, I cannot tell. When we went before the alderman, Mr. Allen desired me to describe the woman; I did, in every particular; he said, it answered to the person they suspected; this was about a week after she sold it. I went afterwards to Mr. Allen's house; he sent for the prisoner; as soon as she came, Mr. Stevens, his little boy, and I, all knew her. When she sold the tankard, Mr. Stevens desired her to sign her name while he paid her. She said her name was

            . On the 5th of March I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and had reason to suspect the prisoner Darling; they were taken out of my chest; I found them in the possession of Ramsey, after he had denied he had any such things in his possession. On the 20th of March I found them, according to the confession of Darling; they were concealed. He said, he sold them to Ramsey on the 6th of March, between five and six in the morning; he also said, all the tools he took out of the building, he sold for 9 s. and I value mine at 12 s.</p>

            . I am an officer and house-broker. Darling was taken in Whitechapel on the 19th of March; and I was sent for to the Man-in-the-Moon; there he said he would tell me where all the tools were, if I would go with him to Mr. Ramsey's. and be bound every man should have his tools again: He was taken before the justice, and a search warrant granted. When we came to Ramsey's house, said Ramsey to Darling, Are not you a great rogue? I took Ramsey into a little room, and said, I had a warrant to search his house, as Darling says he has sold things to you: he said, you shall see all I have: he took out smoothing planes, hammers, saws, and many other tools: there were about five or six thousand nails, which Darling made information he had stole, and sold to Ramsey.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Ramsey denied having any of the things on the 19th, and this was the 20th, which the officer speaks of. I was there on the 19th; seeing some old tools lying, and Ramsey's wife in the shop, I asked her if she had any carpenter's tools to sell? She said, no more than what I saw. I knew nothing of Mr. Ramsey's denying it till we were there to search. After Mr. Marks had asked him if he had any more saws, he said, No. Mr. Marks desired him not to conceal any thing; he said, he had no more; and after that, there were thirteen or fourteen more saws found concealed.</p>
               <p>Marks. I said, Pray, Mrs. Ramsey, where is the key of this drawer? She said, I know not. I sent a young man to him to the alehouse, where he was in custody; when he came to us, he denied that there was a tool in the house more than what we had seen. I took a key and opened two drawers, in which were fourteen saws.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were thirty-eight saws found in his house, and thirty of them are owned; two of them belong to me. ( The things mentioned in the indictment produced, and deposed to.) There were divers people swore to their tools, which are here now.</p>
               <p>Dearing's confession was taken in writing before justice Berry, and signed by his name. It is read in Court, giving an account of all the things mentioned in the several indictments against the two prisoners; and that Ramsey encouraged him to bring what he would, and he would purchase it; and that the marks on the tools were not obliterated when he sold them to Ramsey.</p>
               <p>Marks. Here is the account that Ramsey brought to the justice, and delivered it as the book of what he gave for goods: It runs in this form: He does not mention the names of things, but in general he has put it goods: Laid out on goods. What he bought of Darling was only from the 18th to the 20th of March: this is what he owned before the justice, that these goods were tools bought of

            . I am a butcher in the Fleet-market. On the 7th of March the prisoner came to me, between 9 and 10 in the morning, and said, he had a good cow to sell, and she was at the Bell Inn, in Smithfield: I went and saw her: he asked 5 l. 10 s. it was but poor middling sort of meat: I bid him 4 l. he fell to five guineas: then I bid 4 l. 5 s. and then up to 4 l. 10 s. we could not agree: I went half way over Smithfield: he sent a man to call me back, and said, I must give him a little more: I said, I would not give him any more: then he took my luck with it: he brought her to my slaughter-house, in Wheat-sheaf yard: I gave him 43 s. what I had in my pocket: he came the next morning, and I gave him 2 l. 7 s. the remainder. I sent the hide to Mr. Martin, a hide salesman, at Leaden-hall market; there Mr. Clark found it. It was a brown mottle; pretty much mottled: a very remarkable cow. When Mr. Clark's son asked me if I could find the man I bought the cow of, I said, I believed I could. I went and found the prisoner leaning upon a post at the Crown-tavern door, in Smithfield: we took him to the Nag's-head, Leaden-hall, to Mr. Clark. I saw the hide that Mr. Clark owned: it was the hide of the cow which I bought of the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>The cow was brought to me just at Shoreditch church: a man was coming along with her: he thought I knew better than he how to sell her: and he desired me to go and sell her for him. I gave the man the money at Islington: I met him there by accident: I sold her for 4 l. 10 s.: I had seen the man before, but not to have any acquaintance with him: I gave him the money at the Red-lion alehouse: I had but 18 d. for selling her, the same as in the market: the man stood by me while I sold her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harlow. Did you see a man with the prisoner when you bought the cow?</p>
               <p>Harlow. There was a man with him, but he did not seem to take any notice: the prisoner and I agreed about the price. When we were before Mr. Clark, he said, he had the cow in exchange for a cow and calf at Lewisham.</p>

The prisoner brought a tea-chest, tea-board, and two cardinals: I asked him how he came by them? he said, he kept a girl in the town, and they were her property, and he took them from her. I found something rattle in the tea-box; and, after he was gone, I borrowed a key, and found three silver tea-spoons, and some pieces of money in it; then I advertised it. He came back in the evening, and said, I had given him 6 s. 9 d. instead of half a guinea; then I stopped him, and took him up.</p>

On Tuesday, the 13th, Mr. Stockdale, a pawnbroker, sent for me; I went to his house, and there I saw two crape gowns, my property: then he and I went to Justice Fielding's, and got a warrant to take up the two prisoners: they confessed the fact before Mr. Fielding. I mentioned all I could recollect at that time I had lost; they in general owned to the fact; they said they had pawned the rest, some in one place, and some in another, in several parts of the town. I have recovered some of the other things, according to their directions, and the pawnbrokers all gave me my goods again, that is, all I could find (five gowns and several other things produced in court): there are what I have recovered, my property.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176405020019"/>Q. In what manner did the deceased aggravate her?</p>
               <p>S. Littlewood. The deceased said she made a whore of her daughter-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing passed besides words?</p>
               <p>S. Littlewood. No, nothing but words.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after the blow?</p>
               <p>S. Littlewood. The deceased got up from her seat in the box, and went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any wound?</p>
               <p>S. Littlewood. No, I did not see the wound: I saw blood come immediately; she said she had got a cut on her head, and would go for a warrant: I never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it?</p>
               <p>S. Littlewood. A small blow: (an iron poker produced.) This is the poker. *</p>
               <p>* Note, it was a common kitchen-poker, the great end pretty weighty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I struck the woman with that poker, or a bigger, and if the surgeon that opened her, is of opinion that was the cause of her death, I am willing to die for it. It cut her, to be sure, and she bled excessively; if that is the surgeon's opinion, I am willing to lay down my life for her life.</p>
               <p>Joseph Randall. The deceased sent for me, and I dressed her head on the Friday evening; I desired her to go to bed, and apply a warm poultice to it, and if she was not capable to come to me, to send word, and I would wait on her: she came the next two days, which was Saturday and Sunday, I dressed the wound and examined it, but could not find any fracture; she only complained of a little pain in her head. On the Monday, she sent word to my house, she would be glad if I would come to her; I went and enquired for her; I went in at the Bull and Butcher: Mrs. Hargrove asked me who ordered me to attend? I said I had orders from Justice Welch to attend the deceased, and dress the wound; she said, she was to pay for it, and she would employ who she pleased: she would not shew me the room. I enquired, and found her, and dressed her; and after I had dressed her, Mrs. Hargrove came up into the room, and another woman with her; there was another woman before in the room. After I had dressed it, Mrs. Hargrove insisted upon seeing it, I said I had just dressed it, and begged she would not take off the dressings. She attempted to pull the dressings off: I told her it was upon the head, and it might be of dangerous consequence: then I desired her to send for a surgeon from he hospital for fear of he consequence. She said it was no business of mine, she would take care and provide a surgeon. I left the room, and never saw her till I was sent for to open the head after she was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take the dressings of?</p>
               <p>Randall. I believe she did; I know the cap was off, and she attempted it; but whether she did or not, I am not quite certain. She seemed to be in a passion, and I left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you sent for to open the head?</p>
               <p>Randall. That was on a Thursday, pretty near three weeks after. I opened her head, and found matter under the place where the blow was given upon the brain; I take it to be matter that proceeded from extravased blood: I saw also a black spot between the first and second rib, on the right side, and on the left side there were two broken ribs, the 5th and 6th.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she complained of her ribs to you?</p>
               <p>Randall. No, she never did to me; there was a great inflammation on the right side of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, what was the judgment you formed, as to the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Randall. I do imagine the blows that were given her, were the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the blow on the head was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Randall. I think that was the principal thing. With proper care, it might not have proved mortal.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether the violent blow she had on the temple might not be more the cause of that matter, than that of the poker? I want no favour.</p>
               <p>Randall. I don't know that I found any bruise on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I offered her Surgeon Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether according to your judgment, what she received on the ribs appeared like to be mortal?</p>
               <p>Randall. No, my lord, they did not: there was no; or a very slight inflammation on her side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moffet. I was sent for by the prisoner, on the Thursday; I examined the body, and found on the outside a black spot, between the collar-bone and the 2 d rib; there was a small sore on the head: that I was informed was in consequence of a blow she had received on the left side of the head; there was a trifling blackness below the left eye; we proceeded then to open the chest, and the first object of our attention was, to see whether this black spot was nearly more than skin deep; that part appeared quite unhurt: the chest being opened, the right side of the lungs appeared quite black, and quite condensed; they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176405020020"/> gathered up into a solid matter; there was about a pint and a half of thin matter, in which the lungs were swiming; we took them out, and put them in water; they readily swam in water; they appeared to have been useless a considerable time before the decease of the person: we then looked into the left side of the body, and found the 5th and 6th ribs broke, but the lungs were not in the least hurt by the broken ribs. These I mention because I would give my opinion clearly. As to that upon the head, I found under the scalp, the bone was bare for a considerable distance, the brain was covered with matter, but this matter would have appeared from the injury without. I gave my opinion before the coroner, that these wounds she had, were the cause of her death; but being acquainted with circumstances since, which I did not know before, that is, that she got cold, and in consequence of that, it settled on her lungs; and I am of opinion, if she had had no blow at all, that would have been sufficient to have brought on her death.</p>

            . I attended her from the Thursday, she did not appear to have any remarkable drowsiness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she at any time lose her senses?</p>
               <p>M. Mills. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burgess. I am an apothecary; I was called in three days before she died.</p>
               <p>Q. Who called you in?</p>
               <p>Burgess. The prisoner at the bar: she desired I would take all the pains I could; this was on Easter-Sunday. When I came to her, I understood her disorder was of the pleurisy, and upon the lungs: I thought she was so far gone, that I could not be of much use to her; yet notwithstanding, I tried.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mills. When did the deceased die?</p>
               <p>Mills. She died on the 24th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do towards taking care of the deceased, after Mr. Randall went away on the Monday?</p>
               <p>Mills. The prisoner would have had the deceased gone to the hospital, but the deceased would not go; her fever began about seven days before she died, and from that time, she grew worse and worse, by going out into the yard one day, about 11 o'clock, all in a wringing sweat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Moffet. What do you think was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Moffet. The fracture on her ribs was not; and I cannot think that on her head, without other circumstances, would have been the cause of her death. It did not appear that the bone was broke at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you doubt whether she was struck with the poker?</p>
               <p>Moffet. No; but I doubt whether that was the cause of her death. I rather am of opinion, the cause of her death was the inflammation on her lungs; I believe the wound would have been of no consequence, if she had not catched cold; there was another circumstance, the woman had miscarried about 7 weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Randall. Do you continue in that opinion, that the blow on her head brought on her death?</p>
               <p>Randall. The injury on the brain, must be a considerable part of her death. I saw the deceased's husband, and asked him why they had not got a surgeon? he said he was a poor man, and was indebted to Mrs. Hargrove; and she told him she would give him farther indulgence, in case he would let his wife be without a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Mills. The prisoner sent the deceased victuals and drink till she died.</p>
               <p>Burgess. The first day I was called in, I did not know there was a wound; the second day I was informed there was a wound, but I did not dress it: I attended only as an apothecary.</p>

               <p>Peachey. A small drawing blow, not a violent hard blow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>If the surgeon thinks I am the cause of her death, I am willing to die; I gave her the blow: though my passion was violent, I stopped my hand, and only let it fall; for as I was standing and she sitting, if I had struck her hard, I must have split her skull: to be sure she had been beat very cruelly; she had a very bad tongue.</p>

Soon after, Mr. Wilstead went up, and returned and said, the girl and things mentioned, were missing; she desired me to go to a young fellow that the girl kept company with, to enquire for her. I did, and was informed she was in Cross-lane: we went there, and found her; she had the buttons in her hand, the cloak was found in a closet, and the apron was pawned: she seemed to be pretty much in liquor: all this was in about an hour after she and the things were missing.</p>

I was afraid to say any thing then, being by myself: I ran and told my companion of it: said he, do you know the man? I said, I did: then said he, we will go and get the handkerchief again. When the prisoner saw me see he had my handkerchief, he shuffled up to hide it, and another of them came and catched it out of his hand, but I could not take notice of him. My companion and I went up to the prisoner: I said, you are the young man that took my handkerchief out of my pocket: he said, I know nothing of it: we took him, and met the watchman, and charged him with him: just before we came to the watch-house, he slipped his arm out of my hand, and struck me on the breast: he denied having the handkerchief: he said his name was Smith: but the next morning he said he was a copper-plate printer, and lived by Charing-cross, and that he was a master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Wiggins. It was just under a lamp. I have no doubt at all as to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you your handkerchief last?</p>
               <p>Wiggins. I had it in my hand not above three minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wiggins. I am a journeyman peruke-maker: I have not been long out of the country.</p>
               <p>Fildue Morey. I was with the prosecutor at this time; he told me he had lost his handkerchief; I asked him if he knew the man that took it; he said, he did; then we went, and he pitched upon the prisoner; and said, he took it out of his pocket.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar and I, were fellow servants together, at the Queen's-head tavern, in Holborn. She left the service, and I also: I went to live at the Golden-cross, Charing-cross: she came there, and told me her husband had entered for a soldier, and desired me to lend her some money to take some things out of pawn, and said, she would pay it me again: I told her I would, and went that night to see her: I was to bring the money the next night: I staid with her part of the night: and when I was asleep, she awaked me, and told me, her husband was coming: he came into the room: I had not time to examine after my cloaths, but got out of the room upon the stair-case: I staid there till the man of the house came with a candle to me, I believe the cloaths, mentioned in the indictment, coat, waistcoat, breeches, one stocking, shoe and knee-bukles, shoes, and a neckcloth, were left in the room: I am certain they were not brought out while I was on the stair-case: they turned me out naked. I went to a man who was so good as to lend me cloaths. I went and got a warrant, and took her and her husband up: I got all again, all but my money: he had carried my cloaths to the cock in Tottenham court road: they both confessed, before the justice, that they each had a hand in taking my things, and she had the waistcoat on her: they gave no account of the money: she had the buckles in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. On the 13th of March, about 7 in the morning, the prisoner and her husband were brought to my door: we carried them before Justice Cox at the Rotation-office: the prisoner acknowledged she had the prosecutor's buckles and waistcoat: they both confessed they were jointly concerned in taking the prosecutor's cloaths. We took the husband to Tottenham-court, where they said the things were, and found them, and brought them to Titchfield-street. The husband is since dead in prison.</p>

            . There was one Riley, that was in the room along with the prisoners, that came and gave me information there were some goods which were stolen. When we searched the lower room we found nothing at all. Mr. Marks went up stairs, the prisoners all came running down; said I to Barnard, who is called the Bear, you are a fighting man, and have beat six people at Aldgate church, and if you stir an inch, I'll shoot the first person that moves. Mr. Marks brought the goods down, and put them before me; after that, we got a coach, and brought them before my Lord Mayor, and they were committed. I advertised the ribbons, and a person from Greenwich came and owned them. I know no more of the shalloons than that they were found in

Mr. Wilks, at the Cock, in Aldersgate-street, said to me, What did you do with the box? I said, I burnt it; I never let any body know what I do with the things; Steers bought them of me, or I wish I may be cast for death, and not be reprieved. I assure you, the poor man does not know what he has lost, and that fool the evidence cannot tell him. I am guilty of what I am charged with, I assure you. I hope I shall have Lloyd and Steers in the plantation along with me.</p>

I went to the public house, and alarmed the people, in order to stop the thieves, but they had made their escape; then we went up, and found the boxes broke open, and cloaths taken out.

I went to see if we could find the goods. He said he lodged in Cross-lane, Newtoner's-lane; then he said, the goods he stole were in Gray's lodgings, in Shoemaker-row; we went there, and found Gray and Barnes, and three girls, all in bed together; and there we found these goods.

Then they wrote a letter to this purpose;</p>
               <p>"Sir, we are stopped at Mr. Smith's, with the hauser that we were to sell, and were to bring brooms and greens with: I desire you will come and clear us." I went myself on board the ship, to Mr. Bucannan, and he came on shore: I shewed him the hauser; he said. it does not belong to me: it belongs to such a captain, mentioning the prosecutor; he charged the two men, and they were sent to the watch-house. After that, one of them got the liberty to come to my house again; he then charged the mate with being concerned, in sending it by them, to sell it, and bring him the money; but the next morning, Mr. Bucannan was cleared by the officers.</p>

               <p>I never gave any such orders. I am chief mate of the vessel: my orders were to the boatswain and second mate, to sweep all the odd ends of rope together, and go on shore, and exchange them for brooms and greens.</p>

               <p>Jenkins. I was on the deck. Mr. Bucannan was snoring asleep: I said Mr. Bucannan drives his hogs to market. About an hour after this, I heard a noise, and saw Mr. Bucannan run with a candle in his hand, in his shirt and breeches; there was talk about a rope; he ran to see if it was his own new rope: this was after Mr. Smith came with the account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. Did Bucannan own he ordered them to take this great piece of cable?</p>
               <p>Smith. He did say he ordered them to take this piece on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this piece of cable or junk?</p>
               <p>Smith. He mentioned junk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call this old junk?</p>
               <p>Smith. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear he ordered them to carry this very piece on shore?</p>
               <p>Smith. I cannot swear to this very piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell whether he said carry that piece. or carry old junk?</p>
               <p>Smith. I believe he said old junk.</p>

             Some. I attended the ship, the Carolina: the mate was in the cabbin, snoaring asleep, when the rope was taken away. I am the waterman's apprentice, and moored our boat at the bow: I missed my boat, and went to look round, and found her with this rope lying part in her, and the end of it was not cut: Aplin cut it, as the other part was on board the ship, and the bit fell down into our boat: I jumped into the boat, and desired them to hawl it up: Sherriden was on the poop; it was chopped off partly, and then he cut it with a knife. I heard the custom-house officer say, that the mate was driving his hogs: when they had cut it, they carried it away. I rowed them on shore at St. Catharine's.</p>

            : they asked the price of a wax-bead necklace: I turned myself round to beckon Mrs. Cowell, and in the mean time, I suppose, the cluster diamond ring was taken. I missed it in about an hour and a half after they were gone, from out of a show-glass, in the window. When the bill was going to be found, Mrs. O-Neal told me, she believed she could help me to the middle stone, if I would not say any thing about it: that was last Wednesday.

             The prisoner at the bar and I went to Mr. Cowell's shop on a Saturday: I believe it is going on two years ago: it was in the year 1762. she went in, and I followed her. Mr. Cowell sent for his wife: I stood looking at Mr. Cowell, and did not see the prisoner take the ring: at night, she gave me a ring, and desired me to sell it for her. I asked her, what I should get for it? she bid me get as much as I could. I sent for a man on the Sunday night, that I thought would buy it, are showed it him: he asked me if it was a diamond ring? I told him she told me it was: he said, if I would trust him with the ring, he would go and shew it to a judge. I said, I could not do that: she took the ring of me, on the Monday night; and on the Tuesday, she sent it to me, by one of the women mentioned in the indictment, desiring me to sell it for her. I sent for the man, and he gave me nine guineas for it; I went up to the prisoner's house, and laid it on the table, and I believe Mrs. M'Cabe, and the other woman, took the money up to themselves; and the day after the installation at Windsor, the man came to my house, and said he had sold it to a Jew, and the middle stone was a false one. I sent one of my children to know if it was good; and word was brought, the stone in the middle was a false stone; but the stones round it, were brilliants. I went to Mrs. M'Cabe, and desired the money again; three guineas were allowed for the middle stone being bad, and he gave six guineas for the ring; that is, I allowed that, without having any recompence for it, as I had delivered the money to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any rings in Mr. Cowell's shop?</p>
               <p>O-Neal. No. I did not; I was looking at Mr. Cowell, at work.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was the stone in the middle a true one?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was; it was a diamond.</p>
               <p>Q. to O Neal. Was you taken up?</p>
               <p>O-Neal. No, I was not.</p>

            . I am constable, and live in Duke's-place. On a Saturday night, about a month ago, the prisoner came into my house, through my back door; he brought these two warming-pans, and asked me to buy them: he asked me 8 s. for them: he said he was the maker. I suspected he did not come honestly by them; and said, if he could bring any sufficient housekeeper that could prove them to be his, he should have them again. I shewed them to two gentlemen, who directed me to the prosecutor: I went, and he owned the pans.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have employed the prisoner 20 years, he is the maker: (Produced and deposed to) I never knew he made any for himself since he worked for me: I never knew he was guilty of robbing me before, or any body else.</p>

               <p>About two days before this, a gentleman asked me the price of two pans; I sold them, and carried my mistress the money; master was not at home. I had two pans bespoke; I went home, and told the boy I wanted two pans to shew a man; I carried them to the place appointed, but he did not come. As I was going home, the Jews accosted me, and asked me, if I had any things to sell: I said, no: they said, perhaps I might want money: upon that, I shewed them the pans, and asked them six shillings a-piece: then they sent me to the constable, and he stopped me.</p>

I concluded he had robbed me. I pursued, crying, Stop thief; in his flight he threw away two pair of silver buckles; and, in about 120 yards running, he was stopped by two men at the end of Chamber's-street; they brought him back to a public house near my shop. I went to see what I had lost from the window; then I went to the prisoner, and demanded my watches; he gave me two: I said, here is not all; you have another: then he pulled out the third, and gave it me: then I said, Where are my rings? after some little while, he gave me them: said I, let me have all: then he took out the other pair of buckles, and said, that was all; and held up his hands, and cried for mercy.</p>

I felt in my breeches, and my money was gone: no, said I: she ran crying out at the door, making a noise. In about a minute and a half in came Woodward Harlow; he asked me the same questions, and away he ran: he did not stay above half a minute in the room: then the constable came in, and said, I hear you have lost some money in this house: yes, Sir, said I: he said, come along with me, I'll secure this woman till you can find the rest. I dressed myself, and went along with him to the Mansion-house before the alderman. The prisoner confessed she saw the money before I went to sleep, but denied that she took it.</p>

I was on my watch: there came a parcel of people to me, and desired I would come directly, saying, a man was robbed of an hundred pounds: I went: the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing the money from out of his breeches under his bed.

She came in, and called for a pennyworth of beer, and sat down in a box in the room; I was then warming some wine, to go to the excise-office; I had taken notice of her before, and said, take notice that woman does not give you bad money: I did not go with the wine, but went to her, and said, Mrs. have you paid? she gave me this sixpence; (producing a pewter one); she pulled out three more at the same time, that were all good.

He said to me, you are the person that has come several times, and brought bad sixpences here; and before God, I never was in that house in my life before. He brought a constable, and seized me. I had four sixpences in my pocket, and did not know it was a bad one.</p>

I owed Mr. Steward some money, and said, if he would take the note, I would pay him what I owed him: he asked me how I came by it? I said, it is no matter. I went to him after that, and wanted more money, and I took and indorsed it to him. I declare I never saw no note but that. It never was advertised after I found it.</p>

(A paper box produced, deposed to by prosecutor.) After he was taken, the mob were for ducking him *. When we got to the compter, he gave the names of several of his confederates: he mentioned one by the name of Doctor, and said, he was to be found on Saffron-hill, at the Globe.</p>

Presently after she was gone, Mrs. Ellard came for the linen: we told her we had delivered it to a woman that she sent: she said, she had sent nobody. My master advertised her, and she was taken up on the Sunday after; this was on the Monday: then she made a confession, that she had sold or pawned the things, at Mr. Marchant's and Mr. Jones's: they were found again.</p>
