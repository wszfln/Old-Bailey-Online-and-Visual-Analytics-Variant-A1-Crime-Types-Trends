                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The, evidence of this witness was given partly in English, and partly in French, interpreted</hi>). I am an Austrian, I have been residing at the Belle Vue Hotel, Norfolk Street, Strand—I was a professor of literature at Vienna—I came to England, about 17th March, 1874——I brought with me 105 pieces of Sevres china, a complete dessert service, the property of Prince Repnine, a Russian nobleman—I was employed to sell the service, the price was fixed at Vienna, at 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and coming here at 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money—I was promised a commission by the prince, his word was sufficient for me; I had authority in writing to sell—the agreement with the prince was in conversation, and in a letter; it was spoken about generally, he promised me a remuneration—in August, last year, I was still in possession of the Sevres service, and with the exception of some few pieces I had the service at the hotel in Norfolk Street, where I was residing—the defendant came to me there—I had never seen him before; he came alone, without any introduction—he sent in his card by a waiter, and on going into the drawing-room I found him there—he com<lb/>menced speaking in English—I asked him if he spoke French—he said he was educated in France, and we then conversed in French, with several words in English—he asked me whether he could see that beautiful service of which he had heard so much—I said "With the greatest pleasure, wait a moment," because I was going to fetch the key, as I had the service in a small room, downstairs on the ground floor; I then showed him fourteen pieces which had been taken out as a sample, he examined them with great atten<lb/>tion and with the appearance of a great connoisseur—he asked me the price of the whole collection—I said the lowest price would be 8,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he asked</p>

               <p>me whether the collection could be divided—I said that could be done, into two groups, viz., one group for twelve persons, and the other for ten persons, the first consisting of fifty-five pieces, and the second of forty-nine pieces, and in this way one of the plates would remain over—the price I fixed for the first group was 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for the second 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was looking at the pictures which were in my room, and he particularly looked at one of Nicolas Poussin, and he told me that he also had a Poussin in his pos<lb/>session, together with other old pictures, and he begged me to call upon him in the afternoon at 4 o'clock—he said that one of his friends, a lord, had already offered him 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that picture, but that he had asked 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and therefore he could not give it to him for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed him to be really the son of a lord, in consequence of his way of talking, at all events that he was a distinguished person—I went to the Albany next day, but I made a mistake and went to the wrong door; I left my card—after that I had quite forgotten him, but about three weeks after he came to the hotel again and left a card; I was not at home, and he wrote for me to come to him to-morrow—I wrote to him saying I would come at 10 o'clock the following day—I then went to the rooms, I 3, on that occasion the servant I think opened the door—I do not remember if Phillips or the servant did, but the servant opened it most often when I went there, by the servant I mean, Cohen—I saw Phillips there that morn<lb/>ing; I don't remember the date exactly, it was between the 15th and the 20th, it was about the 15th; he received me in a large room furnished with simple elegance—there were several large pictures in it hanging on the walls—our conversation was principally in French, but also several phrases in English; after a little conversation he took me into another room, and showed me the Poussin which was hanging over his bed—he then said "I wish first of all to buy the smaller group containing forty-nine pieces for 4,500?. in this manner; I shall give you first of all the Poussin picture, and I will bring to you the lord on the day following, who no doubt will buy it for 2,000?., and on that occasion you can sell your own Poussin as well, because the lord is an amateur, and a very passionate or very great admirer of pictures by Poussin, and as to the remaining 2,500?. I shall in the mean while cede or transfer, or give to you as guarantee five other ancient pictures," without selling them, only as guarantee—he said, "When I have the smaller group in my possession I shall obtain a loan from my father of 5,000?. to 6,000?.; my father is a man of fortune and lives at the present moment at Ryde, with his family because he has the intention to go on a long tour in the Mediterranean, and has a yacht, because he is a member, of the yacht club, and the owner of one yacht," and when once he had obtained this loan he would pay me 4,000?. in cash which would make with the price for the Poussin 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me, and as to the rest 2,500?. he should beg me to give him credit till the end of January or the commencement of February, leaving to me as a guarantee, the five other pictures—he said "To have still a larger security or guarantee you will do me the pleasure of residing at my apartments during my absence, instead of living at the hotel, and then you can make use of my servant and housekeeper"—I told him I should consider all this—he mentioned the names of the artists who had painted the pictures that were to be left as a guarantee, and the names were on the frames—he said those pictures had cost him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he would never sell them, except the Poussin—on 22nd September, I went again to the Albany and saw Phillips, but we</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was translated as follows:</hi> "London, 22nd Sept., 1875. I. 3, Albany Street, Piccadilly.

When 1 brought the bos there I immediately took the pieces out and put them on a sideboard—Cohen was not in the room at the time; he brought the box into the room—I don't remember whether he was in the room when the china was placed out on the sideboard, I paid no attention to him—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written by Phillips, and I copied it—he asked me to keep the service till he had received the necessary money from his father—I said "You ought to undertake to purchase it," and on that Phillips wrote and signed this paper.

Phillips then said "Now, as I have the smaller group, I can now have the loan from my father, and I shall bring the lord to you to<lb/>morrow to buy the Poussin, and I hope in four or five days we shall have concluded the whole affair"—I was then going away, and he asked me whether I could not take the Poussin with me—I was a little surprised to see that the picture had been taken down already when I entered there—I said the picture was too large, and it was already very late, and I preferred <hi rend="italic">to call to-morrow</hi> morning at 9 o'clock to take the picture, because he could not come with the lord before 12 o'clock at noon—there never was a question about taking the other pictures with me; nothing was said about that—it had been arranged that the lord was to pay me 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. next day for the Poussin—as to the word "exchange" in that paper I have to observe that I always spoke of a provisional exchange, as I had written in my first con<lb/>tract and guarantee till he should have paid me—now, I well understand the word "exchange," but at that time, in the great haste in which he made me sign, I did not observe that the word "provisional" had been omitted; it never was my intention to exchange the service against the pictures—I had been authorised to give credit for one-third of the sum by selling the service against security; that was verbally—I left the box and the forty-four pieces at the Albany in the possession of Phillips—it was a wooden box covered with leather, made expressly for the china—Cohen and the workmen helped to carry the box from the cab to Phillips' rooms—after my return to the hotel, and after dinner, a waiter called me out, and to <hi rend="italic">my great</hi> surprise I saw four men with a cart, and the pictures outside—Cohen was there—I spoke to him in English—I asked him "For what reason have you brought all these pictures here?——he said "When you left Mr. Phil<lb/>lips, the lord arrived, and he thought it was the best to send you imme<lb/>diately the pictures, because he will call to-morrow between 11 and 12 o'clock with the lord"—I had only a small room for the china and for the other pictures, and I could not put all the pictures in that room—I was angry at receiving the pictures; I had not desired it, and it never was arranged between me and Phillips—Cohen left the pictures with me—I went to the Albany next day before 9 o'clock; I rang the bell many times, and nobody opened the door; I could not get in; the old housekeeper came and said that Phillips was out of town—I gave orders to the housekeeper to send Cohen immediately he returned—I saw Cohen that evening—Phil<lb/>lip did not come with any nobleman that morning—when Cohen came I</p>

I am an Austrian by birth—I know what a bankrupt is; a bankruptcy is a failure—I was a bankrupt in 1864 at Vienna—I gave up all that I possessed—I had property in Styria, the fortune of my wife—I gave up all I possessed, about 27,000 florins to my creditors—Prince Repnine entrusted me with this china at the exhibi<lb/>tion at Vienna; that was after my bankruptcy—I was employed at the exhibition, I was inspector of the pavilion of amateurs, where they exhibited works of ancient art and also modern—here is my document (<hi rend="italic">producing a paper</hi>)—I had the surveillance of that pavilion, it was entrusted to me—this china was exhibited there and then I had to sell it for the prince—he gave me no written directions then, but when he came to Vienna an agreement was arranged between us, he gave me his authority, I had a letter of autho<lb/>risation from the prince; it must be here, it was at the police-court—my duty was to sell the china—I brought it from Vienna to London in the same state in which I received it, 105 pieces—after a year I pledged several pieces—I did not pawn some of it within three months of my arrival in London, it was about a year—I cannot remember whether it was within six months—the first amount I raised was in October; I have given this explanation to Mr. Wontner—I spent the money for my own purposes and also in expenses for the service—I pawned two pieces in October to Mr. Young and some to Mr. Bierstoff—my intention was never dishonest—I pawned some of the china to Young in October, 1874, for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I spent that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself and my 'expenses in England and for my children in Vienna—I re<lb/>deemed those two pieces after two months—I pawned it afterwards at Mr. Bierstoff's for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have thirty-seven pieces of the china now in my pos<lb/>session—I have entrusted it to the London Joint Stock Bank—the forty-four pieces are in this box, which was seized by Sergeant Reimers in Mr. Cook's office—the manager of the bank was so kind as to receive during many months the whole service in deposit—I gave it to him to take care of—I did not get any money from the bank for it—in April last year I went to Paris and took with me fourteen pieces—I pledged one piece there by an agent, it is at Paris now—when I have the liberty to go to Paris, for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can have it back again—I did not pawn it, it was a very bad action of the agent; he was not my agent—I did not myself pawn any in Paris; I gave a piece to a dealer in Pans and he gave me 500 francs, and I gave a receipt for it, that was to enable me to return to London—the prince has since taken out a</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 10th September</hi>, 1873, <hi rend="italic">and purported to be an authority from Prince Repnine to the witness to sell the china service on his behalf.</hi>) I showed that to Phillips on the second or third call—this docu<lb/>ment of the 22nd September is Phillips' writing. (<hi rend="italic">This described the witness as the accredited agent of Prince Repnine, the owner of the china.</hi>) The Prince was to find money for the expenses of <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> and family while I was in England—he was also to pay any expenses incurred in exhibiting and dis<lb/>posing of the china—I had an apartment in Jermyn Street for that purpose—I appropriated the money that I raised in the way I have described for my personal expenses, and for that of my family, and also for the china service, journeys to Paris, and so on, and insurance—ten pieces wore at one time pledged—the greatest number pawned was in November, when we redeemed them, then there were twenty-one—that included Jacobson's—three are still in pledge now at Mr. Bierstoff's—when I saw Mr. Robins, I com<lb/>municated with him, on behalf of the Prince, where they were, and they were redeemed immediately afterwards—there are at present 100 pieces existing; one has been stolen, one is at Paris, and three are at Bierstoff's, that makes 105—I was present when Phillips was taken into custody—not when he was taken by the policemen, but when he was taken before the Magistrate—it was after he was taken before the Magistrate that the offer of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was talked about, because that was on 1st December or 30th November, and he was taken into custody on 15th November—an offer was made to return the china before he was taken into custody—Mr. Jacobson told me that he knew where Phillips was, and he would get it returned if I gave 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I cousented with pleasure; that was before he was arrested, before 1st Decem<lb/>ber—Mr. Robins was to pay the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of the prince—I know now what was to be done with the money; but before I signed that paper I did not know—the arrangement was mentioned to the Magistrate, and he</p>

I took a cursory glance and formed on opinion of the value. We advertised the chambers to let, and the contents for sale. I had known Phillips for two or three years. I knew him in business in Ely Place. I knew-nothing of his liquidation at that time. He was a gentleman wanting chambers. About June or July I sold him the contents of the chambers. I cannot say what I asked for the furniture. An inventory was made in two parts; the books by Sotheby &amp; Co., and the rest of the effects were made an inventory of by one of my clerks, named Sims, who has left us now. We could get no more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the friends of Prince Rodecanacci, and as Phillips had offered 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I consulted with Mr. Waddell, and I sold to Phillips the whole contents of the chambers. I saw some pictures in the rooms. I got the money from Phillips. I have seen Cohen at Phillips' chambers. He has opened the door to me. I have seen Cohen also at Ely Place. I can't say in what capacity. 25, Ely Place, was like an office, two rooms, the back like a warehouse, the front room as an office and sitting room. I do not know how Cohen was employed there</p>

I am a member of the firm of Venning, Robins &amp; Co.—we are very often employed by the Russiam embassy—I have been acting for Prince Repnine—a certain number of pieces of china are in the hands of the police awaiting the result of this trial, and a certain number at the London Joint Stock Bank, one piece in London, two in Paris, and fourteen or fifteen in my custody—this letter, which Mr. Cook says was brought to him by Magner, is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:"</hi> 30th Nov., 1875. To Mr. Cook.

It was not my intention at any time to withdraw from the prosecution without the consent of the Magistrate—about the 26th or 27th of November Mr. Cook, Magner, and the professor called at my office; they told me what had taken place—I think the day before or the day before that, before the Magistrate while they were there, Magner said the china could be got back if 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for it, and that Phillips had said that if he was convicted it could not be obtained, but it should be broken in pieces rather than the prince should</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Boulinnikon Floor cloth Com<lb/>pany—it carries on its chief business in Manchester—there is an office in London, at 76, Queen Street, Cheapside—those premises were opened in June last—it is a registered company (<hi rend="italic">certificate put in, dated 21st Sep<lb/>tember</hi>, 1869)—the business at Manchester has been carried on for some years—Mr. Colville came into our employ in June last at a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, payable monthly—the engagement was ratified by resolution; I was present at the time—the resolution is not here—he received a per<lb/>centage on sales—goods were sent from Manchester as required for stock in London—Colville's duties were to call on all houses in the City of London and South and West of England, to receive orders, and to send particulars, after entering them in his own book, to Manchester—if he received money he was to remit it the same day to Manchester by post—when petty cash was required his duty was to write to Manchester for a cheque—it was pro<lb/>bably about a month after Colville came into our service that I first heard of Miller—when Colville was about to take his first journey I asked him if it was safe to leave the warehouse in charge of a porter, or should I find him assistance—he said it was not necessary, that he had a friend named Miller, who was a barrister's clerk, and it being vacation time he would look in occasionally to see that matters were all right—Spreadbury, a porter, was in our employ—neither Miller nor Colville had any right to pledge any of the goods in the London warehouse—neither of them informed me of the nine pieces of floorcloth which had been removed from the London office—I have seen them since, I identified eight rolls at Messrs. Russell&amp; Co.'s, pawnbrokers, Fore Street, Cripplegate—the day book is in Court and the delivery book also—I have looked through both and find no entries whatever to Mr. James nor to Mr. Dewsbury of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are other entries all about the same time; there is no entry of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was no sale account whatever of these transactions sent down to Manchester (a <hi rend="italic">letter dated 18th August, written to Colville, was handed to the witness</hi>)—I sent this to Colville.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. Colville was our sole representative in London, and with the exception of Spreadbury, the porter, he was the only person employed at the London premises—the resolution embodied the full terms of Colville's engagement—it did not contain the fact that he was to transmit payments to Manchester, on the day of their receipt—I gave him those instructions verbally, acting for the company—they were no part of the resolution that I am aware of—the resolution is contained in the minute-book of the company, that is in Manchester—we have two manufactories in Manchester, but none anywhere else—the books of the company are kept there—Colville used his own discretion as to how long he would be away—we had an agent before appointing him; Mr. Mountford, in Newgate Street—the company would not have allowed Colville to absent himself for the</p>

               <p>or three weeks; it is not a reasonable period—his commission was paid at stock taking time—no specific time was mentioned—the company were only indebted to him the amount of his commission when he was arrested—I cannot tell that amount without the books—these books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all upon which I have made investigation—it would have been perfectly legitimate for him to have entered any sales made in the country, in a rough diary—it would have been the ordinary course of business, and a transfer of the entries into the day-book, when he was in London—petty cash would be sent to him by open cheques—his salary was paid by cheque—I have the book relating to the prisoner's receipts—the Manchester "ledger," but I cannot get from it the amount of commission due to him—Miller never corresponded with me as manager—I may have written in reply to any query—Colville had instructions for the furtherence of the business—he was never told that he might be allowed commission of 12 1/2 per cent in addition to other sums—I did not know until I had made the investigation that that amount had been deducted—he could allow a discount upon sums so long as it was reasonable—the accounts passing between Manchester and London were daily, and Miller forwarded them in Colville's absence—the daily accounts are here—I was never informed of the nine pieces of cloth pledged at Russell's—I had a letter from Mr. Colville. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the passage,"It appears pieces of oilcloth have been pawned at Russell's, in Fore Street, these I will get out"</hi>) As a matter of fact it was not from Colville, I had the first intimation—we found the goods some days before—that letter is dated the 21st December, and the prisoner was arrested, I believe, on the 28th or 29th December—the petty cash was remitted immediately when asked for—we had to get the signatures of two directors, but did not wait for the weekly meeting—there may have been a delay of a day—I cannot say two days—the cheque was upon a Manchester banker—upon petty cash accounts there was something owing to the defendant when taken into custody, but only for accruing expenses—I cannot say to what extent; I have not taken possession of all documents and books that were at Queen Street—Colville removed some of them without our knowledge—I took all the books that were at Queen Street, at the time the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. The company was established in 1869—it has been successful—we lost 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a fire—that is not the reason we appointed Mr. Colville; I did not say when appointing him that the com<lb/>pany had been trading at a loss—we were not insured—we were certainly anxious to push the London trade—we had a very good recommendation with Colville—I believe he has been in New York; we were agreeable to his having Miller there as his friend—during Colville's absence I am not aware that Miller made large sales—we had an order, the amount of which was 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know that Miller obtained it—I cannot say whether it was subsequent to Miller's taking up his position; it was in July (<hi rend="italic">referring to book</hi>)—I cannot say from memory when the arrangement was with Miller—it may have been in July—the order from Rope &amp; Davids, Covent Garden, amounting to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was in August last—I know Mr. Edmunds, of Bayswater, unfortunately, I am not aware of the amount of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of his order—Tunstall &amp; Co., St. Paul's Church Yard, we had an order from and various others, but I cannot say whether that was sub<lb/>sequent to Miller's going to Queen Street—I did go to the Isle of Man, and when there I received a communication from Miller, but no money orders</p>

               <p>sent by him, cither directly or indirectly from Manchester—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) I beg your parden in that instance, I did; it was addressed to me personally—I cannot recollect whether during my stay at the Isle of Man I received from Miller, all communications through the Manchester house—I may have received some orders from Miller—there is no doubt we received some sale notes—not a great many—Miller had something to do with Mr. Edmunds and myself—a security was offered by Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Colville supplied him with goods—the security was never given—these transactions are entered in the books at Manchester—there is a considerable discount; from five to twenty per cent allowed to the trade—Mr. Edmunds owes us a little over 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other larger amounts have been paid—I recollect an interview between Edmunds and Miller, with reference to a mortgage—I saw it, but did not look over it—I gave instructions for it to be sent to Manchester, to submit to the company's solicitors—Miller, Colville, and I dined together afterwards—I do not know that at that time Miller was pushing the business, and getting large quantities of orders—they came through Mr. Colville, as far as I understood up to the present moment—Miller may have sent me the regular accounts during Colville's absence—there is one in his own handwriting.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">It was read and contained the passage "Mr. Colville instructed me to attend in his absence"</hi>) He never made any demand to me for special remuneration for himself—that letter says exactly what he says, that he is there for Mr. Colville—he never made any demand upon the Company—I come to London about once a month—it is very probable I was up in September, October, and November—Colville never told me that the goods were sent to the pawnshop until that letter was sent, and I had discovered it from other sources—Colville was away the longest from the 6th to the 17th September, ten days—he was away once again I think later on—I have brought here every single sale note that was sent down whether by Miller or Colville—I was present last Sessions when the defendants asked for a postponement of the trial—I never had notice to produce a single paper or book on behalf of the defendants—Colville should have given three or four days notice for a cheque for the outgoings of the London office—he was never refused one—there was only a short delay in getting a cheque signed—he could have had one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if required.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 27th October, rather late in the day, the prisoners and a third person were present—Miller told me to fetch up five rolls of floorcloth, irrespective of pattern, from downstairs for Mr. Starkey; he is an old customer—I was assisted by Mr. Miller in getting them up—Miller told me to fetch a porter and I fetched Jones—he put three of the rolls on his barrow, I think, with the assistance of some one outside—Miller and Colville saw this—Miller then sent me on an errand, but I stood at the corner of Watling Street so that I could see, and the goods were taken across Cannon Street, which is not in the direction of Starkey's—when I returned the porter was there waiting to be paid for. his job—the next morning I saw the third person who was in the shop the day before at the door—afterwards Miller came and asked me if I had seen him, mentioning his name—I answered "Yes," he had gone to Lombard Street to Martin's Bank—Miller said something about"30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the beggar yesterday, he is trying to do me," and that he would go after him—he did go and when he returned I asked him if he had seen him—he said "Yes, I caught him at the bank and put my hand over his shoulder and took some of the money that had been paid him"—I have since seen the five rolls of floorcloth at Dowgate <hi rend="italic">Wharf Cross-examined by</hi>

                  </hi>. I am now staying at 133, Camden Road——I was for. merly in the service of Mrs. Capper, five months ago——I went into the service four years last December——I recollect the prisoner being in the habit of attending her——he first came, I think, about April, 1874, and left last August——he used to attend sometimes twice a day, and sometimes once——he used to stay two or three hours sometimes—he attended to dress her hair in her bedroom—he has been in the dining-room——he has had his meals there, not with Mrs. Capper; he had them in the kitchen while he was wait<lb/>ing——he sometimes attended Mrs. Capper before his meals, and sometimes afterwards—I was not in the room at the same time with Mrs. Capper and the prisoner——I never saw these documents before——I have seen Mrs. Capper write a great many times——the signature "Ha. Capper" looks something like the way she used to write sometimes——I believe it is hers; this other, I think, is hers too——I have seen her write a great many times——she writes very differently at different times——this is one particular kind of writing that I have seen——I don't know that the prisoner ever went out and obtained things for Mrs. Capper while I was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Capper was in the kitchen at the time; the pri soner had something to eat there——she was very much in the habit of coming into the kitchen——I was asked to come here at 7.15 the night before last—I never saw these papers until they were put before me to-day——I can read and write——Mrs. Capper used to write very different at times——I have seen her write like this——I have seen her form the letter "H" like that (<hi rend="italic">looking at a signature produced by Mr. Capper)—</hi>—these signatures are not alike, the "H" is quite different——I have no doubt about this being Mrs. Capper's writing—I have not the same belief as to the others—the "Capper" is all alike; the "H" is not alike, but the "Capper" is all alike——the "B" is not in either of these two signatures; it is on this——she did not always use the initial "B" in her signatures; sometimes she would merely put "H. Capper;" it was not always "H. B. Capper," not that I have seen——sometimes she would put "H. B. Capper," and sometimes "H. Capper"—I have not seen her put the small letters after the "H" as in this one——I have not seen her put "Henta" or "Hta"——I do not know the prisoner's writing.</p>

I won't show you, they are rather too heavy, but bullion I think it is, according to my instructions"——he said "That will suit me better"——I said "I can let you have one of them"——he said "When can I come and get it, to-night?"——I said "No, we are so very busy; to<lb/>morrow morning you must call between 8 and 8.10 not later"——he said he should be there, and "Shall I come upstairs to you?"——I said "No, knock on the stairs; it is rather heavy, you will have to bring something to take it away in"——he said he would bring a bag——on the Friday Underwood and I put some leaden weights into a bullion box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and it was put in the basement——on the Saturday morning the detectives were on the pre<lb/>mises——at about 8 <hi rend="italic">o'clock I heard</hi> a rapping <hi rend="italic">on the</hi> stairs——I went to the door and saw Herd; he was standing with his hand before his mouth——I said to him "I have got a beauty for you, it's precious heavy"——he then came in, and I said "Wait here and I will fetch it up"——he brought this carpet bag (<hi rend="italic">produced)—</hi>—I made a clumsy job in putting the box into the bag to give the detectives time——it ultimately got in, and he was walking off——I said "You are not going off like that, I want something from you——he gave me nine sovereigns, and said "You will always find me a gentle<lb/>man"——I said "That won't do for me; you will always find that bullion"—</p>

Two or three days after that I applied personally to the defendant for the money, and again in a few days, and on the third occasion he came and saw me; I think that was between the 17th and 21st January—he said he would try and let me have 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday following—I think the 17th was Monday, and on the following day I called on him, and asked him for the money—he said he could not let me have it, but he would let me know on Thursday how much he could let me have by Saturday—I then got this letter.

I was directed to make enquires with reference to the prosecutors' corn—on Thursday night the 3rd Feb<lb/>ruary, I came to London and went to Whetstone Park, behind Linclon's Inn Fields upon the prosecutors' premises—I saw a van with four wheels, laden with three sacks of oats in the front part and with dung in the remainder—I marked the centre sack with a cross—I examined the contents of all three—the first one outside I opened and put in some pieces of a railway time card, which I cut up—the middle one I opened and found this piece of I; stick in it I took that out and put a pencil mark on it and put it back again, f and then put some pieces of brown leaether in it—the outer one I also put some pieces of time card in it—I went back to Lewisham, and communicated with sergeant Eldred—next morning I watched for the appearence of the van and caughtsight of it at about 10.20. a.m.,—it came from Lewisham pitches-station—Pitches and Hatcher were walking on the kerb talking together—Eldred came in just as they passed the door and I went out and followed them and the van—I saw them turn round and draw up to the George stables—from Lewisham Station to the George is about 300 or 400 yards, from the George to the Catford Bridge Railway Station is about the same distance, and the distance to the nursery is a mile and a quarter—when I saw them turn to the George stables I at once turned back to Ladywell, where I saw sergeant Eldred; then to Catford Bridge to avoid going down the main road—I stood on the bridge and saw the wagon come round to the Board of Works office where it stopped—I then got out of the way as the van passed me towards the nusery—Pitches and Hatcher were riding in it then I waited until they had been in the nursery a little time and then went in and spoke to Pitches and asked him how many sacks of oats he had brought, he said <hi rend="italic">two</hi>—I said I should charge him with stealing a sack of oats, and he turned pale and said nothing—the other man was sweeping out the van at the time I examined the bin at the place and saw some corn the same as the sample—I saw two of the three sacks I marked, not a third one—I found the pieces of card in the fodder, and several days afterwards I found my time card in the bin of fodder—I came away from Perry Hill to the George stables and got there about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Harris and Drake talking together by the horse trough as sergeant and I were walk<lb/>ing up from Russia Green—I kept on the same side of the road as the George while the sergeant went on the other—I told Drake I should take him into custody for receiving a sack of oats—he said he had not received any, I said have you bought any, he said no, and I took him in charge—I re<lb/>mained there until Eldred came—I found in the corner of the stable the middle sack I had found in Whetstone Park the night before—and the pieces of brown leather—the sack was marked as I had marked it—there was about a bushel in the stable of the mixture—at the station I told Drake I had found the sack of oats, and he made no reply—I have known him about two years and a half—three years and Harris five or six years</p>

               <p>they were at one time at Southend together—they both came to the George about two years and a half ago—the stable is a seperate occupation to the public-house—while standing at the stable door waiting for sergeant to come back I asked Harris for the keys of two coach-houses, and we had to take them out of his pocket by force—in the coach-house was found a lot of slating for houses and I found 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in an eld hamper among some rubbish, the amount was composed of sovereigns and half-sovereigns.</p>

Hadley to bring wheat from different, places on the river—Hester was formerly in my sister's service and his brother Edward worked under him at times—the course of business was to send empty sacks down in barges" to be filled at the place where the bulk was and brought back full to the mills at Black-friars—in Messrs. Hadley's business full sacks would not be sent down the river, only empty ones—on 13th, 14th, and 15th December there was a cargo of Calcutta wheat in the Victoria Docks belonging partly to Messrs. Hadley—the prisoner Hester made out this account of his work during that week; it is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the following:</hi> "Tuesday night, <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, from D. to Deptford. * Wednesday, <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, from Deptford to Mill.") It was Edward Hester's duty to load the barges at the Victoria Docks and bring them up the river to the mill—he could get to Blackfriars in one tide—I did not give the prisoner Hester directions until Tuesday evening about 6.30 or 7 o'clock to go to the Victoria Docks and join his brother—he had been employed on Monday navigating another barge, the <hi rend="italic">Lizzie</hi>—I gave him no intimation till Tuesday evening that he would have to go to the Victoria Docks to his brother—I have to direct the men where they shall go—I never employed the prisoners on the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">William.</hi> was not employed at this time by any one except Messrs. Hadley—on Tuesday 21st December the watchman Crossley, employed by my sister, gave me some information, in consequence of which I went to the river-side to Lucas &amp; Skerman's wharf, but could not see the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—I went to the Platform Wharf and looked again but could not see a barge of that description—I then went down to Gordon Wharf—I first caught sight of Hester and the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, four or five barges outside Messrs. Bellamy's Wharf being made fast, and after Hester came ashore I'gave him his orders; at the time I was speaking to him I saw ten sacks of wheat on. Bellamy's wharf, three marked "Hadley," and seven marked "Starkie—that is the usual way in which our sacks are marked—Starkie is a sack-lender; I have borrowed thousands of sacks of him—I never lent any sacks of Hadley's—I said to Hester "You are having a pretty nice game"—he said "Nothing to do with you, Governor"—I gave him in custody—I saw the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi> there—I was present when the police took possession of the ten sacks—up to the time of seeing them there I had no notion what<lb/>ever that ten sacks were there—these chalk marks were more legible than they are now, they have got rubbed off—I can see now "Swp," I believe,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLET</hi>. I personally saw the cargo of wheat at the Victoria Docks about November last—I believe the ship was <hi rend="italic">City of Manchester</hi>—the wheat was then on the jetty—it was Indian wheat—a large quantity of wheat of various kinds is imported here from India—we have missed Hadley's sacks, and sometimes they come back, and sometime they do not—we use thousands of Hadley's sacks—we also hire Starkie's sacks—I was at the City flour mills when I told Hester to go down and join his brother on board the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>; that was about 7 p.m.—I do not know that I detained him later, and that he complained that the last train would be gone—he did not tell me afterwards that he lost the train, and was obliged to walk down—I cannot say whether he accompanied me to the corn market on the 15th, but he most likely met me there—the market is from 11 o'clock to 2.30—he was not with me at the Corn Exchange from 1 o'clock to 1.30; nor was he there to my knowledge—we were in want of that very barge of wheat, and Mr. Hadley was very angry that the barge was not up—I did not see Hester that morning till after he got up with his bargs-1 swear I did not see him before the barge got up to the flour mills—to the best of my belief I saw him in the market that afternoon—persons are not admitted into the market from 2.30 to 3.30, but plenty of sales are trans<lb/>acted after 2.30—the door is closed, and you cannot go in, but those inside can transact business or go out—I believe I was in after it was shut that day, but I should not like to swear that I saw Hester—it is the best part of five miles from Victoria Docks to Deadman's Dock, and from Deadman's Dock to Gordon Wharf, is very nearly two miles, or it may be under it—it was high water at London Bridge at 3.42 on the morning of the 15th, and the difference at Victoria Docks would be about twenty minutes—I do not know whether it is more than that—if the wind was blowing hard from the S.W. it would obstruct the progress of the barge—I was not out that night—Hester was in my brother and sister's employ about four years—I can only speak to eighteen months of my own knowledge—each barge on the river has a number as well as a name, but lots of barges have one man's number on them—there are many <hi rend="italic">Williams</hi> navigating the Thames.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed by Messrs. Berridge, and had to obey my brother's directions, who was foreman—on 13th December I was with the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi> at the Victoria Docks loading wheat for Messrs. Hadley—I got in 130 quarters, 260 sacks on the 13th, and 140 quarters, or 280 sack, on the 14th—she would have carried another quarter—Starkie's marks and Hadley's were upon the sacks—after loading them, I put a tarpaulin on, and nailed them down with 5 1/2 inch nails—I finished loading on the 14th, a little after dinner time, and made all secure—I did not leave the barge then; I only went and got my pass, and then took her down to the grand entrance of the docks, close upon the river, and left her there—I returned at 10.30 p.m., and then remained by the barge—I did not know at all who was com<lb/>ing down to help me with the barge—I took the barge out of the docks by myself, and it was 12 o'clock when she was outside—if she had gone off then wa might have got home to Blackfriars with that tide if the wind had lulled a little—my brother came at 1.30 a.m., and said "Now, then, look sharp—we then navigated the barge to Deadman's Dock; that is a safe place for making barges fast till the next tide serves—we made fast there, and we both went off the barge to my brother's house in Adam Street, Rotherhithe</p>

               <p>—I left him there about 5 o'clock, and he gave me orders to go into Milwall Dock the same morning, and load two quarters of wheat in Starkie's sacks—I saw nothing more of the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—I know no man named White in the docks; a man was there when I loaded, but I do not know his name—I have not seen him since.</p>

My brother told me when he arrived that he did not leave the governor's house till the last train had gone from Fenchurch Street, and that he went and had a bit of supper and had to walk down—the tide served about 3.30, and he was there at 1.30—the wind was blowing very hard from the saw—that is an adverse wind, it was against me—that would make a very great difference in getting up the river—I could not possibly have got up to Blackfriars in one tide In the quarter—the wind was blowing, even if we had started at low water—we got as far up as we could and left the barge at Deadman's Dock, Deptford—I received orders to go and load another barge—my brother was foreman, and according to the rules of the firm it was his duty to give me orders and directions—it is 4 miles, or a little more, from Victoria Docks to Deadman's Dock by the river, and about 2 miles from Beadman's Dock to Gordon Wharf, and from there to the mill about 2 miles—it would take us two hours to get there in that state of the wind and tide.</p>

I was examined once at Greenwich—I saw nothing of the barge with the fifty quarters till the Monday or Tues<lb/>day—I had no right to buy the fifty quarters, and Mr. Skerman refused to buy it on 11th January—I did not tell Mr. Skerman that these five quarters were mixed up with the fifty quarters, about which there was a charge—I did not buy any—I do not as a rule take in goods before I buy them—I never take in goods without telling my master, that the entries may appear in his books—I should have delivered this order but it was a trivial little lot, and I took no notice—I never got Mr. Skerman's authority to bring the ten quarters of wheat to his premises—I never communicated to him that there was an application to me to take possession of property I had not bought—I did not communicate with him till Latimer was in custody.</p>

I am a lighterman, and have been in Latimer's employ, between two and three years—he deals in wheat and wheat sweep-ings, and is also a lighterman—on a Monday, about a fortnight before Christmas, I saw him in conversation with a tall man-about my height who I have often seen in the Docks and on the old Corn Market, and on board ships, trying to get bargains—I did not know his name then, but I heard on the following Wednesday that it was William Martin—I was waiting that Wednesday for a man, and Latimer told me not to go away as he wanted to send me something—I waited a few minutes, or it might be half an hour—the man went away, and then he came to me and said "Go down to Gordon Wharf and ask them to land five quarters of wheat that I have just bought of that gentleman that you saw leaving me"—I said "Yes," but I called at two or three places first—I went to Gordon Wharf, saw Laxton and told him that I wanted it landed and then went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 67, Neale Street, Camberwell—I am single, and in the employment of Mr. Carman, of 40, Boyson Road, Camberwell—I had been in the habit for some time of walking out with the prisoner—I ceased to do so for two months previous to the 12th January—on that night, about 9.30 or 9.45, Mr. Carman sent me out on an errand—it was a snowy night—when I got to the Albany Road I saw the prisoner coming down the Albany Road and I stopped and looked into a shop window to avoid him; the shop was at the corner of a street, I don't know the name of it; it was a turning leading to the canal—the prisoner came behind me and said "You b—, I owe it you," and he took hold of my waist and threw me in the water—I did not feel <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, all my breath was gone—I could not soream; he took hold of my waist and I felt no more till I was in the water—I don't know how far he pushed me—he had threatened me before this, the night I went to my new situation; that was on a Sunday, I don't know the date; I had been at my place, Mr. Carman's, two months and twelve days—he said if I deceived him he would catch hold of my throat and gnaw me to death—I did not see anybody about when he came up to me on this night—after I had been in the water I felt something hard, and I managed to stand up and screamed my loudest—a gentleman came up and assisted me out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known the prisoner just upon twelve months—he promised he would marry me on 22nd August—I kept company with him before that—I don't know the date that I went into Mr. Carman's service, I can't say how long it was after the 22nd August; I was in another place for a month before I went there; I left that of my own accord, it was too hard for me—it was on the occasion of my going into Mr. Carman's service that he used the words I have stated, I am quite sure of that—he has never</p>

I am a mineral-water traveller, of 128, Caledonian Road—on the evening of 5th February I was in Great Suffolk Street, Borough soliciting orders from my old customers—I had come by <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> from London Bridge Station; it was about 7.30—I was walking along Suffolk Street and these three men followed me; Reets and Hatfield got my hands behind me and held me there and pressed me back and Smith put his hands in both my pockets—they did not say anything—I struggled as hard as I could—they pushed me into the doorway of a little cigar shop—I had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pockets, they took 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and left one in my pocket—my money was safe when I got out of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and was walking down the street; I felt them take it—this did not take two minutes—I had never seen them before—they all three ran away—I only had an opportunity of seeing them while they were doing it—I have no doubt at all about their identity—I went to the Borough police-station and gave information, and then went home—I afterwards had a telegram that same evening—I went to the station and there recognised the three prisoners—they were in a passage-way with several others—my money consisted of three or four half-crowns, two or three florins, and the remainder in shillings—it was about 7.30 in the evening as near as I can recollect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner the same evening at 9.30, and found him suffering from a very severe wound in his throat—it was not dangerous—it might have been inflicted with this knife—it did not injure any danger<lb/>ous part—it was a dangerous cut, but it was only one quarter of an inch deep, and 3 or 4 inches long—to the best <hi rend="italic">of my</hi> belief, I do not think he knew what he had been doing—I did not mention it to him—his wound was on the left side of his neck—it might have been inflicted by himself, and I think he said that he had inflicted it himself—he appeared not conscious of having committed an act of this sort—I have had experience in the question of the human mind, and have had experience in lunatic asylums—in my opinion it is possible that lunacy or mania may exist in the mind without previous symptoms having displayed themselves—there is no doubt that this young man was labouring under morbid ideas for some time—I believe they were both in love with the same woman—he did not say or do anything to induce that belief; it is general observation—he did not say anything about being in love with this young woman; I heard that from somebody else—in some cases the act itself may be the only evidence from which to judge of a man's mind—taking the whole circumstances of a particular case they alone may be sufficient to lead to a belief whether or no a person is sane at the time—taking the fact that a man has committed an attack of this sort upon a person with whom he has been on good terms, or more than good terms, occupying the position of a brother-in-law; that, in my opinion, is evidence of insanity, taking the whole circumstances of the case—a man stabbing a woman without apparent motive, and then attempting suicide, is evidence of insanity to the best of my knowledge—the sudden impulse is also a mat<lb/>ter from which I should judge—I do not think the prisoner knew the nature and quality of the act he was doing—I do not think he knew that it was a wrong thing to do at the time he did it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> From the prisoner's behaviour to me I infer that he was insane at the time—he did not seem to know what he was doing; he seemed quite uoconscious of having committed any wrong act—he said nothing at all—it was not simply from his silence that I inferred that he did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187602280088"/>

GUILTY</hi> of—I <hi rend="italic">have no other reason For forming that</hi> judgment—the fact of a man having done a thing of this kind, and rendered himself liable to a criminal charge, might be enough to confound him, and produce a <hi rend="italic">kind of feeling which only implied that he had committed</hi> a criminal act—it might be the confusion of a sane person reflecting on the consequences of the act he had <hi rend="italic">committed.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. He was in a state of mania to the best of my belief—I was induced to believe that he was insane from his general appearance and deportment; I formed the conclusion that he laboured under some disease of the mind—he did not seem to know what he had been doing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOUGLAS</hi>. I did not ask him any questions; I was not with him half an hour, only while I was attending to his wound—he remained per<lb/>fectly quiet and allowed me to dress it and said nothing—I then went away—the policeman was not there—the belief in my mind was that he had a morbid feeling of love for this woman—I cannot say that the act was dic<lb/>tated by motives of jealousy—there are cases where a person murders a person he is in love with because his affection is not returned and commits suicide afterwards—I had heard about his being in love with the woman before I saw him, and I was under the influence of that belief when I formed my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it appears by your evidence that this was not an act which had no motive; you say now that you formed your opinion because you believed he had a motive of the strongest kind, namely, jealousy or unreturned affec<lb/>tion, or seeing the person he loved the wife of another man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the feeling in my mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I had heard of the circumstances of the act, but I did not give any thought to his having committed the act from unrequited affection—he seemed to be acting very stupidly and did not seem conscious of what he had done to the girl—I mean to say that where a person from a belief in his own mind, he being in love, that his affection is unrequited, stabs a woman and attempts to commit suicide, that that is evidence of in<lb/>sanity alone, to a cortain extent—I do not mean that in all cases where a man makes an attack of this kind from a motive of jealousy he is exempted from responsibility for his actions—by jealousy I mean disappointed feelings from affection unrequited—it is my belief that a person perpetrating an act of this kind under feelings of unrequited love is not sensible enough to be responsible.</p>

I am surgeon to the Gaol of Newgate—my atten<lb/>tion was first called to the prisoner when he came in on Tuesday week and I have seen him every day since; my object was to ascertain if there was any derangement of his mind—I knew the case—he has been perfectly rational since he has been under my observation—I have conversed with him every day and have had conversations with him upon this act—he does not appear to be under any delusion with regard to it; he informed me that he had been drinking rather hard for a week before—he has no delusions—I have heard the latter part of Dr. Scott's evidence—I have had considerable experience of lunatics—I have been surgeon to this gaol for more than twenty years—I do not agree in jealousy being an indication of insanity—I cannot resolve the mere feeling of disappointed affection which arises in the mind when affection is not returned, into insanity—I should not consider an act of violence done under that feeling to be reasonable evidence of in<lb/>sanity,</p>
